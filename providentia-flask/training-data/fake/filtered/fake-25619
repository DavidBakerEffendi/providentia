Hit or Miss depending on who is working. The last time we were there ( a Wednesday or Thurs. evening) the young lady behind the bar really screwed up our order. When we pointed out the mistake she rolled her eyes & gave us attitude. The 2nd time our order arrived it was even worse. We started to believe at this point she was just being a smart ass, no one could really be that stupid. At that point we just got our check and went home and made dinner. To add insult to injury the incompetent boob charged us for both wrong dishes including the one we sent back. We used to frequent Birra at one time, but as vegans there are only a few items on the menu that they can modify. Some of the staff were always happy to do so, however this girl was a real idiot. We had ordered the grilled veggie panini with garlic pesto ( something that Â we had ordered on a regular basis-the cooks verified the garlic pesto contained no cheese ) We had them hold the mozz. as always. The orders came out oozing mozz. cheese. That is when we sent it back the first time. The second time our orders arrive they contained NO Grilled veggies, just a smear of (the wrong) pesto.Once again the idiot rolled her eyes. There are some nice folks working there and it's not a bad place to have a few beers depending on who is behind the bar, but as this is the second bad experience we have had. We will never order food there again.
