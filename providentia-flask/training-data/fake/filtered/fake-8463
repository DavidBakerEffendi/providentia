I have been in Philly for 2 days and have had 2 meals @ Jones. first up a late Sunday lunch featuring huevos rancheros. There was a wait at 1pm so I sat at the bar. The service was great and the huevos was a fresh & light take on a classic. And to make matters even better, they had no problem serving a single pancake...a lot of places won't serve a single pancake. Tonight I returned for a late dinner. Bartender suggested the Perogies...OMG...pan fried, topped with caramelized onions and served with sour cream. Crispy, salty and creamy. Better than Blue Ribbon, NYC and those were pretty great. Fried chicken and waffles were delish. Â Perfectly crispy yet juicy chicken and a light and fluffy waffle. The gravy was a little too rich for me and made the waffle get soggy rather quickly. Next time I will have gravy on the side...the flavor was right on, I would just like less. I washed it all down with a watermelon Marguerita that was simply awesome. The prices are great and the decor is very cool mid century modern (cool 60's/ 70's vibe)
