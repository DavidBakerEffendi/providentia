theres a HUGE language barrier and they got my order wrong, but my wrong food that i received was delicious and dirt cheap. the seating was also cramped, I was sitting down with a friend and a Old chinese man sat next to me, pulling shit out of his teeth. i guess its just a different culture down in chinatown. the food was great and thats all that counts and thats why i go back.
