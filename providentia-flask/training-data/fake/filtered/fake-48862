The bar had a beer that I wanted to try so we made the trip. We left disappointed and confused. The draft list would be considered elite anywhere that isn't Philadelphia but being a beer city, the list was on par. Their bottle list was incomplete and the bartenders were of no help when it came to their pricing. The service is laughable. Nothing came in any sort of timely order, including standing with our jackets on waiting for someone to notice and give us our tab after asking to pay more than once. Then there is the food. Working in the restaurant industry, I can understand backed up kitchens and long waits for food (especially when dealing with a new menu) but where do you draw the line? My buddies food was 86'd so they made him order something else. He chose a medium burger that came out well-done and before the other food. I waited 40 mins for a pork sandwich and I didn't know why until I saw it. One look and I understood, I had to wait until someone in the kitchen had to take a dump on a roll. The whole experience was a joke and the punch line was our bartender introduced himself as the owner. I'm sure I will give it another try in a couple months to see if they've worked out the issues but for now save yourself the disappointment.
