okay i heard about this place in philly mag and thought i would give it a shot so one night me and my husband went to try it we got a small buffalo chicken thin square pie it was amazing but thats not why we gave them one star the following week we took some friends there and we wanted to try the pasta i got the pasta pescatora my husband got the linguine and clams, my two friends got the baked ziti with broccoli and the other got the penne rosa everything was okay but i thought the best part was the salad the pasta was way too bland and the garlic needs to be saut√©ed more. the garlic knots need to have more garlic as well. another thing that bothered me was the fountain sodas they had black mold floating in them i think you guys need to get people who know how to clean. the other thing that made all of us upset that night was the owner all he did while we where eating is how was everything? and insisted to continue talking to us about stuff we really do not care about. im the type of person when im sitting there with people to eat and stuff please leave me alone. thank you other than those things i would definitely recommend trios for pizza only!!!!! a few helpful tips: hire people who know how to cook hire people who clean better and pay attention for detail stop talking about yourself so much design a better more inviting environment
