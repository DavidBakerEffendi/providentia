WHAT A GREAT PLACE !!  The food was really good and flavorful !  The service is good ..the view is just amazing !  I can't wait till it opens for the summer !  Great atmosphere and the perfect sunsets !  And if you want to complain about the price...have you been to Mcdonalds lately ???   This place is a must see !!  and a GREAT PLACE TO TAKE MY FAVORITE CUTE LITTLE ITALIAN !!
