I visited New York for the weekend, and stayed in a loft that was directly across the street from Roberta's. Holy shit. Pizza paradise? I think so. We started our meal with the meat board of La Quercia Prosciutto, sweet soppressata, and finocchiona. The finocchiona was super fennel-y, strong and bold flavors, love it. The La Quercia prosciutto is different than prosciutto de Parma. Less salty and the flavors are a bit mild. Nonetheless, it was a great prosciutto. My least favorite was the soppressata, just a regular sweet soppressata, nothing exciting. I polished off an entire margherita which was amazing. For desert i had coffee and ice cream which was perfect. Staff is friendly. Can't wait to go again.
