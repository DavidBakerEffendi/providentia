Had a terrific meal here last night.  The chef's mother ships in the handmade, homemade mole poblano from Puebla, Mexico.  The mole is a truly intense, amazing experience.  Another favorite is the guacamole, laced with just the right amount of cilantro.  The restaurant is small and simply furnished, but the staff is warm, authentic, and welcoming.
