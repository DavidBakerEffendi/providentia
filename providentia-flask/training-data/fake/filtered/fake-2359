If you are reading this on your iPhone, just go inside, it's freakin amazing. The Scene I love the East Village and all the tiny, amazing, restaurants, but nothing compares to the intimacy you'll find in Graffiti.  It's like being in the belly of a sailboat, where everything, including the 12 people in the restaurant (staff & patrons), has its place.  The vibe is electric and fun.  It's a great place for anything from a date to a small group of friends - as long as you make a reservation. The Food Off the hook good.  Seriously.  Everything we had ranged from fantastic to freakin amazing.  Their food has a lot of style to it, not overly delicate undetectable ingredients kind of style, but things like braised pork buns with apricot chutney.   Mmm...chutney. Top 3 Favorites 1. Pickled Ginger Scallops, Candied Red Chili 2. Braised Pork Buns, Apricot Chutney 3. Squid & Lotus Root Stir-fry With Poppyseed & Curry Leaf Cons We had nearly everything on the menu.  Only complaint: super tasty everything, but not enough everything - their entire menu has about 13 items, and all of them are tapas style.  We'd have loved to either have a few items that were more substantial or even more of their amazing mini dishes.
