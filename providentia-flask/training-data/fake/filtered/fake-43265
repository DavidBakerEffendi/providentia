really a 3.5 star review, but since girl was nice and doing it all ( cooking and taking orders?!?!?) I'll give them the half. the chicken and biscut sandwich is really great, and could become habit forming. the oyster po boy was okay, but maybe my disapointment was because it was small for the price.
