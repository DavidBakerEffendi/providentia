Gottino isn't a wine bar, period.  It's a restaurant, tables in the back need I say more.  I wanted to believe there was something unique about this place but there wasn't really anything.  After our first bottle of wine, I caught the bartender picking his nose  behind the bar???  Then, he wiped his fingers on a dish rag and continued on his way.  I was completely turned off at that point.  Gottino's food was eh.  Nothing would make me want to go back there?  As I was about to order a beer, our group was already settling the check.  I don't recommend Gottino.  There are far better wine bars in nyc than Gottino.
