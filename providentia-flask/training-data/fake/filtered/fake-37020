I took this tour in September and it was awesome! We didn't really know what to expect of this tour but we decided that nothing can be bad if your eating pizza. And we were so right! We had delicious slices, but Scott's Pizza Tours is really about every little thing that has to do with pizza: the history, the ovens, the cheese, the sauce, the dough... even coal was discussed! We had a really great time, because Scott is so very passionate about what he does that it's infectious. Loved it, you will too!
