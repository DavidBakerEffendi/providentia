Hu Kitchen is the best thing to come to Union Square since Whole Foods! I stopped into this gem this morning and was as pleased as I'd imagined I'd be. The staff was incredibly friendly, crafted my drink exactly as I'd asked, the manager and director of operations were well versed in each item sold and couldn't have been happier to have each customer there, not to mention it is immaculate. I was so pleased to see people stopping by and hope that people keep visiting and Hu Kitchen thrives and opens additional locations throughout NYC!
