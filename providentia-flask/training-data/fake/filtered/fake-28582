Wow, this place was delicious! Everything we ordered was fresh and flavorful. It's also a BYOB and is very inexpensive. . . . we ordered two grilled meat sticks, a salad, and two main dishes and the whole meal came to $26 before tip. The service was very friendly thought a bit slow. We learned from our waiter that this is his family's first restaurant (the cooks are his mother and grandmother!) so perhaps the service will improve over time. Even if it doesn't, the food at Khymer Kitchen is well worth the wait.
