This is one of  the best Indian restaurant in Brooklyn perhaps in the tri-state area.  Gandhi Fine Indian Cuisine really made my recent order a pleasant experience. I was having a small get-together at house last Friday. They catered the food for about 10 people. The order was correct and they delivered on time. My guests were ravaging about the food.... I ordered the Biryani(Chicken and Vegetables with Pakistani basmati rice), Chicken Tandoori, Shrimp Bhuna, and Chicken Tikka Masala. Delicious!! I would like to commend the staff for providing excellent customer service.  I'm definitely a fan and I love the food. Highly recommended.
