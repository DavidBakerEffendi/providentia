Fantastic restaurant right in the midst of the theater district, where we did not expect to find such high quality combination of both food and service in reasonable price range. We had to wait a few minutes for our table, and were seated by the bar, where a Â friendly and knowledgeable bar tender recommended a wonderful white wine, and treated us with warmth and care. Upon being seated, service was great - fast, attentive, pleasant, super-professional and polite. Food is really great. We travel a lot world-wide and this is definitely one of the best Italian restaurants we've been to, including Italy... everything is fresh, crisp, made to perfection. Portions are very generous and aesthetically plated. Excellent!
