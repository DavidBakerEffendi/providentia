**WHY 3 STARS?** Their cheesesteaks are nothing spectacular, but they are good. I'm sure you can find a better cheesesteak out there, especially in Philly, but this is the original, and perhaps a cheesesteak is only supposed to taste as simple as this. It's a couple of simple ingredients put together, and it works. You learn to appreciate it, just as you would appreciate a good grilled cheese. It's not something I would want to eat too often, but I do like it every once in while. **Favorites**  Wit. Whiz. Eat with pickled cherry peppers. Cheese fries. **Recommend?** I would bring out-of-towners here if they're interested in trying the "original" Philly cheesesteak. I prefer it over Geno's. The more cheesesteaks I eat from here, the more I like this stuff.  When I had my first Pat's cheesesteak many, many years ago when I was a little girl, I wasn't impressed.  At all. I thought, "This is the sandwich Philly is famous for?" That was when I didn't know how to appreciate the flavor of Cheese Whiz. Yes, my friend, the main flavor of this famous cheesesteak is from the Cheese Whiz.  Melded together with the fatty juices of the thinly sliced beef, it provides the perfect complement for the otherwise bland meat. If they happen to skimp on the Whiz (which happens sometimes!) then the cheesesteak suffers in flavor. The bread is nothing special, IMO, but it's an Amoroso roll. In fact, it can get really soggy after the sandwich sits for a while, but it stays chewy! The soft bread allows the flavorful cheese and juices to soak into the bread and you get this soft chewy goodness enrapturing the pile of meat. Unless you can't stand onions, definitely get it "wit onions."  The finely chopped onions add a nice subtlety to the flavor profile. Go get some pickled peppers if you like spicy.  Eat them all together and it becomes the perfect cheesy meaty goodness slathered inside a bread roll. Cheese fries are good, if you eat them fresh.  Otherwise, the cheese and fries themselves can get chewy and/or soggy.  The regular fries are only ok.
