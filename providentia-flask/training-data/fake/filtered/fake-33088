I love this place! It has an artsy, laid-back atmosphere and the food is amazing. I usually try to order something different every time I come and everything I tried so far has been delicious! The entrees are large, fresh, and beautifully crafted, almost resembling and tasting like a gourmet meal. I have not had a chance to try any of their desserts because every time I have an appetizer and a meal I'm too full to eat anything else but they look delicious as well. I think the waiters are really great too. And a big plus is that it's BYOB so it's nice to be able to bring your own wine.
