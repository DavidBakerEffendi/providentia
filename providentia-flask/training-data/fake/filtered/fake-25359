the food is tasty and the drinks are good, but everything else stinks, sometimes literally. the place is cramped, the waitresses are surly and the air is suffocating. i know it's become a trendy hipster spot after the Lenny Kravitz video, but please, give it a rest.   people get so loud and drunk there it's ridiculous.  whenever i take a seat there, i feel like I'm up to my a$$ in more nuts than a fruitcake. pass. oh by the way, the waitresses are maaaad surly.   there was this one hot french/exotic photographer waitress like a long time ago, but when she left, it all went downhill.  lol.
