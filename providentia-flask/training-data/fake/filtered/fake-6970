My family and I decided to eat here today. But it seems like the restaurant does not want to seat us. When we arrived, we were told it would be a 20 minute wait for a table of 10. One hour later, we had to call the manager. I don't care what the wait is, especially when it is busy, however,  just tell the truth. Asked for a manager and we were seated immediately.  Poor hosting.
