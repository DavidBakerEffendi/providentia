I was at Café Lore last night to celebrate a girlfriend's birthday.  I enjoyed the thin-crust pizza, mozzarella with tomatoes with that slightly sweet sauce, fresh shrimps, mussels and clams on pasta, mushrooms and perhaps ten more dishes warmly served by the chef/owner himself.  Music was thoughtfully selected by the Ridge Band and so we danced the night away!  The cake was divine  and Brian made that too!   And I have to come back to try the much talked about pumpkin ravioli and home made ice cream and of course to listen to music again.
