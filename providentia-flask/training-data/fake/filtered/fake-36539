This is absolutely the BEST Chinese food in the Montville Area.  They dont deliver, which stinks, but the food is so good I dont mind taking a few minute ride to get it.  I am impressed with the boneless ribs.  They have great flavor, and they arent fatty like most places.  Everything is always fresh and tasty.
