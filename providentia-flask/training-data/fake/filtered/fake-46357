here are few things in life better than ramen with cold Japanese green tea on a hot summer's day.  The no-frills vibe and friendly Japanese staff at Ippudo's Ramen give customers a truly authentic Japanese ramen shop experience. My recommendation is the Spicy Miso Ramen.  I loved the temperature and flavor of the broth, the chashu, and the texture of the noodles.  The only negative is that although options for extra toppings are available, I felt like Ippudo's is a little stingy on the toppings overall.  A few more slices of chashu and some more veggies would have been nice.   I've had the Salt Ramen and Tonku Ramen before, but I was unimpressed.  The former was a little too salty, and the latter was a little too forgettable.  My recommendation is to go with the Spicy Miso Ramen and make adjustments from there.  If you'd like a saltier dish, try the Salt Ramen your next visit, etc.   Pricing is quit expensive - a little on the higher end for ramen.  Regardless, I was happy to pay the $15 for the Spicy Miso Ramen
