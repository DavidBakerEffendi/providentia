We dined at Stnehearth for first time this past weekend. It's a very attractive, contemporary addition to the cultural scene of Westville. Features farm-to-table menu selections, using a variety of local and regional providers. Salads and entrees were excellent, and the wine we selected was exceptional. Our guests loved it ,too. Will definitely return. The waitstaff Â was efficient, prompt, and charming.
