My personal favorite place in the neighborhood. Great Â french food and great bread, ordered a classic bruger and croquette monsier which was amazing. If you go when it's busy the waiters lack on the service bad, especially when sitting in the garden area. If you sit inside on a hot day it can be brutal, so beware. Will surely be going back
