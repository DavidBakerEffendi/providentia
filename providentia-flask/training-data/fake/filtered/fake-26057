A much-needed addition to the Sunset Park area. This place serves a variety of Italian food-- every dish I've tried (homemade pizza, chicken parmigiana, ravioli) tastes incredible. I took off one star because I'm still waiting for them to start accepting credit/debit. Luckily, the prices aren't bad at all so I can afford to wait. The restaurant is definitely still in it's beginning stages, but with it's friendly atmosphere and great food I'm sure that Cafe Lore has a decent future ahead of it.
