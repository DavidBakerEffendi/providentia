We have been getting take out from the New Great Wall for years, it has become the only place we call for Chinese Food. Tonight we called and ordered the D6...Dinner for 6, it comes with Soup, Eggrolls, Lo Mein and Pork Fried Rice with that you can choose 4 dishes off the menu. My daughter went to pick it up and when she returned we unpacked the bags it was then we noticed the Fried Rice was missing. She called to let them know and a woman started yelling that she put 2 quarts into the bags. My daughter then handed me the phone and I heard her yelling at someone in the restaurant..OK I do understand Chinese but her tone was nasty and she went on and on for over 3 minutes. She came back to the phone again to state she put 2 quarts into the bag and then added that they have cameras. I then became irate because I felt with that last statement she was accusing us of stealing and that was not the case, they simply forgot to put the rice into the bag. She asked me to count the quart containers and I then assured her that I was educated and I could count to 1 maybe she should learn to count to 2. My son took the phone from my hand as I was becoming agitated when he put the phone to his ear, he heard her call me the "B" word, with that he hung up. All we wanted was the container of rice and that became a huge issue with them. I told her we would be finding another place to get our take out from and she seemed unfazed. It is sad because we have come to enjoy the food and now we have to shop around and with Chinese that can be tricky!
