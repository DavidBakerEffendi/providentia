If there is good food in brooklyn, it's definitely in williamsburg. Some expensive some not so much. Loved the wood and the pasta. The asparagus on the neighbor table look exquisite. this place is sweet because the food is awesome. i am going to return and you should go there 2. I didnt have dessert though.
