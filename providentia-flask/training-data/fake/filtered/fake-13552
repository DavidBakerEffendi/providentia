As an English person, visiting our Son, Daughter in law and Grandchildren was taken to his restuarant for my 64th Birthday. The staff were fantastic, the chef came to see us personally, with new dishes he was creating, I felt spoilt, loved the atmosphere and the food was amazing, from the popcorn onwards. A wee bit noisy as the evening went on, but I think that is an age thing on my part. Will definately visit next time we are in New York. Thankyou
