Currently a limited drink menu but my waitress was able to have the bartender make the drink i love!  so awesome of her and my tip reflected my appreciation!  it took a while (10+ mins) for my waitress to greet me when she delivered water and chips, but they had only been open a few days so I know there are some kinks to work out.  table was super wobbly (lack of attention to detail).  tacos were good.  I'll be going again soon for sure.  it's very close to my work so it has the potential to be a weekly $40 tradition, hope they work out the kinks and fix that table.
