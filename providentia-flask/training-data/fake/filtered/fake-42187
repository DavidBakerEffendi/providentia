Everytime I'm in the area I stop by here. It's the best! - seasonal strawberry lemonade is super delicious. It's a nice balance of sweet, tart, and is just generally very refreshing. - the pulled pork: this came highly recommended by the staff at urban cookhouse,but I just didn't prefer it. Mine was inexplicably served with a side of salsa. Don't get me wrong, the salsa's good, but it didn't pair well with the pulled pork. Also comes with 2 slices of white bread (no orange :( roll). Â As an FYI the "fork and knife" section of the menu come with a side of salad (I'm guessing this changes seasonally, but in my case a broccoli salad with grapes and a sweet dressing & Mac and cheese which is solid, but not out of this world good). -the downhome: ham & pineapple is smoky and just the right amount of salty-sweet. When the turkey is hot, it's really good, but when it starts to cool down, it gets a little dry. Live this place clean good healthy food. This is as healthy as it gets for takeout. Also ordered catering from them it's legit.
