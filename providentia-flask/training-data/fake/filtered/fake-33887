Wanted to try this place for a while. Though Restaurant Week might be a good time but were we wrong. We probably should have left when we saw the chef follow 4 diners onto the street and began berating them over the tip(?) Ordered a glass of wine and a Vesper martini. The martini didn't taste right and when I asked the bartender his recipe, I realized that he was incorrect. When I told him the correct recipe, his response was, "well, it tastes lighter this way" (whatever that meant). No offer to redo the drink using the correct recipe. And for the price he should have. Menu was limited to nothing but the Prix Fixe and they couldn't even do that acceptably. The skate was overcooked to the consistency of mashed potatoes, the side of green beans were burnt to a char and hadn't been properly cleaned. I shouldn't have to cut off the stems at theses prices. Petite Filet was tasty, but, when ordered medium rare came out very rare. Side of mashed potatoes was nothing special. Dining room was crowded, hot, and noisy. We won't be back!
