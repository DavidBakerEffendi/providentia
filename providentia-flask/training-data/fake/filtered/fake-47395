My friend and I stopped in for dinner at 8PM on a Wednesday. I was seated immediately with a menu and some tap water. Once my friend arrived, we both ordered glasses of the chianti which was great. They have an impressive array of wine by the glass options...hence why I wanted to go there. We placed an order for the veal-beef-pork ricotta meatballs after reading good things about it via yelp. We were not disappointed. They were really well seasoned and came out very quickly. Shout out to our server who was really patient with my annoying friend who wanted to split the check three ways. My friend got Â -roasted oysters "casino style" 4 ea. I don't do oysters but the dish looked and smelled amazing. He said it was excellent. I got the special pizza which was mozzarella, goat cheese, eggplant and sausage. I never would have put those ingredients together but I'm so glad they did because it was amazing. This place should seriously consider adding this to their regular menu.
