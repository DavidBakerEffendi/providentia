If you come here on a busy time(Lunch/Dinner), be prepared to wait outside.The ramen is pretty good, though there isn't a whole lot of selection. The price is decent - about $8 for a bowl - but the portions aren't overly large. I can comfortably finish one bowl. I love Japanese food, and this is one place that has the BEST RAMEN in the city.
