What an extraordinary surprise to be able to taste again Chef Hugo's unique cuisine. Having had the chance to sample his unusual dishes in Tulum, Mexico, where he had his restaurant then, we now do not need to go on vacation to treat ourselves to an excellent Mexican dinner. The size of his dishes is reasonable ( thank you!) without being too "nouvelle cuisine" , which too often makes one wonders if half the food has not been forgotten in the kitchen. No dish imposes the usually omnipresent beans, rice and cheese ( which in most Mexican restaurants fill up nearly half the plate) . Here, they are served as a accompaniment together with a judicious choice of fresh herbs and vegetables. Very good balance for the discerning and health concerned customer between guiltless indulgence, as well as tasteful and unexpected ingredients. The Mexican wines offer a very pleasant experience and the presentation of the dishes makes one feels how much the chef cares and loves his work. A real gem that does not feel the need to look like a four star restaurant to open up our taste buds to a completely different level of Mexican cuisine. Bravo, and welcome to New-York!
