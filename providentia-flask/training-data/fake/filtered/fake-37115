I went here last night for my parents 40th wedding anniversary.   We arrived at 6:45pm, there were only 2 other patrons there. We ordered an appetizer and  around 7pm we ordered our dinner. Our food did not come out until 8:20pm. We had to ask for bread...only after we saw the waiter deliver it to other tables. The portions were small, the worst part was that some of the chicken fingers my kids ate were semi raw! The waiter apologized blaming it on a "new chef". Then he only took a few dollars off the bill.   It was a horrible experience. The food was overpriced and not that good. I left with my kids early because I was disgusted, my parents stayed a little while longer to enjoy the music.  Never again!
