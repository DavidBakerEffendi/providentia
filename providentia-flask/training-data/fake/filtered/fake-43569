Just finished up the Han Dynastys' 21 course tasting. Im stuffed to the rafters with some of the most authentic, best tasting, incredibly balanced, beautifly spicy, Chinese cuisine. 21 courses ranging from cucumbers in chili sauce to Ma Po tofu to spicy beef and tripe. The highlights for me were the cucumbers in chili sauce, the twice cooked fish (steamed and then fried) and the Don Don noodles. Those were just my personal favs, every dish had somthing to remember. The Han Dynasty has a wait staff that run around making sure everyone is catered to, but also have the time to tell pertinent stories for many dishes. They earn every cent of their 20%, which is why i left 30%. Which leads me to the best part of the meal, besides the food, the meal only costs $25!!! Like most great things in philly, the Han Dynasty is a diamond in the rough. 5 stars across the board! Thank you Han Dynasty, i will be back.
