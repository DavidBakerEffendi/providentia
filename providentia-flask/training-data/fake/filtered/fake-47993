It could be because hurricane Irene was raging outside, and I was in the middle of a precarious drive from Montreal to Boston at the time, but I'm pretty sure that the burger I had at Our House Bistro was among the best I've ever had.  Cooked rare, as ordered (a not-so-frequent occurrence); wonderfully fatty and flavorful local beef; the ciabatta-like roll wasn't as dense or overwhelming to the texture as it looked on first impression; the frizzled leaks were a nice add-on; and the fries were perfectly crispy and golden.  I can't speak to the rest of their menu, but if I'm ever getting blown off the highway in northern Vermont again, I'll try and stop here.
