I have been going to Song for a couple of years now and to date have not had a bad experience.  The food is consistently delicious and the staff is very attentive..especially for re-filling your water.  the pad see-yue, fried calamari and tiger shrimp rolls are my favorite.  the prices are very cheap which is an added plus to a great place!!
