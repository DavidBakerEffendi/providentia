I am always careful of writing Yelp reviews - my husband owns and is head chef at a successful restaurant and unhelpful reviews can be so frustrating.  In this instance, I feel fully compelled to "yelp" my happiness for last night's dinner! 8:15pm reservation for our second wedding anniversary. Everyone on the staff knew it was our anniversary - a nice touch. Made us feel very special, although I think they would have been just as nice if it hadn't been a special occasion. Seated promptly upstairs - skylights in the ceiling are beautiful especially since the remains of a thunderstorm were rolling thru and the lightning was flashing a bit - very cool. I really liked the lighting overall. Our waiter Chris was knowledgeable, kind, attentive, yet unobtrusive. The sommelier Frank really stood out - he paired wine by the glass for each of the 3 courses, all of which were totally stand-out fantastic wines.  I am pregnant, so he graciously poured me a sip of each wine at each course. Truly every dish was delicious, inventive, and an experience. Started with mushroom bruschetta and salumi...pasta course of lobster tortellini and duck angolotti...secondi was veal cheeks over polenta and suckling pig. Dessert was bomboloni and shortcake. We really loved everything.  The entire experience. I would highly recommend this for a special occasion. It has been a long time since we've had such wonderful, genuine service.
