Always a great time, as a couple or with a group of friends. Amazing comfort food - one of the few places in NYC that serves REAL grits, not the instant kind, tasty beers and good cocktails. The only thing I'm not a fan of is the wine selection. Eh at best. I miss the sparking ros√©!!! But I stil feel lucky to have this place as my go-to spot in the hood.
