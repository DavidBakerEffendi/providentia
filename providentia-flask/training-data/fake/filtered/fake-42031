Warning :  dirty kitchen ( take a peek for yourself should you DARE)! 1. Do not take a peek at their kitchens floor while you eat, that's enough to make you walk the F away. 2. THEY TRY TO CON YOU WHEN THE CHECK COMES.  3. They have different prices if your Asian and if your not.  If you go there, make sure you check your bill very carefully ( don't peek at the kitchen you might vomit if you do )..   They have different prices for Chinese / NYers and those that look like tourist. Make sure that you check your bill very carefully and don't be surprised at discrepancies in their favor ( on every bill) that you'll miss if you ( think they know how to add or that think by MISTAKE  these folks in here are anything but clean) ...
