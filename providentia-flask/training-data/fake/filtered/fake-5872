This place is always packed but they have great service so there usually isnt a wait - they are just full because everyone knows how great they are. I heard about this place from multiple people a few towns over - good news spreads when a restaurant like this is enjoyed by someone in a group of friends. Excellent food - my favorite are the lamb balls and chicken shish. Just thinking about the selection is making me drool.
