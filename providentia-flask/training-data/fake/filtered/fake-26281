It's great that the Thai Terrace has opened again after a car crashed into the front of the restaurant. This is an unusual Thai restaurant. The food is of a much higher caliber than the usual Thai restaurant, even when the name of the dish is the usual. The sauces are better, the presentation is beautiful, the ingredients are fresh. And yet it is a small family-run restaurant, understated and friendly. I usually order one of the daily specials, which often include something unusual, either a vegetable grown in the chef's own garden or an unusual fish, like the freshwater prawns I had yesterday evening. My favorite appetizers are the mussels, which are eaten each with a fresh basil leaf and a piquant sauce, and papaya salad, which is julienned and comes with a perfect, spicy sauce. I love the duck and, in season, the soft-shell crabs, which are sauteed rather than fried (they can be eaten as part of a wonderful Pad Thai dish).
