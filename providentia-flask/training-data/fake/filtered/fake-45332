Banzai is one of my favorite places to go for Hibachi.  I love the steak and the shrimp.  I Im always amazed by the skill of the chef .  Its alot of fun to go in a group , you get a ton of food and its like watching a show at the same time.   I dont even mond smelling like hibachi when I leave.   This is definitely not a fancy place, but its the food that counts and that gets 5*.  They have a separate sushi room downstairs.  Im not so much a sushi eater, but friends Ive been with rave about how good it is.
