This is a fabulous place! I moved up here in January 2012 and needed to find a good sushi place. One reason I moved here is because there is like 6 Asian restaurants in a 1/4 miles radius. This place has great sushi and a cosy little atmosphere. I now go there like 3 times a week! You should try it.
