i used to like this place, i really did. But then I went in for brunch today and experienced the most insulting situation one can have. Â after waiting for a table and seeing other people just come in and take open ones without consequence, our turn came and we were seated. we told the waitres that we would like to go pick a few beers to have with our food. she told us to go for it and tell the cashier our table number so the beers would b added to our bill. once we picked some beer and were headed back to our table we realized that our table was given to someone else and the same waitress was helping them!!!! she saw us and didnt even attempt to explain. I left we left the beer and left this place. I won't be back
