I'm not a fan of their Newington location, but I love their new Orange location! Great selection of beer on tap- huge food menu! You get warm chips and salsa which is addicting, both the chips and salsa were fresh and home made. I had the chicken enchilada's and it was delicious. Portions are huge so keep that in mind. The decor is over the top, but not as gaudy as their Newington location. I went on a Wednesday night and the parking lot was nearly full, so if you're going with a group it might work best to drive together. I deducted one star because they sat us behind the hostess station which was loud. They have a helium tank and were blowing up balloons every 15 minutes or so which startled me every time.
