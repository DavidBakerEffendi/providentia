WOW. So glad we've finally made it to this gem of a place. Living one town over in Lyndhurst, I new this place has been here for years, just hadn't made it until now. I will be back over and over again. LOVE the four cheese risotto. Since I am a mushroom lover, I must rate the mushroom risotto as my favorite. Â A nicely decoreated, lightly lit, byob gem of a place. Will be going back again soon.
