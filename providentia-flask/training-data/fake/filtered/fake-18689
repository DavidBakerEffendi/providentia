So I've been dying to try this place after watching the videos and reading some reviews. I decided to give it some time to let the excitement come down a bit before going in. I went there with my coworkers today for lunch and it was closed for a photo-shoot! However, Paul must have seen from inside how desperate we were. He came out with some fingers he prepared for the press and let us try the Wasabi finger. And boy did they not disappoint! The finger was juicy and flavorful, the sauce was incredible....and how clever to add fish row on top. If the wasabi fingers were any indication of what I can expect from the rest of the menu, I'm definitely going to be in for a treat.
