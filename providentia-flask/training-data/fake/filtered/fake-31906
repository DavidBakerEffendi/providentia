Fabulous cuban cuisine!It's a very trendy place, with a loungy look upon entrance which gradually becomes a HUGE dining area, with rustic touches. In my opinion this is one of the best brunch places in the city, where you can order any entree and you receive unlimited Sangrias-which by the way, there are NINE different flavors to choose from..keep 'em coming!Best sangria's I've tasted have been from Calle Ocho, my fav being the Havana. The complimentary rolls and black bean dip are to die for!Service is very hospitable and fast, wait staff is super charming and attentive and prices are decent.I definitely recommend making reservations if you'd like a seat. I hope their new location keeps all the positives going!
