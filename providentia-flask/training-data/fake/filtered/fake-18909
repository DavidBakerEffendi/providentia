This pizzeria wasn't on my list of places to visit but it is good that I did stop by accident. I went in for a slice then I ended up getting 3 slice. Â Best slice was GrandMaa Pie. By the way this place is not Tourist Trap, Newyorkers I urge you to go there and have a slice of heaven. Listen to me because I've been in pizza business over 15 years and opened 5 pizzeria.(not in NY) You must try that GrandMa Pie. I give stars strickly based on pizza.
