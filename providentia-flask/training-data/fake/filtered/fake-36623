With all the hoopla over the tipping thing, I decided to go. I waited 15 minutes and no one came to ask me anything or offer any assistance. It was really uncomfortable. I did not even get a chance to order their food. Having read the other reviewers on here, it looks like the many negative ones related to service hold true after my experience. It is unfortunate that you have a place who has employees who do not care at all about the quality of the work they do. two thumbs down and zero stars if I could.
