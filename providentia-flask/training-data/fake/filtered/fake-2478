Yes, 5 stars!  Burlington was long, long overdue for a place that is GF and Vegan menu friendly.  Whether by choice or medical, eating GF and Vegan is a way of life for so many and to not be able to always find great restaurants that TRULY do it right with local product and fresh produce is few and far between.  I love that I don't have to worry about how anything GF tastes - scrumptious, healthy and leaving me ready to visit again and again.  Thank you Pingala!
