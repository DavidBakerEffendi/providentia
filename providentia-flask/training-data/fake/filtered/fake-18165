Had a great meal there.  The squash soup I got there had me on my knees.  And the other risotto dish was good too, but not has kick ass.  Love that they buy local ingredients.  The atmosphere was terrific.  The owner of the restaurant even came out and said hi.   Definitely will be going here again.
