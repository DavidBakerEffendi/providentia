This is where I got the most authentic Shanghainese food in the greater NY area.  I particularly like the Braised Pork Knuckle in Brown Sauce () and Braised Fish Belly ().  The Braised Pork Knuckle was just like from the kitchen of your very patient Shanghainese grandma.  As a Chinese from the area around Shanghai, I know it has to be braised for at least 5 hours to get rid of most of the greasy fat. The pork simply melted in the mouth and the tastes reminded me so much my old time when I was still in my hometown and enjoy it there...  The fish belly is relatively quicker to braise but that doesn't mean it's easy - it's all about the timing.. I am confident to tell if the fish is overcooked by merely a half minute but the dish I  had in this Asia bistro seemed to be done just right... I would highly recommend this restaurant if you are around.  I often visit Chinese restaurant in NYC but I don't think I had anywhere better there.
