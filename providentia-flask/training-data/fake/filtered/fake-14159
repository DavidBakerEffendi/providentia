Stumbled across this place while visiting the city. My wife and I sat with the owner for almost a hour. He told us his story of how he came to America and became a success. We each had the lunch special and it was outstanding. He even gave us his cell # because we were headed to New York City where he used to live and told us to call if we needed anything.
