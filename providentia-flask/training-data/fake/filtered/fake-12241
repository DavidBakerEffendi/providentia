I use to LOVE this place.  The drink specials each night and the late night half off burritos was awesome.  The menu was good and the food was good.  The new menu is not a good fit for this place.  They are trying to be a bit more high class.  Leave that to Geronimo's and stick to what you know and what you do well. Bring back the specials and some other burritos from the old menu with the corn!
