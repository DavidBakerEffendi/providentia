This was our second time to El Vez - we went with friends from out of town a month ago and it was such a great night out that we couldn't wait to go back. Â Absolutely recommend making reservations. After our first visit, we had to return for another guacamole fix as soon as our schedules allowed. Seems the secret to dining at El Vez is to order the guacamole sampler early. We enjoyed it as we worked our way through the rest of the menu. Our favorites tonight were the mango salsa guacamole and the crab guacamole. The ceviche special was delicious and the pork enchiladas (also a special) was good too. There are plentiful gluten-free, vegetarian, and allergy-aware options on the menu, and the staff are exceptionally well trained to cater to each diner's tastes and needs. El Vez service is excellent and the restaurant is a lot of fun - perfect for a night out on the town alone or with friends. Love the decor and the awesome staff. We'll absolutely be going back.
