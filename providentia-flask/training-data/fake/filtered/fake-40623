I've only ever had Lombardi's delivered and I always regret it.  This pizza doesn't travel and is too expensive for what the experience is.  I can't review Lombardi's on their restaurant, since I haven't dined in (though I'm guessing it's pretty great since there are so many fans) but don't order this pie for delivery.  I prefer Two Boots on Avenue A for delivery or DIY c/o pizza a casa.
