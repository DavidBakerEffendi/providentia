grill 21 been here last saturday night this was my first time here but men the food was amazing serving was huge pork adobo tasted so damn well,chicken curry was so damn spicy made me order extra garlic rice.. service was quick and efficient and helpful even though it was so crowded ,complements to this guy still manages to stop check on us everytime he pass by,he made sure our orders was right cause a white guy took our orders.. one thing grill 21 it was pretty hot inside,i saw you have two AC's non of it was on..and another this white guy think thats the owner sorry man you're the worst order taker ever had we already said our orders but you keep insisting about other things and he even rushed us out we still wanted dessert,after taking our dishes he came back and gaved us the bill without asking if we still wanted something else,goodthing before he gaved the bill i already asked the waiter for the dessert menu.. and now the HALO-HALO special with the purple thing just saw it at the table beside us its a mixture of beans,flan,coconut gel flan well thats all i remembered amazing make sure if youre gonna order that for dessert save space on youre belly because its HUUUUUUUUGE.. be back for more..
