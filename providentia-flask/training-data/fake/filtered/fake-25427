Its not the most vegetarian friendly restaurant, and that is the reason it didn't get 5 Stars.  I usually order the spinach plate with a side of grilled corn which is absolutely delicious.  The reason I really like this place is that the food is always good, and the atmosphere is lively with young attractive people.  It really is the essence of Nolita.
