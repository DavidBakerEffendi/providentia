I first visited Luzzo's over 2 years ago.  I like to stay informed about pizza in New York, since it is my favorite food.  Jeff Versano, who rates pizza around the world, rated Luzzo's #1 in the country.  I had to try it. I took a friend with me.  We were both excited and our expectations were blown away.  First of all, the beer was amazing.  Menabrea is now my favorite beer in the world.  I had never heard of it before going to Luzzo's, and my server suggested it.  Both of us were surprised at how good it was, and how well it paired with the food.  We shared apps.  I clearly remember how thin the eggplant was on the eggplant parm appetizer.  It was so delicate an delicious!  Then the artichoke dish was crazy good.  Baked and stuffed with breadcrumbs.  Simple and very good.   Then we had the pizza.  One word: WOW!  We each ordered a 12 inch pie.  I got the Bufala.  Oh my!!  The buffalo mozzarella was amazing.  The crust was light, slightly charred, with a soft crust on the inside. The sauce was great.  This is the way pizza is in Naples!  The flavor was so simple and delicious that I was immediately addicted!  My friend got the Arugula pizza, and double "oh my"!! The flavors of the arugula and the prosciutto worked perfectly together.  She was hooked as well.  Since then I think we have been back almost 10 times.   Since Luzzo's is always packed at night, we try to go during the afternoon when we can to avoid the lines.   Oh yeah, I almost forgot:  the dessert pizza with Nutella!  Amazing.  Each time I go, I tell myself that I won't do it again, but no matter how much I eat, I always get a nutella dessert pizza. I definitely recommend this place.      The service is very friendly, and the Italian atmosphere is very cool. Plus, they just opened up a Luzzo's closer to me on Long Island!  I will review that separately, but I can tell you that the pizza is the same.  Amazing!
