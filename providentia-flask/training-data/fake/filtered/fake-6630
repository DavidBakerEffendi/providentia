My family and I have been frequenting this place and it never failed us.  We've tried their Pad Thai, Pad Kee Mao, Pad See Ew, Red Snapper, etc. They'are all delicious.  I don't understand why some reviewers say that their noodle dishes are too sweet.  They're just right.  We've been to other so called, "Authentic Thai" restaurants and found their Pad Thai too sweet compared to Thai Essence.  From appetizers to desserts, I would give Thai Essence a deservedly 5-stars rating.
