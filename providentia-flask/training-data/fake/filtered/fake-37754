Would not even seat us!! Friday night (3/10/12) my wife and I tried to eat at Brick Lane. We arrived at 7:45 and there was one other couple of two ahead of us. We were informed that the wait would be 10-15 minutes, which seemed to be based on the fact that two tables of four were wrapping up. None of the tables of two had even received entrees yet. After we arrived, several other parties came in, including a party of three that came in around 8:00. At 8:05, after we had waited 20 minutes (longer than estimated), a table of four got up and we were told that we would have to continue to wait because the table of three that was waiting for 5 minutes would be seated ahead of us and the couple ahead of us. The staff simply said, you will have to continue to wait until a table for two clears. I have several issues with this. First, the estimated wait time was clearly based on the two tables of four that were nearing completion of their meals. I understand that the restaurant needs to be efficient in seating and if they took reservations, I would think less poorly on this situation because the responsibility in that case is on us to plan ahead. Second, my wife is 9 months pregnant and who knows how long the wait would have been as long as parties of the correct size for the table kept coming in behind us. Lastly, Brick Lane was not turning tables quickly because they clearly do more take-out business than seated business. I can honestly say that this was the worst treatment I have ever received in a restaurant by a long shot. We left and so did the couple ahead of us. There are too many good, professionally run restaurants in Montclair to waste time with an ill run restaurant that can't decide if it is a take-out joint or actual restaurant. I DON'T CARE HOW GOOD THE CURRY IS, YOU CAN KEEP IT.
