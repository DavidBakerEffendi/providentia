This is my first experience at one of Chef Jose Garce's restaurants and I have to tell you my party of 4 was a bit surprised by the main dishes. We started with some different tapas which were good, but nothing to write home about. then onto the real stuff...we had the lobster paella and 1 of us ordered the lamb chops.  The lobster paella and the chops came out about 20 minutes apart, which meant the one who ordered the chops had to watch us eat, as she not a big paella fan, until her chops were ready.  The chops were good, but again nothing to write home about.  The paella was way to soggy/soupy...not what a good paella is supposed to be.  The desserts were good, but again nothing to write home about.  Lastly and disappointingly, the espresso's were bitter.  Not at all what we expected from this eatery and famous chef..
