So happy this restaurant has come to the neighborhood - it's become our go-to, "let's get sushi" place. Quaint & intimate, it's the perfect place for date night or catching up with friends. The sushi is fantastic (the Temple roll is amazing), and the ginger dressing on the salad is some of the best I've ever had. Hendra, the owner, genuinely cares for his customers and will stop by the table to see how your meal is going. It's also a BYOB and that's always a good thing :)
