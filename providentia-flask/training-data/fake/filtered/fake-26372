Stopped in for an unexpected late lunch after a business meeting at the beautiful Cira Ctr (truly well run building). The waiter was incredibly helpful & read us like a book, he knew when to come & go, what to bring & when & the wine he chose was perfect for our meal. The food was delicious. I wanted to be more critical in my review, being my 1st, but I have only praise for what seemed like a well oiled machine. I'm in my 1st year of law school at Penn, & glad to be in Philadelphia (transplanted from Athens . . . .Georgia). Again, a spectacular experience, the building, the food, the service, all amazing. If all the people are as friendly as at JG Domestic I may just stay in Philadelphia. Thank you.
