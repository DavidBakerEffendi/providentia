We had guests in our house and ordered food from Bill and Harry's.  The food was delivered within 45 minutes.  Shortly after, I had a few additional unexpected visitors and food felt short.  So I order another batch.   The person on the phone at the restaurant told me rudely that I can not order like this 2 times and got upset However, after a minute he calmed down,   told me that he will deliver the food and took my order.  After an hour passed and there was no sign of anyone delivering, I called up again to check the status.  The guy on the phone told me that the delivery guy is on his way.  But, alas, no one came from the restaurant the whole night. I only wish if the people there could have been nicer.   Now, the whole experience has left a bad feeling in my mind, not to mention my embarrassment in front of my guests who were hungry and waiting for food.
