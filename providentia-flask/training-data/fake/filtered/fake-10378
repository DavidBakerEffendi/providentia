Just went the the Friend House tonight. This is the best sushi in New Haven County. The ambiance and service was great. Great place for a date. I had the rainbow roll and my boyfriend had the maki combination. It was the best I ever had. He also had the miso soup and salad which was above the ordinary, I highly suggest that you try this place. We loved it!
