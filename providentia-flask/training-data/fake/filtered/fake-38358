Quite possibly one of the best sushi places I've ever been to. It's not often that quantity and quality run hand in hand. I have to give it to Nizi's for pulling this one off. The entire staff is quite courteous, I love the fact that they all greet you when you come in, and they thank you as you leave. That might not be as big a deal to some people, but for me that's icing on an awesome cake. And the food? The food is Japanese and Korean, and it's great, and the import beers compliments the food very well. I wish I could put more details in this, but I am pressed for time. But will say this, I plan to make Nizi's an every Friday night routine as soon as possible!
