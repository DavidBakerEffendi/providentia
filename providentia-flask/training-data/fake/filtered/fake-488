As an outsider I must say that both Pat's and its friend across the street are top notch for the traditional steak sandwich (each with their own twist).  I prefer not to choose sides and simply recommend to try them (both).  One more bit of advice, the servers are sometimes abrupt (almost rude) but that is just how this place is.  Don't take it to heart and enjoy your sandwich!
