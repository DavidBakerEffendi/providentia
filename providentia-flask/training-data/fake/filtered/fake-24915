I've been there for dinner several times and everything has been consistently D-E-L-I-C-I-O-U-S!!  Their sauce a/k/a gravy is awesome (that usually does it for me at Italian restaurants).  Very reasonably priced.  Great little spot - warm and welcoming.  The Sat. night we were there, they actually had live entertainment - "Raquel & Sam".  They were excellent!  (FYI: Found out they're there every 1st Sat. of each month.)  Not a big place, so it's probably better to make a reservation.
