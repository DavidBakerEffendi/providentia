Bubby's used to be my favorite neighborhood spot for dinner or brunch.  Unfortunately, my experience for breakfast this morning will make me really think if I want to go back...EVER.  After being seated, it took at least 15 minutes for our server to acknowledge our existence despite the fact that it was 9am and NOT crowded.  A couple other servers were walking around looking for something to do, but because we weren't in their section they couldn't be bothered to get the ball rolling for our lazy waitress and take our drink order.  Once we put our drink order in, we lost our waitress for another 15/20 minutes.  When the food came out, I had what was supposed to be bacon that was only the fatty part - not edible - and soupy eggs.  But trying to get this girl's attention was not going to happen so I ate what I could.  I had to ask for the complimentary biscuits, which came crispy and with an attitude.  For a restaurant that is supposed to pride themselves on good, local food, my last 2 breakfasts there were no where near acceptable.  When we were looking for lazy 'tude waitress, I couldn't help but notice at least 4 other tables looking around annoyed trying to get their servers' attention for the check.  I guess our waitress wasn't the exception.  I'd recommend checking out one of the other spots in the area...at least you'll be able to pay with a credit card and you'll get your food cooked and delivered by someone who actually likes their job.
