this is the worst place I've ever been!!!!!!, don't waste you time or money here. I went on a Wednesday with a friend and they  told us that they have a "Lady's Night" special, for half prize martinis and sushi, my friend and I  had two martinis each (which were not good), and we also had two sushi rolls each (which were not good either) we had to wait for a long time to get the food, when we asked for the check, we were very surprise to see that they wanted to charge us $9 for each drink and on top of that they were charging us $15 of gratuity when we asked for an explanation the waiter says that their "system" does automatically, this was more that the 20% shown at the end of the check, it didn't make sense, so the waiter send the "manager" which says that they charge 18% of gratuity based on the regular prizes, not the "discounted" prizes. I always tip the waiters fairly, but tipping $15 to a waiter that only show up to my table twice was way too much.
