I just moved to New York and the East Village, so I've been feverishly trying all the local restaurants. So far, Yuca Bar has become a favorite. While the sangria isn't the greatest, the tapas menu is to die for. The Lobster Quesadilla is perfect, as is the amazing chips and guacamole plate. Service is decent and the music is great. A good choice for a party of 4.
