Had dinner at American Steak House this weekend.  I could not believe that how professional and accomodating the staff was especially at a resturant that is so affordable.  I have a special needs daughter and the owner actually came to our table and designed a special meal just for her.  She can not have salt thus her diet is tricky. The angus burger was exceptional and the kids got a kick out of making their own salad.   My experience was first class and the prices were simply amazing.  Thank you for an enjoyable dinner.
