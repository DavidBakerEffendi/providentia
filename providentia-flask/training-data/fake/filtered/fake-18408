Very romantic setting... good food.... starter tacos were excellent as was the whole rainbow trout, however the shrimp and grits came in a small unappealing bowl and was a soupy mess. The dish should have been served on a large flat plate with a smaller portion of grits in the center with larger shrimp served on top with less sauce
