Han Dynasty offers the best Szechuan style Chinese food in Philadelphia.  I could end my review there, but from reading some of the other reviews... I feel the need to educate. Chinese food is very broad term, and consists of many different styles.  Most of what you find in Chinatowns throughout the U.S are Cantonese and Mandarin style Chinese food.  There are MANY reasons why, but among those reasons is that Szechuan style Chinese food is often very spicy.. may be too spicy for the stereotypically bland western palate.  Just because it's Szechuan and not Cantonese or Mandarin, does not mean it's unauthentic... because it is.  Chinese food is one of the oldest cuisines known to man. In China, they've had refined cooking styles thousands of years ago when other cultures were still roasting slabs of meat over a fire.  There is a huge variety. Another thing I've been reading are that people are complaining about the owner Han.  May be rightfully so, because this dude is a weirdo, but one big positive is he tells it like it is.  If you go in there and order items that are not traditional Szechuan, he will let you know.  Keep in mind there are tons of people waiting in line for something authentic, and if you're the idiot trying to order mango-flavored fortune cookies you are wasting everyone's time (there are plenty of Asian fusion restaurants nearby, and Chinatown is down the street if you want Cantonese or Mandarin). If you're one of those people, I wish Han would Kung Fu kick your ass out of the restaurant, instead of just telling you to leave.  Bruce Lee was authentic Cantonese by the way. WAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!
