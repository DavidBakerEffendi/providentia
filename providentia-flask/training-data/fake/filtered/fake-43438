Luca's isn't just fine dining. It's a little piece of Italy where your meal is served with pride and perfection. The ambiance is romantic and interesting with a piece of Italian art wherever your eyes wander. The food is indescribably delicious. It's the kind of restaurant experience that you still talk about for days after you've dined there.
