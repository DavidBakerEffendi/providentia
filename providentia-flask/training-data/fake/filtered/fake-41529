After reading all the great reviews we decided to come here for a date night dinner.  Made reservations for 8pm & were seated right away.  The place wasn't packed which was REALLY nice.  I could have an actual conversation.   The place is small, cute, dimly lit, candles and red decor. Our waiter was great, friendly and checked on us.  We had the escargo ($9) Roasted duck leg ($22) & Gratin de ravioles du Royans ($14).  All were delicious, a good portion size and they also give you lots of good bread which was a bonus.   Service was pretty quick.  Other staff that didnt wait on us were also nice.  We would definitely come here again.  Its like a little hidden gem!
