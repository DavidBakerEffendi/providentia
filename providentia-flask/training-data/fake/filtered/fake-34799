This restaurant my favorite place to eat in/around Hartford area. It is a 'diamond in the rough'! The food is amazing. I have been here multiple times and have never had a bad meal. The spicy chicken gorgonzola is my husband's favorite dish, he won't order anything else. I have tried the filet mignon, the scallops, the pizza, salads, calamari, bolognese...and they all were wonderful. The food is made fresh to order with fresh ingredients. The bread is made fresh daily, often served warm from the oven, and they serve it with a dish of olive oil that is the best olive oil I've ever tasted. It is a family-run restaurant so the service can be a little slow but it's worth the wait and they don't rush you out either. Since I've been to the restaurant quite a bit, I've gotten to know the owners and now I feel like I'm eating at my greek grandmother's house...simple, fresh ingredients that make for a wonderful meal. Â BYOB also makes eating here more affordable than the WH center restaurants.
