Was brought here as a surprise for my birthday. It was amazing! We ordered the chef's tasting menu, and each dish was simply perfect. The cocktails were also much more imaginative than I had expected for a fine dining establishment such as Ai Fiori. Each one we had was unique and delicious. Highly recommend.
