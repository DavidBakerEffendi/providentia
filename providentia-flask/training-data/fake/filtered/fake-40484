Absolutely  five stars Chinese delivery! It was hard to find places open during Hurricane Sandy. But East Garden did! And they did a great  job at that moment. Thumb Up!!! It's not that all of the dishes I got were amazing, but most of them were good, and some of them were awesome. Sesame Chicken is the BEST!! The staffs were very friendly, they always keep their smile on their faces. I like their settings, open kitchen which gave me confidence to make sure they were clean. I thought they are already there over 20 years with the same owner, am I right?   East Garden has definitely earned it's spot as my go to Chinese delivery place. Highly Recommended!!!!!
