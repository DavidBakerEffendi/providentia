Hello Yelpers-ok so Opa-what can I say.  It's a chill little greek place, that did not require reservations at 7pm on a friday night.  Tonight me and the little lady decided to try this place out for the first time.  So..... the menu-the appetizers were delicious-they were a good size and contained a great deal of flavor and substance.   We did not try the main plates or entrees because the menu did not have anything that really seemed to be too appealing for us.  A couple of whole fish dishes, and some other greek favorites.  So this should not appear to be a bad reflection on the entrees-it just didn't appeal to our pallets. Anyway, we ordered 5 appetizers, which included the lamb meatballs, sausage flatbreads, spinach croquettes, mussels, and pork ribs.  Everything was great, but we would definitely recommend the spinach croquettes and meatballs.  Deff delicious.  Everything was priced appropriately.  Drink were great too! Anyway, I would recommend! ~~~JP p.s. Across the street there's a dog store that has wonderful and delicious pig ears, that my little dog really loves :)
