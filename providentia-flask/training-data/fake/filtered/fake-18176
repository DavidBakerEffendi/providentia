This is my favorite place to eat in life.    It's the last place my wife and I ate at before our son was born.  It's the first place we went to when he was 15 months old and we actually had the chance to eat out again.   It's the kind of restaurant where you can really tell how much care goes into the food and that whoever is running the kitchen really cares about putting out the best food. I have never once had anything here that I was even remotely disappointed by, and I've had lots of different crepes.  The specials are usually amazing, the soups are to die for, and the Steak au poivre (if you can resist getting a crepe, which is very hard to do) is the best I've had too! My only grip at all about Beau Monde is that there is something very strange going on acoustically inside the place, and it gets very loud very easily.  But, if it's nice out, why sit inside, anyway?  The outdoor seating is so pleasant!  And really, the quality of the food more than makes up for the noise.
