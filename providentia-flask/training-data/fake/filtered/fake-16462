I was excited to learn that a new restaurant had opened at the site of the former Mavi and Saybrook Fish House on Jerome Avenue in Bloomfield. However, a recent lunch left me hungry and disappointed. The atmosphere and bar scene will be what makes this restaurant survive, certainly not the food and prices. The price point of the burgers and lunch fare is significantly higher than its Bloomfield competition. However, the story doesn't stop there. If you're going to charge more, show me more. That is hardly the case at the Republic. I opted for a three-part express lunch for $14, featuring according to the menu, a caesar salad, Thomas Hooker Fish and Chips, and a great-sounding dessert for a summer day...fresh fruit and lime sorbet. The entire three-part lunch arrives at the same time, and for the $14 consists of the following: lettuce in a bowl (doesn't a Caesar salad have croutons), a small square container with one single small piece of fish atop a bed of french fries, and the dessert, which was the most astonishing of all. It consisted of three small slices of fruit with a small round spoonful of what I assume was lime sorbet. To be honest, there wasn't even enough to know for sure what it tasted like. It was less than what would fill a sample cup at your local supermarket or ice cream shop. If I had seen this assortment before I ordered, my guess would have been I was looking at a child's lunch plate for $5, not your featured express lunch for almost three times that much. After hope of finding a new place to eat, Â I'll be instead heading back to the tried and true establishments in Bloomfield. The atmosphere and beer might not match up to the Republic, but I know I will get a square meal at a square price...and won't head back from lunch searching for more to eat.
