One of the best overall dining experiences I have had in a long time. The apps are amazing. Definately recoommend the calamari (and don't forget a little of the lemon on them). Also had potato and greyere croquets which were phenomenal. Also had PEI oysters which were very fresh and a decent size.The red snapper was quite good, but the salmon was better. The mushrooms w/ the snapper were cooked perfectly. Also, the wedge salad is a meal in itself. Good wine list, too. We were a group of three walk-in around 8:30 and were seated right away at a corner booth for 5. Service was very good (our waiter was very knowledgeable and never struggled to answer questions about the food), but it took a while to get the cocktails. Overall, very, very good. It's expensive but definitely the place to go if you want good seafood.
