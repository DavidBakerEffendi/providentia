I went here for a casual business lunch with a new client that I didn't know that well.  The authentic French staff and surroundings had us instantly swapping stories about different trips we had each taken to Paris.  Of course the glass of wine helped, and after a delicious meal (I had the sole, he had the steak frites) we got down to business over coffee and left the meal like old friends.   The credit goes to the authentic ambiance, attentive, but unobtrusive service and great food. I would love to go back with my wife for a romantic dionner sometime.
