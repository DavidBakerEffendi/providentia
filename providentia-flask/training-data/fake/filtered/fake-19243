LOVE THIS PLACE! About 4 weeks ago my wife and I had a small lunch date here. It was very empty which we actually like because it was quiet and we like to talk. We were seated right away very nice. I ordered the Pineapple duck Curry and veg and my wife had the Duck Tamarind IT WAS COOL GOOD AND GOT ALLOT FOR OUR BUCK!... ohhh but we had the apps first right.. yeah I had the Hot Pot Dumpling and my wife had the Tofu Salad with the Ginger Soy dressing EXCELLENT! Food came out fast. We washed it down with some wine and Had alot of time to Talk! We are going back really Soon!!
