All I can say is Wow! Yesterday was the 3rd time I have dined at this restaurant.I decided its time to spread the word while on my way to work. Loved the ambience.Food portion is ample & taste is delish! Although food came out a lil too slow, the service I had gotten was impeccable. And talking abt service,I had the same lady wait on me 2 out of the 3 times. I have to say something after reading the review from AngeloG.That re view seemed really biased & ignorant, on top of being .DISCRIMINATIVE. And I believe he's talking abt the lady who waited on me. I can see she is pregnant, but she definitely not miserable.In fact, she was the only one I see checking on ALL the tables including the ones that weren't hers.I didn'tknow who the manager was, but my lady deserved my tip. Enough said.And I'll keep coming back here definitely for the food,but also because I had good service.
