Drawn by rave reviews touting "best burger in town", I was sorely disappointed. I don't often complain, (check out my average review ratings), but this place was a dump. Don't order the chilli burger. Soggy bread, raw burger patty, (I mean seriously raw ... I could almost see the e.coli festering atop my meal), and soggy fries. Not worth it. Go to Pianos for the best burgers in NYC!
