The food is great. Good pizza and a lot of variety on the menu. Everything except the pizza, bread, vegetables, and fried dough/doughnut bites is froze. It's great food none the less but they way the staff are treated is most of the reason I gave it a low score. A very good friend of mine worked for them recently. She's the reason we went there so much and ordered delivery. Â We'll still eat there as it's the best pizza in Burlington. But I think the owner should treat the people who work for him a little better
