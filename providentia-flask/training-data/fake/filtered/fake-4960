I used to love this place but the last few times I have been there the service has been really bad. The staff are all so oblivious, mess up orders, forget you when you are sitting in the corner etc. I kept going because the food was OK and sometimes I bump into people from the neighborhood I don't see that often, which I liked. However, the NEW BARTENDER tonight is awful and a total Bitch with attitude (not in a good way). After interacting with her tonight, I won't be going to Beco again and neither will any of my friends.
