The good:  The food is fantastic, cheap and unlike anything around.   It is a small space, but so are most the restaurants in New York - at least the neighborhood ones are.  Some commentators have mentioned the space but I think this is nonsense. On busy nights you'll wait to get in, but if you're willing to take a wall seat, you'll get served faster.
