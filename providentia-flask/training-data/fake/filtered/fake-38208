This is one of my all time favorite restaurants. They have a variety of great foods to choose from, my favorite being the salmon salad when I'm feeling healthy and a gyro, milkshake (vanillas my favorite and fries when I'm not. The portions are big and the staff is very friendly. What I love most about this restaurant is that you do not have to wait long in order to have a great fresh meal and they even deliver! This is definitely my go to place on campus and its very fairly priced. You should definitely go here if you are looking for all around great food and service!
