we always enjoy going to Kotos.  It's our daughter's birthday this week and this is the restaurant she has choosen for her special dinner.... much to our delight.  We always fine the food and staff wonderful!  And noticed the last time we went how nice it is to meet such wonderful people (including other guests) each time we go!
