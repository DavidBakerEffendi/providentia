A friend of mine told me to check this place out, so i went this past weekend.  Cute place with cool decor and outside seating.    I ordered their duck salad which was delicious also I had their mussels with their famous fries and homemade dipping sauce, yummy!  To top off this meal I had their awesome chocolate creme brulee.  I'll be coming here more often to dine.
