Okay. So I have been to City Steam a few times. The first two times were prior to my 21st Birthday, so this part of my review is strictly about the food. 1. The fried pickles are awesome! They come with an amazing sauce, that I think you could put on shoe leather and it would taste heavenly. 2. The Risotto fritter things were far from good, I must admit. Ordered them on two occasions, and was disappointed both times. 3. The hubby got the mac n cheese burger and it deemed it just okay. I got a BLT burger and it was delish! (Second time around, hubby got a chicken sandwich and loved it insanely!) 4. Desserts looked pretty yummy, but have yet to try one. On my last visit to City Steam, I actually celebrated my 21st Birthday with you guys, and ended up going to the Comedy Show on March 11th. The seats were wonderful! Right front and center, and my chicken and broccoli pasta was divine. We didn't immediately get waited on though, which was a let down as I was ready to order up a plethora of drinks. However, when we were finally attended to, the drinks were well made and I definitely got my buzz on! The show itself was good. There was a very rude table of talkers just behind us, though and that definitely took away from my experience. After the show, we headed up to the bar for a couple more drinks. It took me almost 20 minutes to even be noticed by a bartender. I ordered a pina coloda, but the bartender told me the blender was out of order. He then proceeded to make me a strawberry daiquiri, with said blender! It wasn't particularly well made, and was a bit watery. I would definitely have preferred my pina coloda. All in all,, City Steam is a good solid place. The beers are great, and the atmosphere as well. The food is hit or miss on some dishes, and if you go to the comedy show, be prepared for the rude talkers. I haven't been back yet, but I hope there is a different bartender on duty when I do.
