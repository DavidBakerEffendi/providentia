I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  We have never experienced anything less than perfect.  My favorite three dishes are the chicken salad, ribs and the fish sandwich.  We love coming here not just for the stellar food, but for the 5 star service.  I always get an iced tea if I am not drinking a glass of wine and they always seem to refill it just as I want to ask for more!  Perfect!
