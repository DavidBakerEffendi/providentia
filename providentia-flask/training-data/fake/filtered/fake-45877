we've been to this place several times, the place is clearly going down. unfortunately.  just had a special pre-fix dinner. nothing was cooked to order: cold (and dry) grilled shrimp salad; lamb that had been sitting for quite some time (the sauce on the plate had even a film of grease; excessively sweet desert.  for $79 (no wine), one can expect something better. the bottom line: if you can avoid it - do it. the place got lazy and unimaginative. sadly.
