The customer service is terrible!! I called in an order and when I got there no one even knew what I was talking about.  One guy finally took the initiative to put the two slices in the oven but I could not wait so I told him don't worry about it.  He said it would only take a minute but the reason I called for it was because I did not have a minute to wait duh!!! The Nona pizza is the worst, it looks horrible but tastes ok.  You want real grandma pizza go to Rosso Pomodoro in North Brunswick. The best thing I have had here is the garlic knots...they are the best I have ever had.
