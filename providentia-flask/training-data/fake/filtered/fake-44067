Ate their with my wife Wednesday night. We had arugula pie and pear pasta with a few drinks. We brought 2 large plain pies home for our kids. The pies were wonderful and the pasta dish was unbelievably good. We had the pleasure of meeting one of the owners and he made us feel as comfortable as if we were in his home.
