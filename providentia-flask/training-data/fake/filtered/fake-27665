Unique Pizza! As my quest to find the best pizza in NYC. I came across Paulie Gee's A very dark atmosphere. Opens at 6pm- anyway, the have unique pizza creations in here. I haven't try all the combos yet. But I am pretty close. Went there a couple of times already and enjoy it. It is like naan bread with toppings on it. Is the best way to describe it. The pizzas that I like are Grapeful Dead and hellboy which happens to be my favorite. Paulie Gee the owner of the place, walk around and ask you how is everything? He is very friendly and we chat will all the customers that dine in. This is # 2 on my list on Pizza of best in NYC. Ask for the Mexican Coke. It is made with real cane sugar and not high fructose corn syrup.
