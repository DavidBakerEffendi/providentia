This is the worst steak and cheese I've tried and I've had many. I've had much better ones in no name joints in Boston. But the real reason why I wanted to write the review is because I was honestly shocked at how racist this place is. It's actually quite disturbing and I'm glad that other people are mentioning it also. Geno's has stickers on windows that say "speak english when ordering.. this is america." Shocked? How about the picture on the front with accusations against Mumia.. Don't eat here. Your money will be better spent elsewhere.
