I have had the pleasure of having good food and good service numerous times, but never has these experiences moved me to write a review, until NOW! I was visiting NYC on business and pleasure, with my husband. After a day of meetings, site seeing, and running around, I was starving. My husband suggested a place called The Writing Room. Apparently, the concierge at our hotel (near there) told him it had recently opened and suggested we dine there. Upon entrance, I was already in love! The decor was intimate, modern and welcoming and the staff was accommodating even though we didn't have a reservation. After being seated, we were greeted by our waiter Nicoye. This young man IS an INCOMPARABLE server. He made our experience magnificent. Not only was he pleasant and very helpful, but he was extremely knowledgeable about the menu. I wanted a glass of wine, but was unfamiliar with the wines listed by the glass. He asked me two questions about my preferences and was able to select the perfect wine for me. And in case I was unsure of his ability, he provided me with a blind tasting. He hit the nail right on the head. And after the day I had, I appreciated him being amazing at what he does! My husband also loved the bourbon he selected for him. The service he provided was personalized. It's as if we went to a tailor to get suited for the perfect dining experience. He was charismatic and articulate with the ability to captivate you with simple yet colorful descriptions of varying menu items. Needless to say, we ate everything he suggested. And the icing on the cake was the dessert selection. He selected a Cheesecake Cobbler that was by far the best dessert I had ever eaten. He made great pairings of food and drinks while we were there, but my husband and both believe the BEST pairing is with The Writing Room and Nicoye! Amazing food, outstanding service!! WE WILL BE BACK!!
