What a nice place!! Was very impressed by Kelly's B&R. Had lunch with four of my pals and all of us really enjoyed it. We have varying tastes and preferences so it's always a bonus when restaurants hit the mark with all five of us!! We were seated in the patio and were enjoying our drinks when in typical New England fashion, it started to rain. The manager (owner even??) was out straight away and accommodated us in front of fireplace in restaurant (I'm sure that must be a winter time draw), which was great because the bar was quite busy. Now for the lowdown on the menu - - - - - TUNA TARTAR wow! SMOKEHOUSE BURGER, SCALLOPS, RAVIOLI wow wow wow! Gouda cheese & crispy onion rings went really well with the burger and the prosecco (?) sauce was delicious with the seafood ravioli. Also, if you're a fan of art house beers and want to try something out of the ordinary, my friend had a large selection to choose from and he seemed pretty impressed. I'm more of a wine-aholic and was not expecting such reasonably priced wines. Will definitely be back to Kelly's, wonderful food plus attentive staff equals very enjoyable experience!! Only drawback was the weather!!
