Probably the most expensive bowl of ramen you'll ever have in your life.  It's also probably the best bowl of ramen you'll have in America.  They specialize in Hakata ramen which is milkier, thicker, collagen'y broth -- not the more typical soy based ramen you're accustomed to.  I think they also have shoyu and shio (salt based) ramen broths too, but haven't tried.  I liked Setagaya's shio ramen, so will stick to having it there. Also, the other appetizers are grossly overpriced.  I think $9 for the cucumber? And as noted 100000 times, the wait is horrendous.  I try to go at off hours.  3pm lunch, etc...
