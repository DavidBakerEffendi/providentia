Rotondo's is the place to go to get prepared sandwiches. There are many different sandwiches to choose from, they're prepared fast and I've never had one that wasn't delicious! Also, other prepared foods I've tasted are good and easy to grab for a quick dinner. The employees are always friendly and willing to help with whatever you may need. Rotondo's is my favorite place in town to stop for lunch!
