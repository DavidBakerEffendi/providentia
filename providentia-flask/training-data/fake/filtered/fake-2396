Hands down the best slice in New York. I'm a snob when it comes to Sicilian (the little known runner-up is Luigi's in Ft. Greene), and the spicy pepperoni is superb. I was a huge fan of the previous tenant, the legendary Ray's and was apprehensive about giving the new guy a shot. Not only I'm glad I did, it made me thankful that a chocolate boutique or another fashion label interloper didn't take it's place. Support your pizzeria and have the best lunch in the neighborhood while you're at it.
