I planned a dinner at Distilled for a group of friends. I'd contacted the restaurant to see if they could work around some food issues in our group and we set up a stellar prixe fixe menu. Everything was amazing - we had the kale salad, apple salad, onion rings, cauliflower, steak, porgy, wings and the POPCORN. And the cocktail menu is fantastic as well. There was herbed salt on the rim of my drink. I can't even explain how fantastic that was. The staff was great (planning, the bar, our servers... everyone). Highly recommended.
