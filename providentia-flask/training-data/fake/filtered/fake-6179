Oh my God, oh my God, oh my God! This is as good a restaurant as I have ever dined in. While not as well known as Morimoto or Susanna Foo or any of the de rigueur Philadelphia restaurants, this tiny eatery serves dishes resplendent with flavor and depth. Accompanied by three other appreciative diners, I shared a grilled radicchio and goat cheese dish with flavor notes that kept ringing long after the morsel was swallowed hinting of smoke, garlic, and an herb I couldn't quite put my finger on but that finished the experience with pizazz and mystery. Another dish spoke volumes about rosemary and renewed my appreciation for that flavorful and aromatic plant. My spaghetti was anything but, as it was perfectly cooked with rich flavors that reached far into each and every al dente strand. I can rave on and on but want to end this short review with a piece of advice. Have a slice of the mascarpone cheesecake and raspberry sauce. You'll want to sop the remains up with some of the restaurant's crusty bread if you are too polite to lick the plate clean.
