We went to the Bonefish Grill for the first time yesterday and were very much disappointed. The fish was terrible, chewy and tasteless. I know they say that the fish is fresh but it certainly did not taste like it was fresh. Â The portions were tiny and the prices were higher than expected. This is a fish restaurant for people that do not like fish.
