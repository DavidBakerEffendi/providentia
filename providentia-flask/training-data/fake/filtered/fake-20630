we've been waiting quite a while to go here after hearing allllllllllllllll the hype.  we went as walk-ins at sat at the bar and had a drink for our 30 minute wait.  the drinks were good, the bartender was a little strange but what are you gonna do.  we started with a patte and crostini and it was insanely delicious.  we came strictly for the black label 26$ burger and that's what we ordered as our mains.  the meat was clearly much better than most burgers i've had.  was it the best in nyc?  no.  would i eat it again, in a heartbeat.  (my vote is still for little owl however).  as far as everything else- the vibe was cool and the service was good.  but go see for yourself!
