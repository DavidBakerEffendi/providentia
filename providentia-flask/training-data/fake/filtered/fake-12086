One of my favorite neighborhood joints if I have the dough. Brunch is awesome but always crazy busy. I have had 1 or 2 bad meals here, but one time the place was RIDICULOUSLY busy and the other was just a question of way too much salt. I have eaten many things here that I probably wouldn't ever try such as beef heart and rabbit (I used to be very picky so these are big steps), and every time I've enjoyed the "gamble." Overall great food and great atmosphere.
