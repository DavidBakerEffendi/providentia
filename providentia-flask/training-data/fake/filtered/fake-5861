A couple coworkers and I celebrated an early birthday and found ourselves at EnoTerra on a Saturday evening.  The decor was as inviting as the staff, and the menu coupled with the wine list was superb!  The only downside was the parking.  Nonetheless, it will not deter me from recommending this fine gem of a restaurant to others and visiting again!  Definitely an enjoyable (and memorable) dining experience!
