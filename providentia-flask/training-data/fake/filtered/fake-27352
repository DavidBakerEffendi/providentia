We just had my sisters baby shower at panevino yesterday and we could not have been more pleased. The food was delicious, the service incredibly attentive, and the atmosphere was just perfect for our event. They hosted 36 people flawlessly. And, they also went above and beyond by participating in our activity of decorating onesies which was so sweet. It was a huge success, thanks to the wonderful people at Panevino.
