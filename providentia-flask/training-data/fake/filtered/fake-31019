This is our go-to when we are craving excellent beer and great food. Not to mention, the service is top notch. My favorite server by FAR has been Jason. We have been here many times and have only been fortunate enough to have Jason just twice.Every staff member is super friendly and helpful and the bartenders know a lot about the beer list. I have NEVER had a bad experience here, with food or with service, and it is why I keep coming back!! The Grilled Cheese is to die for. I felt silly ordering it one day, but it is really an adult grilled cheese. Awesome! Also, they always have fantastic cheese cake that leaves me feeling like I will need to crawl out of the restaurant.
