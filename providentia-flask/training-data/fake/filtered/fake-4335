This has to be one of my  favorite places to eat in the city.  Seating is limited, so you definitely want a reservation.  They write their menu on a chalk board on the wall and have such creative and interesting dishes.  I have never been disappointed with a dish I have ordered there.  Fiance took me there for our engagement dinner - we LOVED the west coast oyster options and their associated sauces.  Definitely a well thought out and delicious menu.   I was a little underwhelmed by the grilled peach dessert, but As far as seafood goes, this place takes the cake.
