The servers are French and are really nice and attentive.  the Munster tarte had the strong flavorful Munster cheese and the Kipik had jalapeños which gave it spice which he liked. They were both awesome. I really enjoyed. The dessert one we got with apples and the flaming brandy was fun, but I vastly preferred the savory ones we got. Their tartes are excellent and have the most amazingly paper-thin crusts. It was delicious.
