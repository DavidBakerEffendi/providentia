The skirt steak and the mussels were awfully awesome! I was worried that the waiter might not like me because i dropped my fork and asked for a new one, but he was super cool and made me feel like I was special as a customer and human being. The ambience was more West Village than French. And I know because I've been to Paris, albeit a long time ago before my life changed so drastically for the worse and then got better again. Anyway, the food and waiter here made me very happy so three thumbs up!
