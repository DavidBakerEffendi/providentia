I literally live 2 blocks away from the Original Nathans and I rather travel all the way to north Brooklyn. The morning dog is why. A hot dog bun topped with a fried egg, American cheese and a crif dog wrapped in bacon and deep fried. First bite I got that hot dog snap which we all love and master( ) to at night. This was a great combo. Now, I NEVER put ketchup on a hotdog and I think people who do should be beaten with a rusty rake in a abandon garage in south Brooklyn, but I can not eat eggs with out ketchup so I threw a little on and I was in eternal hot dog ecstasy. Don't forget to get the chilli cheese on your waffle fries!
