Almost didn't go for Valentine's Eve, but we wound up here with a 9pm reservation. Of course it was packed but our table was waiting for us, and even though the place is quite smaller than I thought, they held our table. At first it was a little uncomfortable, but then the crowd began to thin out and we had more elbow room. The staff was very very nice.... On to the food, we ordered Caipirinias, I particularly do not like them but was pushed by my date, and WOW, turned out to be the best drink ever! We ordered 2 appetizers, the sausage and yuca fries with aioli, TO DIE FOR! and the Mussels, OMG, so fresh, and NO sand!!!! Delicious! Our entrees were Picanha -Grilled sliced top sirloin. Served with rice, beans, vinaigrette and farofa (yuca flour seasoned with bacon.) and Feijoada Completa-The Brazilian national dish: black bean stew with dried meat, pork, ribs, sausage and bacon. Served with rice, farofa and sauteed collard greens. The Picanha was so tender and juicy, couldn't have asked for more! the Feijoada, was excellent, if you like pork and beans, go for this, its awesome! Now on to the best part of the night, the Maracuya (passion fruit) mousse. I swear if I weren't so full, I would have ordered another, OMG its amazing, yes it is very sweet, but its dessert! If you like passion fruit and dulce de leche, go for this! So 2 appetizers, 2 drinks, 2 entrees and 1 dessert= $67, not bad for a great night! I highly recommend this place if you find yourself in Astoria. Can't wait to go back!!!!!
