I had to ask the waitresses to give me plates and utensils to eat and in addition they charged me $5 dollars extra for a spoiled sushi that I did not want to eat. The caviar on it tasted spoiled, but the waitresses and managers and chefs ignored me and pretended to not hear my request. I'm sure that night I went there many people went home Â with upset stomachs. Usually I don't have this problem when I go there. But this just goes to show that when a problem arises, they do not know how to handle it.
