I went there last Sat for dinner and karaoke, their service staff and hosts were very rude and acted very snobbish. The last time I went here was before I moved to philly a year ago with my buddies and it was pretty good. But this place has definitely gone down hill. Â This might be the last time I go here. I give one star for the great bartenders there. If it wasn't for the rest of the staff and just the bartender it would be 4. I heard from one of my buddies that there is a new karaoke place opening in Chinatown on arch st. and hope their staff aren't as snobby and have as much of a bad attitude. Will be trying that place out next. I would not recommend this place unless they get rid of the rude staff
