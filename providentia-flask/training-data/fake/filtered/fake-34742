Admittedly, the first time I walked into Sanford's, I was expecting average diner food. It turns out the food was excellent and very reasonably priced.  I have been there 4 times this month. Overall, the portions are very large...one dish is almost enough for 2 people to share!  The 3 mushroom risotto and 3 mushroom ravior were full of flavor and cooked perfectly, The shrimp and calamari risotto was also very good with a healthy portion of fresh jumbo shrimp and calamari. Farfalle Genovese was also very tasty, again cooked perfectly with good flavor.  The servers were very friendly and attentive but not too intrusive. The only downside is that lighting is very dim and the menu is printed in very small print making it hard to read.  Other than that, Sanford's is truly one the few good restaurants in Astoria that I can trust for good food.
