Oh, where to start. First, take fiddlers lane to Rt.1 and head to any other Indian resturant(Mirchi!!). Â We tried this place when our normal indian resturants were closed, yes... this was our LAST choice. 1. The actual dining hall is mediocre at best, this should have been the first hint. 2. The wait staff, as another person pointed out was dressed very casually which is odd with indian cuisine. The place just didn't feel good. 2. This joint prides themselves on biryani, well it just so happens I'm a biryani connoisseur. Had it from dozens of places, in different states and indulged in biryani with friends from Hyderabad. You cannot fool me abhiruchi, I know what good biryani should taste like! Their biryani was honestly one of the worst biryani I have had in a long time. The rice was dry and non-aromatic, chicken was also very dry and too heavily spiced! How about some balance here guys!. My wife went with her standard Palak Paneer, which was also sub-standard. Good Palak paneer should be dark green, this had shades of yellow all throughout(the oil obviously). The Samosa was also mediocre and bland but not terrible. Please, do yourself a favor and pass on this place as its not worth your time or tastebuds. Ive had a few other friends go here and convey similar findings.
