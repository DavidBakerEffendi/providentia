I caught them in a lie. They printed $.50 coffee with a purchase of any breakfast sandwich. PRINTED on the menu. The owner said it was his wife's misprint on the menu and he won't give it to me for $.50 instead he charged me $1.50 for a small coffee which is his normal price for coffee...Thats nuts. McDonald's you can get a extra large for $1.00. He thanked me for bringing it to his attention and threw away alllll of his menu's lol. He's going to reprint he said...lol. Because I caught them on that. He didn't offer me anything. It was the worst costumer service I have ever seen. I'll never go back there again!
