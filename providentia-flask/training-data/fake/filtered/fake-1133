Lunch trip to philly yesterday. Friend suggested the Continental. Absolutely adorable place. Great decor, great service, and good food! Burger was delicious and came with a generous side salad but the Lobster mac n' cheese took the prize. Making it with orzo pasta is genius. So light you forget you are eating pasta and cheese. Looking forward to trying their dinner menu sometime!
