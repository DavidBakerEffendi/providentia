What a gem!  Enjoyed everything from the moment we walked in and the hostess, Tess, greeted us with a smile. Was she smiling because there were no seats?! Probably, but she was still charming and accomodating!   We had seats at the bar within 15min and proceeded to feast on some delightful fare.  Fun spot with excellent crew!
