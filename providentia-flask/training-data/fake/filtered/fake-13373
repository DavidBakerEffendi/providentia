the place in decent and the outside seating can be very pleasant in the right weather.  The wait and bar staff are very pleasant, but they keep changing them -- looks like they can't decide who they're trying to attract: the middle-aged folks or the 20-30 somethings.  Can't they do both?  The older folks are usually gone before or soon after the weekend entertainment starts and the kiddies take over.  Too many young servers brings naivity into the mix.  I liked is best when the staff most mostly the 30s-40s set with a few 20 somethings to spice up the mix.  They took away some of the favorites on the menu.  Some of their regular entrees are nice, but remember, it you want to be a sports bar, you're not also going to be a "fine dining" place.  When all is said and and done, the bar is probably the mainstay of the place, and if I wanted a special occasion place, this would NOT be it.  That being said, I love it for a casual and 'usual" Friday/Saturday night dinner out.
