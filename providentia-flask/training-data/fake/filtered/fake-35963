We had a very friendly waiter. The ingredients used to cook our food were noticeably high quality and the wine was very nice. The decor is really cool and their oven is an impressive centerpiece to the room. So why three stars from me? The crust. You have a beautiful oven and wonderful ingredients, why not put some more effort into the bread? I like my crust with the kind of chewiness (not tough) and flavor that only some fermentation can provide. However, if you like very soft nan-like crust (a preference I do not judge), then you may have rated Roberta's five stars. Bottom line: good food and friendly service means I'll be back!
