Got there at 1:45 on a Saturday.  Great time to go if you have never been before.  The line was short, and I was afraid that it was closed.  By about 2:30, the line was out the door.  We waited an hour and paid $28 for a pie, and it was one of the best food experiences of my life.  The pizza itself is very simple, just mozzarella, sauce (which was only san marzano, oregano, and pepper), the dough, with parm cheese, oil, and basil on top.  The difference is the freshness.  I dare you to go in with expectations of eating regular pizza at any other place.  That's what I did.  A day later, I can still remember that first bite.  I still crave the cheese, the oil, the sauce.  Go there.  It is worth the wait.  If you want a cheap quality pizza already made for order, dont go. If you want an experience....well, Avenue J of the Q is the place to be.
