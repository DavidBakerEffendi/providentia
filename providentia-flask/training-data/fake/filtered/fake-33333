I tend to walk past this area of town later at night amongst all the lower east side debauchery so I've often walked right past this spot. I came here after work on a Thursday to find it calmer than I would expect but still a decent crowd. Most people were huddled around the bar area so we were able to find seats pretty easily. The beers on tap were phenomenal. Some of the best selection I've seen in that area of the city. The service was pretty good given how much the servers probably had to duck around the crowd up front. I got the steak frites which were so-so but my friends seemed to like the burgers they got. Overall good standard gastropub atmosphere perfect for afterwork and game nights I'd assume.
