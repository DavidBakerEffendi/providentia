Pretty tasty food and cocktails at a place you can get into for an early Saturday night dinner without a reservation. Leans toward small plates, with a few larger ones to choose from as well. Good biscuits, brussel sprouts with ham, mac and cheese. Dishes tend to be rich, and their idea of a small plate is more generous than most places, so you may want to break out the pants with the elastic waistband.
