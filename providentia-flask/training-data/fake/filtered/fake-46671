Food is mediocre to good, depending on what you order. Avoid the calamari. The octopus and vegetarian platter are very good. A note about the service -- some of the WORST I've ever experienced in NYC. Waiters are rude and you get the feeling like the hostess/managers there could care less about the customers waiting to sit down.
