Well my first time there was not pleasant !, the folks in front of us had been waiting for over 1 hour ...once we find an opening upstairs , the service was terrible at the bar , the bartender was rude and had no customer service skills ! We ordered a steak and ask for it medium and the bartender told us he will have to check with the kitchen , he wasn't sure if they could do it that way ?, really ?, waited 45 min , no food ?, needless to say we canceled the food and left , they made us feel like they didn't want us there, I would hate to think that they were bothered by our skin color ?, isn't all money the same ?
