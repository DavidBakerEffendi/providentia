Visiting Carroll Gardens in the fall, we noticed that this place had opened since our last visit.  We chatted with a fellow arranging flowers outside, who turned out to be the owner - he invited us in, bought us a couple of glasses of wine, and could not have been more pleasant.  A few days later, half ruined from walking all over the city, we stopped in again, this time with daughter and boyfriend.  The Bloody Maries were fabulous.  Saved my life.  A plate of comped plantains appeared, and we dove into another round.  Can't speak to the food, but as a neighborhood bar with great soccer pix, good music, and terrific hospitality, the place made me happy. I'll be back.
