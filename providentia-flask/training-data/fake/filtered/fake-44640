Amazing food in a rustic looking tribeca restaurant.  Maybe not the most romantic of restaurants, but you'll fall in love with the food if not the person sitting in front of you. Lamb meatballs, pastas and salads are all great.  Be prepared to plan way ahead (one month) or for a long wait at the bar.  Both are worth it!
