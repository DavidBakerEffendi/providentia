Me and my friend went to Arepas Cafe on the strength of reviews from Yelp. We like to try different restaurants a week and this place did not disappoint. The arepas were fresh and crisp and to my surprise very different from others I have had. I was used to the yellow corn and not the white. But the way it was prepared was definitely different and satisfying. The pernil, avocado and white cheese stuffed delight was a fave thatt I plan on venturing to again. With that, the passion fruit sangria was A-mazing. It was the exact amount of sweet with the exact amount of alcohol. The place itself is cute, a cafe that is small but  not cluttered.  The staff was friendly and our server was cool. There are tons of eateries in this area, but I'm glad I listened to Yelp reviewers on this one. Big Smile.
