What a disgrace!!!! My sister who is in a wheelchair was treated with such disrespect! They seated us at the end table where the wheelchair wasn't even fitting properly. AFTER 45 MIN OF COMPLETE Ignorance, the waitress didn't even take out order and when we asked what was going on, threw us out of their restaurant! Â This is the most disgusting treatment we have ever encountered. I will spread the word everywhere not to ever give this place any business. The owner should be ashamed of himself.
