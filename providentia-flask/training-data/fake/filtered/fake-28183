I love mac and cheese but my experience here was HORRIBLE! I ordered a carbonara mac and cheese and a chopped wedge salad. The mac and cheese was alright, but the salad was a mess. First, they forgot the chicken and dressing (which pretty much makes up the salad), so all I got was lettuce, tomatoes, and cucumbers. So I called them back to let them know that they had made a mistake and the girl on the phone said she talked to the kitchen staff and they said it was in there. First of all, poor customer service. She should've apologized and offered to fix the problem right away, rather than accuse me of making this up. So I asked her to please send me the right salad, with the chicken and dressing as it is in the menu. She seemed really annoyed, which again is poor customer service. So they delivered my salad. They remembered the chicken this time, but still no dressing, and there was a piece of plastic in my salad. NEVER AGAIN WILL I EAT HERE! You have been warned.
