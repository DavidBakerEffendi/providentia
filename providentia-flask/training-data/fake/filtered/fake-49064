In response to Philip D. Evil Eye Cafe does its best to ensure that every customer is satisfied with their experience. We try to provide optimal service for all of our customers, making sure that every order is served on time and prepared with care and love. Like any other restaurant or business, especially during busy times, we may not satisfy our promise to provide exceptional performance and service. Also, in reference to your claim that someone else was served before you, there has been a misunderstanding. The customer who was served before you had given their order ahead of time, and so was rightfully given their food before yours. We are sorry that your experience was not up to par.
