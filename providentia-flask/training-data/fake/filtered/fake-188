Decided to visit this place and Pats while on vaca in Wildwood two summers ago.  Big Mistake.  The trip was to visit the Barnes Foundation before it closed, but we also planned to have lunch at both of these hyped up shops.  Again, big mistake.   The steaks at both places were of, i dunno, the shitty Subway or Quiznos variety.  Flavorless, small, lacking in just about everything that makes a cheesesteak great. The best cheesesteak I've ever had was actually in Wildwood years back on the boardwalk back when the Australian students used to work during the summers.  Quality bread, nice meat with the right amount of juice, slathered in good cheese.   Theres a reason this place only has 2.5 stars.  Those who rated it  more than 1 or 2 stars are delusional, or have simply never had a good cheesesteak.
