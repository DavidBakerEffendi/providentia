i have been going to l&b since i was a child . it use to be great over the years it has gone down hill . dont get me wrong the squares are still ok . but if you dont get them fresh out the oven they tend to suck. i ve tasted much better Â the service in the pizzeria is also terrible . the workers dont seem to care and are rude . make sure when you order you get a fresh pie . they tend to make a bunch of pies and leave them on the oven , sometimes for over an hour .
