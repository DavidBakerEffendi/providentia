absolutely amazing vegan restaurant and bakery. instead of trying to recreate the taste of meat, a mistake many vegan restaurants make, the chefs at champs create delicious new ways of preparing tofu and seitan. you can customize your own veggie burger. and trying the raw kale salad is a must. oh, and best of all, they use daiya cheese, my favorite. so much better than that rice and soy cheese crap a lot of other places use. this is a place non-vegans will absolutely love as well.
