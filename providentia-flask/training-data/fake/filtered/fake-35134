The worst experience I ever had at a restaurant.  Made reservations for a Saturday night 7:00pm bc my husband and i were attending a 9:30 show near by. Even though there were empty tables,  we were told to wait at the bar & were not seated till 7:50. No one came to our table till 8:35 & it was the owner who took our order.  We chose to not even order appetizers in fear we would be late to the show.  Other tables seemed to be very upset as well. No food was coming out of the kitchen.  Looked as if there was just one waitress for 20 tables. We ended up walking out, unfed & extremely hungry at 9:15 in order to catch to catch the 9:30 show. We were not the only ones who walked out.  Several others did the same.  I was very surprised they were under- staffed for a Saturday night.  I had heard good things about the food but unfortunately I was not able to eat anything in the 2 hours & 15 min that I was there. I won't be going back.
