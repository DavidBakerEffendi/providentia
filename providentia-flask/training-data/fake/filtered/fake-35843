Loved this place! Â Cannot say enough about it! The food was delicious and the staff and service were incredible. We had the stuffed mushrooms special for an appetizer and split the scallops and ricciatelle for our main course. The drinks were delicious, the crowd was upbeat, and every single person that worked there was extremely friendly and made you feel like they appreciated your dining there. We will definitely be returning, a new favorite!
