I have been to ootoya three times already...one time during lunch and the other times during dinner and i have been impressed by their service and quality of food. I ordered the shima hokke just to be safe since i have little to no knowledge of japanese food and it was AMAZING!!! the price and the portion of the food is veryyyy reasonable and i could say that this will be one of if not the only japanese restaurant that i love and will be coming here more often!!! However, the only thing i could say about this place is that the wait time is very long. It could be 20min to an hour wait depending on the number of ppl as well as the number of customers ahead of you. So if you are very desperate to get a seat, i would recommend to come in around 5:30 because they have a loong line of customers by 6:00!!! Â So if you are an impatient customer, i suggest to just go during lunch hours or come in during opening time.
