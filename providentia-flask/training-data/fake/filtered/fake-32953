Finally made it to G.Lee's Smokin BBQ on a rainy night. Walking in, the place has a nice feeling to it, spacious and not overly decorated. The staff is super friendly and helpful as well. We ordered blackened catfish and a pulled pork sandwich and both were delicious. The pork was moist and flavorful and was served on a brioche like bun. The fish was fresh and tasty. Sides of fries, cole slaw and greens were also excellent. The food and drinks are very reasonably priced. This is a very welcome addition to the neighborhood (which has lots of great Caribbean food places) and I am looking forward to going back soon!
