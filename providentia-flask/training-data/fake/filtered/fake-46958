I have been to this restaurant at least 5 times and really enjoy each time. Food and atmosphere are great and it is a great place for locals as well as those who come from out of town. However I was extremely disappointed at bar today. When I ordered a glass of champagne, a bartender gave me a glass of prosecco instead. It was not even a mistake (I wish it was). I believed he assumed I would not know the difference. For the restaurant with that level, I do not think it is acceptable. It is pretty unfortunate and I don't' think I can't take my people anymore as I do not want to be embarrassed. Again it's enjoyable but please be careful and make sure that you get what you order.
