So a few days ago, me and another friend were on a quest for real ramen and the first place we thought of was "Mincas" Because based on the rave reviews ive seen here, it must be good.  Or so we thought.  After a LONG trip here in a secluded area, we both got gyoza and Chasyu ramen, which is supposedly good here.  We were Wrong. What happened next was, i started eating it and it was HORRIBLE!!! I dont know what these guys are talking about but the ramen we got was bad, the egg / pork was COLD and sometimes i think it smelled rotten to im like wtf am i eating?? The Chasyu is full of fat and it was about to me give a me a heartburn..  The gyoza has absolutely no taste and paid 4 dollars for that POS? a compelte ripoff considering i couldve gotten something way better in chinatown for 1 dollar and it tastes better.  I felt like throwing up after that ramen and my friend agreed to since he knows how real ramen tastes like and this is  disgrace to "Ramen".  If you want real ramen, Try Rai Rai ken's, which is way better.
