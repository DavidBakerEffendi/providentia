Penny Cluse is a dog. A real dog. You can get a free postcard of her sweet face when you visit this wonderful, wonderful cafe. Hands down the best breakfast/brunch in the area. Penny has a breakfast named after her: eggs and biscuits in a unique and delicious herb sauce/gravy, and the selection beyond that is as delectable as it is diverse. Â Just off Church Street. The staff is friendly to old and new customers alike. Put your name in early on weekends, as the line can be long - PC is a well known secret in the Queen City. Don't go when you are in a rush - not because they can't handle that but because you will want to savor the laid back brunch vibe. Bring the Sunday Times puzzle, or they always have BFP and 7 Days lying around...
