I go to this place quite often, despite the wait, because the food is really good, especially their banana pancakes. Usually, the service is good too, but I went there today and the waitress (whose name is Cassandra, I believe) was just not nice at all. First, she gave us the check while we were still eating and started taking away the plates away while we were literally still chewing... and there was no one waiting outside! Then, for a reason yet to be determined, she decided to put a 20% (!) mandatory gratuity on the check, just for US and not anyone else. I complained about it and instead of just changing the check, she started lying blatantly to make up for her screw-up and pretended that they always do that for everybody... Well, it was the first time for me. When I showed another waiter the check of the person seating nearby without this 20% automatic gratuity, they made-up another far-fetched story. Eventually, when she ran out of stupid lies, she thought it was a good idea to start making fun of her costumer and started mocking me (« Oh thank you _SO_ much for your business »). I gave a 15% tip and left. Considering how I was treated as a costumer over there, I don't think I will go ever again. It is not because you run a famous and successful place that you have the right to be disrespectful towards your costumers.
