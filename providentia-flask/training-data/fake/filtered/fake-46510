Yum! This place opened my eyes to a new world of ramen - one that doesn't involve using the microwave to boil water and wait 3 mins. As a ramen novice, I can't give you a dissertation on the differences between noodle, broth types, etc. etc. - all I can say is that it's just plain good eats. Definitely recommend this place to anyone who hasn't tried restaurant ramen before!
