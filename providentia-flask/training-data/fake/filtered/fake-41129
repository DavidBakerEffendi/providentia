I normally do not write on yelp but because of the experience I had, I have to let everyone know what this place really is about. The food is ok. Not the best like most people here are saying. Katana-Ya in San Francisco beats it by far. The service here is absolutely awful. The host had attitude, the waiter was rude and just tossed the food on the table without a smile or asking how we were doing. On top of this, the table was sticky. The health grade for this location is pending (previously C) because of Totto's history of storing dishes in the restroom. I checked the restroom and they no longer have dishes there so kudos for them for reading the reviews and fixing their problem on that issue. However because of the poor service I did not give the big tip I normally do. The waiter upon receiving the bill, count the amount and the tip in front of my face. He then threw it and not handed to my table and said that it was not enough. I was applauded by this reaction and did not spoke a word and left. The food here was good but certainly not worth the wait. But to those who think this place is like heaven, I do not feel the any food no matter how good it is is worth the service and "rude-ness" given here. In case if the owner is reading this, the host was a white guy with bread in his 20s-30s and the waiter I had was this tall Asian guy with long brown hair. I know you guys will always be busy regardless of what you do but if you what to be a good human being please work on your service Totto.
