It was our second visit to Philadelphia and second visit to the market as well. We went to the Carmen's to get our favorite philly cheesesteak and Bassett's to get our favorite ice cream. We tried the "Philly's #1 Pecking Duck" from one of their Chinese places but it wasn't #1 honestly, there was fire alarm keep going on and off and at one point everyone was little confused but we were told by the information center's lady that we don't have to worry about it and if anything happens that she will be leaving. haha. Such a cute market that is actually serving a role as a market (not like a chelsea market, which became the place for tourists only).
