First found this sub shop through Grubhub and was pleasantly surprised by the size of the subs, great quality bread and amazing price. They also make great wraps and have lightning fast delivery... they even hiked up 4 floors to get it to me. My only gripe with this place is the quality of some of the meats, specifically the procuitto which i found borderline inedible. Long story short if your in the area and hungry this is the place to be!
