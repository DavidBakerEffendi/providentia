I had a party here and it was the worst experience ever... Music system wasnt working and what pissed me off was that we were not notified before the party started...so there was my husband running around walmart looking for a sound system bcuz the idiots here didnt tell.us before hand..no apologies Next the food arrived so late..we only had one waiter who was extremely slow The menu we had decided with the owner was changed around and he had done things we had specifically told him not to do Drinks took forever to refill Overall service was disgustingly slow and unsatisfying...DO NOT WASTE MONEY HERE!!
