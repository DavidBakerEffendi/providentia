Complete Disappointment. We visited Greek Taverna on a Saturday night - there was no wait. The wait and hostess seemed distracted to guests arriving (because the staff were rearranging tables). We were seated outside. The waitress arrived and was very pleasant. After taking our order it took over 15 minutes to be served bread and water. When our appetizer arrived we had to return it because they made a mistake. At this point we were there for about a half hour. The waitress finally circled back and offered nothing but several excuses as to the mistake. She mostly blamed the kitchen staff and the increase in guests arrival. Notwithstanding the initial bad experience, we overlooked the slow start, the error in our food order, and in fact enjoyed our appetizer, when it finally arrived. After finishing our appetizer, dinner arrived about 45 minutes later and the temperature of the food was cold. The management staff appears unengaged to customers and the place lacks managerial control of it's staff. We returned our dinners and asked for the check. The hostess finally came over (who appeared to be a college student who did not convey an understanding of the business, the problem and only offered more excuses as to the extreme delay).  We paid for the appetizer and took a walk (at 9:30pm)  to to a local Thai Restaurant which was great. We were very disappointed in that we have visited this restaurant in the past and the experiences have been relatively good. This was a remarkably bad experience which most likely not return us to the restaurant.
