There's a reason for the long lines but the despite the wait, the fresh and delicious quality of the food makes the wait worthwhile. Prices are reasonable but not ideal. Service can sometimes carry attitude but at the speed and volume of the server's days at this non-stop restaurant, one may cut them some slack and be back for more.
