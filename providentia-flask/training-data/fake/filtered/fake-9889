Ode to Hummus: so tasty, so smooth, melting in your mouth- divine dip in the pita, and you'll almost lose your mind add spices and toppings, and taste buds galore will keep you so happy, and coming back for more. (Sit outside, to keep from smelling like cooking oil, its closed saturdays, but worth coming back for!)
