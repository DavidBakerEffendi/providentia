I love love love this restaurant!  The could move the restaurant to a supply closet in a YMCA and I would still go.  I see that a lot of people do not like or find the look of the restaurant to be plain.  I find it nice and simple.  I mean hey- I'm not going for the scenery..... The food is fresh, great tasting, and more options than you can shake a stick at!  Satish is great for vegetarians and meat eaters.  I usually go in a mixed group and there is never an issue.  And Satish is actually the only place I will eat lamb at.  So good!   As for the buffet, I have to disagree with an earlier review.  The food on the buffet is great!  I have never found anything weird or gross about it.  The options are always great, and are a great way to have some of what you like AND try something new.  And I just cannot understand the comment in the same review about the clientele.  After eating here for well over a decade, I can honestly say that I always feel welcome, warm, and always leave full and happy. And to top it off, everyone who works there (including the owner) is very nice and helpful.  Try the Murg Sagwala if you like both chicken & spinach or anything with cauliflower!
