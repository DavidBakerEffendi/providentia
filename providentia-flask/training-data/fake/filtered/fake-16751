This place is on the long list of restaurants giving a bad names to vegan chefs. The avocado burger had no burger element. Just a wheat bun with sickeningly sweet teriyaki sauce, some wilted shredded lettuce, and a few slice of avocado. The sweet potato fries were right out of the freezer. Friendly staff but the food is so underwhelming a child googling vegan recipes for a half-hour could make more impressive food.
