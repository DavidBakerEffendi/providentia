Horrible would be putting it mildly.The food was Â old served cold by a frown faced waitress fresh out of trailor park boot camp. Although you should feel grateful to get anything for your money here; (which is exactly what you get) DON'T ASK THE WAITER/WAITRESSES FOR ANYTHING!!!! I don't know what they do but your satisfaction is not it. Parking is center city with no parking lots. The food had burnt debris from the grill. THIS WAS A THIRD WORLD EXPERIENCE!!!!!!!
