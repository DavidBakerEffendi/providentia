Just wanted to give a shout out to a great place we visited while visitng Philly last week. The Food Drinks where great. Eat and drink upstairs. Tell Donte behind the bar he is great. Visted 2 days in row while in town for a Flyers game. Dante made us feel right at home. Thanks to Donte and the rest of the staff great place. Jim Link Kentland Indiana
