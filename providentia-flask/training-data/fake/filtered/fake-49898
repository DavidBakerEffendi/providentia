This update is long overdue. We went back, as asked by the manager, and were sat at the very same table. He even remembered us from my previous review, and took the time to get to know us, chat with us, and even made a delicious dessert recommendation. The service was much better this time around. It's been a few months so I do not remember specifically what we ordered, but the food was much better as well. We don't frequent downtown Hartford often, but this experience, and the fact that they made a genuine effort to look into what went wrong during the initial experience and make that better, will get us back again. (And if you haven't had the Naughty Nurse, you are missing out!)
