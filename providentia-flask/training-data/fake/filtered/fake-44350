Ever since I was a lil chinaboy, my parent took me here to eat. It was all we could afford since we were illegal immigrant and had no moneys. But now I am US citizen and I have job, i still go eat he ah! This is favorite "fast food" chineses restaurant. The food good and cheap. Waitas quick and get you food and check quick, even fasta than McDonalds sometimes. The place look lil dirty but I neva got sick or food poison yet. When I grow up, I open my own restaurant like this and call it Big Rod. Everybody eat Big Rod. OK?
