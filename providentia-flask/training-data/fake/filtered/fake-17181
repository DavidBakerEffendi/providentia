Excellent veggie fast good place. Service is quick. Take out is quick as well. They offer Mumbai chat, Chinese and a bit of Thai as well. I love the veg fried rice and Hakka noodles. Would also recommend their chats , specifically the chole puri chat which is heavenly. South Indian fare is okay... Sambar is not very authentic. Overall this is one of my regulars...
