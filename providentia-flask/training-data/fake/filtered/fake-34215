Went last night and had the omakase. Also had the soft shell crab app, 2 orders of sake and a beer. Everything was fresh and decent, but was not blown away by anything.  Soft shell crab was well done, but did not seem worth the price. Didn't think the meal was close to worth the $428 price tag for 2.  Left feeling like there would have been way better places in nyc to spend 400+ on a meal for 2. Overall opinion, overpriced and overrated.
