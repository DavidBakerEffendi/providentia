I have waiting years for a place to open up in our neighborhood outside of Farell's.  I must say the beer selection, happy hour, and new hot beef sandwich are awesome.  I met one of the owners a while back, when I forgot my yankees, great guy! He sat with my brother and I and we chatted about families.  Great overall welcome. I was there the other day and asked Nick the bartender  for the owners name as I wanted to write a personal letter to ownership on a job well done. I told him I come here often.  With wife and a toddler once a week is often to me! Instead of telling me that it is against policy to do so or anything of that nature which I would have totally understood... Nick stated that he works there 6 days per week and has never seen me before.  That was his response to me...Literally insinuated that I was lying. about ever being there before..I was not impressed by his lack of customer service in his response. I explained why I was asking, he cut me off.   I asked him is this how you should treat your customers? His response was to me was to calm down.  I was speaking in a very civil tone...instead of diffusing a situation he was stand offish and really didnt care what I was asking him. I went from Yay-I am in Fan to A-OK.  He pretty much turned me off to being a patron there for the short term maybe long term.   Afterall, a customer only remembers their last visit. He really burned me up!
