At this point I wish there were more waiting options for yelp. Pizza ***** Service (-15stars) Rude employees who don't give a flying shit about you. Ambiance (-5) Crammed, loud. So crammed I could feel the beard of the guy next to me creeping up my sleeve. Im basing this review purely on the pizza. If there is a pizza god Robertas has him trapped in the basement making the dough. The texture is perfect, the slightly burnt bottom makes the smokiness, fresh ingredients, home made sauce that isn't sweet, my goodness I'm getting wet just thinking about it. My mouth is getting wet rather... This shit is good, but I think what I'm going to do next time is just order for pick up get awesome pizza a run home before it gets cold. If you are willing to wait and sit beware of the vicious animals that work there. They bite, I would too if i worked there and i wasn't constantly shoving pizza down my throat. 5 stars for pizza -15 for service = 5 star yelp review because this pizza won my heart.
