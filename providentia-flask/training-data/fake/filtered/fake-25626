Waited 20 minutes for two sanwiches while six people were milling around in the open  kitchen area doing nothing.   My wife's BRAISED SHORT RIB sandwich arrived with unmelted fontina cheese and very scant  portion of mushrooms. Apparently your choice of toppings on steak sanwiches did not include marinara/pizza sauce because I was charged $ 1.50 for  "a side of sauce" What a joke of a restaurant.  Will be preaching your inadequecies till the cows come home.
