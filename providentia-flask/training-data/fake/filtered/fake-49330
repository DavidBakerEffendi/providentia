This place is amazing. It's offers great food in a cozy setting. I had the filet mignon in a pepper bacon sauce with the truffled mashed potatoes -- both were wonderful. A friend had Â baby back ribs with creamed spinach and loved it. The staff were extremely helpful and the overall experience was real delight. We can't wait to go back when we visit New York again.
