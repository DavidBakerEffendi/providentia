Never in my 63 years have I been to a more pleasing restaurant than Tink's. The atmospere, service, and choice of meals were EXCELLENT. Since my assignment in NY with the Federal Government (DOA) as a Civilain in FEB 2000 and my reassignment to Virgnia in 2005 I have missed my home away from home and the many fine restaurants I would frequent.. Tink's is superb in all aspects. All I can say is to visit and decide for yourself, you will not be disappointed.
