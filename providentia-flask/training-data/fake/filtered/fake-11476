I ordered take out from Baby Blues BBQ and was very disappointed. The portions were small, the mac & cheese had a funky flavor, and the potato salad was warm when it arrived. I also ordered an apple cobbler dessert. I received a small piece of apple pie (NOT apple cobbler) and a terrible piece of apple pie on top of it. It honestly tasted like stale piece of grocery store pie. The dessert cost $6...    needless to say I will never be ordering from this establishment again.
