If I could give Joju a -5 stars I would.  This place has horrible customer service as they don't even keep track of the orders they hand out for pick up customers.  What's the point of having numbers on the receipt if you don't call it out!!!  First off, I waited at least 30 mins. for 4 sandwiches while they had like 5 people working in the back.  After 3 people who ordered after me got their orders before mine I got a little worried they forgot my order so I went up to the cashier girl.  She didn't even speak to me nor apologize for giving someone else my order, but instead she starts yapping in chinese I think to her coworker about screwing up.  Then, she proceeded to run out of the store looking for the previous customer(s) she gave my order to.  WTF.  I don't want the sandwiches she gave to other customers, and why not go back and just make new sandwiches instead of running after the people.  What a dim witted time wasting move!!! After all this nonsense, I had to leave so I asked for a refund but again the short asian cashier chick proceeded to ignore me.  Lastly, when I finally got my order, I was only given 3 sandwiches and shorted 1 (didn't find this out until I got home as I was heated and just wanted out of that damn place).  It was my own fault for not checking before I left, but damn they really need to train these people better and teach them some manners because they have none.  So pretty much I paid $21 for crappy service and 3 sandwiches.  That's the last time this place will get my $$$-not only because of this incident but also that their banh mi sandwiches have degraded in taste and quality (their pickled daikon and carrots are way too sour and their bread is old tasting).  So please check your order before you leave the store because most likely you may be getting the wrong order or may even be shorted a banh mi or two.
