Had the sausage Stromboli, and they were hot, slightly crispy outer crust and tasty filling, dipping in marinara sauce... Anyway, as good as I've had anywhere - including a family restaurant that I remember fondly in Florence, Italy...   But I digress.  Our food was excellent, the restaurant was clean and I saw them hand-making their pizza crusts.  And not expensive-all in all great food, very reasonably priced.
