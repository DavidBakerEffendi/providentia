Zero Stars. Never Again. 35$ for Juice!!!!!! Â The restaurant ripped us off. We asked the waiter is there was any alcohol in our first pitcher of Mojito and he said yes. After our second pitcher I asked the manager why there was so little alcohol in our drinks. He explained to us that there is no alcohol in it and did not offer to take it off our check. I paid 35$ for Juice! Cut with a little tonic. The tonic seems at first that there is a little wine flavor to it. It is a Scam... Oh the food sucked too. over priced for a BYOB!!!!
