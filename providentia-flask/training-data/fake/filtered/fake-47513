My first review on Yelp: I m from Australia, i was starving from a jogging on Brooklyn bridge, and I decided to have my dinner somewhere near the pier. I saw the line up in from this restaurant, and decided to give it a go. Pizza was good but not great, I mean, better pizzas are out there at a similar or a bit higher price, at least I tried much better pizzas in Melbourne. Service is ok not so good. A gentleman sat next to me was surprised abt the size of the crust, yep even the regular size seems to be huge to me. So he asked waiter to make sure they gave him the correct size, and the waiter said 'yes, yes' and rolled his eyes.. I understand it is a Cash only restaurant, but The ATM inside charges $4.5 as CC surcharge, outrageous! I d like to give it 2.5, but Yelp doesnot allow me, so I d like to give it "Meh. I've experienced better".
