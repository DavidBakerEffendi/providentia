This is my favorite place in NoLibs.  BEST MARGARITAS EVER.  The Mex places cant even touch them.  Its relaxed, the background music is not too loud but really good, the outside tables rock.  Things to get: Veggie lasagne (sooooooooo good) Crabcake Sandwich (and Im a stickler for good crab.  This is it) Sweet Potato Fries Abbaye Salad with steak ... and a Margartia.  Duh. Want awesome food and not feel claustrophobic?  Maybe bring in your cool dog?  Work on a laptop?  Socialize with down to earth people?  Want NOT to wait in a line?  Want a great brunch? Go to the Abbaye.  5 stars.  For sho.
