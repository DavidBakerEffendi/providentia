A friendly little burger joint with a laid back atmosphere and delicious food. The place is fairly small though, so it's not a place to hit up with more than 4-5 people. The menu is reasonably priced -- around $8-12 depending on your preferences -- and the selection is short and simple. (This is definitely a burger place. Although there are a couple other menu items, I wouldn't recommend coming here if you weren't in the mood for some permutation of patty (beef, turkey, veggie), toppings, and buns) I ordered a kobe burger with pepperjack cheese, bacon, and chipotle -- not necessarily an exciting order, but a classic nonetheless -- and was very satisfied. The fries are thick, too. Overall, I had a nice experience here. I think I'll stop by again in a couple weeks.
