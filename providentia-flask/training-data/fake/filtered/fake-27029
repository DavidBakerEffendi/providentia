Laurel is a sensation! After having a birthday dinner here with my family last week I have this place now as a number one on my list of the very best and fine food restaurants in Philadelphia. The quality and taste of its dishes is beyond delicious! Yes, the music should be more appropriate for the setting and cuisine, perhaps, more on a French romantic side - it would enhance and complete the ambiance of the restaurant.
