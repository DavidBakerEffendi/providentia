The best Italian food east of California. I grew up as a next door neighbor of Stretch back in the 60's and never made it to the Belmont Tavern till last year....long story...LOL. Gotta tell you, and I've been all over the globe, this place has to be on everyone's bucket list. Simply the best Italian food on the planet. Â Planning a trip back this year for sure.
