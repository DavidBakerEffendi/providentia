Need I say more??  Great New York Style pizza and location near the Brooklyn Bridge.  If you are a tourist, walk the bridge after eating that mouth watering pizza.  Or take a picture near the water overlooking the bridge. I have high standards coming from the tradition of Deep Dish Chicago Pizza.  Trust me.  PUT THIS ON THE TOP OF YOUR LIST FOR PIZZA PLACES TO EAT!  You will not regret it!
