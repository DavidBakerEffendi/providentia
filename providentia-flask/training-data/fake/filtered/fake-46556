Just went to Anthony's yesterday with my husband.  We stop there every time we go visit our granddaughter.  They have the best wings on the planet and great salads.  The blue cheese dressing is the real deal too. I like the fact that the place is so clean and the owner takes to time to make sure everyone is happy. We are definitely making a trip there for our SuperBowl Sunday party! Janne
