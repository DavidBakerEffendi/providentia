Not only does La Goulette serve incredibly fresh and authentic food, but it also has an incredible staff and impeccable level of service...exceeding almost any other restaurant I have been to in Williamsburg. The employees exemplify outstanding customer service and always remember a familiar face. After only the second time dining there, they addressed my boyfriend and I by our first names and proceeded to give us complimentary tea to end the meal. Always smiling and constantly seeking ways to improve our experience, they know how to keep a customer satisfied! Absolutely love this place. Excellent service, excellent food.
