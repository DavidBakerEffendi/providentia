This place is pretty decent, it is a lot more Chicano/Northern Mexican than anything in South Philly, which is rare and good for me being a Chicana from California. I feel in South Philly you will either get food from Mexicans from Southern Mexico trying to please Philadelphians by what they think is Mexican which is more tex mex style of burritos, fajitas, etc. and not doing it so good(although you can get amazing more authentic Mexican dishes down there) But at Jose's it is good comfort food, from their tamales to tostadas, tacos, etc, they don't put up a front and they were really friendly too. I would say this place is a more California typical style taqueria hidden away. Pretty good.
