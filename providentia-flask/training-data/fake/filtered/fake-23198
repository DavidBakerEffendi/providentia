So I have been at this burger joint a few times now, largely due to the close proximity to my apartment and I must say that the burgers are not much better than McDonalds. The jalapeno can only be described as a disaster to the taste buds, no flavor, just raw heat!! the gorgonzola burger was terrible!! We also made the mistake and ordered the pirogues and they were foul. I'm sorry to write bad reports bc the staff are really nice and I wanted this place to succeed but, the food is over priced, and bland! Ps usually the only saving grace is the milkshakes but even the one we ordered tonight was far to watery!!
