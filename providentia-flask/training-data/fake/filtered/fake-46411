This is my favorite restaurant in New York.  The few times I have been have each been unique and delicious.  The courses are small but packed with flavor.  It is the best bang for the buck for a 2+ michelin star restaurant in new york imo. The downside is reservations can be a pain (Amex is helpful), and the chef has a strict dress/ no pictures or dietary accommodations policy.  It was so good we tried to order extra courses to no avail.
