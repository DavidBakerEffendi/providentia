Definitely my new go-to in Midtown. Great for happy hours (that inevitably head into happy evenings/all-nighters). Service is on point, food superb (the truffle fries are like crack and I love the upscale sports bar feel to it. This is one of those bars I found by chance and now introduce all my friends/clients to - always to good reviews. My only complaint is there are only three Men's toilets, which can lead to lines during the really peak periods. Not something I'm used to! Regardless, love the place and conveniently close to Bryant Park.
