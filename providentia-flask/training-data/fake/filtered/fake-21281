After hearing a lot of positive reviews I was eager to try this place.   My wife and I ate here this past Friday and we left a bit disappointed.  The arepa con choclo was so so.  The corn tasted good, however, the arepa was quite dry and a little tough.  The other stuff we ordered was better.  My chicken in white wine was good, but could have been better if it was made with fresh garlic rather than the other kind.  The sides of spinach and kale were good.  The quinoa was excellent, and was the best thing we had.
