To be honest I don't like this place at all. I've been here three times for coffee and for some reason the people working there think they are doing you a favor by even acknowledging your presence. Only one girl was really really nice and friendly who told us she grew up in the East Side of Manhattan and seemed like she didn't fit in; maybe that's because she smiled. What ever happened to "service with a smile" ? I have never tried the food and I don't think I ever want to. And really people? A grilled cheese sandwich? How can you mess up a grill cheese sandwich? And why would I leave my house to eat A GRILLED CHEESE SANDWICH??? Are people that useless that they can't put cheese between bread, heat it up, eat it and save $10.00? Anyway, bottom line is the espresso was pulled to putrefaction and not to perfection.
