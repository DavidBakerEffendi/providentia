I would love to start by saying, Rahway Fried chicken is the absolute best hands down!!! We have been going here since they opened and we will be going here any chance we get! The food is amazing, they have really good chicken, sides and tons of awesome desserts to choose from. They are great for dine in, take out and delivery. The restaurant is clean, the guys working there are always sure to give a nice warm welcome whenever someone walks in, they are all so friendly. Even when I call for delivery the manager Ralph always remembers me, he is really friendly and has a great relationship with all of his customers, it's so nice to be remembered and addressed by name when you walk in. Also, Kenny who delivers is so nice, funny and he's always right on time!!! Overall, I recommend this place to everyone and anyone, if your looking for good quality food, awesome service and all at a great price, this should be your new Â favorite restaurant, I know it's mine!!!
