I will never eat here again due to the way I was treated.   My best friend from London had just arrived to celebrate my birthday (there were 5 people in my group).  They rushed us through the entire meal, bringing us the entrees probably 5 minutes after delivering the appetizers.  Multiple times, they tried clearing our plates before we were finished.  They did not offer dessert, and stood back keeping a watchful eye on our every move, seemed annoyed when we let them know we were not quite finished with a given dish, and then ultimately approached us and told us we had to leave because there was another group of 5 waiting on our table.  We had been there for LESS than one hour!  This was the worst birthday dinner I've ever had, and I was humiliated in front of my friend who had traveled from London to spend the day with me.  I have had years of experience as a bartender and a server in 3 restaurants, and typically would not comment/judge because I know what a stressful job it can be.  But this experience truly shocked me. On a side note, as someone who has traveled around Thailand multiple times, this food leaves A LOT to be desired.  Too sweet, lacking complexity of flavors, Americanized are some of the words that come to mind...
