I found this place on Yelp, and since it had a 4 star rating I thought that it should be pretty good. When I walked up to the restaurant, there weren't any customers. I think a lot of it had to do with it being the summer time, and plus it was a Sunday afternoon. However, I decided to give it a try anyways. The menu had a lot of options. Most of the main dishes were around $10-$15. I ordered Bi Bim Bap. It was a large bowl, I couldn't finish the whole thing. The food itself was very good. My dad ordered a bubble tea. There was 2 inch of foam on top, then the tea was on the bottom. I didn't think it looked very appetizing; however, he said that it was good. They don't take American Express. In a snap shot, I would definitely come back!
