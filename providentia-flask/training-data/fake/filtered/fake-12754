OH MY GOD SO GOOD! Lupa is the best restaurant in the city.  My most recent favorite combo of dishes is their decadent Escarole, Pecorino, walnut and onion salad, a buttery Butternut Squash tortellini, and followed by non other than their famous Pistachio gelato.  All of this I sloshed down with a bottle of Gavi di Gavi Piemonte wine.  SMASHING!
