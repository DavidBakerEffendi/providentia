Soup is OK. I ordered Chicken Soup, I read the review and I thought it would be in a good portion of the soup. It turned out that it's a really small bowl. You cannot even consider it as an appetizer. The appetizer was OK. The soup tasted great but was too small. The service was great and our server was wonderful.
