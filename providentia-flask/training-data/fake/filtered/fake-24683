We arrived early and the beautiful background was red and by the time we left it changed to a yellowish green. The atmosphere was relaxing and beatifully done. We loved the background music of soft rock and movie trivia in the bathrooms. Our waitress was extremely attentive to our every course. We enjoyed all of the small dishes but would highly recommend the edamame dumplings, lobster roll, crab on rice cracker and ice cream cones for dessert. Definitely go here with someone who enjoys sharing!! You will have a great time at this cozy, well priced, fantastic establishment. I highly recommend for 2 or for a group!
