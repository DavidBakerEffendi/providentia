The food was wonderful. The service was deplorable. All started out well until the dessert menu was presented and we never saw our waiter after that. Finally after 30 to 40 minutes later I summoned the waiter to tell him of our discontent, he apologized and made every excuse in the book including he did not want to disturb us. I related that his service was inexcusable and I would like the check. Â The manager came over and was apologetic and offered us a 1/2 glass of wine. I have never been so insulted in my life by this thoughtless and pathetic gesture. Keep in mind that I was with someone who frequents this restaurant whom he acknowledged. I refused his pathetic offer and he had the nerve to actually bring each of us a half glass of wine. In my book this shows how clueless management is to their awful treatment of guests and how to treat them after acknowledging their wrong doing. This restaurant falls in the category of life is too short to patronize such an awful establishment. Fortunately we live in New York where there are many options and ones that serve great food with wonderful service. What a sad excuse for a restaurant.
