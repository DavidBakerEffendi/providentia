We get takeout from China Pavilion frequently, and it always tastes amazing! The lunch menu is a great value and good portion size; I always order the chicken and shrimp combo and it is saut√©ed to perfection in a very light unsweetened brown sauce (they do not put sugar in it, and it is thin, unlike most places that give you a sweet sticky syrup sauce) and it never fails to make my mouth happy. When we eat there the service is wonderful, the owner is lovely and the staff is always very friendly. Definitely the best Chinese I've every had, their spring rolls are great too, made to order and piping hot, you can taste the freshens of the ingredients. My mother in law even loved it and she sends everything back at least once whenever we eat at restaurants, but not here! I would go for a sauteed dish here if your trying for the first time because they are definitely this restaurant's forte.
