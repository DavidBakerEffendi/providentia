I am not usually a bar fan, so that fact that I love this bar so much and spend so much time there is a true compliment to it. It is not because the food delicious and the beer tasty, though I will admit this was the initial lure. It is because it is filled with real people, staff and customers alike. There is a genuine care about the place, which is what matters to me the most. I find  that too often people open places with all superficial bases covered, the "perfect" decor, the "perfect" music, the "perfect" menu, the "perfect" looking waitstaff. But there is often lack of love and actual knowledge behind it all. And when you look closely your realize that all the antique looking things are from Bed Bath and Beyond, and the music is the same every time you go in because it is a satellite radio station, the food tastes bad, and the wait staff is unhappy and hollow, even though they are smiling.  This is not the case for Double Windsor. They are honest about what they care about and what they don't. It is not the place for efficiency, though I have never waited a long time for my food or my drink when it is crowded.  It is not the place for always smiling customer service, though I have never had anyone be rude to me.  It a place filled with actual people and actual food and actual music. And  I love it.
