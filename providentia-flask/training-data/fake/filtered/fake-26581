I wouldn't know how the pizza tastes because after booking a pizza delivery 3 days in advance of my boss's requested event date and time and calling the day of delivery to confirm the location and  time, they delivered the pizza a half hour early. When my boss was not at the scheduled meeting place a half an hour early the delivery person left. What is the point of scheduling a delivery time on line when you order if the delivery person does not adhere to the requested time? EST EST EST Pizza made me look bad in the eyes of my boss and his very hungry meeting attendees. When I called the next day after my boss asked why I didn't have pizza delivered to his meeting as requested the owner had the nerve to yell at me and suggest I just take the delivery the next day!!!!  Never order there again!! EVER
