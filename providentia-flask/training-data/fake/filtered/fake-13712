There is nothing like a good Brooklyn smack-down. In this case, Juliana's versus Grimaldi's. The owner of Juliana's (the older, grumpy guy) used to own Grimaldi's. He sold it to another older, grumpy guy. The new owner of Grimaldi's moved a few doors down (rumor is he didn't pay his rent) and the previous owner of Grimaldi's took the vacated space and opened Juliana's. So now it's Juliana's and Grimaldi's literally next door to one another. The good news is that Juliana's takes credit cards (Grimaldi's does not) and their pizza is amazing. Their menu can be a little confusing as they seem to want you to order pre-created pizza combinations. The other good thing about Juliana's is that they have more on their menu such as good salads. That said, Grimaldi's is still awesomely delicious. We choose which one we're going to based on the line out front.
