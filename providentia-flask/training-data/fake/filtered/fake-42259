Don't listen to the sad, unloved hipster who gave this place two stars.  The food is excellent, the atmosphere is cozy, and the service is great.  The drink menu is well-selected, with good, interesting cocktails and strong beer choices.  The pork belly melts in your mouth, the ribs fall off the bone, and the bacon dates are incredible.  The foie is delicious, and the sweetbreads brought me to my knees.  Figuratively.  We had the bacon doughnuts for dessert, and they are absolutely amazing.  I'm from Texas- my brother raised pigs- and trust me, these guys know what to do with some pork.  The ribs by themselves blow the pants off of any barbecue place in Manhattan.  I can't wait to come back!
