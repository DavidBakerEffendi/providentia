The people that run and own this place are very rude and nasty! I will not ever nor will any family or friends go to this pizza place......they don't deliver to my house but they deliver down the street? does that make any sense?....I called and placed an order about an hour passed so I called and asked was it on it's way, the person on the other end was very rude and nasty and stated that I gave them the wrong address, why the fk would I give another address besides my own? then he rudely stated OH we don't deliver to that area and hung up on me, meanwhile my kids were waiting to eat.  Even when you go in to place an order they are nasty and sarcastic and rude.  Gencarelli's SUCKS!
