came here with friends, one of them being a huge sushi lover and perfectionist. i order the unagi , ume, squid and uni which were so freakin' delis! i don't think i've had sushi so fresh.. and they make sure everything is perfect from the alignment of the roll to each grain of rice! It's a place any sushi lover will appreciate. a little pricey though.. but it's not like you're there everydayy :P
