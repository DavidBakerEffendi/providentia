Cask has grown on me, especially since my previous go-to spot was Prime 16 - as everyone who frequents there knows, the place can get ridiculously crowded when you're trying to get a happy hour brew.  So Cask was a welcome addition to the Crown St scene for me. Detailing the amazing beer selection once more would be trite, so I'll focus on the ambiance.  There's a lot of small details in the place that really add up - everything from the dark hardwood to even the really cool lightbulbs they use in their lamps (seriously, check them out!).  I'm a big fan of the nooks with the couches flanking the entrance and all the in the back, the side room for more intimate parties, and the nice tall tables that line the middle as you walk in.  It's an awesome atmosphere if you've got a group and don't want to be awkwardly positioned around a tiny space at the bar.  In addition to a really friendly staff, these touches make Cask a very comfortable spot. This is all in spite of being overcharged $40 last time I came in.  The server accidentally put the entire table's tab onto my card.  Being the personal finance wizard that I am, I lost my receipt, but saw the amount on my statement.  After visiting the bar and talking to the manager, they were extremely helpful and courteous, but I was pretty sure I would never hear back from them, since I didn't have my receipt.  Instead they looked into the matter, and called me a few days later to credit the difference back to my account.  I kind of feel bad that we bombarded the waitress with 4 cards leading to this, but I am glad to know that Cask was on top of it. Give it a shot, it's definitely worth a look.
