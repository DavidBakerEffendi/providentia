I was part of a party of three who came for dinner on Saturday night. The reviews we read were great, the place is beautiful, the server was charming and knowledgeable, and the food was tasty... However, there was a huge party seated alongside the wall whose members had long since finished their meal, and were milling around and shouting as if they were hanging out at a bar. Members of that party congregated between tables, squeezed against tables to get past one another, and leaned casually against the backs of chairs at which other diners were seated! Worst of all, this bar scene (as opposed to a dining scene) resulted in an incredible amount of noise! It was a terrible atmosphere and it was not possible to have a normal conversation at my table. I complained to a server, and she said that management was aware of this crowd and that there was nothing she could do. It was a terrible experience. I followed up by writing to the restaurant and have had no response from them. But I did hear from others who have reported a similarly disdainful attitude of the management. Stay away! P.S. The secret of the green sauce is mayonaise - lots and lots of mayonnaise!
