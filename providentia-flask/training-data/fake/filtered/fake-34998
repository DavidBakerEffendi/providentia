I went to Agricola on 6/6/2013 around 5:15 PM. I sat at the bar and ordered a glass of Rose from bartender #1. At 5:30 PM, I wanted to order some food and I had to call Â bartender #2 over to take my order for Crispy Stinging Nettles, Squash Blossom, and Carrots. About ten minutes later, I was served my dish by a food runner. I had to call bartender #1 over to give me a flatware and a napkin. The appetizer was less interesting than it sounded -- tempura vegetables -- but the batter was light, crisp, and tasty. After I finished, it took about ten minutes for bartender #1 to clear my plate. I wasn't asked if I wanted to order more food. Once again I had to flag down someone to order another dish and a glass of water. I ordered some soup from the bar menu, I was never offered a dinner menu. I may have ordered another dish, but I didn't because I wasn't asked and just wanted to leave. Water was not served until I repeated my request and asked for the check. The food was pretty good, the atmosphere hip, but the service was lousy.
