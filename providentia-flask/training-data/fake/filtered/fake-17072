I was seeking a new place to try, should we do the French place in Westfield..after hearing their price fix, (quite high) and considering Ive had French before and portion wise lacking.  We figured to try Cubanu in Rahway.  We were pleasant suprised by the quality and quantity, and the great warm service.  We had the Moito, which was the best Ive had in the Metro NYC area.  For a starter, they had a special Beef in a sweet/spicy sauce...fantastic.  I had the Lechon Asado, (suckingly pig) and my guest had the special (not on their memu) of Salmon.  Both dishes decent portion, very well priced and great flavor.  For dessert we shared a flan w/capaccino.  They had a 3piece band playing after 10pm.. all in all well worth the trip.  A great evening... and Im going back for the Easter Dinner.
