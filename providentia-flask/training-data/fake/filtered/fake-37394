Food is okay. Not excellent. But they swiped my credit card thrice. I have called their manager three times. Every time, she assured me that amount will be reverted now. But nothing happened. So I had to file a dispute my credit card company. Â And her response is disgusting. She says "I am new to the palce". I will take care of your request. Be careful and check your credit card statement, once you had visited this place.
