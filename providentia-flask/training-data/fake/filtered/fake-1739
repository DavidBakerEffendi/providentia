Pio Pio Restaurant, 10th Ave,, NYC - On Dec. 20th, a small Xmas lunch of 5 was a fiasco.  Poor service of  45 minutes for 1st course, a late service of more than 1.5 hours for lunch course. Management did not surface to address service issues, left waiter to suffer blame alone.  Others who arrived at tables after our party were served first.  When our table was FINALLY served, minus my entree - I was offerred another appetizer!  They are clueless.   Avoid at all cost, unless you are desperate for mediocre food, i.e.  IPeruvian cuisine -  chicken, beef and rice with Velveeta cheese, con't waste your money.   This is an insult .  I've seen more appetizing dog food.
