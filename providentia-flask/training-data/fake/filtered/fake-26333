just OK food, decent price, long wait, just OK ambience. Many have commended their customer service for locals. I believe that.The cashier seemed to know some people and maybe be super friendly to them. I just moved into the area. I was there at 9AM. Everyone was acting super busy with only 3 customers in store! It took more than 20 minutes for someone to take my order (with only 2 other customers). I know summer is hot and sweaty, but scratching body parts and then handling my toast with butter is not good practice. My food looked and tasted okay. I liked the sweet Italian sausage and home fries. but the eggs had black residue from the grill. I used to run a restaurant and we always clean the grill before making eggs. one thing you dont mess with in breakfast is eggs. they tell the truth about how the cook handles food. The cook also handles the cash and the waiter does delivery runs... how hygienic is that. I'm not asking for gloves and sanitary hand washes, but keep the money and street away from food. oh and BTW... it took another 17 minutes to get my check. I hope they clean up their act... or not. I got other places to visit.
