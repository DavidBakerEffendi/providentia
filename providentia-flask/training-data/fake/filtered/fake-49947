Rutts hut is ok. There hot dogs are yucky me and my brother had to spit i out. Instead we got a cheeseburger and grilled cheese I liked it but my brother wouldn't eat it so we got a cheese and egg sandwich. It was good. Then we ordered chocolate pudding. It was sooooo yummy. It is kind of dirty in there and there is know place to sit down just a counter and a smaller one for kids. The one for kids is bad it is very dirty.
