Louis Lunch is a terrible, terrible tourist trap. Living in the US for many years, this is the first place terrible enough to make me write a review. After waiting nearly an hour in a little shack completely packed with tourists for two "burgers", I politely asked the cashier to return my money as I had to leave. After the burger cook told me "You gotta relax, man.", I replied that I just relaxed a full hour waiting and unfortunately had to leave right now. The burger cook then demonstratively crossed out our order from his list with a red marker and told me "Get outta here, buddy!". A waiting time of one hour for two "burgers" that merely consist of two slices of low-quality toast bred and a patty is unpleasant. However, this extremely rude behavior towards customers is simply unacceptable. Fun fact: The place is _not_ cheap. Although one would expect good value from a place that has terrible service and a more than shabby interior, a patty between two slices of white toast bred is actually 5.50$ - no sides included. Most people pay more than 10$ for a bottle of water, the "burger" and some potato goo, money for which you can get a proper burger, fries and a beer just down the street. In conclusion, avoid this place. The service is terrible, the atmosphere is terrible, and the food is so not worth it. As we visited Yale, we heard other visitors complaining about the aweful service and food in this place. It seems that all they have is the incorrect legend of being the "oldest burger place". Don't let them fool you into wasting an hour of your life for overpriced mediocre food, like we did, and rather spend your money in a more customer-oriented place.
