I came to this place because of its cool story , that it was the birthright of a pair of sons who took their Dad's business and brought it into the 21st century.  That being said, as you walk in, there's the immediate sense that this is just that, a place that has been "updated."  Everything looks very new, but also a bit out of place.   Fortunately, the food and drink had no such problem.  I went with a group of four, and every one of us very much enjoyed his dish and drinks.  The selection of beers was a pleasant surprise as well.  A reasonably priced bottle of Zeezuipers went great with my meal.
