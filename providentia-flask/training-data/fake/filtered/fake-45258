BEWARE if you are reserving for a party.  I gave them 3 months notice that we had to cancel because they could not accommodate our number of guests any longer.  They agreed to refund my $100 deposit but the refund NEVER went through. It is now over a month and still NO REFUND.  Ohhh the owner is too BUSY to verify his bank statements...  Well guess what? I want my $100 refund as promised so log into your ONLINE account like the rest of the world.   Until then DO NOT book any parties with Giuseppe (owner) or Chris (manager). They DO NOT have good business etiquette.  They are holding my deposit hostage and it's NOT RIGHT!!!
