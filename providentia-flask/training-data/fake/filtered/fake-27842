This is real pizza made the real slow way.  The wait is slow moving, the pizzas are slow moving.  But what you sacrifice in time you make up in quality of experience and quality of food. The atmosphere is comfortable, homey, and natural.  Service is friendly, and attentive.  Pizzas are absolutely delicious, and they are a much-needed and welcome addition to the neighborhood.   I wish the wait was not as long, but that's what happens when you have a quality product.
