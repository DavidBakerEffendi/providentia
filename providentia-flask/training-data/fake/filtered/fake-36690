This place could be 4 stars, but I wouldnt know because I have only ever had the Lobster Burger (which is absolutely awesome).  My boyfriend and I have learned to go only when we are in the mood for this burger because it seems like they are ALWAYS OUT OF EVERYTHING!  It sounds like the specials are great, but we have not been able to order them everytime we go because they are sold out!   It was humorous at first because not only did we not get our first choice sometimes for beers...but we had to order our 3rd choice.  I have to say some of the staff was nice including the bar tenders, but some of the hostesses have a real attitude problem.  On a week night there was a thicker looking hostess that was wearing a one piece overall outfit that screamed camel toe. Not really a visual you want while eating.  She was helping the waitress get us drinks when she decided to sit down with us to take the order and just had a bad attitude like we were an inconvienece for her.   As long as you don't catch the camel toe hostess, and somehow catch them stocked with everything... This is a great burger place!
