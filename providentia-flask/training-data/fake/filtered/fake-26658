Finally, a spot in the Village perfect for date night and dinner with friends! The ambiance is lively, decor is rustic and sexy, staff are a pleasure. The space is an adventure to walk through; the bar area is spacious, looks like there will be live music in the back room; upstairs is a great room for parties. I went with two friends and we split  the Tartufo pizza (a truffle delight!), their homemade pappardelle, and their juicy burger  on a foccacia bun . I must mention the pizzas are made in a woodfired oven! We all had a glass of wine, lots of options with 25 by the glass available. Getting more friends together to go this week for cocktails and dinner.
