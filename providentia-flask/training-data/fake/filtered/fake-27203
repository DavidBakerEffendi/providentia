I've been to Masa Sushi  3 times & have never been disappointed. Having all you can eat sushi & cooked entries; but  be able to order as you go be keeps everything fresh (not old  sitting out getting iccky buffet stuff). Sushi chefs gladly tell you about their rolls/ingredients & show pride/care when preparing orders.Cooked options are small potions, but very have good flavor. Want more just order it! Wait staff are responsive, friendly.  Keep in mind the orders are made fresh, so yes there is some time to spend here, but worth the cost. BYOB  .can also order dishes. Be respectful and don't over order in one shot and waste (they do have a surcharge option which is fair). Everyone I have taken has loved it. I regularly eat sushi all over the country and will be going back to Masa Sushi.
