I am going to guess that a garden salad with grilled chicken isn't a popular item, because at 7.78, you would think it would be more plentiful - not the case! I am pretty sure the grilled chicken was the Perdue grilled selections you get in the vacuum sealed plastic bags from the grocery stores. Will not be returning.
