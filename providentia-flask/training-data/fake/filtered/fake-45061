I recently moved to Plainsboro and discovered the charming town of Cranbury. I have gone into Cranbury Pizza on a few occasions, the food was good, but I immediately got the negative vibe of not being a local. The people taking the orders are very cold and unwelcoming, unless you are a regular customer that lives in town, only then are they warm and friendly. Someone else mentioned that he too never got a warm vibe from this place. I'm glad it wasn't only me that feels this way. I hope that the locals give them enough steady business to keep them open long term, because in the future, I will take my business to the pizzeria in Plainsboro, where they treat ALL of their customers equally and with a smile and a thank you!
