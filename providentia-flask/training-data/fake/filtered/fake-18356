We ate here for the first time about a month ago. While I can say that it's a bit over-priced and the the decor is a bit dated and stereotypically old-school Italian, we enjoyed everything else about the place. My partner had a mixed seafood dish with black pasta, and I had short ribs with risotto that was moist, tender and delicious. The soups we had for appetizer were also very good. Â We had a creme brulee' for dessert which was good, though it's pretty hard to mess up creme-brulee'. The service was very good, even teetering on the edge of *too* attentive, but never crossing the line. We were seated and our food served in a timely manner--I think it was a really well-paced meal. We never felt rushed, nor were we ever looking around wondering where the meal was. The best thing about the place, I thought, was the live music. We were seated right near the piano, where there was a pianist and saxophone player. Two elderly gentlemen who could *really* play. It was a delight, as I don't see many places with casual live entertainment these days (or maybe it's just me and I need to get out more). I'm a musician, myself, so I can vouch that these guys were real pros. Great repertoire of standards and lesser-known songs, sweet solos and creative improv. I really enjoyed the music a lot. It is a bit pricey, as I said, so we won't be able to go back often, but we'll definitely go back.
