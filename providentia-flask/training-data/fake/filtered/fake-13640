The food was amazing, I went on labor day and there were very few people there so I thought the service would have been fast but their took 15 mins just to get out drinks order and that one because I had to stand up and go to the bar, the hostess was on the phone and the servers just stood by the back end of the bar talking. I would never want to go on a busy night if they can't work well on a slow one.
