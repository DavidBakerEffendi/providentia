First review for me and many more to come! Whoa! The reviews for this place are all over the place.  I had to check out this place and make my own judgements.  First off, the space is so cute, it feels like a general store out of the 50's.  Really clean and super airy.  I went today for breakfast, there were a couple of people eating and all seemed pretty chill.  The server greeted me and said to have a seat anywhere so I sat outside.  I settled in ordered a black coffee pulled out a book and waited.  The waitress came out and told me about the specials and took my order. I ordered a simple breakfast, Pancakes, Bacon and side of homefries I kept hearing about.  Here comes the food, everything looked super good.  I put my book down and decided to let the judging begin.   First off the coffee is out of this world.  Soft, little roastiness, little sweetness and subtly bitter.  The pancakes are fluffy, big and huge!  The bacon is as advertised, thick cut and meaty.  It;s not flaky or fatty like many bacons I've had before.  The homefries, has a lot going on.  There's all these spices and an herbal taste that is soooo effin good.   This is really executed well and cooked perfectly.   The cute little server came and asked how everything was, and I replied "couldn't get any better than this".  She smiled and asked me if I wanted seconds jokingly.  After settling for a bit I asked for the check and was pleasently surprised to find a mint with my check.  It'l like my meal was arapped in a silver bow. Overall, this place rocks, good food, good people, clean bathrooms (that says everything about a restaurant).  I will defintely come back and get my eat on!
