Waste of time & money! My wife and I were visiting Burlington and decided to go out for some sushi... we chose this place based on some of the reviews from Yelp. Big mistake. To start with the place was cold and drafty. Once we were seated, it took the waitress about 20 minutes to take our food and drinks order. My wife ordered one roll for an appetizer and the chicken teriyaki for her main course. I just ordered three rolls of sushi. After about 20 minutes of waiting (this is in addition to the 20 minutes we waited get our orders taken), we finally asked the waitress about our meal. Five minutes later my wife's dinner came out, the chicken teriyaki. The chicken was warm, not hot, rubbery in texture and without much flavor. The vegetables that came with her dish were not even warm, just room temperature. She never received her appetizer. When we asked about the appetizer, it seemed as though the waitress had completely forgotten about it. Finally, about 10 minutes after my wife's dinner came out, my dinner was served, the three rolls. Simply put, it was nothing great. It was just okay. This place scores below average on atmosphere, service and food, in our humble opinion.
