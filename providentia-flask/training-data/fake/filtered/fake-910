Delish!!! Was looking for a local place close-by (was in the area for work) and found this on yelp. Saw it got decent reviews and served healthy options. Gave it a shot and was NOT disappointed!! Ordered the western egg white omelet wrap with a side of turkey bacon. Yum!! I'll be returning when I'm in the area for sure...
