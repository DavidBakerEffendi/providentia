This is a great place to go for a dinner with friends or a date night. The atmosphere is fun and the service is quick (Jessica is great!). It's a little higher priced, but worth it. There are tons of food options from bruschetta to panini to classic Italian dishes. Everything has been excellent so far. It's definitely become a favorite place to go.
