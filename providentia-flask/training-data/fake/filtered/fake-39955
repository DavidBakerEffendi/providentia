Apparently I'm not the foodee I thought I was, because I ordered take out there and was pleasanly surprised after reading the negative reviews. The two chicken curry dishes were succulent and the flavor was well balanced . The garlic naan was well textured but could stand a bit more garlic. and the samosas were as good as I've found any where in my travels. All priced reasonably and they honored my discount coupon.
