WE MISSED YOU!!! The only thing better than Bonita is Carino -- owned and operated by the heartbeat and soul of Bonita -- the manager and staff! The food is excellent and the decor is authentic and down-home. Carino is awesome and it's evident in the shared neighborhood smiles and excitement seen throughout the restaurant on any given night, that Sergio and the crew were missed and have filled the void our neighborhood was missing. Mexican food is back in Wmsbg!
