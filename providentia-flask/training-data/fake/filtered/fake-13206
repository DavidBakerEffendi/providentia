We had a very bad experience at Mister hot pot last night. We spent over $100, but     We were not full. They charged $20 for the Soup base.It is too expensive,and ridiculers of doing this to a customer.Also,I had a very bad stomached after having the hot pot over there.  So I don't think the foods are fresh enough. No wonder it was grade as B restaurant from the health department.  Never go back again.... By the way, if you use the coupon or groupon, you better ask them before because there are some limitations of using it.If its group of five,they will give 2 hot pots,and it costs u $40 already;the trick is here..therefore, you don't get much discount. I like 99 Korean BBQ,at 61st better. They have hot pot too,and all we can eat only $19 per person.
