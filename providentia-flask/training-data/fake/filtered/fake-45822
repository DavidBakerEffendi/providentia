Tucked mid-block of 44th and Spruce not far from Penn's campus, you will discover the best Mexican food anywhere around.  The chicken tacos with everything are deliciously fresh and zesty.  Their signature chicken and sweet potato burrito is enough to feed 3... a gourmet blend of seasoned chicken and fresh vegetables cooked and measured to perfection.  New sidewalk seating is available but it's best for take-out.  A real treat and very reasonably priced.  Wait time is minimal.
