This place is awesome. The only downside is the loooooong wait, but that's usually what you get with a place like this. The service was great, and the pizza was even better. Dont go unless you have your friends, you cant buy Â by the slice. All in all, the place is great. And there's an ice cream factory down the block! Gotta love Brooklyn
