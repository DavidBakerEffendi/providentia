I've been coming to Kafe Neo since it opened and I must say this place gets better and better each time I come. Whether its for dinner or just for dessert with friends each experience is better then the last. The mozz and gencareli sandwhich's are definately my favorites along with the neo nutella crepe which is a definate must have, but I just started getting creative with the "make your own crepes" which is a definate plus because you get to make it your way and with all the choices you can have a new one each time you come in. Lastly, you must try there daily specials, everything on the specials menu is amazing !! Don't forget about the live music each week, you won't be disappointed by this Kafe, it's two thumbs up in my book !! Keep up the great work Kafe neo - your place and employees rock !!!
