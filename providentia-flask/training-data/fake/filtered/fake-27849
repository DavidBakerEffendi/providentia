I've only ever had the calzone here....but they are GREAT.  I'd recomend the ham and ricotta cheese.  And they're BIG.  One calzone is enough for dinner AND lunch the net day because you won't be able to eat it all in one sitting. Can't comment on the rest of the menu but if you're looking for a calzone....search no further
