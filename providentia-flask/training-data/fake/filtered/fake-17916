My last pizza before this was from Frank Pepe's in New Haven, Ct.  Wow was it fabulous. And then I went to  Nauna's and had the  cheese pizza with prosciutto which I hope  is not the best New Jersey has to offer.  What a uninspired pie.  I guess I would go back if pizza was required for some reason and this was the only pizza place left in Montclair.
