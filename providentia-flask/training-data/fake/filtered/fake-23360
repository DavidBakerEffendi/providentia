Ox Cart is a hidden gem of our neighborhood !  (Midwood/ditmas park ) They might have the best burgers in NY ! My audacious statement is backed by quality of their food and friendly service of their staff I've been their last month and had Ox Cart's Alamo burger. A perfectly cooked burger topped with melt jack cheese, a huge onion and a fried egg. It was  friday night so the place was packed , atmosphere is very casual and you dont feel stressed out like at some places in the city during fri/sat nights .  You can bring a date there or have a great dinner with family and friends . Interior is very simple  , I would say it has authentic style and charm of our borough . I defenitely intend to go there again !
