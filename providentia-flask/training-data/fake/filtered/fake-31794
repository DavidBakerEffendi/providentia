When I first started going to Limoncello's, I fell in love with the food and I had no problems with the service.  I'd go for lunch with coworkers and dinner. After a while, the service started to go down.  A few weeks ago, after ordering, I sat down and watched several patrons come in, order, and either begin eating or leave with food while I sat.  When I asked what was going on, they appeared to then cook my food.  I decided then to stay away from there. However, I decided to go back.  So I called in my order: two sandwiches --one patty melt, one pastrami reuben without sauerkraut-- and fries.  The gentleman on the phone repeated the order back the order. I get there and long story short, the patty melt was missing.  I ask what's going on and he tells me that he repeated the order back the same way it had been fulfilled.  I told him that it was incorrect.  The missing patty melt was the first thing I'd ordered.  Instead of making things right by maybe offering to make one, his answer was just that he'd repeated the order back and that was it. So I leave and when I get back home, I find that the pastrami has sauerkraut on it.  So evidently, he wasn't listening closely enough, since he didn't get that right, either.  So, since instead of providing good service (and he did recognize me as a repeat customer in the past), he had to insist that I was wrong.  I'm insisting that I'm never going back.
