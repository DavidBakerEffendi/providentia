I'm a huge fan of their guac and spicy margaritas. Small restaurant with a dark ambience, which I dig but be prepared for a wait. Our waitress was cool, she ended up messing up our drink order (no big), but made up for it by buying us some tequila shots. It's the little things that count, I think. Overall, really liked the place. Definitely going back soon.
