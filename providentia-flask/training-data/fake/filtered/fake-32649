We ate here Sunday  for my Husband's Birthday. We were a party of 19 and Very Pleased that upon our arrival our table was prepared and waiters Moses and Charlie along with the owner Pat was there to greet us. They truly made our evening  a Wonderful Tasty Food Filling Evening. They provided excellent service and well portioned tasty family style appetizers & desserts. We each ordered individual entrees. I had the Pork Chop special it was truly DELICIOUS, other family members in our group  stated their food was also very Tasty. I will Definitely recommend this restaurant to my friends and I will Definitely return very soon.
