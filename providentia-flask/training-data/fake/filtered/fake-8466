What an AMAZING find! Highly recommended.  To start we had the guac extra spicy ... great kicks. Then as my meal I had the special of the day ...  spaghetti with salmon in a light white sauce.  Super YummY!  And my fiancee had mac and cheese (obvi because if there is mac and cheese on the menu anywhere he is going to get it) ... BUT to make it extra special he added both lobster and bacon.  Ultimately he said he could have done without the bacon and just did lobster but all in all very very yummy. The restaurant is super small so if you have a party of over 2 this probably isnt the place for you. Many craft beers and great wine selections.   Great date night.
