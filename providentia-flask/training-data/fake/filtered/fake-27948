My husband and I have eaten at Meal several times and the food and the service are always very good. The bar scene is vibrant and the friendly bartender makes very good cocktail. We love their raw bar menu and the oysters are very good. We Â like steak and Meal has no many types of steaks and sauces to choose from. My husband likes his steak rare and it was cooked perfect every time. Their grill lobster is so tasty and not overcooked. The servers are always very friendly and professional. We really enjoy our dining experience and will come back for more.
