I'm from Mexico City, so I know tacos, especially "Al Pastor" which are called "Adobada" here, and these are the absolute best tacos I've ever had outside of Mexico. Actually, they're better than many in Mexico, it was an absolute joy to have these and if I could, I would've had 20 of them. The Aguas Frescas are terrific too, I had the Horchata but they all look amazing. It was crowded and with a long line, but it was a short wait, and totally worth it.
