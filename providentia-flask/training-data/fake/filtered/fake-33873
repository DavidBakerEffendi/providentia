These are the best tacos in Staten Island ! I see that some people wrote that there "simple" because they only have cilantro and onions well that's how a taco is suppose to be ! Also this is not a place for rice and beans because rice and beans don't go with tacos.the guacamole is delicious as well. This is an AUTHENTIC TAQUERIA they only focus mainly on tacos, if your expecting lettuce and tomatoes or rice and beans then you are in a wrong place, there's a Taco Bell down the block if you want that.
