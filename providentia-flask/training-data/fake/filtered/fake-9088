Most newcomers at Hoagie Haven order something they recognize the name of. Like a cheesesteak or chicken parmesan. While these are great options, the Haven (as it is referred to by obese Princeton students) has a great menu of their specialties. When I go, I normally get an 'extra dirty Sanchez' or a 'Phat lady'. There's a small menu taped to the glass where they make your sandwich that describes what's on these sandwiches. Vegetarians are welcome Â too! You can substitute eggplant for chicken, for example. (An egg-plant Phat Lady is a favorite for some of my veggie-friends). So, next time you want a big meal and only have $6 in your pocket, stop by Hoagie Haven and try something new.
