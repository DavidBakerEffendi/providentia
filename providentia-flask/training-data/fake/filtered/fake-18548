Gramercy Tavern is one of the classic restaurants, it is always great. I was introduced to Sweetbreads here and they continue to be some of my favorite. Their soup, this time was chicken and dumplings is always superb, warms you right up. The open ravioli was a nice twist and was fresh and light. The service is always great and over the top at Gramercy, My sister is gluten free and they always go out of their way to accomodate her, that is real hospitality.
