Panini's Trattoria is one of the best restaurants in Philadelphia.  The food and service is the best!  I love this restaurant.  Have had lunch and dinner here a few times and can't wait to go back.  I always feel like family and friends are there to make you feel very special in your dining experience.  The food is outstanding!!! Attended the Wine Festival on 8/17/11 and want to compliment the chef!!!  The 5 course meal was outstanding.  The arugula salad was outstanding and the Tuna Tartar topped with Fried Quail Egg was excellent.  The main course was Filet Mignon topped with Jumbo Crab Meat in a wonderful sauce.  The filet  was the most tender Filet I have ever had in a restaurant.  Love the Panini's - the chichen with roasted red peppers and Provolone cheese is great! The Italian dipping oil is also the best!  The previous reviewers don't know good restaurants! Jennifer my waitress is awesome!  She is the best!
