I've been a regular since this place opened. I enjoyed the spring rolls & asian meatball soup. That is until recently. I found bloodied a Band-Aid in my soup. When I brought it to the owner's attention (after calming my gag reflex & gathering myself), she offered me another bowl. I declined. The food actually tastes ok, but I can never trust their food prep hygiene again. I've heard stories like this, but never believed them. What a disappointment.
