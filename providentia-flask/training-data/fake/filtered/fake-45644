This place gets five stars because of the balance between quality and value.  The food is excellent with delicate layers of flavoring and great cook.  The curry puffs, egg rolls, etc.. are as good as it gets.  I don't eat fried foods, but those are so delicately done with such a perfect cook that they are not greasy at all.  Crisp and just wonderful. The curries that they do are phenomenal and very nicely balanced.  Rich, but not too rich, well seasoned but not overly seasoned, etc.... I come here a few times a month. Tonight for the first time I had a slight issue with a dish.  The head chef personally saw to it that the dish was redone.  It was taken care of quickly and the results were nothing short of awesome.  They went above and beyond to make sure we had a perfect experience.   I am a regular and plan to continue being a regular here.
