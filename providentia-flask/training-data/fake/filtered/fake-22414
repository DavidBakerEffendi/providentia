This restaurant has good reviews but for us was disappointing. Very crowded, we were sited at the center communal table. When the couple seated to our left side left the water glasses were not taken off the table and table not cleaned properly. The appetizers and main course tasted ok (nothing to remember) and were pricy (only cash accepted) for what is being offered. We ordered desert (I love sweets and I never miss deserts). Two puddings that were worse we ever tasted: thick bread with syrup.
