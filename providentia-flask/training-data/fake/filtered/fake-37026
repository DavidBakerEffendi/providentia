Very cute restaurant, with great menu for breakfast.  I am a huge fane of Huevos Rancheros, and I felt like a kid on christmas morning when I found FOUR different varieties of mexican eggs.   But alas, Virginia, there is no Santa Claus.  How do you make huevos rancheros taste bland??  I do not know, but they did it.  Only 2 spoons of black beans??  So much cheese, I couldnt taste any eggs.  ,The poblano eggs benedict had only a tad bit more flavor. Maybe breakfast isnt there thing.
