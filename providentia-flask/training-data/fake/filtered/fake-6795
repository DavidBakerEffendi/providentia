We went here for our 18th anniversary. Other than wishing I had a bigger stomach, it could not have been better. The food was amazing. Great, intimate surroundings--we got to interact with other diners, which was kind of fun. Pretty decent service, although we didn't seem to have a dedicated waiter. My main advice: don't eat lunch before if you visit and wear stretchy pants. Pace yourself with eating the dishes. Everything is so good you want to finish it all, but if you do you won't have room for the next course, or the one after it. We ended up having to take home the fruit course and the pastries. The mint tea was delicious. We finished about 15 minutes before the belly dancer was due to arrive, so I can't speak for that. But honestly, this was some of the best food I've ever eaten. If you get a chance, come here to eat!
