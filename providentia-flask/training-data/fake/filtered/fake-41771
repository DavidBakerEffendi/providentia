I had heard about this little restaurant from my Mom and since I work at Travelers I decided to stop in for lunch the other day. I was very impressed! First impression was the decor and friendly staff were very inviting. I ordered the buffalo chicken wrap and my co-worker ordered the maryland crab cakes, & wow! Far exceeded our expectations, it was gourmet taste but in a quick friendly setting. I highly recommend this cafe! Also, if you let then know you're just stopping in to the cafe, they won't charge museum admission :)
