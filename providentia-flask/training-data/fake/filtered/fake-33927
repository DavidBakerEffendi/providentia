We were looking forward to trying this new restaurant in Princeton. The plus is that it is a BYOB and the food was delicious. We had the grilled octopus (delicious) and the grilled beet salad (excellent); I had the grilled skate (again delicious). Everyone seemed to like their dishes. Negatives - the small plates did not come out fast enough; one friend had to wait almost 45 minutes for his dish. Waiter tried to be helpful, but still the wait was too long. Also, the restaurant is so noisy that we could not hear ourselves talk. We do not have trouble hearing, but the noise level will keep us from returning. Go on a beautiful spring or summer evening when you can sit outdoors. MKF
