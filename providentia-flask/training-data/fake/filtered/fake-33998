I love this place! Just as good and in some cases far better than most New Haven pizza without all the nonsense and tourists. Two Additional signs of Greatness: 1. Best chicken parmigiana dinner in the area (possibly the Continent?) 2. Great Calamari Appetizer.. Â a heaping plate of fried tentacles! what a beautiful sight after so many disappointing mediocre plates of "tubes" everywhere else. Yes it is a bit of a dump but who cares.. If pizza is your thing then I strongly suggest eating in and getting the full fresh experience. Great Prices too!
