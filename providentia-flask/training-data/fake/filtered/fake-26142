I stopped in for lunch feeling excruciatingly hungry. After the long line, I was even hungrier. Tommy DiNic's, your puny sandwich was unsatisfactory! Did I mention kinda moist? Come to think of it, my sandwich was actually wet and soggy. The flavor must have been on vacation, because it was nowhere to be found. I'd possibly give Tommy DiNic's a second chance because the meat looks so appetizing behind the counter. If I wait fifteen minutes to pay a pretty penny for a moist towelette sandwich again though, I'm just gonna pretend this place doesn't exist.
