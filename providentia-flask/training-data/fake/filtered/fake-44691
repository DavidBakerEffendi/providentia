The Painted Bride Art Center held it's 45th Anniversary Celebration at Material Culture this past Saturday and it was a smashing success. The venue is unparalleled with art and furniture from all over the world used as the backdrop or the centerpiece for your event. It's a visual delight and our guests were impressed as soon as they walked in the door. And, the food was outstanding! Baba Olga's café is on site and  Chef Aliza Green prepared a Caribbean buffet that was absolutely delicious. And the table presentation was more than we could have hoped for. She even had fresh sugar cane in vases beside the buffet table. The owners and staff could not have been more accommodating. They went out of their way to make sure that our needs were met and had creative suggestions to make our event the success that it was. When we asked our guests what contributed to our success they said it was the venue (Material Culture),the food( Baba Olga's Café) and the band (Urban Guerilla Orchestra) I would highly recommend Material Culture and Chef Aliza Green for most any event. Still smiling from our successful event, Joan Sloan Event Chair dance With The Bride!
