Consistency is what makes people keep going back. The first few times I visited Barbuzzo, I was so impressed. I have turned many friends onto Barbuzzo, people have traveled far to eat here. The last time I was there, I was highly disappointed and will not be back for a long while, if that. What we ate: Dinner: brussel sprouts- dry. i make them better myself uovo- half the pizza had no toppings! i usually dream about this pizza- very, very disappointed. squid and calamari- came to our table ICE cold! actually sent this dish back- something I would never dream of doing the first few times I ate here. fideua- 23 bucks for 3 shrimp, a few mussels and some sausage?  not impressed at all. mortadella-  missing the pesto as the menu describes in the dish. Drinks: Sanguinello and Basil Lemonade- good Desserts: tirumaso- nothing special bundino- the only food item that stayed consistently very enjoyable. Service: more depressed than the usual blase attitude. Sorry Barbuzzo, I will miss the old you terribly!
