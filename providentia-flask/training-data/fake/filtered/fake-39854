I love this place! I've been to thailand long time ago and this place transports me back to thailand again. I love their handmade egg noodle with crab & pork, you can ask for either dry or soup but i recommend dry one, try it!  It s what you can get on every corner of the street in thailand but over here is more fresh ingredients and good quality of products. Warning if you are hungry then order snack and finish with the noodle then it fill you up. No complaint about portion size compare to the freshness of ingredients that they use, it's worth it! For snack try their baby back ribs,  perfectly seasoning with a little bit spicy. Service is friendly, fun and fast.  I definitely go back there again. Love it.
