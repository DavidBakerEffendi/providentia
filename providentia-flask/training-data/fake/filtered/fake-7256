Came here for $5 pitchers of PBR and 25 cent buffalo wings.  The servers were RUDE when I asked about this deal, as if I wasn't cool enough to be part of this insde club that was clearly reaping the benefits of this offer.  I can't believe they tried to make me leave after I took my shoes off.  With carpet that nice, THEY'RE the assholes for not allowing people to walk around barefoot! NEVER AGAIN.
