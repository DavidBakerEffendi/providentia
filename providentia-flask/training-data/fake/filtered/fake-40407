Song is a genuine Thai restaurant in park slope with great food and low to moderate prices. The food is great. Portions are generally big satisfying. Cocktails are a bit limited but you don't come here drinks anyway. Wait time on a fri/sat night? 30min to an hour. The seating area is limited but when its warmer there is outdoor seating available. Oh and good luck trying to make a reservation...tried calling for an hour and it was busy or no one picked up. Prices are great for the portion size. About $7 for great pad thai. About $15 for their daily specials( mine was skirt steak ). Atmosphere? Trendy...dark but kind of loud with the live dj playing. Don't expect meaningful conversations here. Service? Could be better. They're nice but just not around much. My complaint...CREDIT CARDS are NOT accepted. Overall, great thai food in brooklyn. Give yourself a good amount of wait time!
