Sadly, The Red Onion is only a shadow of its former self. The food is still great, mind you, but the interior of the restaurant is in dire, dire need of a thorough cleaning. It's hard to believe that the proprietor could allow operations to continue. Check out the plastic flower arrangement above the coffee area, and then take a good look around -- the cooking area itself sits under an veritable tent of dust and grime. This situation has been going on for some time, but our last visit on Sunday, Feb. 5 finally convinced us. We enjoy a funky eatery as much as the next guy, but it's just reached the point where we can no longer return. That's a sad commentary, more than anything. We've been frequenting The Red Onion on weekends for more than 30 years. Hopefully things will improve?
