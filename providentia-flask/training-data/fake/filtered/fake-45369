Being born and raised in the South (Tenn, Texas, Miss, Ark) i know excellent fried chicken and this was very  good; i had chicken and waffles (more on waffles in minute) and it came with 3 very crunchy tasty pieces; not amazing but very very good; my daughter had the fried chicken sandwich and the breast was very tender and moist; nicely done. Now to the waffles; OH MY GOODNESS GRACIOUS!!! they were the best things i had in new york!!  red velvet with sweet syrup was  fantastic;   worth the money
