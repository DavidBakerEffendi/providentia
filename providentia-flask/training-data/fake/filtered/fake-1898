Horrible service. I was highly anticipated and disappointed. Â I eat out a mere twice a month at a different restaurant in NYC all the time. Im not one to complain about long lines. But this was ridiculous. The wait was ridiculous, esp when it came to the service. Forget the fact that the price was not worth it as well. I over heard mgnt speaking to their employers worse than a parent to a chil. This is NY not a 3rd world country. I dont understand it. This was my second time visiting Brooklyn Crab and i was hoping my 2nd visit would give me a different outlook. I was wrong. This place shpuld be reported to dept of Labor. Staff is rude. Line is obserd. They have kids the age of 15-16 workin late nights, last I checked that was ILLEGAL. I have children of my own. This is UNLAWFUL. I will be visiting again to obtain Brooklyn Crab's LLC and other info. This is disturbing
