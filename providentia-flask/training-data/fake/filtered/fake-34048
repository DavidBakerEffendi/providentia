The food and service was excellent. The amount of food for the price we paid was amazing. We enjoyed the Taverna Chips for appetizer which are the deep fried zucchini and eggplant chips, yum! Also has the fried calamari, just as delicious. for the main course we enjoyed the atlantic salmon and the gyro plater, again the quantity and quality were excellent. Thanks for a wonderful experience.
