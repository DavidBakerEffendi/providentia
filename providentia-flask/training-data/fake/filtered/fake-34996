If you're heading out for a place with solid ambiance (especially around the bar and hostess stand), then this certainly stands towards the top of the heap for Princeton. However, the food, service, and value are all sub-par - the kale salad was similar to chopping up raw kale at home with watery dressing, and while the flatbread was quite good, the main courses were extremely limited, small portioned and uneventful despite the great local NJ produce. Finally, they followed the charge-for-tap-water scam so while the waitress was nowhere to be seen and the busers consistently filled our glasses to the top - we left with $150 check while not being full ($10 was for tap water!). If I were single, it would certainly be a cool hangout - but I'd have to say the best part about this new restaurant is that it has taken away almost all of Teresa's overflow!
