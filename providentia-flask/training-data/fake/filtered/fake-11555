I had my sons communion party in May 2014 and thanks to Steve it was perfect (and I tend to be a but demanding). He took the time to cover each detail of the venue start to the very end ( my guests were very impressed as were we). The food was great, the party room was perfectly decorated and Steve and the staff accommodated my every request. I can't thank you enough for creating this wonderful event for us! It's a beautiful place and the service was impeccable! We plan to book all our parties there from now on...:)
