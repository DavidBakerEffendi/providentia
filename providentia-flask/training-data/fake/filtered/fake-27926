I just want to say that I finally made it here this week and was so happy to see a new place at this corner.  Everything was great and the service was exceptional.  There were not that many people there but it was an enjoyable experience.  I have to disagree with Craig about the antipasta, I had it and enjoyed it, but he is right about the veal.  Will be going back.  People, lets support this place.  We have seen some good places here go out of business for lack of local support.
