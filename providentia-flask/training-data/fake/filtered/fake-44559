I love going to this restaurant for the past 3 month I have been in Princeton.  I had put up a review about two weeks back but surprised it did not show up in here. Anyway so far I have tried the wonton noodles, fried rice with shrimps, penang prawn mee, fish head rice noodles , Tom yum soup, penang char keow teow, rendang chicken, thai lemongrass chicken and my favorite Belacan kang kung. I'm from Singapore and all these dishes are so familiar to me. I have brought my colleagues from Argentina, Jamaica, Morocco and my friends from Singapore to this restaurant.  We were all impressed by the food quality and the service provided. I'm guilty of food waste because I would forget the food  portion served was very generous. I really appreciate the BYOB policy as well. Thank you and keep up the good work.
