Do not go to this restaurant, never go to Geronimos in New Haven, CT, do not take your family to this restaurant, do not let a casual acquaintance you might bump into who mentions they were going to this restaurant go to this restaurant.  We just moved from New Mexico to New Haven so we were excited to try this place, as they hang the New Mexican flag there.  But, the ambiance is southwestern applebees.  Smells like a tequila hangover and jello shots.  Sounds like a slow jazz on tequila and jello shots.  The wait staff are slow, snooty, and seem to think they are not waiters at a cheap impostor of a restaurant.  The food is not southwestern, ingredients do not make food.  Just putting a western location as an adjective to a food item does not make it authentic either.  But, the wait staff, unbelievably bad, abrasive, bold.  I left a zero tip and that is a difficult thing for me to do.  Do not go.  Don't let others go.  Never go to Geronimos.  Do not go to Geronimos Tequila Bar in New Haven CT.  Don't do it, PLEASE!!!!!!!!!  This is the review you should believe, the others were written by the wait staff.
