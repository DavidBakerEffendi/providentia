The service overall was very slow.  When we got there, the server was right on us asking us if we were ready to order drinks - we weren't.  When she got back my girlfriend ordered a mixed drink, and I ordered one of the special IPA's - the LBIPA.  Heck, it was 85 degrees out today - I wanted a cold, refreshing beer. We waited at least 10 minutes to get our drinks.  My girlfriend got the wrong drink, and I ended up with a stout - a stout on an 85 degree day.  My girlfriend sent her drink back.  I didn't want to pile on the server so i sucked down my stout.  When I got the bill I found out that was a $10 mistake - a 10 dollar glass of beer.  Wow.       The food was decent actually.  My girlfriend got a chicken and guacamole salad which she enjoyed (maybe 7 out of 10 for her).  I went low end and got a chicken parm sandwich.  I really liked the crusty roll that it came on, and the fresh mozz that obviously topped the sandwich.  However, there was precious little sauce on it, so overall it was rather dry and lacked flavor.  The fries seemed well seasoned and crunchy, but weren't hot enough to be enjoyable.      I don't think i would go back.  It's a shame, because there really aren't a lot of good options in the area.  You can tell by the one page double sided menu that this place was a little lower end.  So don't let the great furnishings fool you.  I will say, outside of my $10 beer, the prices were palatable.
