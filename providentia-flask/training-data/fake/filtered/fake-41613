Overall a good experience.  Started off poorly.  Went there on a Saturday night, had a 7:30 reservation.  I checked in with the host and the table wasn't ready.  The host stand area was mobbed with people waiting, some seemed very unhappy.  To their credit, the guy who looked like a manager brought out glasses of Sangria for everyone who was waiting.  That was really nice.  I waited 20 minutes, checked back in with the host and they  didn't even know I was waiting.  Got sat about 10 minutes after that.  Had a pitcher of Sangria, which was pretty good. I got the tapas for two which is 6 tapas of your choice.  Really liked the wild mushrooms & the salmon. Had churros for dessert, really good.  Our waiter was really quick and friendly.  Besides the slow start and waiting 30 minutes for my reserved table, I left very happy.  Good food, good service, nice atmosphere.  Would recommend it to anyone who like tapas.
