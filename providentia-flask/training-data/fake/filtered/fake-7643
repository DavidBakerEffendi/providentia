My friend and I went to this newly opened restaurant last Saturday. It is actually run by the same group of people from Yangzi River restaurant in Deptford, NJ - probably the best Szechuan food restaurant in new jersey. We ordered several dishes including suanni bairou (steamed fresh pork with garlic soy vinaigrette) and maoxuewang (duck blood in spiced sauce). Very authentic cuisine, and the price is even cheaper than their former restaurant. The waiters were very friendly, overall it was a gorgeous dining experience. The place is now further way from where I live, but it is definitely worth the trip.
