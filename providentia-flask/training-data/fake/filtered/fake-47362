The worst BBQ I have ever tasted.  Service was horrible, waited 15 minutes before we even got a waitress to bring us a drink.  The ribs were tough, not juicy at all, and they hadn't been slow cooked, smoked or even roasted.  They tasted as if someone microwaved the meat and then tossed BBQ sauce on top.  The BBQ tasted the same, it was roasted chicken with BBQ sauce tossed on top.  It was overall tasteless.  I've had better sauces out of a jar.  A huge waste of time and money.
