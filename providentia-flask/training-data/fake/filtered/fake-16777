Honest Tom's move from a food truck to a store front has increased their offering of tacos and continued to impress me with generous dulpings of guac and fresh ingredients. I really am a huge fan of the sweet potato tacos on corn tortillas. The sweet potatoes are charred on the grill and just have a nice bold flavor. Honest Tom's taco box, it rocks it rocks.
