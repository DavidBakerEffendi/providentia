Went here for brunch with my girl friend service was a little slow, we were seated outside. It was packed inside with a 30 minute wait. The waiter was very nice, we got our drinks in a decent amount of time, we both got the perfecto margarita, this was a strong drink and had both of us tipsy. We were I a rush so we didn't get appetizers. We ordered the pork tacos and I got the burger of the brunch menu. Both were good however my burger didn't come out medium as I ordered it can out well done. Service needs to be better outside, and they should deff learn there temperatures when it comes to burgers or any meats.
