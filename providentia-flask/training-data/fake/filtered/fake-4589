I have to agree with the reviewer above: this pizza is some of the best. This is my first review on Yelp; I realized that there were next to no reviews on this restaurant and simply had to write one myself. I read this article nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/… and remembered Old World's pizza fondly.  The pizza at Augustine's is at least as good as that.   Whenever I'm in a new area, I check out the reviews of the local pizza places to see if I might find a great one.  Of course, I've been to Grimaldi's in Brooklyn, but this is better.  The only pizzeria nearby that can compete with this place is Nomad's in Hopewell, NJ.   To add to our satisfaction, the owner is plainly passionate about the food he makes.  With a little luck, this place will go far.
