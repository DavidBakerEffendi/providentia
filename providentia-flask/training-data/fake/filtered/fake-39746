Like a lot of reviewers, I agree the place is a little bit pricey, but if you consider the ambiance and service, the place is worth every penny! I came here for a romantic dinner and it was one of the best dinner dates I've had in a long time. I knew the place was going to be on the more expensive side so I opted to save a few bucks by bringing a really nice bottle of wine and succumbing to the corkage fee.  I actually noticed two other tables doing the same thing : ).   You could definitely tell the chefs put their hearts and souls into preparing the food. We started off by getting 3 cheeses that I had requested for the cheese monger to pair with our bottle of cabernet sauvignon. Though the cheeses came out in very small portions, the plate was well curated and the cheeses were all exceptional! Our favorite was a goat cheese that had truffle flakes in it. For appetizers, we got the celery root soup and potato gnocchi which were both very delicate. For entrees, we got the scallops and the risotto which actually were larger portions than expected.  We were both stuffed by that point but still got the cookie sampler for dessert (the perfect size and to die for!).   Overall, the experience was magical!!! I definitely think Talula's Garden will be worth coming back to in the summer when outdoor seating will make the dining experience even more memorable.
