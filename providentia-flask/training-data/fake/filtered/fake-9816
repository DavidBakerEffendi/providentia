Good place. Dark inside, very moody.. trendy but not overly fussy interior, which I generally appreciate. Good date spot. I love seafood.. and cocktails -- they do both well. Nice and balanced menu, I would go back there with a larger crew to order / share and try more things. I totally regret not getting the lobster. Crowd is pretty much what I expected from Tribeca. I have a thing where if I see a woman on a date (usually with a fairly older gentleman) in a Herve Leger dress on a weekday, I feel entitled to judge the crowd of that place accordingly. Well, that happened here. My parents would love this place. I also love my parents.
