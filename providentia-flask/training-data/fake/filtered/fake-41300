We had our daughter's rehearsal dinner at Big Fish, because it is one of her favorite restaurants. We had a party of 14 people on 4/25/2008,a Friday night. I had spoken with Kim the manager earlier in the day to select wine and appetizers for the table. Our guests then selected anything they wanted from the menu.  We had excellent service; our guests said they were each very pleased with the food selections they made; and our bill was very reasonable!!  It is a lively venue and the atmosphere added to the festivity of the occasion!
