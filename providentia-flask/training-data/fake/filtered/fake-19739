I searched for homemade bratwurst in all of western Mass and finally Hartford before coming up with this place. Not sure what the hours are but they are open until 6 on Tuesday. The service here was awesome. I went at an off peak time just to grab some Brats. The woman behind the counter was helpful, polite, energetic and honest. I ended up with the Brats and a couple other things, but got to try so much more at her insistence and she sent me on my way with almost as many samples to take home as I bought! There are a lot of polish deli's in my area, but nothing compare to Adolf's variety. Products and service are great, I already can't wait to go back!
