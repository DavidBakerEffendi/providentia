This place is awesome. Where it's sister bar, The Standard Tap can be a little pretentious, this place is ruff around the edges with whipped cream inside. The local beers on tap are always fresh. It's hard to find a pint of Sly Fox's O'Reilly Stout (the Guinness KILLER!) around. This place has it and it's delish. The food, like at Standard Tap, is not your usual bar food. It's a step up and out of here. The clientele is an eclectic mix. From rockabillies to center city suits to pincushion heads to suburban-boneheads-who've-just-moved-into-the-­city-and-think-it's-jus "so cool" to-be-down-with-the-people-and-not-have-to-mow-­mommy's-yard-ever-again. I've yet to sit elbow-to-elbow with a toothless and ruthless Fishtown native there, but it is old school in the most modest means. The pool table rocks and the jukebox is the best I've ever seen. my website... Gigfy.com my blog... lovelyday4aguinness.blog…
