Super cute little restaurant, which I finally tried out after driving by for years. Great atmosphere, very attentive staff. I'm  huge fan of french food,  my sister and mother both loved what they had (both had some sort of crepe), and the portion size was exactly right, which is a really hard feat for most restaurants now. While the food  exactly up my alley, the dessert was amazing. We had a creme brulee and strawberry bread pudding. Whoa. It was good.
