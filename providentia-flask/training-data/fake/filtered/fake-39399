I use to go to Koreana all the time when I was an undergrad; in fact one summer I went there everyday for lunch. However I have stopped going there for quite a number of years because they got too cheap with the portions, esp the Gal Bi. I remember when i use to first get it, there was so much beef i couldn't even finish it.  Then they started given fever pieces of meat, and a more bone and fat to meat ratio. I would be hungry an hour after eating. I also did not like that when i ordered the dish  delivery , every time 80% of the meat would be all fat; literally bbq fat. I simply stopped going because  I was paying $10.25 for BBQ fat, bone and a little meat. That being said, their gal bi recipe is one of the best I have tasted, but until they stop being cheap and put more meat on the plate, I will take my money elsewhere.
