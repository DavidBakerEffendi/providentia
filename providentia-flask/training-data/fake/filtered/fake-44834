I am from this area 4800 Baltimore ... grew up here and have known and eaten in all of the establishments owned by these guys... I have eaten in and supported this particular establishment from the day it opened... out of allegiance to the neighborhood and convienience. The Food: Mediocre with some surprising hits.... brunch would be your best bet. I don't eat meat, but the Parmesan Â wings and burgers seem to be ok according to my family members. The brunch menu is full of flavor and creativity... ALTHOUGH food handling and consistency in quality is pretty bad.... We actually got ill the last time we ate there. The Service: Rude and Overwhelmed....In general the staff has way too much going on it is hard to get a warm smile upon entering and asking for a table.... and the treatment of black patrons (my own experience and a few fam and friends is questionable....even by the black employees lol ) so we stopped by to try and have dinner and the waitress was rude so we approached Rodger to tell him what happened ... he hardly stopped what he was doing nor did he apologize or ask us to stay for our meal .... he did not care about loosing our business and since he does not care .... I will also keep my money. If you are in the area might be worth it for coffee/tea/pastries... or a brunch (slow service and loud). But they have definitely lost me and my family members as regulars..... as many service complaints as are posted you'd think they'd tighten up.... guess he's making too much money to care since the place is always packed.... There are some other nice options within a few blocks with much better food or $10-15
