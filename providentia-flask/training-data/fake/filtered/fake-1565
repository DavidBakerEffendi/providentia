This family restaurant is a wonderful place to eat out. Service here is great! They are polite, friendly and patient. They really make you feel welcome to the point you want to come back. The main reasons why I came back are their magnificent Fresh! Food and the many different Delicious! foods. Â I have to say, this restaurant being in Brooklyn has surprised me, when you taste the food it sends you to India. I will be going back for years to come and recommend it to anyone and everyone.
