I recently had a chance to try some of their food at  a luncheon I attended in verona and found the food to be not only fresh, but delicious. I checked out the website and ordered food the other nite. The order arrived in record time and all the food was packed professionally and EVERYTHING arrived  hot! Great quality compared to the other local chinese places. Definetly recommend!
