My wife & son & I ate here last week.  Had the shrimp rossini which was awesome, wife had pizza with goat cheese & portobello which she said she liked alot.  Son had mac and cheese which is made with penne or rigatoni?  But he ate it all up so that's good.  Had Peroni on tap, it was a little cool in there but we liked overall very much
