Took my daughter to Genteels this afternoon.  We usually get our pizza delievered so I'm not in the actual "restaurant" much.  It was 87 degrees and they only have the fan on.  The place is dark and dirty.  And no one is around to seat you, give you a menu or take your order.  I asked for a turkey sub with provolone.  No provolone.  American cheese is the only cheese they have.  Soda?  No diet in the refrigerator case but they have it in the back.  There is a very good reason why it's in the back.  It's expired and flat.  Better yet, he charged me for the whole can of flat expired soda and never gave me the whole can. Finally get our food and the "American" cheese is a Kraft single.  Processsed cheese!   I will never ever get food from this dump ever again!
