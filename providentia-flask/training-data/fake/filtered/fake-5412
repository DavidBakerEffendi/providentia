I can't imagine how anyone has ever left Matisse unhappy. I have been there countless times over 10 years and it never disappoints. It is the restaurant we compare all others to, and they almost always come up short. Inventive always changing menu, fabulous but not stuffy service, and BYOB. Not expensive when compared to other nice places with wine, and you can save 15% by paying cash all nights other than Saturday. As others have mentioned, while all the food is great, the crab cakes are spectacular. I have had many versions and they are all amazing, especially since I normally don't like them at all! Ignore the negative reviews. There are always people you can't please in the world. Visit for yourself, or don't- it is already tough to get reservations!
