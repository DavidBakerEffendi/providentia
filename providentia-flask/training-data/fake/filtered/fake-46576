Came here on a Friday night, with a 9:30 reservation for two in the summer. The place was packed however our table was waiting for us to my surprise. We were looking for a sexy environment to romance in candle light and got it here! The staff is laid back and knowledgeable about wines and dinner specials. It was nice not to feel hurried in any way and we did take our time. The drinks came quickly and we were brought complimentary crab salad on toast. I love unexpected complimentary stuff! The kitchen is open, tiny and very busy and makes for some entertainment it looked like the cooks were putting on a show for us. They have a big garden patio that is an after work scene but closes early for the neighbors.
