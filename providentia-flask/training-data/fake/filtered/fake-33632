Worst service ever! I arrived with a party of 12 for a corporate dinner. We over estimated and told the hostess to seat 14. They don't take reservations so we had to wait for a bit. No problem there we were waiting for 2 in our party to come in from the parking lot. We tell the hostess our party is there and we sit at our tables (Our party was too large for one table, so they set up a table of 10 and a table of 4.) So then she says that she'd like to consolidate the tables which is impossible because the table of 10 is a tight fit and she had told us previously, when we asked, that she could not add another table because there was no room. (So you can extra chairs to an already small table?!) Needless to say we told her that we'd be fine with the two tables. Now that we're seated the waitress says to us that our entire party isn't here because we have open seats. I tell her that two went to the bathroom and another colleague mentions that we have a party of 12 and not 14. Well then she says we've been "misled" and that their policy is to seat "whole" parties only. She said that because everyone wasn't together we would have to get up and go back to the waiting area until they are done in the bathroom before we can be seated again. You can imagine the reactions to that statement seeing as how we had already done our waiting and were already seated. Some of us were already eating chips and salsa as well! Of course we said surely you can let us slide for two people and consider the fact that 10 of us are already seated. But this woman just wouldn't budge! Another colleague of mine suggested to her that we would take our business elsewhere. She told us to go right ahead! She was SOOO rude! Needless to say this was my first and last time at this place!
