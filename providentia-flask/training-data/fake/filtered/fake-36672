PYT sounds like a good theory, but is a prime example of how far apart theory and reality can be. The truth about PYT is it draws wanna-be gangstas nappy, yeasty hipsters. On any given day you can see a bunch of them slumped over the so-called couches outside the store. Good practice for the future homeless. As for the food quality, the burger is decent (in a city with literally hundreds of great burgers on offer), but that's all I've tried so I'm not getting into that. The main point is I would not eat at/go back to PYT because of the crowd it draws.
