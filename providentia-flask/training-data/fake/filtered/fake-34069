I have to say, I am new to the Greek cuisine as I have always been an extremely picky eater.  I'm slowly starting to try more and more and have heard about this place.  I have now gone to their Edgewater location as well as Montclair and been very pleased with both.  We've tried so many of the dishes, some favorites that I highly recommend the Greek salad, all the dips (tzatzik, hummus, melitzanosalata), the zucchini and eggplant chips and the meatballs.  The chicken and lamb are both extremely flavorful.  I don't eat fish but my dad and brother both said it was amazing, so I'll take their word for that.  Other than the food, I've had great service at both locations as well as a great dining atmosphere.  I will definitely be back to Greek Taverna a lot!!
