This place was extremely awful. Totally over priced for each personal size pizza that resembles a cracker, got 10 pieces of fried calamari, the mozarella and carroza was totally boxed and was a mozarella stick shaped as a triangle. The pizza crust was burnt. The sausage was lousy, and the nutella pizza looked like a cookie! I would be totally mortified sending food like this to someone if this was my restaurant. I'm now ordering another dinner from somewhere else the same night because this was terrible and we are starving!
