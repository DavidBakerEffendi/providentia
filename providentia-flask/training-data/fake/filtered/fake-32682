DON'T GO! Â It was better in the 90's. 12-11-10 The Italian Antipasto salad had RANCID salami in it... three hours later, I'm vomiting and having diarrhea!!! And this was in their private party room where the volunteer firefighters were having their Christmas Party! Maybe they thought they could pass off some bad meat and serve enough pitchers of beer that the poor guys would think they were puking from drinking too much. No way, that's bad news... many people commented the sausage was bad too!!
