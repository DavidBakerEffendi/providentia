Me and 16 of my family member ate here last Sunday and it is now Wednesday and we are still talking about how good everything was at Estia. Â Tha barbounia fish had to be the most delicious fish that I ever had, the service was wonderful the only problem is that we all ate way too much and could barely make it back to the cars!! cant wait to go back!!
