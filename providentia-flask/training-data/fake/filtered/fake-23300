The freshest  sushi/sashimi in town. Lunchboxes are of superb quality for a reasonable price. (Fried sweet potato is the killer) Purple rice (more like "brown rice" except that it's literally purple) is used for all dishes which really stood out from the rest of the sushi places for its aesthetic and nutritional values. Free, steamy miso soups served even before the appetizers  psyke u up for the upcoming sushi fest. Some might argue the entrees could be a bit pricy but they are worth every penny for i had never tasted fresher fish with better texture, at least around here. A variety of Korean dishes are offered as well; you can ask the chef for details for the owner/chef is a nice, friendly gentleman of Korean descent. Don't miss out on the opportunity to have an aunthetic taste of Korea/Japan right in the center of New Haven!
