I could not be happier that this restaurant has Â opened in Greenpoint. I love shell fish and this area has been lacking in seafood choices. The place (former Lamb & Jaffey) is tastefully decorated (ie;not of the 70's, 80"s an 90"s and the owner is a local! I only had the lobster roll and bisque but both were extremely fresh and did not skimp on pieces of lobster. I plan on returning for brunch but will also visit for early dinner on occasion.. If you enjoy seafood run on over to Lobster Joint.
