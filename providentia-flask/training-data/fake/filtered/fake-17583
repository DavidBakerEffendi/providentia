This place is awesome, and I am extremely lucky to be living close enough to this place to have them deliver to me. We went the other night and the pizza margarita was fabulous.  I specifically asked for it hot and not soggy.  The reason was that the one time before, it was.  I am guessing the one bad time was an exception.,  Luzzo's is the best. But from now on, I'm asking for it hot and crisp. I definitely suggest checking out this pizza joint when you have a chance. Definitely not to be missed!
