Just had dinner on Friday night. Reservation was made a week in advance. My girlfriend and I arrived shortly before 8. We waited around for 5 minutes or so before we were seated. It was fairly crowded, but not terribly noisy. It is sort of small as one might expect if you visit many individually owned restaurants in Philly. The host, waiter and server were all very nice and attentive. Water glasses were full, plates were cleared promptly and the food was served quickly. It was BYOB and there were no extra charges like opening the bottle or anything like that. In fact, my girlfriend ordered the alfredo thinking that she ordered the special. The waiter was overly apologetic (because it was her mistake, not the waiter). My girl said that she would eat what was served (which she commented was very good), but the waiter returned anyway moments later with the plate that she has wanted and did not charge us for it. Â On top of that, we declined the coffee, tea, dessert option at the end of our meal and they still brought out a small dish of tiramisu free of charge. As far as customer service goes, they went way above and beyond in many aspects. They have placards from some food rating group showing that they won the customer service award consecutive years going back to 2010 and I can see why. As for the food, we ordered a sweet italian sausage appetizer, which was very good. I had the gnocchi with beef and I thoroughly enjoyed it. There is not a whole lot to say about food other than that it everything I had was very good and my girlfriend also enjoyed everything. I definitely plan to go back in to the city specifically to eat here again.
