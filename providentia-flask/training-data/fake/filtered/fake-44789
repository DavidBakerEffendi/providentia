After waiting bout 30 minutes to sit after our reservation we were told the kitchen is "backed up" and the waiter would come back to take our order in a little bit.  We then asked for bread and he said he normally brings that out when he takes our order....Seriously..wtf.  Food was incredibly average at best.  Also we sat upstairs and the bathroom literally has a couch in it, most likely covered in urine since it is about an inch from the toilet.  We sat next to a window and the blinds looked like they hadnt been dusted in a few years.  Also their new years decorractions were still up.  Would never go back.
