Our friends just recommended this gem and we went there today for brunch. I think this was the best french toast ever. And I know a lot about french toast! My husband had the chicken sandwich and raved. Then we splurged with two desserts. Creme brûlée and a  heavenly Halva concoction. Wonderful! The service was great and very personable. The decor is bright with big windows on two sides. In the summer they will open wide. It should be great then too and we will be back.
