I have never liked pomme frites till I came to this place. My friends were raving about this spot and I was pretty apprehensive about this spot, but I am glad they took me here. Hot double fried fries with cheese curds and gravy? yes please (poutine style) got to love the canadians for this concoction. If I were pregnant, I'd fly to pomme frites in ny to get this delicious fried goodness
