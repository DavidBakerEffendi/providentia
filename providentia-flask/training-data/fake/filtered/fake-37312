wonderful. been here twice. food is amazing and presented well. food is excellent and excellent value. A burger with fries and side salad included, all delicious is 10 bucks. Staff are attentive and welcoming. Beer is a bit pricey, and it can be tricky to tell what is on special. I will still be back often.
