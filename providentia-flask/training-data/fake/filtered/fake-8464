Went here for the first time and I tried the garlic bomb, now something called the garlic bomb should have a ton of flavor, which it did.  The roll was perfect and the fried garlic cloves made this sandwich extremely tasty.  Next time I go, I plan on getting the Charlie Brown.   I also went with a few people from work who tried the ghost pepper sandwich.  It always a little strange when they make you sign a waiver before eating anything but they did for that sandwich.  For anyone who loves heat, then this sandwich would be good for them.
