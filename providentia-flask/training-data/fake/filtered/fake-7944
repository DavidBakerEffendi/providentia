I ate here with my 6 best friends right before we graduated last week. It was quiet on a Tuesday around 4 pm and the staff was attentive and very congratulatory towards us. We ordered a round of blueberry mojitos and they were SO good. We ordered the blue cheese garlic bread and quickly ordered more of it because it was unlike anything we had had before. There was outside seating, a raw oyster bar and one of the managers told me that there would be music and a fire pit later that night..definitely an awesome summer spot with friends.
