I was very disappointed with a recent brunch experience. It was very busy and service lacked quite a bit. (We didn't get our drinks until our meals. The coffee never came. The attitude was cool and disaffected.) I would give Freeman's another chance, most likely for dinner or a snack at the bar. But a warning: if you're hungry, don't get the salad. For $12, it was tiny and uninspiring. Think of a child's handful of lettuce leaves, four grapes sliced in half, and three walnuts. (My companion felt similarly about her eggs.) Fortunately, my experience was somewhat redeemed by the manager who took my salad off the bill. OCCUPY SALAD BOWL!
