Black Crescent is my new favorite bar! The drinks and food are amazing and the service is great. It's easy to become a regular with all the delicious cocktails, wine list and small plates. You feel cozy and welcome the second  you walk in the door. The Peruvian Ceviche is my favorite dish. I've never had anything like it.  The have happy hour cocktails and $1 oysters from 6-8 and $1 oysters again from 12-1 which is great for people who work in the industry. I would definitely recommend to friends and family. You won't regret it!
