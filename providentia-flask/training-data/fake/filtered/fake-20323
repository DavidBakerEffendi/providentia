for the price it was "meh".  $55 (before tip) got us three rolls, they DIDNT have the most popular (and best) sake they serve... It's called Sake Cafe... and they were out of good sake... Our waitress barely understood a word of english and could not make a comment for or against any of the sakes or dishes/rolls.  I would have been happy if she could even indicate what was better or worse but she couldnt.  Pretty sad for a slightly more expensive than normal Sushi place. If I ever go there again and theyre out of what I want or cant understand my order verbally, I would just walk out.
