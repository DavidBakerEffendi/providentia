Way overpriced.  Two of us had a croque monsieur (thin slice of ham, thin slice of cheese) -- basically grilled ham and cheese -- with a small underdressed salad, plus one iced coffee and one glass of water.  $31 for the 2 of us, which means (with tip) about $18 per person.  Rip-off.  Nice waitress, however.
