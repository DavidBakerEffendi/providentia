Bakehouse is that restaurant youve come to the west village for but hasn't existed since Florent was driven out by rent inflation. In this quaint-gone-chic neighborhood Bakehouse brings back a sense of home for its neighbors or visitors. Their lattes are the best in the neighborhood. Try the quiche and pastries. My one-year old daughter goes to bed saying "cookies" after an afternoon here.
