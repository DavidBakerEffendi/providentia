Great new West Philly hangout! Place is bright and comfortable, very simple yet nicely decorated. Coffee and espressos here are really good, so if you're a caffeine junkie, this is your spot. The pastries are all really tasty- the buttery coffee cake will melt in your mouth, and the strawberry jam filled carrot cake is a unique must-have. Great breakfast options like bagels/eggs/croissants/parfaits and a really nice looking oatmeal that's finished off with a blowtorch. Soups are warm and hearty for the cold winter months, and if you want an amazing snack for any time, make sure to get some warm pita and Renata's homemade Hummus or Baba-Ganouj. You will not regret it. If you love the idea of good food and a relaxing environment in West Philly, you should try it.
