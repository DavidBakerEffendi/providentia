I made a surprise random decision visit for my smoothie craving - I'm SO glad I did! Greg the owner is an incredible guy and I had a pleasant afternoon hanging out with the staff and other customers. I'll be back again and again. The soup of the day and smoothie were delicious ! Such a friendly and positive atmosphere .
