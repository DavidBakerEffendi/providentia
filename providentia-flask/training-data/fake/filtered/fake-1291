Mexican Post has the best Mexican food in the Plainsboro area!! The food is always excellent and very efficiently prepared, as well as very competitively priced. As a vegetarian I really appreciate all the vegetable and tofu options they have! I would say it is even better than Chipotle!! (Which is a huge compliment as far as I'm concerned).
