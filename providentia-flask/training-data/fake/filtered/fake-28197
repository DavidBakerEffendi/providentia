A great breakfast sandwich to go is so hard to find in Montclair. I'm a native New Yorker and miss the ability to grab a sausage, egg, and cheese from places that don't expect you to stay.  I have had several menu items from Mac Attack so I was already a fan. Then I found out they do breakfast 7 days/week.  Finally satisfied my desire to try one this morning. Loved it!  They can work a little faster but this isn't NYC after all so I'm spoiled. But the sandwich was delicious!  Hit the spot and let me do what I do best, move on to the next thing.  A great breakfast sandwich to go has finally arrived in Montclair.
