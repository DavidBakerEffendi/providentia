Fantastic place! We were in NYC for 4 days and ate at Juniors 3 times:) The first time I got the "something a little different", which was a giant ball of delicious beef brisket sandwiched between two huge potato pancakes with a side of au jus and applesauce. DELICIOUS! If only I had been able to eat all of it, it was just too much because I saved room to share an ice cream shake, also delicious. (we ended up getting shakes every time). It was very reasonably priced considering the area and there were a lot of choices on the menu, and again, great desserts:)
