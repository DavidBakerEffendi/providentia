This place is a wonderful, authentic, charming little hidden gem. I've lived in Kearny for over two years now and always gone to Hoboken for a good Italian sandwich. Luckily today i discovered Appetizzio's and have to say it blows all those Hoboken delis out of the water. The people who worked there were super friendly, and the food was both fresh and delicious. They even gave us some garlic bread to try out. I will most certainly be back.
