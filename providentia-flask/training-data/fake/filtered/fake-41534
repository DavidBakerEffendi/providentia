In the short time since it has opened, Amelie has become a favorite.   It's a very nice space, modern but  still warm and comfortable.   They offer 70+well-chosen  wines by the glass as well as a 300+ bottle list.   They also have great happy hour specials including a flight of any 3 wines-by-the glass for $10!   That has to be the best deal on wine in Manhattan.  Though the menu is relatively small, the food is very authentic French, well priced and absolutely everything (and we literally have tried everything) is delicious.  But what really sets Amelie apart is the people who work there.   Everyone;  from the owner ,Sammy to the bartenders Joen and Oivier to all the waiters ---all are sincerely friendly, warm and welcoming.  At the end of our first visit, we felt as if we had made a group of new friends.  And by the second visit, we were literally greeted with open arms.  And talking with other customers, they all feel the same way.   I actually can't say enough good things about the place.   Great food, great wine and some of the best hospitality anywhere.   Wish I could give them more than 5 stars!
