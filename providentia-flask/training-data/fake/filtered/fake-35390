Food is really good but the prices are a bit high. They also haven't done much to reinvent themselves. This place got so many accolades in the past for being such a fantastic restuarant but I feel like Astoria's restaurant district has grown so much since then and they definetely have more competition if they want to be number one. The place is also super dark and there isn't ample waiting area in the front entrance. it's definetly worth trying out.
