I've ordered the Krab Rangoon, which is one of their appetizers. Best thing that I ever tasted in my life. Their combination platter has a lot of taste. I kinda want to order more of their selections but I got too full. The staff are friendly too. If you're in the area, I recommend to check this place out.
