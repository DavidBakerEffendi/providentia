Gross! I had my first cheesesteak at Pat's today (I'm new to Philly) and was bitterly disappointed. The guy at the window actually wasn't so bad, didn't feel like I was in "Soup Nazi" territory. But the quality of the cheesesteak (I had one 'wit' with cheese whiz) was a complete letdown. The meat was pretty dry and tough, because it had been sitting for a while. It was in the middle of the afternoon, so no lines... that might be different when there's more business. The cheese whiz was ok, and the bread was actually good. BUT the quality of the meat was AWFUL - disgusting, with lots of pieces of gristly fat in between. It almost made me puke... I have no idea how Pat's came to have this reputation. Never again! BTW, I liked Steaks on South a lot better! Go there if you are looking for a good cheesesteak. They make them fresh, so you're not in for nasty surprises like at Pat's.
