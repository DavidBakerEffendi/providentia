Let's be clear- the Ivy is a dive bar. It wouldn't be complete without the townies, crazy night, and dark corners! I moved to Princeton about 3 months ago, and the Ivy is one of my favourite things about my new home. It's where my roommates and I will go for a drink, it's where my friends and I go to sing karaoke, and it's where I go when I know that I will have a fun time. Whether you are talking to a new friend, an old friend, or Justin and Corbett behind the bar, you are destined to have a good memory (if you have any at all!) To the yelper who wrote that the Ivy was being selective about who does and doesn't get to come inside based on what they look like: I think you were confused. You were probably at an eating club, or a night club. So long as you are 21 and not wasted, you'll get into the Ivy. Sure- It's not the fanciest bar in town. Since when is that the standard that all bars must strive for? I think it's GREAT to have a reliable place that boasts a clientele of all sorts, where you can share a drink with a friend. Thanks Richie for being the owner of my fav place in town! See you tonight!
