So the new garden is open and it's an amazing little space to enjoy your meal.  HOWEVER, I must warn others about the new avocado crostini.  The spicy avocado crostini with goat cheese is just gross.  The spice completely overwhelmed the avocado and goat cheese and from what little I could detect of those ingredients I don't think the flavors meshed well at all.  I am disappointed that I did not let my waiter know that, contrary to his belief, it is not "the best thing in the world".  It's the only item I have ever ordered and not loved so I don't want people to go ordering it out of curiosity and being disappointed too.  That being said- everything else there is still fantastically good.
