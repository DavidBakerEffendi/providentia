I just had lunch here yesterday..........yummy!    The food is very good and very fresh; the menu is fun and full of things I want to try soon and often and the staff is very friendly and helpful.   But the first thing that hit me when I walked in the door was cleanliness!   The owners obviously care and work hard so that their customers are comfortable and satisfied.    Definately a place I will be heading to again and again.
