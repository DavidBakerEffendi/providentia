I just recently checked out El Camino with a few friends, and had a great time! There was a little bit of a wait for a table, but Elaine the bartender promptly set us up with beers, so it was hardly noticeable. They had Sixpoint Righteous Rye on tap which I was really excited about. We were sat outside with Deva, and couldn't have asked for a more personable waitress. She was the perfect mix of cheeky and professional. I love when I can find a staff willing to toe the line of propriety to entertain me and my inappropriate friends. ;) The beer selection was great, the margaritas were the perfect level of tart, and two notable items were the duck confit nachos and the seitan chiles rellenos. All in all a delicious experience.
