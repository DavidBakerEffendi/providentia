This tour was a BLAST! Scott is a man infused with passion for pizza -- he has gone deep on his research and has amassed a wealth of knowledge about the subject. We hit pizzerias in Manhattan and two boroughs, riding around in a yellow school bus, all the while Scott explaining the finer points of pizza, and asking us what we thought of the various slices in what became some interesting conversations. The slices were all great (and quite varied) and the vibe was fun. Scott is warm, hilarious and knowledgeable, but what stuck with me the most is how *excited* he was about pizza. That excitement made the whole experience that much more fun -- that, and the groovy pizza jams we listened to in the bus. (He also played some Rush, as a nod to our Canadian contingent -- I'm sure that's optional.) This tour was totally a highlight of our trip, and would definitely recommend it. You'll walk away happy, and you might never look at pizza again quite the same way.
