I used to be a neighbor of theirs and be there ALL of the time, I have recently moved and I literally have shed tears. The food here is great and especially the Edamame burger, I like to think of myself as a veggie burger expert.. and this one is the best. With a cucumber yogurt sauce and picked onions and cucumbers on top with a side of the WW house salad! Sooo yummy! The bartender Chris is great too, great personality for a neighborhood bar where making friends is the key! Great rotating draft lists and bottles too! Every time I am in the Italian market it is here for dinner and then 12 Steps for Karaoke!!
