Ok if you are Â interested in very bad service and ghetto waitressing then have at it I had a horrible experience while I was there two customers at different tables sent their food back twice please don't even think about doing karaoke there the host is trying to become a star so he does more songs then the people who come to support his show and buy food and drinks it was so disappointing when you try to support black establishment Don't Waste You Time
