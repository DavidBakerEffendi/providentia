This is probably going to lose me a few friends, but I had a my first pats steak this past week..And it was good..But I think the "King" title is more myth and legend then reality.. Its sparce and average..Pretty much anything covered in that much whiz and decent bread is going to be ok...Feels more like a ritual then really going there for quality of the cheesesteak..Ive had better..Ive had worse
