Authentic chinese food place and the food was pretty good but slightly overpriced.  However, the service was less than desirable.  The food came out in a timely fashion but we saw another couple who came in with us who didn't get their food till we were done.  We went on Sunday evening and the place was pretty packed.  There was only 1 waiter for the whole front section.  He was always on the move going as fast as he can but still overwhelmed.  The manager was helping also.  After we ate we spent 10 minutes trying to get someones attention to refill our drinks only to wait another 15 minutes to get our drinks.  They charge $1.50 for fountain refills in a small cup that is mostly filled with ice.  You probably only get 6 oz of drink.
