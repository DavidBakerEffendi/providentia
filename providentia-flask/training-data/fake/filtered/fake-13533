I live around the corner so I'll chime in and say how amazing it is to have a place near my house. I like the decor and the drinks. But I too am conflicted. Is it a bar or a restaurant? There is a difference between the two. My main comment is the food. The catfish has too much mayo and too much bread. Also the plate for it is too small. It can barely hold the sandwich and the lettuce. It is pricey but they're going to be able to get people to pay those prices so no need to quibble on that. The full menu is coming next week so I'm curious to see that. I think it will just be a drink place for me though.
