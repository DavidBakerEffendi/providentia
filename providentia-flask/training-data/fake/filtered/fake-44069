I am writing this review as I am eating one of their amazing buffalo chicken rolls! Pier 76 is a great spot! The food, drinks, and staff are absolutely amazing!  From their pizza, to entrees, appetizers to drinks I don't have one complaint about anything from this restaurant. Pier 76 has made a regular customer out of me. Anytime  I go there I leave very satisfied!  Also reasonably priced and in a great location!
