My experience here was not good. Our waitress was very slow. The food overall was awful. I had a veggie burger which was very mushy, blah. My husband had the Ten Stone Burger which he says tasted like a brillo pad. Our appetizers were good. I had the three cheese fritters and he had wings which we both enjoyed. I had a ginger ale that was very flat. If I returned it would be for the fritters alone or for a couple beers. This place left a lot to be desired. It is very unlikely that I will return.
