My wife and I pick up sandwiches from iMunch on a pretty regular basis.  I'm pretty sure that between the two of us, we've had every sandwich on the menu and it's always a hard decision what to get.  The VG panini is a GREAT Breakfast option. We love iMunch.  The space upstairs is very nice to sit back and relax.
