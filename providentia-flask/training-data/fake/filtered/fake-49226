In town for business and linden has a nice plaza. Went to chevy for drinks but i dont like their food. Then went to applebee for appetizer to do a time track. Then went for sushi because my intern loves it. The place is decorated with nice interior. The places is busy and the sound level is workable. I went there saturday and sunday for lunch and it was pack. Being pack you still respected and treated with great service. The british sushi guy made my lunch with a roll i never had. He called it "Your momma got saucy". Will come back again.I wonna try the bbq table next time i go.
