I went there for dinner last night after not dining there for a number of years. The food was terrible and very pricey for the quality of food that was served. The steak tasted like shoe leather, and the broccoli had seen much better days. I will not return there again for dinner.I don't know what happened to this place but I can't imagine how you can stay in business with just a bar crowd.
