I bought a hamburger the other day here.  The real Greek Lady and  her son run the restaurant.  They were both there running the restaurant when I came in.  After I got the burger  and went back to my office I realized they hadn't put the burger patty in the sandwich.  I took the sandwich back.  The Greek Lady took the still cooking patty off the grill and put it in the bread and gave it back.  No apology.  No alternative offer to make it fresh or give me my money back. Nothing- no words- period. After years of bad service and bad attitudes I am done.  I will not  go back here.  If you like cashiers who roll their eyes when you walk in, rude condescending service, and angry staff this is the place for you.  Enjoy and Bon Apetit.
