I really liked this place, I got the health kick focus without being kitschy.  A lot of juice bars try hard to play on Newark. I finally looked on Yelp to see if they served food, They have a unique selection Pizza, Burger, sandwiches etc.  Their special seem freshest So I recommend those. This eating place space square measure therefore clean and nice, sitting arrangement sensible. Its dedicated Lebanese place, through its missing a couple of things that will build it an outstanding geographic area eating place. The standard of Pizza and Burger nice and Yummy. Service is very fast which you order. You can get enjoy with beer, cold coffee, tea and  musics. My family prefer to come at this place because they love this restaurant.........
