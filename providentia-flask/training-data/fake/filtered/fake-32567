Wow.  If you want to try real, delicious, NYC Halal, go here.  It's a must.  I tried the chicken and lamb platter.  The lamb and chicken were both very juicy, flavorful, and thoroughly cooked unlike most Halal carts in NYC.  The rice actually had a taste to it and was more than just a filler.  The white sauce is better than most halal carts.  Not only is the serving size huge (I coulnd't finish my platter with a decent amount left over), but the platters come with a couple triangle pieces of pita, something that costs extra at most halal carts.  The platter is still only $6, and it will more than fill you up with delicious food.  TRY IT!
