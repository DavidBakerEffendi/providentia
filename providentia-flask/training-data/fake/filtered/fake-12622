here we go.... We all join yelp when we are compelled to review. So, i will make it quick as it is only compelling enough to give this review 5 mins of my time. Dismal Food, Disgusting service and super rude & dumb staff who can't tell the difference between a gamay & a beuajolais to top off the delays! In the end, when the brilliant server asked us "how was it" (after waiting an hour for 3 apps, 1 mains & a horribly disgusting salad, which apparently had to come all at once), we told her "hmmm the gratin was great!" only to have her walk away from the table of unfinished food....What can I say - PRICELESS!
