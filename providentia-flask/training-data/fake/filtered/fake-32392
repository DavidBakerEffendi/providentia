I've made my last order at Rustica.  1 large pie with 2 toppings and 1 small with 3.  $44 plus tip for delivery.  These had to be the worst pies I've ordered so far.  Despite the OK toppings, the overall taste of both pies was very bland.  I had kept hoping that each time I ordered, I would love the pizza (based on a lot of the Yelp reviews), but this was the case.  I'm going back to Gianfrancos.
