This jam is the shizz-nizzle........`nuff said!!   Well, okay, maybe that's not enough.  See, no matter where you search throughout the slowly redeveloping dowtown area in Newark, the quality of food being offered will not compare with this "fresh as can be" locale owned and operated by the sweetest young lady this side of Raymond Boulevard (the freckles are what do me in, personally). For the cost incurred by an average visitor - say, about $10 - the quality and, usually, the portions are not only excellent, they satisfy more tastefully and more healthfully than anything else available nearby. Lastly, have you had the brownies?!  Holy sh*t......have the f*ckin' brownies, wouldja?  Seriously, man.  No joke. Now go!!
