My husband and I dined here on Thursday for the first time and our experience was excellent. Our waitress was extremely helpful, knew the menu very well and also knew all the specials by memorization (which we were very impressed by seeing how detailed they were). The food was spectacular. Great portions for a great price. We definitely will be returning.
