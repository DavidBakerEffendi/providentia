GUYS. I rarely order takeout because I'm admittedly That Girl when everyone in the office starts placing the Seamless order--Oh, they only have white bread? Hm. No, I still don't eat meat. Oh, tomato on my grilled cheese? No, it'll be soggy. Still, I tried the Belly's Grilled Cheese. This place has serious ingredients--Meunster AND Provolone? Ok!--and excellent execution--cheese melted on either side to keep the *black pepper & rosemary compound butter seared* wholegrain bread crispy? Yes, please! And tomato and/or bacon, if you want, for $1. Pretty great overall prices, too, esp for Manhattan. AND a decently sized portion of their satisfyingly hearty house tomato soup. Oh, and another thing: I was unwrapping the small bit of toast to dip in my soup when I realized it wasn't toast, but A SURPRISE COOKIE. I usually decline cookies, but I'm just feeling pretty great about this whole order. Best part: my low-maintenance friends all ordered the same thing and we're all respectively loving it.
