Tibetan food shows a major influence of Indian and Chinese methods of cooking but Yak in the other hand shows no type of excellence. i read many reviews of yak before going to eat there and thought the food would be mind blowing. i was very disheartened because i was looking for real tibetan food which reminded me of my home land. the food Chayley also known as beef tongue tasted stale and gummy. the rest of meal was very spicy and very oily or shall i say very greasy i had to order atleast 5 sodas because it was spicy. Â i know that the food is suppose to be spicy but if its to spicy the flavor of the food becomes spoiled and you cant enjoy the meal. waiters and waitress were everywher they seem to be lost but friendly. it took them about 30 min's just for them to bring out my soup. which tasted like milk and corn being warmed up . the decoration wasn't that bad. but i feel like they should reduce the spice and cook fresh food and not be giving customers stale food. after all we are paying for the food and i don't want to pay for a food that i have chances of getting sick with. the music or live band was very annoying it sounded like someone crying. they should try tib chants or inspiration songs that are more likely to smooth customers. i think i'll go back if ever decide to eat oily and very spicy food. but as for now i don't think so.
