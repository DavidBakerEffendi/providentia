I really like the Verona Inn, they have a solid beer selection and some great bar food.  If you're looking for a 5 star dining experience, go elsewhere.   But if you are looking for a great spot that has some good food, good drinks, and a lively atmosphere, VI is a great choice.  It's a great change up from the Cloverleaf.  Burgers are awesome and although the fries are sold separately, they are big portions with great options.  I highly recommend VI.
