I have been getting coffee from the genius to go window since they opened and finally went for brunch here yesterday. The place was absolutely slammed but we didn't have to wait too long for a table. I had the pancakes with ricotta and my friend had the chicken sand which she def loved. The server I had was super nice considering how busy the place was. Iam a huge fan of their coffee & think this place is such an awesome cafe to have in greenpoint. Oh and I love the park location.
