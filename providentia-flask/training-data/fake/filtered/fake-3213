I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!  My boyfriend and I go there often and we always enjoy the Rodizo and blue sangria!!! Everything in this restaurant is amazing!!!  From the food to the decor right down to the friendly staff, this is my FAVORITE place!!! If you are looking for a nice evening for 2 or a fun atmosphere for a party, this is the place to be!  I have also been there celebrating New Years two year in a row. I can assure you and who ever you dine with will LOVE it here!!!
