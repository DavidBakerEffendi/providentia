Came for Saturday brunch around 12:30. There were about 4 different groups there. Nice for a budget brunch. Options are limited but you definitely get enough food to fill you. We ordered omelettes so they came with a small salad and fries. The wild mushroom omelette was delicious, but not gonna lie, I was a little skeptical about whether they used real eggs or not. Fries were amazing! so we ordered an extra side. Coffee was average. Salad was really yum too. Staff was nice. Offered to refill coffee after we paid the bill. Checked on us. Very small place so do not come with a group. The rating might be on the low side but I would recommend it and go again if I were nearby.
