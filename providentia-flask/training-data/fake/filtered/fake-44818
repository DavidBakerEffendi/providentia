My friends and I go out every other month, to eat. Usually The Belmount Tavern. We thought to try someplace new. The food was really, really awful. Fish old, steak devoid of taste and these were the specials. The waiter had the eight plates of food rotating around the table and kept asking who gets what . The took an hour to arrive after the appetizers had long been gone. Avoid this place like the plague. I'm a chef of long standing and stature. Danger Will Robinson!
