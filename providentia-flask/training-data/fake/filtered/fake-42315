The first thing that caught my attention when I walked through the door was how packed this place was. I know large crowds are to be expected pretty much anywhere you go in Times Square, but it still caught me a little off guard. Once we were seated, our waiter came over to our table and asked if there was still a member of our group with a gluten allergy. Everyone in my party was impressed with this because our reservation was made several months in advance. There were three couples in our party, so we decided to order one dish per couple that we would share with the group. Our choices were the house salad, the veal saltimbocca, and a pasta special that included rigatoni, lasagna and possibly the best cheese ravioli I've ever had. The portions were huge and the food in general was good but not great. I'm not sure that I would visit again, but only because I don't live in NY and there are so many different places that I want to try every time I visit. I would definitely recommend going there at least once, though, especially if you're with a large group.
