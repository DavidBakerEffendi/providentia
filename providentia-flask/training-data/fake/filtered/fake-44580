I called ahead to make a reservation but was told by the male phone host that Locanda Verde are full until 2057 but...that I could show up when they open and get a walk-in table for which they save a few. Planning to go there for my birthday and I showed up on a freezing cold holiday-week Tuesday at 5:30pm. To an empty room! An empty room. (Can I say again all the tables were vacant)? To be told that they had no table for a party of three until 9:30pm. Another couple showed up behind us got the same chilly smug reception. And with a parting gift of wisdom from the female hostesses that perhaps we should all go to the Tribeca Grill (folks in-the-know understand why they try and funnel extra diners to that mediocre dinosaur of christmas past). Nice Try hostess ladies. DO THE WORLD A FAVOR AND BOYCOTT THIS "TO HIP FOR THOU" bulls**t eatery called Locanda Verde. Um...also, the foyer smelled funny. Like gas leak and butane funny. Never eat in a place that smells funny. Rule number one.
