The tapas were to die for. I highly suggest getting some wine and tapas. It was the show that came with my dinner I could do without. A female manager started yelling at a young male employee in the main area of the restaurant. Please, if you want to be a classy place then show some class. Do NOT yell at employees in front of people. I honestly would never go back there. I do not like to go to places that treat people so poorly. If you have an issue with your staff, take them aside, it is common sense and courteous to your customers. Also, maybe your wait staff would be happier and more attentive if they weren't getting yelled at by their boss in front of people. I am a female retail manager, and seeing that woman made me so angry. She gives other female managers a bad reputation like we don't know how to do business. Sorry, I know better to address issues then in front of a customer.
