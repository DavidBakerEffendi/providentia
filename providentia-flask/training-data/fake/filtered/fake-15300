You will probably be fooled and enjoy yourself. The food is overrated. Vegetable soup completely bland. service is rushed. Plop everything on the table and then forget about you. And having a long wait to get in, which is understandable because it's a busy place, but to completely skip over us and then squeeze three of us onto a table for two so that I'm awkwardly facing all the other tables down the line? Despicable.
