dont get the hype. waiters/host all nice. But pizza IS NOT the best in the city; portions of other food are small. One pizza, one glass of red wine (for one person)=/$26 bucks--not my idea of a good or a gourmet deal. I'm a long time neighborhood person--these guys must have a big friendship network.
