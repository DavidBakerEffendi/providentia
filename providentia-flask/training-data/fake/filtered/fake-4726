Absolutely love the atmosphere, as I usually do when I'm in any of Starr's establishments.  Bright, colorful, loud and exciting decorations cover the place from top to bottom, including an old-school black&white photo booth that while I don't really understand it's placement in this restaurant, I still love that it exists.  Bathrooms are a blast - one of the best trips to the loo that I've had in Philly. The food is great - not the *best* Mexican in the city, but certainly up there.  With this said, they do have the best rare tuna dishes I've ever had.  Their mahi mahi is fair to good, as are their salsa and dips.  The tortilla chips are delicious, and make up for the sometimes-bland (or slightly lacking) dips. Margaritas are good - also not the best, but up there as well.  They tend to have a slight kick - not a flavor kick, but a slightly strong alcoholic aftertaste.  I wouldn't guess that this means they're extra strong, just lacking slightly in the triple sec and lime.  They taste great, but could use a slight adjustment. I'll keep coming.  Never had a bad experience, always enjoyed my company and the ambiance.
