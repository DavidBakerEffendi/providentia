My friend and I both live in this Harlem neighborhood and decided to meet for dinner and sample one of the many local eateries that have popped up in the area in the last year. We decided on Blvd Bistro on the corner of 122nd and Lenox. First, the diningroom looks great, feels like an old Irish pub, very warm and homey. Service is great. Wait staff and even the chef came by the table multiple times to make sure everything was good. But most importantly, the food was amazing. We shared the beef short rib taco starter- comes with 2 nice size tacos. So yummy I regretted not getting my own order of 2. My friend had the pork chop. I'm not into the thick cut pork chops myself, but I had a taste and it was tender and juicy and flavorful. I had the pan fried chicken- this was some of the best fried chicken I have ever had. A boneless breast piece and a drumstick. Fried just right, and the coating was the bomb! It comes with delicious collard greens and potato salad, but I got garlic mashed potatoes instead. I normally would take half of a meal like that home, but it was so good I forced myself to stuff it all down in one sitting. Everything was so good I just had to try a dessert, knowing I'd end up taking most of it home, I was so full. I settled on the apple cobbler with cinnamon ice cream. It was piping hot- PIPING- but yummy and the ice cream was especially good. Had the remainder of the cobbler for lunch today and was reminded how much I enjoyed my meal there, so I popped onto Yelp to try to spread the word. I want these good new places to stick around and Blvd Bistro is one of the good ones. And the staff/chef really seem to care about the place. Not sure if it's a family business, but it has that feel. 5 stars! Oh, I almost forgot- the biscuits! Their free bread is a pair of the yummiest "like your grandmama made" biscuits with some kind of syrup butter (ask for an extra)!!!
