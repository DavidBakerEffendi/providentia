Best Burger and fries that I have ever had anywhere! I was just visiting my daughter in Philly this weekend and it was "a must try it" on her list of places to eat for me! So glad she did! Burger was perfection....not sure what type of bun they used but I loved it! And spicy fries were also amazing! Great seasoning for fries!
