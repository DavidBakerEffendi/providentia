A group of 6 of us went to Karma today for lunch.  Included in the group were several adults from India, so I am relying on their comments for part of this review. First, we arrived at 11:30 which is when the restaurant opens for lunch.  The door was open and we were seated (in the very back which turned out to be a good spot close to the buffet).  We could easily hear one another until other guests crowded the room; that happened starting at noon.   Second, they were still putting food on the buffet when we arrived, so we had to wait about 10 minutes to start filling our plates. The Indians in our group started ordering various breads.  I am not sure if other tables received these breads (I was not paying attention), but they were good. The wait staff is not that fast at removing dirty dishes.  There was plenty of staff; they just were not paying attention.  They were also a bit slow filling empty or near empty water glasses. Now to the food.  It was clearly fresh and varied, but my Indian friends said it was just so-so.  On a scale of 1-10 they gave it a 4-5 (hence my 2 out of 5 star rating here).  They said it was not authentic Indian food.  They did praise the dessert, a custard with fruit in it.  Often it is too sweet, and this one was sweetened to perfection; I must admit it was good. The team compared the lunch at Karma with a lunch they had a few weeks ago at Inde Blue.  Yelp customers give Inde Blue a 4.5 star rating, but my friends were not impressed.  They were even less impressed with Karma.
