Absolutely hands down the best italian food my wife and i have ever had...and we've been everywhere EXCEPT Italy :-) The manager/host/server John made us feel right at home...he even bought a copy of my album! (I'm a musician on tour from Raleigh NC). Anyway, i highly recommend this place. Its a little off the beaten path but believe me when i say it is so so SO worth it.
