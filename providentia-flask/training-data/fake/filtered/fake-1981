Ambiance is reminiscent of French Colonial Vietnam, much more refined than any other of its kind in Philadelphia, and it's conveniently located in Chinatown.  However, the food is unauthentic and caters more to the American palate.  Some might even say it's a bastardization of the real thing.  But hey, that's what happens when a cultural product, even food, becomes popular.  Just look at  what some of the Italian-American establishments in South Philly try to pass off as Italian food.   If you're interested in having something closer to the real thing, check out Nam Phuong  at 11th and Washington.
