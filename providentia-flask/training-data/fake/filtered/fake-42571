Today I thought to take an adventure, I decided to go to The Moshulu for the Sunday Brunch! Wow! What a delight. First let me say, it was easy to find, but the parking lot is set up that you have to pay $12. No problem. When I entered, I was immediately greeted and observed all types of desserts on the table. I waited to be seated, which took a few minutes. I was seated next to a large window that I had a beautiful view of the water and boats. My date/waiter Chris, was attentive, friendly, nice, accommodating, and a wealth of information. The staff there were wonderful! I started off with my 1st Entree (Please pace yourself), of various items; my favorite the Butternut Squash Soup which was very comforting to have during the cold weather today. For my 2nd Entree, I decided with trying the Mustard Herb Crusted Rainbow Trout Fingerling Potatoes, Marcona Almonds Haricot Vert, Frisee, Sherry Vinaigrette Melt in your mouth delicious! By this time, I was ready to be rolled down to my car! I was SO full! Dessert, I had to find enough room in my stomach to at least try the pumpkin mini cheese cake. Yum! Also, I can not forget the ladyfingers, they were so moist, warm, and tantalizing in my mouth! I had such a wonderful time! The Three-Course Champagne Brunch ~ $35 per person which totals with already included tax & gratuity to $45. It was worth it. Also don't rush, just relax and enjoy the atmosphere! Bon Appetit~
