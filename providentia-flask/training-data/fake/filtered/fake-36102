Went on a weekday morning at 8am.The waitresses were nasty and lazy .the place was dirty ( sticky floors , knats flying around, dirty tables and silverware ) no heat, chairs were wobbly .The food was horrible and over priced .i I use to go here all the time when the two male owners would cook and wait on tables . But after this experience I'd rather eat at a McDonald's which tells you how bad it is at the pantry
