Llama Tooth has a lot of pluses: Great outdoor seating, a stellar beer list, and some seriously yummy food choices. The brunch fritattas are killer, and the home fries are mouthwatering. Â The minus though; I have been here on 3 occasions, and every time, the service has been slow, there has been a long wait for the food... and twice it has arrived at the table cold. Now, I have never felt as though the slow service was the fault of our servers. They have always been pleasant, and clearly working their buts off, there just aren't enough of them. As someone who has worked waitressing for years, I feel bad for them, and watching them be completely overwhelmed gives me pangs of true empathy having been in those shoes. This place has a whole lot of potential to be great, and I would love to make them a regular stop before shows at Union Transfer. In my opinion, adding a server or two would do the trick. I'll be back, and hopefully be able to enjoy their tasty food and beer at a better pace.
