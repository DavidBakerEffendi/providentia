This place is fantastic! First of all, it's gorgeous inside. The food is super flavorful and the menu clearly very well thought out, but with none of the pretension that usually comes with lots of these new Brooklyn hotspots. The service and overall ambiance is welcoming and friendly. I had lots of questions about the wine cocktails, because I didn't know what most of them were. We sat at the bar and our bartender couldn't have been more patient and helpful. The portions aren't huge, but Â everything is so rich and flavorful that I don't think they're supposed to be. Will definitely be back!
