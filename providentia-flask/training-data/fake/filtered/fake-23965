funny how 45 seconds on the phone with one dude can make you never want to go to a place ever.  i don't doubt that anybody in the service industry has had to deal with a lot of assholes, convulated expectations, and stupid questions... but to treat me like you assume i've never actually been to a restaurant before is pretty much uncalled-for.  i'll take my $200 elsewhere.
