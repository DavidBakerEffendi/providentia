I must thank Katy Kasmai. It's because of her friends' bad behavior that I know of Feast. I ate there this noon and it was crowded; the food was superb and the service excellent. Â  I had the baby back benedict and my wife had an omelette. Both were beautifully prepared and delicious. The starters, particularly the bakery basket, were excellent as well. We showed up around 1pm without reservations and the place was incredibly crowded so we sat at the bar. Despite the crowds the service we received was very quick and professional all the way through. I would recommend Feast to anyone coming to NYC. The only complaint is one all too familiar in NYC. Too noisy. Again, thanks to Katy and her Google glass wearing friends. I never would have tried Feast if not for you.
