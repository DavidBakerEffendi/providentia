A restaurant has to have the total package. Great food, clean, and great service. As the food was good, the service sucked. Who wants to get their order, drive all the way home, and the order is wrong? The lady who takes the orders has to go. Went over the order 4 times and she still got it wrong. Oh yeah, they tried to sell me some re-heated cabbage from the day before, not knowing I'm a Chef myself!
