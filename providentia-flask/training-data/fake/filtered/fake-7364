Bouley is a very fine dining experience.  Luckily, I was just here again for a friend's birthday. It's expensive and beautiful and it delivers the goods.  Everything is perfect.  The atmosphere, the food, the service, the fashion, everything.  To describe this restaurant in words, I would have to talk french. I want to indulge again and again. I will just have to sell my apartment.
