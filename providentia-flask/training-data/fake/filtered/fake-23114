I must disagree with the post (Mike W.) below about the service. I think that good things come to those wait and our food was delicious.  We also had some EXCELLENT drinks while waiting for our meals to come.  The staff was friendly and had great food and drink pairing suggestions. After not visiting this location since it was Humphrey's I am amazed at the transformation that has occurred at this location.  Great Job!
