Despite being an area with multiple options for take-out and delivery, this place is my go-to. The food is good, the portions are generous, but what keeps me going back is the service. Everyone is kind and welcoming, and the woman who takes orders over the phone always remembers what you get if you're a regular. Fantastic place with great service.
