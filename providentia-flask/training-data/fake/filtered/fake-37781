Waitress (from the table next to us) dropped a glass of milk on the floor next to the table where my friend and I were eating.  It splashed all over use.  She was very apologetic, and brought a wet cloth so we could try to clean up a bit (cloth didn't help much).   Slow service. Food came.  Good fries.  Soup was just OK, room temperature, not hot.  Then the bill came.  Our waiter had quoted us a price that was much less then the item appeared on the bill.  I pointed this out to the waiter.  He just said "sorry."  The manager said the same. For the milk spill, they should have paid for part, if not all of the bill.  Also, they didn't reduce price of misquoted item.  No change to the bill at all.  Tacky.
