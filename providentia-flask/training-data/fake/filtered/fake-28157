The best tasting slices of pizza in Brooklyn.   Now for the bad: it's in a horrible location if you do not have a car or live near-by.  Long wait 30 mins. plus.  $5.00 for a smallish slice without any toppings.  Good luck getting a seat.  It's not the cleanest place to eat in.  Craziest hours of operation--something like 11am to 2pm then reopens at 6:30 to like 9pm.
