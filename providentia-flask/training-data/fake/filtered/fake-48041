I went to The Smith today for lunch and got the only veggie option in the sandwiches  menu- goats cheese, sprouts and avocado. Nothing extraordinary about  the sandwich, it was actually an odd combo of flavours but my main gripe is the ridiculous cost for the very poor coffee. They conveniently do not list the coffee on the menu and when the bill came the cappuccino cost $5. I felt like I had been scammed especially as the coffee was particularly bad. I would not go there again...for the same price I would go to freemans or peels for a similar but more honest experience.
