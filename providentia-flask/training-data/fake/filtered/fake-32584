I had never dined in a Spanish restaurant before and I had an outstanding meal. Each dish was excellent - I particularly was delighted with the seafood paella. This dish was packed with outstanding quality calimari, scallops, mussels, clams and shrimp. I also enjoyed the large selection of wines by the glass, and thought to quality of food and the price to be fantastic. They also had a hard to find 2003 port available for after dinner that was a great way to top off my meal. Â I would definitely eagerly return. It was also very close to my hotel, and I sent my colleagues there to dine the next night. What a treat!
