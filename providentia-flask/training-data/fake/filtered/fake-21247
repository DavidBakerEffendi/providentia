Yum! As others noted, the menu is on the small side, but most of their food is simple, fresh and delicious. The green salads are all fantastic - all of the ingredients, including the citrusy dressing, are really refreshing. I liked the lentil soup, the Turkish coffee was great, and I couldn't get enough of the baklava. My significant other went nuts for the grilled sampler entree. The owner was super nice - every time we ordered something, he seemed really impressed by us (which just cracked me up). PLUS! The prices are really reasonable and the place is BYO. Awesome. I do wish there was some hummus or something, but you know, if you're going to do something, do it right. I trust he's doing everything for a reason.
