1/2 OVERPRICED FOOD COURT - 1/2 TOURIST TRAP Let me start by saying that Eataly is top on my list of places never to visit in New York.  My girlfriend and I visited for the first and last time on Friday and had a horrible experience.  We walked in and went straight for the main restaurant to reserve our place in line for a table.  The host told us it would be about an hour and a half wait.  This was understandable because it was opening weekend and the place was packed.  We decided to wait and walked around the store to pass the time. Overall I would say that Eataly delivers when it comes to brining the Italian grocery store experience to New York.  I just came home from an August vacation in Italy and can attest to the authenticity of the products.  That is where the allure of this overpriced tourist trap ends.  Let me also disclose that I am from Manhattan and enjoy doing the tourist thing once in a while.  This was different. After walking around for an hour and spending $65 on two glasses of wine and a very small cheese and meat platter we returned to the restaurant to check on our table.  The host told us that they were no longer honoring reservations because the owner's family was there and that they would need all of the tables.  Who does that?  Needless to say I am telling everyone to stay away. If you still insist on going, leave your wallet at home.  This place sells discount Italian brands at premium prices.  Sure, most of the product comes from Italy but even Italian's don't eat the junk that Eataly is trying to sell.  If you want a nice Italian meal, go to CRISPO.
