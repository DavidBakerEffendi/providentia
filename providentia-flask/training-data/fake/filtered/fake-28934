My boyfriend and I went on a double date food road trip from Long Island to New Haven to try a Louis' Lunch burger... let me tell you, we did not walk away from the trip talking about the burger (as awesome as it was) but rather, we could not stop talking about these donuts. We actually stumbled upon Orangeside when once we got to New Haven. We googled donuts around the area, and this place was right around the block from us. When we walked into the store around 7 pm, we were disappointed to find that they had sold out of donuts for the day...until the owner, who had been standing nearby, told us that he may have been able to help us. They were in the middle of baking a bunch of donuts for wholesale and he managed to snag us a few. While we waited for our donuts to come out, we chatted with the owner, Tony, to find he was SUCH a nice guy and very down to earth. He told us a bit about Orangeside on Temple, and how the restaurant was only 5 years old; the donut making, 2. When our donuts came out, we were shocked to see the size of them. I'm used to Dunkin' Donuts' pathetic excuses for donuts and I was in awe to see that Orangeside's donuts were nearly the size of a paper plate.... and that they were square! After one bite of this donut, I knew I could never have a Dunkin' Donuts donut ever again. I tasted what donuts were SUPPOSED to taste like, and good God was it glorious. So light and fluffy on the inside, baked perfectly golden on the outside, and covered in a sweet, sticky glaze that makes my mouth water just typing this. THESE DONUTS ARE OUT OF THIS WORLD. I would make the trip back to New Haven just to get my hands on one of these donuts any day. If you're ever in the New Haven area, go to Orangeside on Temple!! You will NOT be disappointed!!!! Also, PLEASEEEEEEEE open a location on Long Island... or at least Manhattan!!!
