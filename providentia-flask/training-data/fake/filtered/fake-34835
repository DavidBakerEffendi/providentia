Yelp, where are the NO STAR ratings? I went to Downtown at the Taft with a big group of grad classmates for restaurant week and DAMN, everything that could go wrong...went wrong. Service: For a group of 20+, you'd think they use more than one waiter...even after we suggested, nope.  Just one guy who looked like he was ready to crap his pants after taking the orders. Food: Calamari was cold. None of the steaks were cooked to order.  Seared ahi was probably made at an Iams cat food factory. Just bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Total dinner time from order until end of dessert: 4 hours?  Seriously?   Luckily there was enough of us to fill the downtime with conversation, but man, if you were here on a first date or family dinner...forget it, the awkward silence/tension would eat your soul. The only upside was seeing the manager blow up at the server a few tables down.  It provided Jersey Shore caliber drama to a Jersey Shore caliber meal. Downtown at the Taft - FAIL
