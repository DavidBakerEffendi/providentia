On our recent visit to NYC, we had a few hours to kill before heading to LGA. We strolled through the streets downtown and came upon Fraunces Tavern. It looked cool, so we stopped in for lunch. The building is the oldest in New York -- built in 1716.  So it had character. We nabbed a table by the window and watched the crowd: Locals and visitors, including a big table of people speaking French. The menu was very basic, but inviting. I ordered the roast turkey, and Susan had a salad and salmon appetizer. We also received a basket of great soda bread. The food was fresh tasting, delicious and reasonably priced. But the highlight of our visit was our server, Adrian. We chatted with this nice man, an immigrant from Romania, and he shared his story of moving to America. We asked if we could have the bread wrapped. He did more than this: He gave us several piece to go.  Try Fraunces Tavern on your next visit to the city. They also have a great tavern with lots of beers. If you decide to dine, ask for Adrian.
