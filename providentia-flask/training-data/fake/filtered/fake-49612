Vlad, "the bald bartender" is one of my favorites.  He is extremely knowledgeable about the fabulous wine selection and the extremely pleasing innovative cocktails.  As are all of the staff at 116.  They strive to please without being overbearing and they all do their jobs very well.  I've eaten (with my 12 year old vegetarian son) everything on the menu and have never hit anything even resembling a "dud".  I recommend any of the amazing cheese boards and the selection of cured meats as well.  The duck salami is out of this world.  Couple this with one of their appetizers; the spicy olives or the green beans tempura will prepare you for one or more of the marvelous "small plates" that 116 has become famous for.  My favorites are the risotto balls (always moist and flavorful when I've had them), the mussels served up in a delicious broth that you will savor down to the last drop, and the smoky, sweet ribs.  Everything else on the menu is equally superb but these are my favorites.  Try the gravlax and any of the raw seafood (oysters and shrimp) for a fresh, flavorful mouthful in these hot dog days.  The caviar is equally superb although a bit out of my price range.  But a nice infrequent treat.  And the fries?  When I first had them a year ago they were hot and delicious and paired with some wonderful sauces for dipping.  I had them again last week and they are now drizzled with truffle oil which really is to die for.  For a quick  bite, try the burger or the Cubano or the 116 (sandwich of the day).  If you have room for dessert, the menu, although small, is sumptuous.  Add a cup of coffee and an aperitif and you'll be out the door in fabulous Ninth Square  a satisfied and happy diner.
