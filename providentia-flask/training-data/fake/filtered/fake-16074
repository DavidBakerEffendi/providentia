I was just at this eatery for lunch and my experience was horrible. From a beyond inattentive waiter (who blamed his inability to serve more than one table on tourists) to just okay food and then a massive billing screw-up, it was a terrible experience. Not once through the entire ordeal did our waiter truly apologize for the lack of service and when he did make a vain attempt, he Â blamed it on being busy which is BS considering that he flipped at least four tables while I was sitting there. I can't say that I would recommend this place to anyone or even come back for another meal. There way too many places in this city to dine someplace where neither the waiters nor the managers care enough to rectify the situation.
