There's a very pleasant atmosphere to Dos Toros. The burritos are very good. The guac! You HAVE to try the guacamole. The steak burrito is my personal favorite. A bit too spicy at times, but usually the burritos never disappoint. A steak burrito with a 'Rona hits the spot like no other! Also you can see a lot of famous people in there. It's a happening joint. Everyone from Billy Connelly to Judas Friedlander, it's a Â great place to eat. The service is also very friendly. There's a man with a beard that i always see who chortles at my jokes and is incredibly pleasant.
