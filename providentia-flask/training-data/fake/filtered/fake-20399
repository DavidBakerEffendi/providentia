I have never eaten there and I won't! I live in the same building they operate out of and I share their trash room. Everything comes out of cans! They have 3 recycle trash bins all full all the time labeled cans of main ingredients. When they bring their trash, recycleables out the side door to the trash room, they do not remove their gloves and walk right back into the side door with those gloves on that just came out of the trash room. They are very loud and inconsiderate after they lock their doors to the public and have no respect for the people who live here. Every year, they remodel, never hang their permits, or give warning to their neighbors who as I said before "live" here. So, as I said, I haven't eaten there and I won't based on their unhealthy practices, and knowing everything comes out of cans that they can push as authentic.Definitly, BYOB or three as an alcohol astringent!
