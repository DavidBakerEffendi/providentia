Don't be fooled by the architectural elegance of this place.  It is to be avoided!  The appetizers we ordered were ok - nothing special for the price, but the main entrees where terribly presented and at best tasted ordinary.  Fine dining this is not.  The lone bright spot was our server behind the bar and based on what we've heard from others this was the exception to the rule.  There are many, many places in downtown New Haven where you can have a better dining experience.
