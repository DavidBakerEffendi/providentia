So glad to finally have another food choice in Nutley! Krishna's is great and I highly recommend it.  Food is excellent and well priced.  The staff is friendly and the place is kept clean. The menu is extensive and has something for everyone. Enjoy and don't be afraid to try some new things.  Haven't had a bad dish yet.
