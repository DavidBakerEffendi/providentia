It's about day five of Snow-Apocalypto-Nemo here in CT, I wanted to do something with my day and write a review about where I went last night, Box63. They're Always open and for what I can remember, always a great time! I have been there before because I go to school in the area but I don't remember ever stopping by on a Monday, however, what a great stroke of luck because it was just $5 for a burger! Every Monday night! It was a good size meal especially with the chili nachos we got to start off with! AMAZING! After the three of us ate, we headed up to their amazing bar on the 2nd floor. Box63 had to have had more than 8 beers on tap, which is great because I'm kind of a beer snob, and they always are changing it up with the seasons. After dinner there was a good amount of people flowing in which was nice. Definitely a great fix to that cabin fever high-tension everyone was going through. I would definitely suggest them for a catered gig or even a birthday party if you plan on bringing a good amount of people because they can fit a lot of people and provide a private space so you can get that V.I.P treatment and feel fly like a G6. ;) Why not, if you can? Maybe I brought that up because I just want to fly out of here.
