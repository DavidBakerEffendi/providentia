A group of us went to this place to celebrate my sisters return home. I heard great things about the place and was very excited to go. After being seated we were informed that our last guest was bringing a 7th person, after our waiter tried all he could to accommodate us, the owner walked over and told us there was nothing he could do. Our waiter, who was great, started to come to us to say sorry about the situation and the owner told him, in front of us "FORGET ABOUT THEM, GO TO THE NEXT TABLE." This was not acceptable to my friends and I and we told the owner that he was out of line and was very rude. We weren't loud, we didn't cause a scene, but we told him how we felt and asked to speak to the manager- he told us no and to leave if we were going to give him a problem. HE KICKED US OUT! We didn't do anything, he was the one who was extremely rude. And they cleared our table with the drinks we brought and already opened and we had to leave. We called the police and they along with the waitress at the restaurant we ended up at informed us that they have heard plenty complaints about the owner being rude. So, they may have good food and byo, but if you have an opinion, you get kicked out!
