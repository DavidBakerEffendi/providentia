After reading all those nice reviews from fellow yelpers, my friends and I decided to give this place a try. The restaurant is not too big, nicely decorated. Now to the important part, the menu! wow...the list of hand rolls and rolls was quite large..but the most important part were the ingredients of each roll, each sounded sooo delicious I really did have a hard time deciding what to get. So, what did we order? to start off, edamame of course. All together we ordered, the sashimi platter appetizer, veggie tempura appetizer, the french, avocado and crunchy roll and a hand roll. Out waiter was nice. I was def impressed by the taste and the size of the rolls. This place will def be seeing my face again!
