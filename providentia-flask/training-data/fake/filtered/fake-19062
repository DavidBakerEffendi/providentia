Amazing. As soon as I took my first bite, I was in love. Thinking about it right now is making my mouth water. Living in Staten Island, I've had my fair share of great NY pizza, and this place is definitely up there with the best of them. Sure, the line is a little crazy (we waited 45 minutes at about 3am on a Sunday morning) but wellllll worth it. 4$ for an absolutely enormous slice of spinach and artichoke pizza. I definitely can't wait 'til the next time I'm in the city and get to try it again.
