We were here at 11:00 because that is what was advertised on site. Doors were closed and notice posted that they will start 'Grand Buffet' at 11:30, so we went to nearby CVS to while some time away. Returned at 11:35 and nothing was setup. They said it will take 10 mins. We waited till 12:00 and they only had appetizers ready. Don't know how long to wait till the actual Buffet. Service is HORRIBLE! I am NEVER coming here again. I thought Shalimar was a big name but this Â Rt 1. Restaurant is miserable. I can't care less if food is going to be great now. The place Sux!!!!!!
