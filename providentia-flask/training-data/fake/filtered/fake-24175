Food was excellent and reasonably priced.  The meat (at least the Corned Beef, Pastrami, and Roast Beef) were kosher, usually the turkey is too but they did not have it kosher that day.  If you only eat meat that's kosher and will eat at non-kosher certified establishments, this place is definitely for you as I recommend it to everyone, as I had good (but not as great) kosher meat at Hamifgash and Burger.org with bad service, this place is quick and helpful.   .
