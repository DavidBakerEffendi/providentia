In many ways it pains me to write this review as I have dined at Almond Â at least 20 times over the years. Unfortunately the continued deterioration of their food coupled with the absolutely abysmal dining experience last night leaves me no recourse. We arrived and were seated but an adjacent group of 6 were so loud we literally could not hear each other across the table. We asked to be relocated and were only given the option of a table on the other side of this group or outside. The hostess clearly saw our request as a bother; talk about blaming the victim. We relocated outside but I had no desire to sit outside with a jacket in order to eat. We were looking for another restaurant on-line and told the waiter we were leaving. Apparently he was able to find us a table towards the back. We were further annoyed to see several empty tables despite the hostess's contention that none were available. Capping things off was a dinner that was eminently mediocre. I've always loved this place for both the quality of the dining experience and professionalism and friendliness of the staff. Last nice it was closer to a raucous, drunken sorority party than a restaurant. Several other diners mentioned to us how terrible their evening had been due to this group. Management was clearly unable or unwilling to get control of the situation as it grew louder and more obnoxious throughout the evening. What was once a neighborhood gem is clearly now just a hack joint. They're down to 3.5 stars and I can only envision those ratings will continue to drop like a rock. What a completely avoidable disappointment .
