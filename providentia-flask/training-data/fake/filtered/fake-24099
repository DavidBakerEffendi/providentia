I always eat at masala grill, so I went to the restuarant with my friends and we ordered our food.  I was eating when suddenly I found a roach inside my chicken tikka masala.  i was grossed out so i called the waiter and I told him.  They have very bad customer service because no listened to us. I recommend to all the students not to eat there.  If I found a roach in my food imgaine how dirty and nasty is inside the restuarant.  i am never gtoing back again.
