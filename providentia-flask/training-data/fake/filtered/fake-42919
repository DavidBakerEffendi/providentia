Ambiance -  Very NY, exactly what I would expect from a finance district restaurant. Tall ceilings, great lighting, perfect place to impress a colleague, date, or go with a group of 5-6. Definitely a good lunch/dinner/drinks spot. Food - Great presentation, very flavorful and true to the menu descriptions. Appetizers were good portion sizes, and the wait staff was clear about how many servings were appropriate for our group. The shrimp dish did come out cold, but the rest of the apps were very tasty, epically the vegetable samosas. My entrée the lamb vindaloo was one of the tastiest I've ever had and someone else ordered the lamb chops which were equally as delicious. Long story short - Go with the Lamb! As for Drinks, the house wine was a food network approved sparkling white that complimented desert perfectly; and it's clear that the mixologist they had create the cocktail menu is an ace. All of the cocktails were unique, delicious and made just perfectly! Drink Up! Service - The wait staff was excellent, very attentive, polite and eager to make the experience top notch. Our waiter in particular knew the menu well and made several suggestions as we moved through the courses. In general, great place I will be back!
