The Ivy is a Princeton insitution- it has a variety of different nights that offer different experiences- Karaoke, DJ, even a comedy night. The beer and drinks are always cheap and the staff is friendly and professional. Justin and Richie do a great job behind the bar.   Morons who posted above such as Alexandra L are obviously pompous snobs with no sense of reality. The Ivy is a bar, its not a club, and its not some Magic Kingdom Mickey Mouse fake Disney bull either. It is a great time provided you are not looking for a retractable roof with a DJ being dropped in by helicopter.   This is the best bar in Princeton and everyone should check it out!
