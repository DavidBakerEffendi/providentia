Best coal fired pizza we have had in New York!  Excellent wait staff, quick friendly service.  Located under the Brooklyn Bridge. This pizza place is owned by the original Grimaldi's owner, Patsy Grimaldi.  Ironically the store Patsy sold, along with his name, is still operating next door, providing a choice of pizzeria's under the bridge..
