I like simple concepts and falafel is one of my favorite on the go foods. Anything simple needs to be done very well. At this place it is. At Taim they live up to that maxim with delicious falafel that is so crispy! Really, really good!! If you visit don't forget to get lots of the tahini over the falafel. It's the perfect mix.
