The food is fresh and delicious, but over priced. The employees are unfriendly...I go there everyday (for about the past 6 months) for a morning coffee and the employees look at me like they've never seen me before. You would think they would want to have a better connection with their regulars. The only reason I continue to go back is for the convenience and good coffee.
