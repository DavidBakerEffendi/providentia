walked in without a reservation at 6:00 on a Saturday and 3/4s of the place was empty. the host was arrogant and told us we could sit at the bar. serious the place was half empty and who does he think he is.  We had a subpar meal (that pizza sucks) and the bartender was not interested in us at all and made some horrible recs on the wine.  When we left the place at 730 it was still half empty.  Gotta say I wont be going back and I hope the place shuts down as it is so mediocre and they were flat out rude and unaccomodating.
