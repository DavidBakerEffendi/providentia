While my dish tasted good, and my friends who were not vegetarian loved their dishes, it is ABSOLUTELY unacceptable to advertise your menu items as "vegetarian" when your special Pad Thai sauce AND your curry both contain fish oil. You should disclose that on your menu! My boyfriend ordered the green curry dish and my friend ordered a dish with curry. When the curry sauce was not included on my friends plate, she was told by the bus boy that they didn't put it on because she is vegan and the curry contains fish oil. This was news to us, as my vegan boyfriend had ordered the green curry dish believing it to be "safe" to eat based on what the waiter had recommended-- and that the dish was described as "V" for Vegetarian on the menu. Advertising your items as "vegetarian" when they are plainly NOT is completely misleading and unprofessional. While it is wonderful the staff tried to accommodate us after the incidents, the whole situation could have avoided if the menu accurately disclosed the fish oil, and understood what the term "vegetarian" means. It is unfortunate because now I imagine the staff was annoyed at the "angry vegans," but if the restaurant had just done it's professional duty to be accurate and honest, there would have been no misunderstandings at our table.If you are a vegetarian or vegan, I would definitely NOT recommend this place, as you simply cannot trust the information provided to you via the menu - or the staff, apparently.
