This Italian Market stalwart has, quite simply, the tastiest falafel sandwich you could ever want. Half (very) small restaurant, half Middle Eastern grocery, the small but mighty staff at Bitar's makes incredibly tasty, affordable food. Forget the orange goo-slingers around the corner that claim the best 'authentic' South Philly sandwich. Bitar's is where it's at.
