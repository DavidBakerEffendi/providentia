Been here a few times. Every time I go in the owner looks like he rather be eating cow shit than working in a pizzeria. The ambiance of the place feels like a cemetery. Not very warm. Not very friendly. I will admit that they have a decent slice for this area. I've had better. Anyway. I'm done with this place. I ordered lunch for delivery for my wife and I. A wrap with fries. A chicken roll. And a 2 liter soda. For delivery. 7 minutes away. It takes them an hour to arrive. When the kid finally gets here. He's forgotten the fries, soda, and credit card reciept that I have to sign. I sign a piece of paper and write down 5$ for his tip. I call this place and tell the guy about my fries, soda, and receipt. He tells me he's going to send the driver back out. Driver comes back. With hour and half old French fries in a crumpled up bag. My warm soda. And a receipt that has more items on it than I ordered. I was charged 2.50 more than I should have. I didn't care about the 250. I just agreed I wouldn't order here anymore. My wife wanted to call and complain. I thought maybe they had a delivery charge. That's why there was an extra item for 250. I said leave it alone. After seeing free delivery on the menu. She of course had to call. When she told the guy about it he says oh those are old menus. We do have delivery charge. That's what pissed me off. This place is the typical new York jerk off who hates his job and life. I wouldn't recommend this place. Especially with better places around the area.
