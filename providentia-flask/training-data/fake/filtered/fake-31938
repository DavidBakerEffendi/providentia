Posto is a cozy neighborhood spot; generally speaking, the service is good, the ambiance is nice, and they have a great variety of very tasty thin crust pizzas. Takeout is a different story - on a recent occasion, I ordered one of their pizzas, a cookie, and a soda for delivery and the soda was the only thing I didn't have a problem with. Â The pizzas ingredients were visibly unappealing; the tomatoes looked and tasted a bit wilted and old, the bacon was blackened to a crisp, and the edges were also burnt (perhaps they left it in the oven for a bit too long) However, instead of apologizing for this error, they didn't say anything (a simple, "have a free drink on us next time you come by" would have done wonders). The cookie wasn't inedible, but wasn't chewy at all, didn't taste fresh, and if they're all like that I wouldn't recommend it.
