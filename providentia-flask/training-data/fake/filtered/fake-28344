We tried the fixed menu for dinner and LOVED it.  This is an expensive restaurant, but the food and drink specials were great!  I think it came with 5 courses?  It was a lot of strong drinks that night.  But everything was delicious.  At first, we thought the portions were on the small side, but at the end of dinner we left very full.  This is definitely a place to try or visit again.
