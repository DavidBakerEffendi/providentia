I was happy to see that this place had finally opened and went in to order take out this evening.  I found it to be really cute inside and the staff seems very friendly (although there were a lot of them in there for the amount of people).  The menu features a bunch of standard BBQ entrees and sides. I got the pulled chicken and a side of green beans.   My order took about 5-10 minutes to be prepared.  Not bad at all.   The pulled chicken came with slaw (which was a bit too sweet in my opinion) and a couple of very new dill pickles (yum!).  They also gave me two small containers of BBQ sauce (different kinds).  The food was pretty good, however I think it is a bit over priced.  My above order cost almost $17.  Too much to spend for a dinner for one on a regular basis.
