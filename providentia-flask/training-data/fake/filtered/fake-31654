This has become my Go To spot in the neighborhood.  Mostly meeting friends at the bar - which is always busy to full but never packed - but also for dinner.  Great food and drinks and they really take their Farm-to-Table / Local schtick to heart.  There's something new and different every time I go in (they'd call it "seasonal"), have a big American Whiskey selection, and even keep their beer local.   Their wine's are all domestic too, which I honestly don't love because I prefer Old World wines, but I gotta give them credit for being consistent and doing a good job with the list. And the service?  Super friendly and always looking out for me, probably the biggest reason it's now my Go To.
