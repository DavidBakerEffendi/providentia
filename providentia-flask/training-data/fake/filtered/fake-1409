I'm a bit late on the review but here we go. I have never had sizzling sisig before and we loved it so much we ordered it again. The taste and smells definitely reminded me of my travels in SE Asia. This place is for people who are open minded about food and are willing to be adventurous in their culinary journey. Don't just come in and cringe at the exotic food on the menu and order the mango salad because its the most mainstream ...go to the Olive Garden if you want that kind of food (there were a few of these when we went).
