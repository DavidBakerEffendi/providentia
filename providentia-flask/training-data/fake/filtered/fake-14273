We went to Beso to celebrate a bday party with a couple of friends. I thought the restaurant was very cozy and I loved the atmosphere, even though the place was so loud we were having hard time understanding what everyone was saying (still not as LOUD as Enoteca Maria...). I was very excited about the idea of ordering many types of tapas dishes and getting a little taste of everything, everything on the menu sounded delicious and after all very simple, which is always a good thing. We started with a pitcher of red wine sangria (which was good enough to order two more) and some nachos with guacamole. The nachos were homemade but they literally tasted like fried chicken because of the oil that they got deep fried with. We also had some queso frito balls, fried goat cheese balls tapas, not impressive, some crepes rolls filled with a dense and dry mushroom and cheese stuffing that needed some moisture in the filling or some dipping sauce, they were really heavy and had a sort of boring taste, the lambchops were really good, grilled well done even if the waitress didn't bother asking us what was our preference on the cooking of the meat, the slices of beef meat w/ bluecheese were overcooked and hard to chew, and the eggplant tapas with bacon too wet and plain. We ordered a few more tapas that didn't impress me and I hardly can recall. As for dessert, the chocolate cake tasted like burned and the other custard with coconut flakes was really plain. I had good time with my friends, I saw the place packed of people but I really don't think it was anything special.
