Takei has just reopened, and it's still my favorite place to get sushi!  It is by far the best tasting sushi you can get for the price.  They do a lot of interesting rolls with fruit in them that are really good - I'd recommend all of them. There's almost never anybody there - the only people I ever see there are people I see there pretty much all the time, so there is never a wait.
