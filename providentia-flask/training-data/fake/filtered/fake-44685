We had an awesome evening at the Rotisserie this evening (1/20/14), great location, sufficient parking (in comparison to going to downtown Burlington), excellent service (Josh) and nice ambiance.  The food was delivered in a timely fashion and tasted fresh and yummy. Lots of choices on the menu to please most any connoisseur. Great wine selection and full bar service. Prices are appropriate for ingredients and portions.  Did not feel rushed and will definitely be back soon.
