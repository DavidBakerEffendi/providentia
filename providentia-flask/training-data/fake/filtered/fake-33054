OMG this is such an amazing neighborhood spot.  The place is so unpretentious and the venezuelan food is so good.   When my friend and I walked in we got friendly hellos from the bartender and server.  We went during happy hour and sat at the bar. We had some great sangria. What made it even better is that every drink you by they give you a FREE  tapa. And we're not talking cheapies like, chips & a bowl of nuts-- I mean good stuff like empanadas, and tequenos (which, by the way, are delicious with guava dipping sauce. YUM!!!) The arepas we had (pernil & pabellon) were the perfect little sandwich style appetizers--so juicy and tender. The service was just my style: friendly and attentive without being overbearing. Everyone was so nice and welcoming.  And the items on the menu won't break the bank.  I am so happy I accidentally found this place.  I definitely plan on going back and even becoming a regular.
