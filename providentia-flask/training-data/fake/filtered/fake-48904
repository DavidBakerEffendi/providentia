Really really noisy. Couldn't hear anyone unless they raised their voice. The sardines had a kind of potato chip included which was suppose to add crunch but just seemed like it was chips on top of the sardines. Then when I got the salad it had those curly chinese chips you get before a meal in the salads. They may have been made in the kitchen, fresh, but really? Food, average.
