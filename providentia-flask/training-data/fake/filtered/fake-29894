My friend and I went there for lunch, we had a groupon.  My friend was able to see into the kitchen - she saw the chef handling raw meat with his bare hands then handling other food.  She saw the chef switch the food on two plates after they came back because they were not right - he switched the food again with the same unwashed bare hands, and sent it back to the customers.  At the end of the meal we presented the groupon, we had in addition ordered two sodas which came to 4.00.  The establishment took out a 20% tip based on the cost before the groupon.  The groupon states the tip should be based on the groupon cost.  So I paid 18.00 for the groupon, 4.00 for drinks, and got charged a 8.20 tip.  Based on all of this we would never, ever, go back there!  There were two people at the next table with the same groupon, they were also upset about the automatic tip deduction!
