An excellent taste of Perth. I have tried to get Bellhaven in the states and it never tastes right but Highlands wee heavy and stought are exactly they way they should taste. Their Scotch menu is extensive and their staff knowledgeable. You now it is a real Scottish taigh-seinnse when they have haggis neeps and tatties. This is an excellent addition to Little Britain and may just be my new favourite pub.
