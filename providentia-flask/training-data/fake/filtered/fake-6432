GREAT beer selection, just wish they didn't charge so much for it. However, when you factor in the the overall experience, it's definitely worth paying more. As far as I know this place is fairly unique in Philly, and when it's cooler they have a nice fire going for SMORES! I'd recommend going during the week, it gets crazy busy on the weekends, especially if it's nice out. I've seen lines to get in on Friday nights that are easily 50+ people long...
