This is basically, the best sliders and fries I'll ever have. I love the fact that, their bacon sliders, had bacon INSIDE the meat, not on top like most places make it. Their chipotle sauce is sooo good. My boyfriend loved their jalapeno sauce. I got the regular cheese fries while he got the chilli cheese fries, it doesn't matter which you have, you will be satisfied with it! We didn't get any shakes, maybe next time. Â But definitely check this place out, i recommend this place, to EVERYBODY. The only down side was their bbq sauce, it had such a weird after taste that I quickly went back to chipotle sauce. But if you're in the area and want something amazing, come here!
