The burgers here are pretty amazing. I went with a friend and we split the truffle burger and the manly. We liked both of them but preferred the truffle for its flavor. The service was really nice considering it was packed and everyone was running around serving multiple tables. Onion rings were OK, they didn't seem to have much flavor to me. The sweet potato fries were awesome, and I LOVE sweet potato fries. My only complaint would be that the dipping sauce portions are very small and because it's so crowded all the time, it's hard to find your server and ask for more. Regardless, I love Umami and will be coming back for more burgers!
