The perfect slice. A mix between the clean flavors of Neapolitan and a classic New York cheesy heaven made by a master. It's amazing Dom is still going and we all are so lucky that retirement hasn't started yet. So run on down and get a bite while you still have a chance. Â  PS OK so it's expensive for pizza, but it is by no means expensive. If $30 is beyond your price range for a life changing meal. Then go down the frozen food isle and grab some frozen "pizza", because you obviously don't care about quality.
