This is a great neighborhood bar in a hipster neighborhood. Great ambiance, decent wine, pretty good food. The service on the night we went was spotty at best - many of the workers were hanging at the very back bar and could have been more attentive to the few patrons in the place. Music could also be dialed down a bit. Not a place I would go to specifically for the food - Philly has too many great restaurants for that - it was just convenient for the night we went. More of a hang out place with friends - for drinking and socializing.
