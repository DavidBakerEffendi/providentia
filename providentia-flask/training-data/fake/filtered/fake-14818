First time at a BFg last night.  We had a great time. It was a busy night but we were able to sit in the bar area and have a few drinks while we waited for our table. We were told 45 min but really only waited 20. Our waiter was promt and very knowledgeable about the menu. If you go in there, ask for Mitch. He takes care do his customers.  The food was awesome. I had fish tacos and they were delicious.   During desert the owner hank stopped by our table and a 5 minute conversation with him was pleasant.  All in all I can say hat I will be going back.
