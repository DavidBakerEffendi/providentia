it got worst since the last time i went.. food was fine but not the wow! it used to be.. maybe the cooks got a little too confident  cooking with a certain snob attitude in the their open kitchen trying not to pay attention to costumers right in front of them (not all of them but i think i am talking about the chef.. not sure though).. anyway..  not as interesting as expected
