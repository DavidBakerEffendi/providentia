Have read the reviews and have mixed feelings about them. Has the staff had attitude, Yes. Is that part of the hometown charm, Yes. But can they make you feel good, like you're Norm at Cheers, Yes. My wife and I have been going to Just Plain Dave's for years. Why, because it's a great breakfast place and they have the best burgers around. Just like anything in this word, they have good days and bad days, but I do believe they care and do they best they can. Have we walked out in the past because of waiting to long for our food and didn't like the attitude of the waitress, Yes. But we always come back because of the food. And bottom line is we like Dave, love Cheryl and all the quirkiness that is Just Plain Dave's. Would I recommended this place to others, Absolutely.
