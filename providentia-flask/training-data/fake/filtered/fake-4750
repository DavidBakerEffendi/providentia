On Dec 30,2012 I was craving Indian food, So we (me and 5 friends) decided to go to Shalimar Of India (Disgrace Of India) for a Sunday  buffet.  The food was so bad, if you are an Indian born you would want to punch the cook and I am not exaggerating. Here's WHY 1)  All the dishes are cold; its not even warm. 2)  For our taste buds, quality of the food is below average to poor. 3)  Tandoori chicken is cold, dry and tasteless. 4)  Veggie biryani is a joke!  It was made with frozen Vegetables which includes corn. Corn in a veggie biryani? Dont even ask me about other dishes. The only saving grace was a curry made with Bell pepper. If you are non-indian and haven't eaten Indian food in Boston or any other major city, then you might like this restaurant. If you are an Indian don't even bother!
