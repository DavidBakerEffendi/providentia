One of the places where "patience is key". Such a precise and dedicated artist the pizza maker is. When you want to rush the guy, you hold back knowing you'll get exactly what you smell, see, and experience you get from hearing the other customers can't be imitated. Everyone loves their order! Although the price is slowing rising, I still order a pie (best deal) and then share amongst friends or just for myself. Whenever I know guests are coming, I always place an order at least an hour advance. (the guy really takes his time). In the end, patience = one of the best slice of pizza you'll have in NYC.
