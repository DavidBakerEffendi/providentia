After hearing lots of good things, I was excited to finally get a chance to eat lunch here.  We had lunch on a Friday and enjoyed the casual atmosphere, with its mix of business suited lunchers, out of towners (like us) and what I guessed were neighborhood regulars.  The service was friendly and they accommodated adding another person to our reservation without changing the time.   I should have tried the ricotta, but enjoyed the salad and the crostini.  The roasted garlic chicken was tender, juicy and delicious. The pumpkin pasta was also delicious and delicately flavored.  The orchiette with duck sausage and broccoli rabe was hearty and filling.  The pasta texture seemed just right.   My husband had the buccatini which he said was good, but not amazing.  We also enjoyed the apple and quince crumble very much. I would definitely bring friends here again.
