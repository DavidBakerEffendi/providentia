Eating in at this place was great. The food & service was amazing so I expected delivery to be just as amazing. Boy was I wrong!  The delivery order went very poorly. They messed up the order and tried to accuse me of making the mistake (while I was looking at their menu, and very aware someone was trying to cover their own error)  I remember when the owner won the prize money from the NYPL business contest, but it seems now they choose to put the customers last.
