My wife, daughter and I visited the placefor dinner on Wednesday. We ordered three entrees: chicken and rice, stewed codfish, and beef stew. In addition, we ordered a bowl of tripe soup and mashed fried plantains. The tripe soup was delicious and the mashed fried plantains tasty. But, we all found our entrees less than perfect. Generally, the main dish was dry and tasteless and the rice and beans somewhat plain. We were generally disappointed and surmised that the entrees were not freshly cooked but sitting on a hotplate somewhere to be eaten by someone who happened to order that dish that night.
