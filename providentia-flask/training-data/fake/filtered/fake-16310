We are visiting New Haven this week and have used Yelp to locate all the restaurants we have been to and Zoi's on Orange was a fast and the service was attentive, the food was basic and good but the sandwich menu was fantastic. Â I wish I had time to enjoy a few of them but you should. Thanks Zoi's for a nice breakfast.
