Despite some pretty constant changes in management and wine list, this place never disappoints.  The food has remained consistent across three or four managers in the last year, and even as the wine list and availability is changing, there is always something new and interesting to taste.  Ian the bartender is one of the best things about the Upper West Side, and it is a great treat to be able to occasionally watch some major sports event without having to stand in a crowded bar drinking beer. (love my beer and college football, but sometimes it's just not what you're in the mood for, ya know?)  My husband and I particularly love the "salad pizza" or Vegetarian flatbread if you want to get technical, and the option to add perfectly cooked flank steak to most options is great!
