To be honest, the place has SO much potential. I love the atmosphere and the general layout, but I think the type of music they play brings down its quality. Tonight was my first time there. I walked in absolutely loving the whole concept/idea of it, but was extremely let down when it came to the music. In terms of the crowd--I think they need to be more selective with who they let in. You've got a variety of people, ranging from those who dress up to those who dressed down (to a point where one would ask themselves, "who let these people in?"), It's an extremely classy place (as classy as a bar can get), and I just think that the combination of the music they played + the variety of people kinda brought down the whole feel of it. Try being more selective? Not saying full out dress code, but people were coming in with sweats and whatnot... Recommendations I can make (in terms of music)--something along the lines of: RIO- Shine On DON OMAR- Danza Kuduro Nicolas Jaar- El Bandido Trentemoller- Sycamore Feeling (Gui Boratto Remix) You're welcome.
