as i have eaten in many a Korean restaurant both here in the states and in Korea, i would have to say this is a great little place.  i have found over the years that the restaurants appearance on the out side (location, neighbor hood and suck) is normally a great preview of what is going to be inside. i have eaten in some that are in the right location, right neighborhood and will not go back to them. and i have been to some that are back streets and old plaza's that you get the best food.  that being said.  this is in an old plaza area that looks like it has been left for dead and the business that are there are trying to bring it back up.   the service was prompt and with a smile and more time than not the server bowed and as she left the table.  after the crowd had reduced the server came back out and was talking to us and seeing where we were from and making us feel right at home. the menu and selections.  the menu selections are many and vast to choose from so you can get a varied taste of their cuisine.  i did with they had cucumber kimche but it was not fresh today so it was not available.  and a few other traditional fares were not there but each restaurant is different.   i will definitely be going back again.  great little place with really good food. that came out quick.
