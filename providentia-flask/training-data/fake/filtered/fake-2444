Had fabulous birthday dinner at Fond two months ago . Our waiter and photographer (lol) and the rest of the staff were friendly, professional and just fabulous. Dinner was simply amazing! A feast for all the senses. Our overall dining experience - priceless! Thank you for making my day extra special. We WILL be back and we WILL spread the word!
