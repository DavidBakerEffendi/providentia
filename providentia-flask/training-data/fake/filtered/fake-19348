I always liked the "old" Twenty Manning, but I didn't go there very often.  It was more of a "special occasion" place for me.  The new TMG, on the other hand, is so bright and warm and affordable, that I have been there about 10 times already since it opened a few months ago.  It has quickly become my go-to default restaurant when I want a good, affordable meal in a fun, festive spot.  I have tried almost everything on the menu by now, and I have to say that everything is really good.  My favorite is probably the Ahi Tuna, but I also love the pork chops with peaches, steak frites, burger and the chicken (served in a cast iron skillet with a big mound of bright green peas and some tasty mashed potatoes).  Salads are also really tasty, and the desserts -- when I indulge -- are sinfully good (especially the half-baked chocolate chip cookie with vanilla ice cream...).  The service is also consistently good; I've had several good waiters, and they are always young, friendly and eager to make your experience a good one.  Often, I eat at the bar, and I've become friendly with the super cool bartenders, Risa and Jill, who always keep me smiling.  On top of all this good food, cheery ambience, friendly vibe and positive energy... add the fact that proprietor Audrey Taichman can be found nearly every evening walking around the room, attending to details, and making sure that everyone is having a great time.  It makes you feel like you have been invited to a wonderful dinner party at the home of a dear friend.  All in all, I have to say that I really love TMG.  It has become my favorite new neighborhood bistro in town.
