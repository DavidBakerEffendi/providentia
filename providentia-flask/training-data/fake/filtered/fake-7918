This place is the best! As a vegan I wouldn't figure there would be options at a hot dog joint, but you can substitute any option with a veggie dog, and a good one at that. All the toppings were fresh and tasty, and the staff were super helpful knowing it was my first time ordering. I'll definitely be going back! P.S this place gets bonus points for having the coolest menu in Philly.
