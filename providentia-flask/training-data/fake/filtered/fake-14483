This was by far one of the best taste experiences I've had in a long time! With so many burger places out there it was wonderful to visit and eat at this Burger Fi for many reasons...It began when I walked through the door, the restaurant design is cool, hip and friendly, and they have a full bar. The staff amazing the food was SO fresh. It was also refreshing to eat onion rings that are genuinely homemade. Really, "you can't eat just one"! Go for the "Cry" fries and onion ring combo...also veggie burger was excellent if you are vegetarian or just not in the mood for a burger. It is addictive so watch out :).
