Excellent, authentic Korean food at - surprise - reasonable prices in priced-to-the-stars Upper Montclair. The atmosphere is nothing extraordinary, but you soon appreciate the best Miso soup available in Northern NJ, fresh, delicious, healthy salads, and - if you're dining in - Bulgogi served in a hot stone pot that retains the warmth of the dish. I'm extremely temperature sensitive when it comes to food but I was able to eat leisurely without worry. Their English is a second language at best but it's all part of the charm. Take out is just as satisfying. They also take extra good care to package everything carefully and not rob you of any of the sides or sauces that you would enjoy with the dining-in experience. The only thing missing is the hot stone pot :) This is a newly opened gem that deserves to be discovered by more people.
