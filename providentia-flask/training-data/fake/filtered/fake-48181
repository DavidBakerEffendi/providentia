I lived in Belgium for a year and these fries do not do the food of the country any justice. The special sauce which should be the equivalent of homemade mayo is straight from a Heinz bottle. This place is a joke, might as well go to BK or McDonald's and pick up some Hellmann's Mayo on the way home.
