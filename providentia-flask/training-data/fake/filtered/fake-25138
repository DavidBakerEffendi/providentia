Finally after 5+ years of eating out in Philly I feel compelled to write a review. I tried Amis for the second time tonight. I think some of Vetri's dishes, more familiarly at Osteria, can be excellent, but generally I find his last two places to be inconsistent. We tried Amis a few weeks after opening and really gave it a fair shake again tonight. I want to love this place, I love the idea, I want to get fat eating around Rome for years someday, then go to a fat farm, then rejoin society. The only thing that stood out for me was the ribeye, amazing. To preface, I have a culinary background and love very salty and flavorful foods and admittedly have high standards. The service tonight was outstanding, the food fell flat. The fava bean contorni, new to the menu, was excellent, the meatballs are juicy, tasty little bites. The tuna was well executed and balanced  with the right punch of acid. The artichokes, which I think are far superior at Osteria, needed lemon. The pastas  left the most to be desired. The gnocchi is unconventional and worth trying however the bucatini was laden with chunky chewy pork fat, the vongole lacked distinction and the cacio e pepe did not compare to Amanda Hesser's Lupa recipe I've been making at home for years. I've also sampled the eggplant, ricotta, pork terrine, fritto, arancini, lamb's tongue and saltimbocca and don't feel inspired to expand beyond that. The desserts elevated the meal, the waffles and tartufo stood out. I think it's a credit to the chef/ restauranteur that we try Amis with high expectations and hope upon the next visit (or with the right order), they will be met.
