I must say, my family used to love this place. Not any more!  Since the new owners and management the quality has gone WAY DOWN!  The crab legs were so overcooked that the shells would bend!  I tried the oysters, I had to leave the table to go to the ladies room to be able to spit out the rancid oyster!  These were some of my findings, not to mention that theycharged $14.00 for my 10yr old son who ate 3 small pieces of pizza because the chicken strips were too dry and stiff.  Don't waste your time nor money at this dump.  Even the dinning rooms smelled and not of food, more like a locker room!  Btw. The staff are too busy yapping on their cell phones to take a plate away.
