Since I live down the street from the Belgian, I've been there many times.  It's got a great atmosphere and when the weather's nice you can sit outside.    The best thing: the extensive beer list.  They have beers from all over the world.  Also the waiters seem to have a lot of knowledge, so they can usually recommend something or answer your questions about any kind.   The next best thing: frites.  The fries are delicious and addictive.  They also specialize in mussels.  They also carry vegetarian dishes and use a lot of organic ingredients. The downsides: The menu is limited and doesn't change.  Although they offer specials, it is not somewhere I go to for dinner a lot. (mostly we go for beer and frites).  Another downside it is pretty small and does get crowded, so it can be a little loud.
