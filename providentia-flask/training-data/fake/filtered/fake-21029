Went into the restaurant  for the first time on December 2nd, please excuse me, I know this is review is a week overdue but I've been sick with the flu. I've been to all of Garces's restaurants and WOW!!!! I was never once ever so disappointed (with any other Garces restaurant or any other restaurant) until coming into Garces Trading Co. Both our service and the food were T-E-R-R-I-B-L-E. Service: When we asked  our waiter for suggestions he looked at us like a deer in the headlight, I would have given him a pass waiving it off to inexperience, except I know our waiter wasn't new because a prominent  Philadelphia couple was present and he spent all his time fawning over them and ignoring the rest of his tables. We had to ask for our drinks and the check twice. Completely inexcusable in my books. Food: Now our food choices may have been corrected if we had a foody waiter that cared but since he didn't we were led astray. Maybe the deep dish pizza really is just that terrible. Either way I would say the $70 spent on the dog food I choked down (I left hungry) was a complete waste and I would never recommend anyone go there because I certainly will never be going again. Close this place and stick with tapas.
