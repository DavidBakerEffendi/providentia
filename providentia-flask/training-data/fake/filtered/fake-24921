Second time here...this time we opted for the Mexicali and schnitzel instead Of the same thing I had last time (big WAC?). I'm any event, Food was fabulous, and despite apparently being the only one working, the waitress ( Audrey) made me an incredible smoothie. Will definitely be back and maybe try another burger, and a smoothie for sure!
