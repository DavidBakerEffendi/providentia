I've had better Italian food, but man this place is cool.  It was founded in the late 19th Century, so for that reason alone you have to try it.  No real celebrities there last night, but a soap opera actress was there who I never heard of before.  It's got a tourists feel, but it is hard to get in there.  It was busy for a Wednesday, and there is energy about the place.  Like everyone else I have to recommend the mozzarella in carozza.  I will go back, but no rush now that I've been there.
