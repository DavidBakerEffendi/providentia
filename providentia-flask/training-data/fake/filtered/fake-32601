I hosted a bridal shower for my sister last weekend at Le P'tit. The food was great and the portions were fairly large. We were able to order from a large selection of menu items. I had the chicken and mozz sandwich with shoe string fries and salad. The French toast looked delicious. The staff was friendly and attentive and the food came out rather quickly. We got their chocolate hazelnut cake which was delicious. I would recommend this restaurant for brunch or a private event.
