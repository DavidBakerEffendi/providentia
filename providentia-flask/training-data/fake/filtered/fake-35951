Sorry, I cannot recommend this spot. Overpriced, slow and inconsiderate service, and an air of that annoyingly condescending hipster vibe. The food was pretty decent, but $15 for a pie (we ordered the Axel Rosenberg) which falls apart in your hands is not reasonable in my opinion. I was also disappointed in the lack of toppings purported to come with the pizza....ours literally had about 4 pieces of soppresatta (spicy pepperoni) on the whole thing. The menu and specials are filled with obscure Italian ingredients that our server would name but not explain to us. She probably approached our table about 4 times during our time there, and forgot to bring drinks which we requested. Apparently her excuse for doing so was that she was "like, 1 hour away from vacation." That made us like, 1 minute away from giving her a small tip. If you are looking for a great "fancy" pizza place, try Motorino in East Williamsburg (on Graham Ave). Or if you're looking for "hip" Bushwick atmopshere, try Northeast Kingdom, which is quieter, has much better food, and better service. They also have cheaper and better drinks too - Roberta's charged $7 (!) of some mediocre microbrew.
