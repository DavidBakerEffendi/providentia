Pakistani food is hard to beat after Shalimar sweeat restaurant on oaktree road but this location comes into a close second. It's clean, the service is organized and fantastic. I love how big it is and most importantly best food in north brunswick. We had the haleem, chicken tikka, chicken biryani, fried fish (my dad still talks about the fish and says it's hands down the best he's ever had), and chai. The portion sizes are plentiful and it's reasonably priced. The food is so much better than Kabob King (YUCK!) I really loved this place!
