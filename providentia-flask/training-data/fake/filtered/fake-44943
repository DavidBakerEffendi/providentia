Working in the city I tend to give in to all the great food places around for lunch...which aren't always the healthiest choices. Fuel is great for the price and the waist line. Everything on the menu is under 500 calories- and a lot is under 300 too- and under $10! The portions are too bad either, full sandwiches or salads and since its vegetarian (trust me, I love meat and I never miss it with this menu) its a lot of fiber so not eating a lot still fills you up. It could use a little kick in the flavor department, some items are a little bland, but overall I make it a point to order here fairly often. They have free delivery as well- not sure how far the deliver zone is, but I work by Penn's landing and they go there.
