Wow! Went to Park and Orchard Rest. last night and they were packed...of course! The Fire Steak was out of this world...and the portion with the wild rice was amazing! Usually, I get the Blackened Tuna(second to none) awesome!....or Crawfish enchiladas..incredible! The short ribs and Chicken Chili are also amazing...never know what to get! Love this place! Specials are always fantastic...and if you like great portions...look out...huge! A must try!
