We actually stumbled on this gem by looking on yelp.  I can not say enough positive things about this place.  Had we discovered it at the beginning of our trip we may have eaten all of our meals there.   The staff was on top of everything.  I had read a few reviews saying that you will never run out of water and it's true.  It was almost like the guy that was refilling the water glasses was on a mission that he could not fail.  Every time I took a sip he topped me off. I had also read another review that said to try the olives.  I didn't see olives on the menu and didn't order anything with olives so I almost didn't ask for any.  If you are a fan of olives, ask for a side of them.  They are some of the best olives I have ever had. I ate everything on my plate and then some.  I had the meal with mozzarella and egg plant and my boyfriend ate the chicken and sausage meal.  If we weren't adults (and it was socially acceptable) we totally would have picked up our plates and licked them... and even so I am amazed that we didn't actually do that. If you are in the area and looking for an inexpensive, delicious meal (that will change the way you look at Olive Garden forever), this place is mandatory.
