Huge fans! Huge! Denny and I loved Da Andrea back in the day when it was on Hudson Street and we, of course, followed it over to 13th Street. Thankfully the charming staff is the same, the service is wonderful and you feel welcomed when you arrive. But the food---it's outstanding! The ingredients are always super duper fresh and all the dishes are cooked just perfectly. Everything's excellent but Den and I especially love the warm octopus salad, grilled calamari, squid ink tagliolini with clams, and the papardelle with sausage with the most marvelous touch of truffle oil. And what's more, it's very, very affordable. Hands down, it's the best Italian for miles and Denny and I can never get enough of this place. Da Andrea....Da Licious!
