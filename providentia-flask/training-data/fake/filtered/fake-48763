Came in with 3 friends and we started with 4 different cocktails, everyone tasting each others, the drinks are innovative and very flavourful. We then decided to order pretty much everything on the menu to share so we could experience every dish. I have to say that each dish is unique as well as delicious. The menu is well thought out and creative, using great quality ingredients. The Smoked Char Rillette and Beef Tendon puffs got everyone's attention and surely a great sign of what was to come. Everything that followed was met with pleasure sighs and positive comments. The Ribeye melts in your mouth and was cooked to a perfect medium rare, the Gnocchi is out of this world! The desserts are suberb and original. The service is fantastic, not one Â detail was overlooked. Bravo. I look forward to returning.
