Sarelli's is one of our favorite restaurants. The food and service are always excellent.  We travel from Brooklyn just to enjoy their food. I can't understand the tow similar poor reviews here. I wonder if they are referring to another restaurant. This is a Northern Italian restaurant. At least one reviewer seemed to miss the "Northern" part.   We especially like the "Portobello Gorgonzola" appetizer. For Entrees, two of our favorites are "Pollo all'Abbruzzese" and Pollo Scarpariello".  These may not be on the newest menu but the management will most likely be happy to prepare them for you.  It's always a good idea to ask about price when ordering off menu.
