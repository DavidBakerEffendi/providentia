The food is fine and affordable, but when I asked for another glass of wine they refused to serve me.  Mind you I wasn't intoxicated, I only had one glass of wine.  But they have this "policy" when they serve you dessert they will no longer serve you wine.  Their reason is because they don't want people to take time sitting drinking wine when they have people waiting for tables outside.  Well I feel that is ludicrous because if you had ordered a bottle of wine you would be sitting there drinking it regardless of the course.  I told the maitre d her argument was invalid and she refused to accept she was wrong. I wont be going back again after years of going there.  I would advise to find another Italian style restaurant as there are plenty others around serving the same food, for the same price.
