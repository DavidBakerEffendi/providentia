We were quite surprised to see the restaurant practically empty when we walked in on a Saturday night. Should have taken that as a clear warning - but ignored that telltale sign and walked in anyway. Â It was all downhill after that. The service was worse than brusque. The food we ordered (Tom yum soup, tom kha soup, and veg fried rice) were devoid of anything remotely resembling Thai food taste and smell. I am quite convinced that the cooks are chinese. This place is THAI in name only. Cheap - Yes. Tasty - no. Will I go there again - No way.
