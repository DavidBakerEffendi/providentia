Well, I've got to say that at the end of the day, I really work too hard for my money to pay for rudeness.  I was looking for a new Chinese Restaurant in the neighborhood, saw the reviews and decided to give a call.  I wanted delivery.  Tonight was just for me, so I was only ordering for one.  The person on the phone acted as if she was doing me a favor taking such a small order.  There was no 'thank you' or any other acknowledgement that she was ever interested in taking my order again - and, at this point, she won't.  Like I said, I work too hard to give my money away.  What ever happened to 'service with a smile?'
