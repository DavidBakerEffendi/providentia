Me and my boyfriend went to the new Elis on Election night. The staff were pleasant and they seemed to be busy but I was not impressed and I had been looking forward to going there ever since I saw the construction. I will give them a little room because maybe they were too busy because they just opened but on the other hand they own other resturaunts so they should know what they are doing. The food came out all at once. Meaning, my salad, soup appt and entree ALLL AT ONCE. The wings that my bf ordered were burned and they were frozen in the middle. The mashed potatoes were clearly boxed potatoes because they were still flaky. The steak had no taste and although the food came out in literally 10 minutes, I would rather wait to eat then eat that microwave shit.
