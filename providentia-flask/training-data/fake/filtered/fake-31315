Let me just start with a "WOW"...This is all I can say! A younger, loud, rude, dumpy, waitress ruined the dining experience for everyone! This young lady, if , one can call her a lady, scolded a customer and threw him out! Why you might ask? He told her he didn't like her and her waitressing skills. You know what? I didn't like her either! She should be fired!   The food was ok for a small town joint.  According to the other reviews this used to be Coopers Family Restaurant. If I ever travel through here again. I will stop somewhere else. I'm sorry but I cant get over the language that came out of the waitress's mouth. Seriously, if you are the owners of Riverside Restaurant, get rid of that girl. She is not good for the restaurant, customers, or your business. She continued to talk (loudly) about it long after it happened. BAD NEWS...
