i visited here on a very busy saturday night and was lucky to get a table. this is a small space but there is lots of seating for the size. I had the cauliflower which was out of this world followed by the hummus with the pita which is the best i have ever tasted. the chicken for mains which was also really good. Â i would highly recommend this spot,
