Great Thai food, and delicious. The whole fish with chili and basil, their green curry with duck, their fried soft shell crab-- I can never get tired of these dishes. I've had a hard time, lately, getting them to give me food as spicy as I'd like. I have to assure them that I know what I'm asking for when I ask for my dishes really spicy, Thai spicy. Yes, I'm Asian (even if I don't look it), I'm Korean, omigod for reals make it spicy. But how many people have I seen at the tables around me sending back their food for being too spicy? It's frustrating. It's also crowded still on weekends at mealtimes. I like to go on weekdays if at all possible, or midafternoon on weekends.
