Got a margarita pizza. First off let me say very expensive that one pie came out to 25$ with 2 simple toppings on it. Secondly the was a piece of hair in it. Â Also the sauce was bland. My table was all oily. Definitely not recommending this place might as well go down the block to Tommys. Again HORRIBLE.
