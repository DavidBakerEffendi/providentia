I've been away from the States for 2 years and man, I had crazy cravings for this. I was in love with this place when it was just the man working in the dinky hole in the wall under the Manhattan bridge. When other kids brought PB&J and ham & cheese sandwiches to field trips, my mom would never fail to pack Banh Mi for me from this. After getting back to the states the next day, I had to come here for my fill of vietnamese sandwich (just the regular one but you can choose different types of meat)....and boy was it satisfying. The bread is nicely toasted, with a good amount of roast pork, fresh cucumber, daikon (shredded pickled radish and carrots) and loads of cilantro. If you like it spicy, you can also tell the workers to add pieces of peppers or just have it on the side. If you're in the area but can't eat it then, order one and tell them to have the daikon and cilantro on the side so the bread does not get soggy. There is some seating in there but they are all against the wall, so if you want to sit around a round table or face each other, order out and have it at a near by park. Enjoy.
