I left there just 5 minutes ago!!  I purchased the smothered chicken dinner and the smothered chicken looked liked baked chicken with grease dripping from it!!!!  DISGUSTING!!  When I asked for my money back, the management team was very unprofessional and rude asking me " do I know how to cook smothered chicken?" This restaurant was very unprofessional, does not give out receipts, and the management team was church going ghetto people. Stay far away from this establishment.
