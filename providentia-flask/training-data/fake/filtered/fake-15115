We are life long gluten free, and have travelled the world in search of gluten free tasty food, without doubt Risoterria has the best thin crust gluten free pizza in the universe! we even had our first carrot cake ever! gluten free and freshly baked! just divine....cannot say enough positives, great atmosphere! service - the staff are soooo cool and customer oriented! We have been in NYC ten days and eaten there three times and taken two take-always!
