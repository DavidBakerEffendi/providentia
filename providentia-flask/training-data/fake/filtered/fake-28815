Finally Beth and Josh have their place!!! We have all been waiting for years.  Since the closing of Marlowe in 2004 this neighborhood has been sorely lacking of the "locals" theatre spot.   This new ownership at Hourglass Tavern has truly turned this place back into the great hang we need!  The food choices although fewer than the "old" Hourglass menu is all great.  I've eaten there alot over the last 12 weeks and have loved everything I ordered.  My favorite being the Braised Short Ribs.   A new wine list completes the updated menu and all bottles are $50 or under for a great selection.  And of course, remember if you want the best drink in the hood, have Beth or Josh make it for you. Enjoy!
