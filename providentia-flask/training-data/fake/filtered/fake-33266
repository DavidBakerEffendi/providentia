Went here for a friend's birthday dinner in early September. Diego and the waitress went out of their way to make it a memorable night for us. We sat in the garden for a while, then moved indoors for the dinner, and were gladly accomodated.       We shared the beet salad and octopus and lima bean apps, which were incredible. The beet salad had pistachio nuts and a hard type of shaved ricotta cheese on top that was just perfect. Really, one of the best beet salads I've tried. The lima bean and octopus bake was a nice sized portion and seasoned with garlic just right- very flavorful.     My foodie friend had the dorado fish special which she really enjoyed,  and I had the ravioli special which was delicious and a portion size that was just right. Diego, with the natural class and warm style that he has, comped my friend with a glass of wine and a birthday candle-lit flan at the end, which we gobbled up with delight, because the desert flan here is just amazing. It's a light, but luscious way to end a perfect meal.  We sat for a two and half hour meal, relaxing, talking, enjoying, everything came at the right time, and we were never made to feel that we had to hurry up and leave, because this is not that kind of place. It's set up so that you can enjoy a nice, unhurried dinner out, in the old-fasioned continental, albiet South American, way. And most importantly, you feel welcome. I feel this is an attitude which is lacking in so may restaurants in NY, and which is why Tabare is my favorite restaurant in the entire Brooklyn-Queens area. The decor alone is enough to make you want to have many more unhurried, relaxing , delicious dinners, with nice people, both diners and staff,  in the place.
