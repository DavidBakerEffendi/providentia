I LOVE the Falafel Hut. My sister and I go here every Thursday! You get amazing portions for a low and reasonable price, fantastic food and presentation, and fast service. The Hummus is always wonderful as well. Everything is always fresh. Please help keep this little treasure of a business alive- they truly work very hard!
