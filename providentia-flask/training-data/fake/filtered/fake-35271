By looking from the outside, much different then anything you would expect ... very original and awesome food!   usually a line out the door during lunch but the guys behind the counter are extremely quick & efficient.   I heard they are opening up a new store.. Does anyone know where the next location is going to be... hopefully in Hoboken, they would rake in tons of cash there! Great place overall
