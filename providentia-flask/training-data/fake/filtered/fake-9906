Clearly much has been said about how great Mama's Vegetarian is. I'm just here to add to the crowd of people in Philadelphia who cannot get on with life without some of the tastiest falafel in the city. Their timings and rapidly selling out stocks make for an adventur-esque experience especially if you don't live close-by, but i still relish the challenge of trying to get there in time and while stocks last. The Falafel, pita, salad, hummus, latkes are all to die for. and their fries are a different experience all-together. I love that they offer whole pita as an option. The prices are just right, a sandwich and my brain is shut off for the next 3-4 hours. However they accept only cash, though they have an ATM on the premises. Also if you need extra tahina sauce feel free to ask them for a container to carry it. I just love my sandwich drowned in tahina, thus. Anyways, i really have nothing great to add, the place is great, possibly the best falafel in philadelphia, and highly recommended. If they ever started delivering, i think i would die of overeating (but that would be a beautiful death =)
