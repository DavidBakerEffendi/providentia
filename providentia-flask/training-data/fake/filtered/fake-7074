The Chicken tikka Kati roll was cold and lacked flavor. The Paneer Kati roll was better. The place was super busy so I am pretty shocked the Chicken Kati roll was cold. I think I may have gotten lost in the shuffle as others who came after me were getting their orders before me. I may give it another chance but definitely not when they are super busy.
