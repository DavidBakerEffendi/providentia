This was my third visit to Eataly and the most disappointing one yet.  There was a line on Saturday afternoon to enter the main area, so we opted for the pizza/pasta-to-go area on 24th street.  We waited just 10 minutes for a pizza that was good, albeit a bit soupy.  But the kicker is that an employee jumped over the service counter exposing the soles of his shoes where food is being served, to exit the door, since there is not an opening in the counter!!! Plus multiple employees were using this area as a 'break room' and we didn't enjoy hearing their very unprofessional conversations.  How disgusting!  I don't think the health inspectors would give this behavior a passing grade!
