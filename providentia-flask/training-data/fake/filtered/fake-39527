This place is outstanding. Their kababs are the best I've ever had. The gyro platter is unbelievably good. The white and green sauce they make is a perfect accompaniment to any meal. If it wasn't so bad for you, I would eat this every day. The food is VERY filling and it'll keep you satisfied for a day or two. The MECCA sandwich is like heaven. So good. I could order everything on this menu twice, and be happy every time. Next time you need a fix on rice, amazingly slow cooked meat, or some flavors that will wake up your taste buds from the same old same old, this is the place to go.
