Nice atmosphere, but the food is lacking flavor. Everything needed a little more something. We were all looking for the salt.!! Does not have the depth or flavor of actual authentic Italian cuisine. Not like what you get in Italy.. sorry. Plus the Manager was abrasive to us and fawning over his friends. Won't be back.   Go to Paradiso or L'Angolo.  More Flavorful food and much friendlier people.
