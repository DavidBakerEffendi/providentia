If you like Mexican food and you're very patient you have to try Fiesta Hut. So far it's the best Mexican food I've ever had it blows all the other places away. The place is small and the service is slow and the hours are kinda weird because it's a family owned restaurant. So why am I giving it 5 stars? Because the food and margaritas are A-MA-ZING! Make sure you try their appetizers and entrees but the appetizers is where it's at..try them all if you're a fatty lol. Oh & the owners are really, really nice people so don't be rude!
