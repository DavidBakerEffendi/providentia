From all of the reviews here, had me thinking that I might have ended up in the wrong place. The place is tiny, in a cozy intimate manner, a couple of friends not a group kind of cozy. The menu (on the paper place mat) is very limiting with few lunch choices. I ordered the chopped lamb and eggplant lasagne, silly me thought when a menu mentions an ingredient, that it should be on your plate.  This item was mentioned under the pasta section and lacked lasagna, so it with safe to assume that it was an actual lasagne, but no; it was eggplant slices baked lasagne style with some chopped lamb, which wasn't even close to an appetite filler. With that kind of little portion, almost average  tasting dish, it is extremely over priced for it. That's all in my opinion and based on my experience. Did I mention that I went by myself on my birthday to treat myself? I was indeed, disappointed.
