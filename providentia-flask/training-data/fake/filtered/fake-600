Geno's has far better food and service than Pats, and is much more respectable. It is clean and looks good on the outside, not worn down and dirty. And as far as Joey Vento being a "lizard just trying to take your money", i can attest that he is a great guy and doesn't pull all of his stunts for business. His support for Danny Faulkner is justified. One of Philly's finest was shot cold-blooded by a ruthless criminal. There is mad evidence to support it. Aside from that, he has a brick laid for every Philadelphia Police Officer or Firefighter killed in the line of duty. On both sides of the establishment are boards laden with Police patches from around the nation.  He is a strong supporter of our troops and police forces.  My father is a police officer, and has been personally invited inside Geno's by Joey Vento himself.  He said the inside is incredibly clean, and Vento was a real nice guy.  So what if he states his opinion? Its his business, and his opinions are correct. People are just too afraid to recognize it.
