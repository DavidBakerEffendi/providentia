food was delicious i have nothing but great things to say - drinks were even better - i had this watermelon mojito and it just hit the spot. Â i had the server surprise me since I couldn't decide on what to get (it all just sounded so good!), anyhow he picked the dish with the poached eggs, chips and i think it came on a griddle - whatever it was, it was amazing and blew my taste buds out of the water... top notch place here.
