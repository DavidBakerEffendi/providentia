I had my first experience today for brunch and the staff were very friendly and accommodating. I had chicken and waffles which I never had anywhere before and was excellent! Decor was well done and clean, warm and cozy even in the small space. I met the owner who was really sweet and friendly! Being a resident of the lower east, it's great to have those types of places!
