I ate the "Yacht Rock Shrimp Burger" It looked as if it had some sort of magic nose golbin topping and now I have food poisoning, my asshole won't stop leaking, and the server "Rob" was a Cowboys fan and he kept trashing my Eagles gear. Not so great food (unless you have an eating disorder), with bad service.
