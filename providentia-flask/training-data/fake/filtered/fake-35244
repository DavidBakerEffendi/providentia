This is honestly one of my favorite restaurants/cafe. I always always always order the Milanese panini. It's soooooooo good. I'm carving one as I'm typing this. I love the pesto sauce, the tomatoes, the chicken cutlet, the panini bread, and everything (even though I've listed everything in the panini, including the panini itself). I honestly suggest you to try the Milanese. It's small for $5 but it's so delicious, it's worth it. I've tried the dessert with nutella (sorry, I forgot its name). It is delicious. It's $1, kind of small, but so good.
