This is my first yelp review. I normally don't care for doing reviews but my girlfriend urged me to set up an account so we could spin the wheel. She gave it a spin and she won a free cocktail. She had some lavender drink which was good, but I was in the mood for something stronger. Luckily they have good selection of Whiskies at the bar so I had a Laphroaig on the rocks. Â We started with an order of chicken wings and a sushi roll. The roll was slightly fried and was delicious and they must have wizards in the kitchen cause the wings were some of the best I ever had. For the main coarse we shared a bowl of their udon soup which was great with tempura shrimp and veggies. Our server, who was very sweet, almost talked us into a dessert but we were pretty full. That's something for next time. One last thing that I must mention is the look of the place. It has a very rustic and warm atmosphere and the moving art on the walls is one of the coolest things I have ever seen.
