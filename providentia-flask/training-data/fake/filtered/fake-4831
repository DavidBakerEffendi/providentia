I frequent the Redstone Tavern for dinner approximately twice per month.    The staff is always extremely helpful and friendly.    They have a great selection of reasonably priced items on the menu and I have always liked whatever I have chosen. I recommend the Red Stone to my friends and coworkers.   - Delia / Wayne NJ
