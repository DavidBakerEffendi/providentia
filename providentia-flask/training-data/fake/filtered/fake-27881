To quote the eminently quotable Jay-Z (who happens to be a Lucali patron), "What more can I say?" This place is amazing - Grimaldi might get the lionshare of attention (to note: 1827 reviews), but this place is better. Get a calazone, order a pie (or 2), and BYOB (that's right), you will not be disappointed. NB: Cash only (which, knowing the hustler that Jay-Z is, shouldn't be a problem for him; however, it might be a slight issue for you, if you're not on the street corner hustling); No reservations (just like Bourdain says); and BYOB. So grab some wine from around the block, get there early, and be prepared to huddle up outside as you wait your turn to get inside to the promised land that is Lucali. Boom goes the dynamite.
