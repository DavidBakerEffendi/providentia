I have been visiting here with my sisters since 2004.  We always order the "lunch special" even after hours.   It is a GIANT bargain.   The veggie egg roll is AMAZING!!! It is the ONLY eggroll I have ever had that isn't soggy and nasty.  It is perfectly crispy and fresh inside!  The customer service isn't the best, because the staff doesn't really speak English, but who cares?! It is the best Chinese food that we have had and we travel 40 mins to go there.  Even our friends that don't like Chinese, like it here!  Also, where else can you eat Chinese food and not feel horrible afterward?  NO WHERE!   Broccoli and garlic sauce is our favorite dish.  The broccoli is always cooked to perfection.  Any other place I know cooks broccoli until its partially digested before you even eat it. This place is a diamond in the rough.
