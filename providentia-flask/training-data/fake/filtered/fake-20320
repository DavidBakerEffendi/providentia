Will never come here ever again! Sake has the worst food and service ever! It took forever just for a glass of water! Everything looked fine at first, but then, everything turned into a disappointment soon after. My husband and I sat at the hibachi table. We ordered lobster & scallop and filet mignon & steak. We waited for almost half an hour when we got our drinks. We waited another half hour to get salad and soup, but when I ate my salad, I found a hair in it and the soup was fine, but a lacking a little flavor. I didn't want trouble so I didn't complain. I wanted a refill on my water, but it took forever and I said forget it. When the hibachi chef came out, he wasn't friendly nor unfriendly. He wasn't REALLY entertaining, but just enough to pass. The filet mignon and steak I got was a little extra salty and so it was then I told a waiter to get me water. I drank until the saltiness had gone. My husband didn't seem too happy about the food either so we left, not eating much. So in all, worst place ever and definately NOT coming back.
