BE WARY of the CHICKEN ! used to love this place, in fact live around the corner, but after taking 3 guests there recently and all ordering the Chicken Box, we all suffered horribly, in fact two weeks on I'm still suffering from a bacterial infection from the food poisoning.  Another friend of mine also discovered uncooked chicken there one night, and sent it back.  Clearly the place is now too busy and popular for them to have the time to properly keep and cook their chicken, shame, it used to be great but I will not be going back.  Stick to the biscuit.
