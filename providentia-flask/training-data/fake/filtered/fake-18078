the old man who is the manger or owner behind the register w/ the glasses is one of the rudest people i have ever seen. Don't know why i went back. If you are getting anything but a burger, go somewhere else. place is old, needs a makeover and even the waiters and waitresses are forced to where uniforms it looks like they have been using over and over for years. Just has a dirty feel to it.
