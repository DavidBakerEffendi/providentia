I Do Not want to come to back this place anymore! Not because of food, just because of service here is terrible! Their food is about average level, just like elsewhere chinese restaurant that I have been before! But the waiter are extremely rude! Â I wait on the table, and I see there is only lady is taking the order! And I see there is some other waitress stand on the side! I don't understand why they don't take my order instead of just watching!!! I just think they must have a horrible management. BECAUSE of a good restaurant can't live without good management!!! And again, You don't need to get chinese food in this bad mangement restaurant. Instead of this, You can go to any other chinese restaurants in this area beside this! I guranteed that you will get chinese food much better than this!!!
