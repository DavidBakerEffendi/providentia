Meh....had better....way better. Now, I know it may seem unfair to compare this bbq joint to real bbq joints in the South (or even the Midwest), but, I've been there and tried them, so i cannot help it. The pulled pork was moist and tender but lacked even the smallest scintilla of flavor. Actually, three or four different employees insisted that I cover the pork in vinegar to make it taste good. I did, and alas! vinegar pork....yuck. The baby back ribs and Memphis ribs both suffered from the same 2 flaws:  charred and no meat.  I arduously worked my way through the ribs only to be rewarded by tiny bites of meat (and trust me, I'm not the type of person that only eats the lean parts of the rib). Furthermore, I had to ignore the prevalent taste of char and burnt flesh in order to even down the meat. I think it is an insult to the city of Memphis to name your mediocre (at best) ribs after the rib capital of America. (Doing so was probably also insulting to Memphis Monroe, who I am sure enjoys a good slab of ribs after a hard day's work). The sides were also mediocre. There was absolutely nothing special about the corn on the cob and the sautéed okra was plain.  On the upside, the mac and cheese was good (actually, it was pretty amazing). However, who frequents an expensive restaurant just for one side? I give them 2 stars only because the staff and service were spectacular. If I ever go back it will only be because Philadelphia lacks bbq places--especially in UCity.
