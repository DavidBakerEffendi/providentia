This is a great neighborhood spot that isn't too romantic or too trendy, but also not too casual. Just right.  I've had dinner here with just my boyfriend and then meals here with my family (8 of us) and I've never had a bad experience.  The food is great, and they have their own veggie garden to boot!  But the prices - the prices are unheard of in a city restaurant with a full bar.  Seriously, you can get a very full meal for $15 per person.  My brother actually requests we go there when everyone in my family comes to town.  The service is excellent.  During our last "big family" outing the waiter made everyone laugh, he was well spoken and made the kids at the table feel pretty important.  Really - first class service.  I gotta hand it to this place - they have their act together.
