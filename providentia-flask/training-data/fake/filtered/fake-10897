This place is absolutely fantastic. First of all, it is pretty weird. I mean, they play music that sometimes skips, they have a counter in front that is empty except for a few flans, they have a faded menu on the wall and an entirely different menu written down in broken English, and half of the stuff available on a given night is on neither menu. BUT it is really, really tasty, very authentic, the waitresses and staff are super chill and friendly, and the portions are huge and cheap. I highly recommend the tacos al carbon, but the best idea is just to ask the waitress if there are any specials, and pick something you've never heard of before. Chances are you'll like it. Â It was also BYOB at one point but now this is unclear. They may get a liquor license soon. If you are unpretentious and just like to eat lots of delicious inexpensive Mexican food, this is place for you. If you are stuck up and prefer style over substance, you're better off elsewhere.
