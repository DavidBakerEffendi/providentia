So disappointing.  After all the glowing reviews I had expected some seriously good BBQ...especially the brisket. Well, after trying this place twice and being completely disappointed I thought I would try it just one more time.  Results....the same.  While the space is not bad and the staff is quite friendly, the food is average.  They have been open for months now and you still can not get any french fries as they don't have a fryer.   They installed a 5000 lb. BBQ smoker but couldn't figure out how to get a deep fryer going? Seriously though...the brisket is just average.  Single serving portions are small and so are the sides that come with it or purchased separately. Hill Country BBQ on 26th Street serves amazing BBQ in comparison.  Mighty Quinn's should send a spy to reverse engineer their brisket.   We truly hoped for better in the East Village.  Perhaps the new BBQ place opening at the old Lucky Cheng's space on First Avenue will offer better fare.
