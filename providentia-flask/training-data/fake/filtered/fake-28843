Not worth all the hype!!!!!! Okay so where do I begin. Well my buddy Nick told me about this amazing place called "Potatopia". So last week I tried it out. When I got in there, it looked like a nice place. The food smelled amazing. When I got the register a short women took my order. Not the most politest girl but ehh. She convinced me to get a "smash hit" so I said hey why not if it's the best seller. Now here's when every thing goes down south. She told me it would only take 2-3 minuets Tops. It took me 10 MINUTES to get it. -.- I told them no cilantro and they added cilantro -.-". This "awesome Potatopia" my friend told me about was not how he explained it. The "great" customer service I heard so much about wasn't there and I didn't even enjoy my food. Not worth $8 -.-. For all that I can cook a potato in my own home.
