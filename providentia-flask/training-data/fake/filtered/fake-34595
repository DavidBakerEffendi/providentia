I've been a fan of the Philadelphia Chutney Company for the past year and a half. This is the only place to get both modern/unique and authentic Dosa's in Philadelphia. I've had Dosa's at other Indian restaurants around different parts of the city, but they always pale in comparison. The prices are reasonable, and the menu offers other traditional southern Indian cuisine (Medhu Wada, Idli), as well as vegan options (!). The staff is warm, friendly, and very informative to their customers about the menu. Having their only location in Center City, this diamond in the rough attracts a lot of newcomers to this unique restaurant, so it helps to have an insightful staff. HOWEVER, I've stopped by here for lunch a few times this summer, and with the current heatwave bursts it can be pretty brutal inside. They have no air conditioner, which can be excruciating to some while eating spicy food. Other than the miserable heat, I sometimes have to endure the painful sounds of current pop hits playing over the restaurants speakers. I understand that this is a modern Indian restaurant, but this kind of food does not go well together with the music. It creates a confusing vibe. How about something more soothing? I eat out to relax, or to get away for just an hour. I imagine the heat must be unbearable for the staff to work in all day long too, which isn't such a positive thing for customers either. Overall this is a gem of a restaurant that I can see expanding in Philadelphia once Philadelphians catch on! Great food, great staff, reasonably priced. FYI: they don't take credit card tips (why?), and this is not a wait staff restaurant (meaning you grab your food and sit down), so bring cash.
