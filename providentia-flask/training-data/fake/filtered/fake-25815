I was visiting my friends in New York and they recommended me this place...I went for it and you know what?? NO REGRETS! Absolutely delicious food and great service! I ordered their Lentil salad with a couple of stix, my friends got their lunch specials...the atmosphere, the music, the food - everything was great! And their COFFEE!!! Their coffee is amazing. I was especially impressed by the service. Don't get to see a good service in LA that much... Anyway, STIX is now one of my favorite places in NY:)
