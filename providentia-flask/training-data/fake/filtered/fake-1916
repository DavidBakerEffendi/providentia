Ditto almost what everyone else has been saying. Waited 1 1/2 hours to sit. Ordered. Waited 1 hour with no food, then when it came the order was wrong. They ran out of everything and substituted it without mentioning it. And no, whatever came was not worth the wait or price. Pretty average to bad. Just a good night gone terribly wrong. Too bad cause its in such a cool spot, nice sunsets and all.
