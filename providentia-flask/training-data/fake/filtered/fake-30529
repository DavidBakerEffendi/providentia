The first time I visited Continental Midtown was in 2007.  Service was horrible and food was mediocre.  On Saturday, July 24, 2010, we visited Continental on Market Street and again it was a complete disappointment.  Service was good; however, food and drinks were horrible.  Food was left untouched without our server asking if something was wrong with the dishes and corrections made.  Calamari was overdone and their invention of the french onion soup dumplings were a disaster. Drinks had no alcohol in them whatsoever.  The best thing about this restaurant is the lobster macaroni and cheese with orzo pasta.
