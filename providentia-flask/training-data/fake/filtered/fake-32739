Great wine selection and the wine-shot idea, great!!! The thin crust Pizza, amazing. The Steak and potatoes, the lamb, and the lasagna, all great plates. Now as far as the dessert, I don't know what they offer because every time I go the Baby Jesus is all I get. Very simple but very very tasty. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone.
