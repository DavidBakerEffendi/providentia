Though the atmosphere was very nice and the service was good the food Â was poor. Obvious that they need to change the chef. Our salads were pre made including the Capresse, they were so cold and dried out that it was tasteless. Mussels had a strange taste because they had ham in the seafood broth. I had the gnocchi s which sounded great, again disappointed. The sauce had not been cooked down so it was like water, and the gnocchi were terribly heavy. All our other meals were equally as poorly prepared. Last the cappuccino was cold and made with heavy cream. It was 8 pm on a Friday night and pretty empty, now we understand why, it's a shame cause it's a cute place
