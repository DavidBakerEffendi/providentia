Five Leaves is great. I wanted a burger the other night and my cousin who lives in Greenpoint said this was the place to go. We had burgers and beers and it was a great dinner atmosphere. I don't like a stuffy place and I'm real fickle about my burger. But I enjoyed this. I don't get out this way much because I'm on the other side of Brooklyn. Check it out when you're in town.
