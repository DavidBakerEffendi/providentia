Never going back! My friends and I stopped by this place today lured by promising "paleo", "organic", "foods for humans" etc. First, it was rather expensive. We paid $50 for meatloaf, side vegetables and beer for two. Then, the food tasted more like a cardboard, beer wasn't really a beer. And most importantly, I got sick after having this food. Never would recommend to anyone. Giving one star just for a great concept (I would have given five stars for the concept, but the negative experience and my not feeling well after this dinner don't allow me to do so, unfortunately).
