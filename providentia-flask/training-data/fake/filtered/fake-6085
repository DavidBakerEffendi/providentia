Thumbs down. My mom and I decided to order some food from OBAO online. It took nearly an hour. My mom had to call the restaurant, and we waited about another half an hour. This also happened before. The food is okay. The Pho Bo tastes good, but last time when I ordered pork chops they were dry and hard to eat. I'm not coming back. I'd give a one but the food tastes good. The service is also rude. My mom called, before, when we were ordering food, my mother was saying how our food wasn't yet here after waiting 60 minutes. The person on the other end argued with my mother, saying he recieved ONLY 40 MINUTES AGO. We only live about a few avenues away. *I have eaten at the restaurant in person. But the food was still eh. And the food also took a bit to get to the table.
