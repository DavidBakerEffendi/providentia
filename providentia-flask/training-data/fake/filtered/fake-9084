While it is sometimes difficult to find a nice seafood restaurant in central NJ, the Blue Point is a nice BYOB seafood restaurant that features freshh, high quality seafood. Recently, I tried the skate special which was a little pricey, but fantastic.  My boyfriend tried the Halibut which was also great.  The soup, shrimp appetizers, and calamari were great appetizers. Not too much to report on the desert menu, but there are a number of options close by.
