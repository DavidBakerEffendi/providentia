Everything but the price about this place is perfect. Been coming here for at least 7 years, since before it was renovated and put under new management. Still as great, although a little pricier and better looking. Buck a shuck is unbeatable, the oyster selection is fantastic, and the fried oysters are to die for. Oh and don't miss out on the clam chowder. You really can't go wrong.
