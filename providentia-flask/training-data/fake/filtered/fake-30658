What a wonderful addition to Fishtown.  The food is wonderful and the atmosphere is very charming.  It's fun to see the chefs/owners working in the open kitchen creating such great dishes.  Four of us dined and each enjoyed their food immensely.  I had the onion soup and the beef bourgvignon and enjoyed every bite.  It's great to see a restaurant of this caliber in the area.  I wish them a long stay in the neighborhood.
