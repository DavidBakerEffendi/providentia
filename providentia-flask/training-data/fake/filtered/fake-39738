Just got back from a girls night at Talula's Garden and I feel it's safe to say that this was hands down the best dining experience of my life. My first impression of the restaurant was the beautiful and homey decor. Everything looked amazing and the atmosphere is indescribable. The customer service here was phenomenal. I felt as though all of the employees treated my friends and I like we were part of their family. Our main course came out quickly and our waitress was able to describe our meals to us with such detail. I ordered one of the cheese plates. Everything was paired so well and you could tell that even the order of the cheese on the plate was well planned. Our desert orders took a little longer than usual to arrive, but when they did, they arrived with many apologies and they did not charge us for them. In addition to our complimentary deserts, we received sea salt caramel chocolates on the house. Honestly, I was a little hesitant to go here at first when I saw the prices on the menu. I am not usually one to pay such a hefty price for a meal, but every cent was absolutely worth it. The desert alone was enough to put my friends and I into heaven. When asked at the end of our meal how we enjoyed it, we could only say that we were intoxicated from the food (and none of us ordered cocktails or wine!) Next time I go back (which will hopefully be soon), I hope the outside garden seating is open!
