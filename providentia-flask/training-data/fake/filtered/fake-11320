Took one of my dates there (it was more of a casual relaxed date, she didn't want it to be super fancy!) and it was really cool! Besides the fact that there is a lot of tricks and turns to find the food court you somehow enjoy the mounds and mounds of products they have there! As other reviewers said its quite the place to get lost! It's fascinating to see the many types of food and they were definite topic starters. I have to say that their ravioli there was so very good! Light but filling and the pistachio touch was unexpected but so delicious. I wish they gave more per serving it was that delicious. I also picked up some of their products, mostly their coffee, to have some for my morning cup and the price for the bag was pretty intense I was so glad I invested on such a great quality of coffee. Overall, I liked the place and hope to return soon! When in doubt guys, try the personal pizza. It wont disappoint. Or the ravioli.
