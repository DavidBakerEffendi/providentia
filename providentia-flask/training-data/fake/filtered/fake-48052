Very good. During the summer you can usually get seated during weekend brunch pretty quickly as long as you're willing to sit inside. Their eggs Benedict are very good although somewhat small. I went for the beet and pear salad to start; my friend had a hummus dish. I loved the salad the dressing was unreal. We both followed with Orlin Burgers once again cooked to perfection (my perfection being very well done....don't scream at me foodies!) The service was swift and the staff attentive without being intrusive. Would definitely go back!
