We had Valentines Day dinner here and were blown away!!!! Rose peddles greeted us on the tables, chocolate croissants were given to us as we left (a total surprise) and what came in-between was amazing!!! I could make a meal out of the housemade bread alone, but didn't have to. We had the 5 course tasting menu that showcased everything from fancy lobster and foie gras to simple baked clams and beef tartare. This was our second visit and we will be going back soon. This month they were showing work from a local photographer, and we are dying to use him for our upcoming wedding. Picked Heron...keep up the good work!!!!
