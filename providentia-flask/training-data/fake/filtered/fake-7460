I haven't actually eaten at any of the restaurants within eataly, but the foccacia pizza is ridiculously good.  Only $2.80 and it still feels like you're eating something fancy.  gooooooooooooooooood comfort food!  The place itself is uncomfortably crowded at all times which is the only thing that sometimes keeps me from going there.
