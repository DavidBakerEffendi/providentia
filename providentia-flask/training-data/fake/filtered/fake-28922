Okay, I cannot believe some of these reviews. I have been going to Baja's for about nineteen years now. People are like "oh the fish taco's are terrible." Before the economy hit hard Mexicans would go there constantly. You know the food is good if someone who is true to the race actually enjoys the food. The fish tacos are freshly made, and are not frozen like Rubio's or Chili's claiming their fajita's are better. I don't think so. Baja's has been in business for years because their food is consistently good, and consistently fresh. Don't try to tell me another Mexican place is better, I grew up with Baja's always being delicious. Now, yes it is a little big expensive, so it's a nice treat every once in a while, but that does not lower the quality of their food. Â Authentic Mexican food for sure. Five stars. Kudos guys.
