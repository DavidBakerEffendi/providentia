My wife and I traveled from cleveland ohio to try Gino's an Pats! What a dissaponitment! We were so disappointed that we continued on a quest for a good tasting cheesesteak. We heard about Ishkabibbles and decided to give it a try. OMG! This place was worth the trip!! Great tasting sandwich. Good porpotions, enough that we shared the sandwich! Piping hot seasoned very well! Â This place beat out the aforementioned places hands down!! A must try when you come to Philly!
