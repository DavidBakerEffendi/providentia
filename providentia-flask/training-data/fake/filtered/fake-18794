when they first opened the food and service were very good, but now, the Manager seems to have more interests in woman then the establishment. the service is sub standard. my son and i waited over 15 minutes for a Gyro... and when i asked the manager what the delay was.. he yelled from across the room "some food takes time".... super unprofessional and embarrassing. When the food came, it was cold and the lamp my son order was sparse...
