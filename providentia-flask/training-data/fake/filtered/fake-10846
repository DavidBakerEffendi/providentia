Oh my gosh! This place is amazing. I've always been a fan of Boiling Crab in California but this place has them beat. The staff is super friendly, the ambiance is warm with a bar of select beers & spirits that are hard to find elsewhere and the food... AH-FRICKIN-MAZING. Thanks to Jenny & Asa for making our experience so pleasurable & see u soon. As a foodie, this will be a near weekly indulgence. (From Quia & Kira)
