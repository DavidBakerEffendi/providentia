This is by far my favorite restaurant! Not only is the Italian food fabulous, but the atmosphere is exceptional. The service is great too! When we want folks to feel special this is where we bring them (and we've brought a lot). Luca's is legendary among our out of state friends who request a visit upon their arrival to NJ. Rarely a week goes by that my husband and I don't have a meal at Luca's...needless to say, I'm a big fan!
