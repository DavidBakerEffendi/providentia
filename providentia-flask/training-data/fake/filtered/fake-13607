The food is not nearly as good and a lot more expensive than other Vietnamese restaurants in Chinatown (e.g. Nha Trang One).  The last time we had the vermicelli noodles, it had a strange soapy like taste.  I called to complain but was told that the noodles were probably still on the wet side (however that doesn't explain the awful taste).  Perhaps that's one reason why they received a "B" rating.
