Place is filthy. No air. Full of smoke from burning pizzas. Incredibly rude staff. Pizza is just hyped up by in what I assume to be non NYers who grew up on Dominos. What's the appeal about an old guy who's as slow as molasses making pizza?  $5 a slice? Are you people mad? People rave about the cheese. Next time you go pay attention. He uses BelGioso fresh mozzarella and Polly-o plus parmagianno regianno. Wake up folks. You're being conned. oh yeah and this is from the NYC.gov website - dept of health: a816-restaurantinspectio… Violations from 07/28/2010 Inspection Violation points: 26 Violations were cited in the following area(s).
