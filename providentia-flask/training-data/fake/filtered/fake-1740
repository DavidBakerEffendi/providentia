Don't get what the hype is all about.. food sucks.. customer service sucks.. cant make a booking for weeks ahead of time.. so done with this place The waiter spilled some pisco sour over my blouse and what does he do ... ya .. looks at me like I did it. what a jerk! and then I have to request him to get me another drink. customer service these days has gone out the window. never coming back here ever again!
