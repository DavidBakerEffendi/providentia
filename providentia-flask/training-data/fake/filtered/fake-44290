The food is very tasty and fresh. The ambience is pleasant and the service is excellent. And--the prices are low. We were five at dinner and everyone was really pleased with the meal. I had Beef with Eggplant in Garlic Sauce which was great. I tasted the General Tso's Chicken which I found very good as well. Parking is easy.
