I went with my husband and son for Sunday brunch. This is a busy, vibrant place with warm atmosphere and some creative touches to the decor. We took a walk while we waited for a table. There is some interesting architecture in the neighborhood. We ordered Bloody Marys, which were appropriately spicy. (We opted for the "regular" as opposed to the version with shrimp, etc.) I had shrimp and grits -- lots of shrimp and the grits were creamy and good. The boys had eggs with anduoille and bacon -- also great. The beer list looked interesting. The service was friendly and timely. Clearly the staff enjoys working there.
