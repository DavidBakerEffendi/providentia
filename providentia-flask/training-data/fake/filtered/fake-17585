My First successful trip to a place using the Maps app OMG. I ordered a "the best bloody Mary" and scrambled eggs with ham. Strangely it comes w a side of mixed greens. The bloody Mary was banging! It's was hot n spicy just the way I like it and the eggs were very tasty. The waitress kept refilling our waters.. that important. I enjoyed the mixed greens and the conversation. Only con was our table was too close to our neighbors.. it's like we went to brunch with strangers! I would def recommend this place!
