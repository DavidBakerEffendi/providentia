It is an experience thing, and something fun to do.  Buy one at each place,  cut them in half,  or um, tear them in half, and share the halves with a significant other or friend, etc and compare them. By the way,  its not racist to ask a person to order in a language that the person taking the order can understand.  It is racist however, to insist someone learn the language you want to order in because you refuse to assimilate and learn the language of your adopted country. Ive been to other countries,  and I assure you,  they expect you to learn their language if you want to live there.
