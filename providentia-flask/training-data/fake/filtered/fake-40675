I usually don't do tourist trap type restaurants, but for some reason Lombardi's got me. The whole first pizzeria thing really drew me in, and I was little disappointed with the pizza. It wasn't bad, it just wasn't great. We had the original pizza and it was just above average. Everything about the pizza (toppings, tomato sauce, crust, cheese) were all just above average. The only saving grace is the historical value of the place. My suggestion if you want great New York style pizza, go somewhere else. If you want the historical/tourist experience with decent pizza, try Lombardi's.
