Cookshop provided a wonderful meal with service to match in an atmosphere that nearly lives up to the rest of the experience.. An interesting variety of breads was served with a horseradish-flavored pot cheese. Appetizers of burata with pickled eggplant and a lone, lovely stuffed squash blossom were consumed with wholehearted glee. Our lovely server suggested a robust Cabernet to go wth my lamb served three ways. The star of this trio was the merguez. Once again plates were cleaned.
