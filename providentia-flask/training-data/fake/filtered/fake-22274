I always enjoyed the food, but the last time i ordered from here while at work it was a horrible experience. After waiting for 2 hours I finally called the restaurant and asked where my food was, the woman said the driver could not find us??? I was very confused because I gave them my phone number and no one bothered to call. When i asked the woman why no one called she simply said she gave my number to the driver, then she insisted he was here to deliver my food at that moment. 20 minutes later the food finally arrived. When i asked the delivery man if the food was free since we ordered 2 hours ago he said " no, what do you want me to do Im just the driver". I paid $31 for cold food, a crushed cheesecake and they forgot my soda. This is not how you run a business. MY COWORKERS AND I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THERE AGAIN!
