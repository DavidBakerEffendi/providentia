Wow, Saraghina.  We live in the neighborhood, and we probably get Seraghina take out twice a month.  The pizza is outstanding: Grimaldi's style but smokier.  Really, this is better then Grimaldi's pizza.  I always get the Bufala margherita pizza, which is incredible.  The pasta specials (which change daily) are outstanding.  In particular I've enjoyed an amazing spaghetti with clam sauce, and a kind of thick pasta with beef ragu. In warmer weather, we'll sometimes eat there (instead of take out), because the space is so incredibly charming/ romantic.  But we have kids, so we don't want to ruin the charm/ romance for everyone else...  (Note to parents: go between 5 and 6pm and the place is full of other families.  Go after 7 and you will seriously annoy the other [child-free] patrons.)  In all seriousness, the decor is stunning: has a sort of rustic Italian barn feeling.  During the summer, the garden is so gorgeous, it feels like you're transported to another world. Here are the only cons (which in my mind don't detract from my five star rating because the food is so outstanding): 1. They don't take orders over the phone.  I mean, I understand that they don't deliver, but it would be SO much easier if we could order before we come to pick up instead of ordering there and then waiting for the food.  This is a pizza place, after all... 2.  It's expensive, especially for Bed Stuy.  Spending $17 on a personal pizza is a little ridiculous.  But there are so few other options nearby, that we do it.  Like I said above, the food is worth it, but if it were a little cheaper we'd be able to eat there more often. 3.  It's doesn't cater to (or attract?) locals.  Sometimes we go there and feel like we're the only people who actually live in Bed Stuy.  I mean, of course I LOVE that people come to the neighborhood to eat, because it's great for the local economy.  But it would be nice to see more locals frequenting the establishment, a la Peaches down the street.
