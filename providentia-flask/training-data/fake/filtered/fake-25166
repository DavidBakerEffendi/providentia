I called tonight to ask for delivery service.  Apparently I had an outdated delivery menu, from which I had ordered before.  When the woman who answered the phone informed me that the meat entree I asked for was no longer on the menu, I asked her what entrees were available.  She responded that she was not sure, because the entrees change frequently, but they were all on the website.  I asked her if she could please just tell me what the entrees were, and she responded that a customer had just walked in, had been standing there for a minute or so, and she needed to wait on him.  She said that I "should just look at the website."  I did not have time to do that, I was in a fairly hectic situation and wanted to order food.  I will never again call this restaurant for delivery.  Nor will I ever go there again.  The woman who answered the phone was unprofessional, impatient, and very immature.
