I signed up just to write this review. This place is pretty hit and miss. You either get the hipster vegans who look at you the wrong way if you eat gluten or the nice hipsters who serve good food. Either way, the food is always pretty good. A little pricy, but good. The main problem comes in when getting delivery. I've gotten delivery from these guys five times now, and most of the time something is a little wrong. Usually not as bad as it is tonight, but the last time I got a drink with my order it was only lemonade and didn't kill my meal if a little spilled. Tonight I got some veggie flatbread and a large green tea smoothie. If you are going to offer drinks for delivery, you really need to have a good way of delivery this! I am pretty sure your flatbread is supposed to be... I dunno... somewhat crunchy? Not a heaping soggy mess drenched in green tea. It might not be right to color my opinion based on one incident, but I'm pretty disappointed. Please don't offer drinks if you can't come through. I'm even willing to wait the hour for the food because it is so good and healthy (and DAMN if that Balsamic Reduction isn't the tastiest damn thing ever)... but I guess I can't get my green tea fix anymore without risking soggy sandwiches. On the bright side, as soon as I called, they offered to send me another one right out. So very nice people, very good food. But do be careful what you choose to order for delivery! These get delivered by backpack on bike!
