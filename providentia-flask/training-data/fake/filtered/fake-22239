I was in here recently and will not being going back.  The food is just okay, but the owner, Siggy, is an unprofessional and pretentious grump.  I innocently waited for my food while she publicly berated one of her employees right in front of her patrons!  She was shouting!  I don't know what the employee did (something about a phone call), but that's just no way to treat the people who work for you, especially in front of your customers.  I'm sorry, but I cannot support this sort of negative environment.  I straight up left when I saw that.  I hope that woman gets a reality check when no one wants to work for her anymore.
