We had an early dinner here last night and thoroughly enjoyed it. I had the veal Sorrentino and loved it and my friend had the risotto mare e tere.  She didn't offer me a taste since she wanted it all to herself.  We were too full for dessert.  The restaurant was quiet (you could carry on a conversation easily) despite being full and very relaxing (we sat in the back left corner which was a great location) and the staff was very friendly.  Prices were very reasonable - about what I would have paid in central Jersey.  I'll go back there the next time I go to the theater and will recommend it to friends
