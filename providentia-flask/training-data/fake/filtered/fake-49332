Pathetic indian food. I have had indian food everywhere and had never experienced a food which was so stale. I was on a business trip to this area and felt like having indian food hence found this restaurant. Seems like these guys have no idea about Indian food. Also the spread on the Buffet is so less for the price they charge. Absolute no for anybody wanting to experience indian food.
