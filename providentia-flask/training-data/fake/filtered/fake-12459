I had never tried macarons until Ladur√©e. Was online yesterday (saturday) in the early evening. Stood in line for about 1h 20m. I didn't mind - i'm a pretty patient person so I stood outside and read through the reviews. Cute location, but take it in quickly - you won't be in there long. Can't wait until they expand and turn it into a cafe. Macarons are small, about 1.5in diameter. Don't be fooled because these little treasures validate the phrase "great things come in small packages." Take one bite and you KNOW it's not made in New York. So delicate, such pronounced flavors and textures - simply amazing. I'll list descriptions below in order of preference. I tried Rose (the best - if one could eat a rose, this is probably what it would taste like) It has a creamy/airy filling that is just divine. Orange Blossom - I would say this was second best. Just try it. Pistachio - Simply amazing. If you like pistachio, you'll love this. It's the perfect consistency and blend of sweetness. just right. Caramel - a bit on the sweet side but if you love caramel this is good. Coconut - Similar in flavor to the "coconetes" from Dominican Republic, except not as sweet. Black Violet - A bit on the sweet side as well but still good. It has a jam filling. This is particularly good, but i didn't enjoy the jam filling as much. I enjoy creamy/airy fillings instead. It was worth the wait and the price. Would I wait that long again, absolutely not. Something that was particularly annoying - the asians. They were everywhere, and lacked consideration. On numerous occasions a staff member would have to leave the cash register to instruct the people on line to come in one at a time. (as one person leaves the store, another comes in) The asians just seem to have an issue following instructions. One couple leaves, 12 asians come in. That was the most annoying part.
