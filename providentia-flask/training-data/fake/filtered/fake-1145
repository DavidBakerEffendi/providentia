Made reservations for 9pm for 4 people on a Friday night and we were all on time.  The hostess didn't seat us for another 45 minutes.  The wait was excrutiating since we were all so hungry.  Aside from the tortious wait, where they didn't even comp us a drink, the food was pretty decent and reasonably priced.  We had a hamachi tartar, which seemed very fresh, a couple of the pastas which were really quite stellar, the octopus which was ok, the chicken and a couple of sides.  The drinks were pretty good and we also had a couple of desserts. Overall, the food was pretty tasty but I had to dock them 1 star due to the very long wait.
