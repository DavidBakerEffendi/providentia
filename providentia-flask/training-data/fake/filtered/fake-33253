Experienced Tabar√© last night for the first time. I had the churrasco and it was amazing. Since the meal is fairly light (the steak came accompanied with two small potato croquettes and some greens), there was room for dessert. We had the alfajor which is somewhat different than the traditional but oh so delicious. I'm not sure what other reviewers are talking about when they say that the staff is rude-- we thought they were amazing and on point. Maybe they've been reading the reviews and improved? Idk but it was great! Definitely would come back. Remember to bring CASH!
