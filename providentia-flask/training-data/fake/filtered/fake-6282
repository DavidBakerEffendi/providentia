I'm a big fan of freshmex burrito places but this place falls short.  Other reviewers were correct to point out that they put way too much rice in the burritos (and bowls).  It's a common trick and you see it at all such places, but my burrito was probably 50% or more rice, which is just unacceptable.  The guy making mine also screwed up the wrapping and tore the tortilla, and instead of making a whole new burrito he just dumped the contents onto a new tortilla that wasn't heated.  This mixed everything up so you didn't get the nice layer effect. The prices are high too and the burritos are so runny you can't eat them without napkins, burrito juice gets everywhere.  Chipotle is better in all respects and I wish they would have opened a Chipotle here instead.
