Absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in New York. The food is great, inexpensive, and the waiters are hot. The mac and cheese is a must on your order. It's so rich and creamy, like something your mother makes with her special homecooked recipe. The only downside is that you can't make reservations and it's always busy. But the food and staff definitely make up for it. I always recommend Cafeteria to my friends when they visit New York.
