I wanted to go with my friends to eat. We really wanted to try something different then your typical restaurants. So we were looking around and we found Terra Nostra! We walked in and got treated nicely! I tried the Portuguese meat called febra in wine sauce with a touch of cinnamon served with rice and the traditional round fries! Plus we tried empanadas! Yummy! Then we ended up getting desert! We got rice pudding which is to die for. It just melts in your mouth! As I was saying good service, Great for families or groups, the food is amazing one the best Portuguese restaurant I have ever been !
