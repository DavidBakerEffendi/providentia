We had reservations (4/25/14) at 6pm, left message and was told we would get a phone call to confirm.  Never happened I had to call back. Drinks where good, Crab Cake appetizer was very good.  Dinner was just ok for me, I had the salmon (on the small size, kids portion) and wife had the Lamb special.  Lamb was nothing but a very large bone in middle and fat all around, they did take the meal off the bill, but it seemed our waitress was pre occupied or just forgetful that night.  Never got salad that was ordered.  Food showed up 1 hour and 40 min. later,  leaving us only 20 min to eat since we had tickets to see a show at the Shubert. We told them did not have time to order something else or free drink, which they still brought over free wine, never drank the wine..waste. Will be sometime before we go back again.
