The service was friendly and attentive, and a complementary anniversary cake crowned a wonderful evening. I was taken by the confidence the restaurant placed in simple American cuisine and fresh, uncomplicated ingredients: the only French in sight was on the label of our Cabernet Sauvignon. Atmosphere here is just gorgeous! Since it's the Holiday season, they really hooked up the place with Holiday decor.
