The noise level makes this place a torture chamber. Which is a damn shame, because the food is terrific.  But the noise was so loud on a Sat night that the WAITER had to shout the specials.  I gave up in despair and just ordered from the menu. I couldn't hear the man sitting right next to me.  I was there with friends or would have left. Why can't American restauranteurs understand that people go out to enjoy a sensuous experience, not to have their ears -- and stomach--assaulted?
