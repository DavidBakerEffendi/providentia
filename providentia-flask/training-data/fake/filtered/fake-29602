I went to Pies n Thighs a few weeks ago.  We were seated in the farthest-back room, which was pleasant and fairly quiet.  We were seated very close to our neighbors on each side, but it was during the dinner rush so it's understandable. I ordered the chicken biscuit, hush puppies, and a mimosa.  My friend ordered fried chicken with mac & cheese and beer. The chicken biscuit was divine, mostly due to the generous amounts of honey-butter and hot sauce that dressed the sandwich.  I am a wimp when it comes to spicy foods, but the honey butter made everything better.  The hush puppies were good, but the dipping sauce--a tartar  sauce, I think--was kind of carelessly splattered in one corner of the greasy basket instead of having its own dish, and the hushpuppies were kind of plain without it.  (They made an amazing drunk leftover later though).   I order the smores pie for dessert.  The taste was great, but it was very dense and very cold--as if it had just come out of the back of the fridge.  I would have enjoyed it much more if it had been room temperature or warmed up. Lastly, our server seemed very out of it.  She took our orders kind of lazily.  When she took the order of some people next to us, she sat down at the table with them to take the order.  Then she disappeared for a while and another server brought us our food and, later, the check.  Then our original server came back and gave us the check a second time.  Then we got up to pay at the register, and she came and gave us the check a third time.  Not sure what was going on with her but she seemed like she was either sick or high.   Overall, the food was pretty good but I think they need to focus a little bit more on service and presentation.
