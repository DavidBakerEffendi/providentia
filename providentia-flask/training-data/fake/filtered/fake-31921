I come to New York a great deal with my quartet, we're always on the look out for a good bite. So far everything has been mediocre in the sense that nothing has "wow"ed us yet. Places either have quality food and horrible service or vice versa. In a recent visit to NY an associate of ours recommended a Cuban spot, typically not into Latin food but we gave it a try. OUTSTANDING! The food was absolutely exceptional, presentation was perfect, I got the filete, a filet Mignon with a cheese pastry on top that was to die for. The atmosphere was pumped, our server was the most charming girl, her name was Carolina. These ppl know their stuff, I usually like to test waiters to see them crack but not this one. Service was efficient and on the money and i guess since we were also so well behaved we earned a drink on the house! gotta love comped booze. You can only talk so much about this restaurant, you have to experience it, give it a try, you most definitely will not be disappointed. Highly Impressed, Andres Gil Prin.
