I work a half block from Spice End and finally decided to give them a try.  I ordered the Veggie Platter for delivery (sometimes its hard to sneak out of my job!) through Spice End's website.  From the picture and decription, it looked like it would be a heaping, delicious platter of grilled veggies and rice. Fifteen minutes after I placed my order, I recieved a phone call from Spice End letting me know that 1. There is a delivery minimum of $15, and 2. The veggie platter I ordered actually consits of rice and salad.  Most deceiving website EVER.  No mention of delivery minimum, if fact, it shouldn't have even let my order be placed without reaching the minimum.  Anyway, upon me asking to cancel my order, the employee on the phone suggested I try this other vegetarian option they offered, and assured me it was more of what I was looking for, so I went for it. I was able to walk over and pick up my $9 lunch, but I couldn't help notice the sign they had posted behind the counter.  It read "Sorry for the inconvenience, we do not serve tap water."  I just have to point out here that I just think its flat out rude to try and max out profit on your customers that way. Anyway, when I got back to the office, my lunch appeared very good; however I couldn't have been more wrong.  It was a dry, spicy, one-note flavor of rice and (frozen) peas and carrots, with a couple pieces of tofu and one extremely small piece of overcooked broccoli. Nothing fresh about it, and absolutley nothing like as pictured on the website (I know the pictures were for suggestion, but if all your pictures show fresh veggies and you only serve frozen, isn't that sort of a bait and switch?)  The only thing good about my meal was the naan. Probably wouldn't try them again, and definitely won't be recommending them.
