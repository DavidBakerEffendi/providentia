Who ever is leaving 4 and 5 Star reviews needs to have a serious taste bud renovation. I had dinner there on 3/10/12 and it was one of the worst meals I have ever had. The famous Chicken Savoy was so overcooked you could not cut through the top layer of Chicken, the sauce was terrible. The Shrimp Oreganata was 5 tiny overdone shrimp swimming in oily Breadcrumbs. This Place is coasting on it's old reputation and mystique. When the waitress was told the Kitchen destroyed the food she said "Yeah I know" and walked away. Save your money don't go!
