This place is fantastic - small, legitimate gem - it is absolute top quality food, simple Italian ingredients all mixed just the right way.  It is still undiscovered, but I won't be surprised if there are soon lines out the door for these paninis.  They are truly that good.... easily could become another Torrisi, etc.  I can't believe how good the food is and can't wait to go back!  (One panini is easily 2 meals - saved half for dinner every time).
