I came here to pick my husband up one night since him and a bunch of the other grad students had just finished their quarter.  I parked my car behind Bar.  I went in and the guy id-ed me and let me go in.  I found my husband and gave him my amex card to pay for the drinks.  Then I went looking for the bathroom.  I saw a large staircase right in front of where I had come in and like MOST places in New Haven, I thought the bathroom would be downstairs.  IMMEDIATELY 2 guys ran to me (all 5 ft and 100 lbs) and told me I had to leave now.  I was confused as to why I was being kicked out, and they said it was for "trying to go downstairs"  WHAAAT?  Apparently they thought I was trying to steal liquor!  ( I assume this is a problem they have had before?)  There was no sign saying "do not enter"- and this was my first time here so I had no idea where the bathroom was.   I ended up leaving and my husband came with, but forgot the card because we were in a bit of a frenzy.  I called a couple days later and the woman was very rude on the phone and said she cut up all the cards that morning.   I would rather slit my wrists then give this place business.  I think the doormen are on a power trip and I think they desperately need signs, one saying "DO NOT ENTER" - and another labeling where the bathroom is! When I went to the parking lot, someone had backed over the hood of my car, basically smooshing part of the hood, so I could not open it.  Needless to say I will not be back.
