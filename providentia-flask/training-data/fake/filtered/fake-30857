i just created a yelp account so i could respond to the dude who loves farrell's so much.  i have lived in windsor terrace for five years and park slope before that for six more.  and i grew up in staten island.  this barely makes me an import to the neighborhood, and i love giving local bars a chance to accept me. in fact, i love rhythm and booze, 12th st, etc.   but farrell's?  talk about discriminatory!  and sexist!  the first time i went in there (with very high hopes!) i could *hear* people (men and women) talking about me and making fun of me. and i've been sexually harrassed more times than i can count on one hand just walking by farrell's. i love having a bar so close to me that a) doesn't make me feel eye-raped, and b) has more beer on tap than crappy bud. and you, sir, seem like a pretty intelligent human being (judging from your spelling, grammar, and articulate vocabulary.)  trust me, if you came into the 'dub-win', you'd probably find at least a few of my friends acceptable.  even interesting.  even fun.  (oh, hey, wait!  bars are supposed to be fun!  that's right!)
