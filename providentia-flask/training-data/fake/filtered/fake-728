My husband and I came here for some appetizers to munch on and enjoyed a few cocktails. At first I was a little stubborn because I am comfortable with what I am used to and what I like. I wasn't quite in the mood to "try something new." When we first walked in, I was amazed at how beautiful the space was. The decor and ambiance will blow you away. The space has a great flow all throughout. Truly took my breath away. We went over to the bar area and were greeted by Evan. Evan is a very passionate and knowledgeable bartender. You truly do not come across many bartenders who were on the level as he was. He truly was helpful in picking out appetizers and drinks and made us feel very comfortable. Super nice too! That always helps. :-) We order the Ahi tuna tartar and the calamari. Both extremely tasty. The calamari is on the spicier side so be prepared for a little caliente in your mouth. Our drinks were AMAZING! Presentation is key and also a great way to get buzzed/drunk. Ha! Every time I saw Evan make a new drink, I wanted one. I had the Black Orchid and the Bubbles and Razz (I forget the name of the second one). I won't go into detail as I think you should try one. Great place for drinks with the gals! Drinks are on the pricier side but totally worth it. Can't wait to go back! Ask for Evan at the bar! He is spectacular! Hope this review was helpful!
