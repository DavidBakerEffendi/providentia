Great Ramen...interesting atmosphere, but long wait. Get there around 10:45am if you want to eat without a long long wait. Don't get there at noon or you'll be waiting forever. Pork buns are a must and the Akamaru Modern is delicious. I've tried several other ramen places around the US and this is the best I've had...
