I am a Jefferson Employee and like to get out of the office and have lunch at least 3 times a week. I was on my way to Fuel and came across this burger place and figured that I would give it a try. The atmosphere is very trendy really clean and nice lighting fixtures. The staff seamed nice although I did think it was strange that there was no woman working there ?.... I ordered the Guadalupe burger it was very tasty. When I went to the counter to order the person asked me if I want to order fries. I then realized that the burger was 9.50 with a 10% discount WOW ! that's high. The clerk was interrupted  by another guy  that I later figured out was one of the owners super pale kid with large eyes. He explained that when I saw what I was getting that it would not seem expense. I told him that I will just have the burger with that he continued to push French fries and told me that if I want "Wendy's" food I could go for Wendy's prices. Since I order a turkey burger and do not eat red meat he should have paid more attention to the detail of my order never the less I told him it really does not matter please just give me the burger and I will be on my way. He continue that it does  matter and that he's sick of reading on YELP that the prices are too high and that people need to understand  what they are getting. With that I politely told him that I am on my lunch break and frankly he was beyond annoying me. Let's just say I will not be back. When someone says they do not want fries and then you have to explain why you do not want fries and listen to their BS and validation about Yelp comments. Also maybe as an owner you could work side by side instead of sitting at the counter asking customers random questions and then mistaking them for other people that you handed fries out to earlier in the day - so NOT  personal. It was like a bad used car salesman. I give this place 6/8 mths tops !
