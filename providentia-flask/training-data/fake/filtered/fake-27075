We stopped in with friends on a Tuesday night after work for drinks and small plates and absolutely love the vibe going on here at NIXS! Attentive and knowledgeable service, great food, and the cocktail menu is fun and inventive! We had a wide variety of small plates. Favorites Loved the crab tater tots, the hangar steak, and the short rib tacos. Loved the Dirty Rotten Scoundrel cocktail - the perfect "sippin' cocktail. I was a little worried when I read previous comments about the music being loud...but found that if that was the case, it has been rectified. The sound was the perfect background level for dinner conversation.
