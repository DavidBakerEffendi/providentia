This is the place to go for hearty, grown-up versions of the grilled cheese sandwich.  My favorite is the Fried Chicken--it's exactly how it sounds with a healthy portion of red cabbage slaw and met sauce on sourdough bread.  The Maple Bacon is pretty good also, but unless you're eating for two I'd go for the Fried Chicken. The tots make a great side (with extra melt sauce), and the Oreo shake will put you over but is well worth it.  Melt closes at 9pm, but go before that; popular items like the Fried Chicken sell out quickly, or they might turn off the deep fryer early.
