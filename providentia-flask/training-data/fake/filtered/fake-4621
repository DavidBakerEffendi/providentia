I came here for a romantic dinner with my boyfriend for a special occasion. It is somewhat new york-sized restaurant with decent food. More than anything the decor was top notch. Service was attentive and the staff was extra friendly For the two of us with non-alcoholic beverages, it came to about 105$ including tip.
