i visited this place after hearing of all the talk about how good there pizza was. We were disappointed with both service and pizza and extremely pricy.   A regular pie was $32.00 with topping's $45.00 for pizza come on.  The calzones were $32.00 each. The place was dirty and needs a total makeover from floor to ceiling.  T They also need extra help with serving so many customers. The location is a block from the train station but very crowded area.   The sanitary conditions were poor there rating is still pending after 6 months. The owner pit man needs to wash his hands after handling the pies that he produces. He also uses a scissor to cut fresh basil as the pies come out of the oven and sprinkles oil all over the pie making is soupy. The server grinds cheese with his hands and handles the exchange of money as the orders come out. What I place the slices are $5.00 each this place needs a lot of clean up and out of the building. I would not come back at all. With so many wonderful pizza parlors in Brooklyn to choose from.
