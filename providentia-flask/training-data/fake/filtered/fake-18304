We went for the food because it came highly reccomended as a meat eaters paradise. I have been to some of the best meat eating places in this country. It has a good atmosphere but you dont leave happy about the experience. So I will tell you the truth, unlike some of these stuffy yuppys that will tell you its great. For starters, she orders a blonde belgian beer and I order a Chimmay belgian beer. Both small bottles.The chimmay was as small as a bud nip and was $15 I ordered what people here said and what I heard was good. The ham was veryy salty and veiney was not good at all and I found myself spitting pieces out that were not chewable. I had to ask for more bread. I looked at the bacon in the meat case thinking it might be great with my salad and it was like 90% fat so I ask the waiter and he says "Yeah its like a 50/50 ratio. I saw it was completely fatty so I obviously passed on it. Peter Lugers blows the doors off of this and so does Wolfgangs. Its not even a close race if you are trying to match that here. The merguez lamb sausage was terrible and wasnt even cooked enough, I Â left 1 of the 2 whole sausages they gave us.Reccomended by another stuffy yuppy on here. as soon as yoiu tasdte it you will push the dish away from you. No kidding The salad was the best thing I ate in the place. It had a great dressing and pancetta. The Steak for 2 was a sirloin and we ordered it med-rare. It was cooked very well but not by any means a peter luger steak. Also had 2 of their cookies which were nothing to brag about not to mention dry. The Bill $180 with tip for 2. Not even close to being satisfied or full when I left which is always the case at a real meat eaters place. Take my opinion from someone who loves to eat and ate almost freakin everywhere here. I Do Not reccomend this to someone who is a real Meat eater. I would have rather had the rib eye burger and lolipop wings at "Rare" on 37th and Lex like I was craving J
