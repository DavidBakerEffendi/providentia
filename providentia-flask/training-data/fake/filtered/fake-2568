Pros: Great wine list (bottle or glass), open late, perfect portions Cons: Very loud, can be busy Review: Great neighborhood wine bar with a good vibe and a great waitstaff. The place does get real loud and can be very busy so there is usually a wait.  I would suggest this for a great casual date place or a fun double date.   The portions are perfectly sized.  You can have as large or small of a meal as you would like, which is a nice change.
