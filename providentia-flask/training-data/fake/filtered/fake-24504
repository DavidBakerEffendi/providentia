I came here on bitterly cold Christmas Day with my family. We would normally be eating roast turkey so this was a bit of a change! The line was filling up the whole hall area in the front so it is a pretty popular place. I am told it's famous for its dumplings so we had those. They are not easy to eat but delicious and warming if very hot indeed. We felt the rest of the meal was average and the atmosphere is unremarkable which was a shame for Christmas Day. The service is good though and very fast. More of a speedy lunch option than special occasion destination.
