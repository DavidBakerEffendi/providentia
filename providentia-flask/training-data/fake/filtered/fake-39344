I feel badly writing this review because the staff was very nice, but I owe it to my fellow citizens. Firstly, it is unbearably crowded. The dining room is freakishly tiny, which would be OK if they didn't cram so many people into it. Second, the food is, frankly, stale. For the relatively high prices, I expected much better. I brought a date there because I heard it had great ambiance. Instead, we were both disappointed with the sardine-like overcrowding, combined with the stale mediocre food. Other than that, the waiter was very nice, and the room itself looks nice. So if you don't mind crappy food and cramped seating, this is the place for you.
