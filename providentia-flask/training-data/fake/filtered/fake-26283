DInner Saturday night was blustery outside but warm and cozy inside. Small, unassuming; the charm is in the food and the owner and chef. One of my pet theories is that ethnic foods get better as you approach the center of metropolitan areas. Living in Berkshire County, Mass might imply we don't have great food. To the contrary, we do, but there are more offerings to the diner, better ingredients, fresher, and a much larger dining public. I think this results in better food. The spice gauge goes: medium, hot, Thai hot. Medium was great for me but clearly too hot for most of my companions. I have friends who wouldn't/couldn't eat at this spice level. But different kinds of heats were offered in different dishes. The cold rice vermicelli salad was clean, fresh tasting, including a shrimp or two. It was a lovely interlude between some adequate spring rolls and the prawn evening special, also medium heat. I tasted all from around the table. Each was a unique take on some classic dishes. The sweetness of a beer really pairs well with some of the intense spice. I think the price is a bit high, but they deliver. The meal was quite enough so we did not have any dessert. Maybe next time. There will be a next time.
