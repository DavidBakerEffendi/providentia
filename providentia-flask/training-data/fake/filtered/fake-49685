Was Â all ready to go...dressed up ,anniversary reservations at rats restaurant for Havana Nights...Cuban Band,Mojitos,Pig Roasting,evening tour of the gardens, $65.00 a person reservations..made reservations on line three weeks earlier.....romantic ,right ? Googled the location ,driving 45 minutes to get there,talking about how great the evening would be.....15 minutes from my reservation time,,2 miles away...I get a call on my cell, saying the restaurant would be shut down...something about an electric problem...they were unable to honor my reservations and that someone would get back to me to apologize/explain what happened....still waiting...no e mail, no phone call,no discounted certificates in the mail....NOTHING...When you try to e mail them you are sent thru a maze of non conforming ..cannot send responses..you would think they would want to keep the customer base that can routinely fork over $125.00 per person like their Valentine dinners..but I guess customer service takes a back seat ................................. DON'T GO............unless you want a $7.00 beer and a view....Read the reviews.
