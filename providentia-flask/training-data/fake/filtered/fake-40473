I have been in this restaurant a few times. The food is good. However, the service by the waiter is horrible. The waiters are flirtatious to girls and tell improper comments. One time, I went to eat at this restaurant with 3 friends. The waiter was courteous to my female friends but was very rude to my male friend. Â He almost threw the dish on the table. Most of the times, there is a vagabond in the front of the restaurant. He demanded money from me on two occasions. One time, he followed me to my car demanding money. I was afraid. I am half peruvian.
