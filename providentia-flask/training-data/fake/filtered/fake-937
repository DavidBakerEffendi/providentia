Don't usually write reviews but I had such a great experience I felt the need to share. I will keep it short since I don't always do this. Service is excellent from all staff. Always friendly and welcoming. I used to live in Miami and this the some of the best Cuban cuisine I've had since going to some of my favorite restaurants on calle ocho. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for authentic Cuban cuisine and great service.
