BC has amazing food, and some pretty special drinks. They are often very crowded, so plan on getting there early to wait. They have very friendly staff, and the management is quite nice too. It's pricey, but for a splurge (birthday, engagement etc) it is worth it! In the summer they have nice outdoor seating.
