Went to Amis last night with two friends before seeing a show, and we were definitely impressed.  As we always do at a new restaurant, we went with all of our server's recommendations.  We ordered the buffalo ricotta bruschetta (very simple but incredible - best ricotta I have ever tasted), the meatballs (you only get three but they are so tender and delicious in a really authentic Italian sauce with an unique thick texture), the octopus salad (best octopus I've ever tasted, combined with olives and a simple, clean dressing), and the risotto (fried balls of risotto - an interesting texture but not with the powerful flavor I had hoped for).  For dessert we got the waffles with nutella, and weren't particularly wowed.   Yes, the portions are small but we knew what we were getting so we ordered several of them and weren't left unsatisfied.  The wine list  was surprisingly great - really well rounded with options at both ends of the price spectrum and a pretty impressive and reasonable carafe of house red at $20.  I have to agree with the other reviewers, the classic rock music selection felt a little weird.  I like to enjoy the background music in a restaurant without really noticing it specifically, and I certainly don't think I've ever remembered individual songs before (the beatles, the doors, tom petty).  Overall, the food was great, the service wonderful and even overly-attentive (understandable for a restaurant in its first week, however), and we had a really great experience.  Marc hit another one out of the park!
