Me and my boyfriend drove an hour and a half on the suggestion of my neighbor who says the place is awesome. and it was a waste of a trip !!  The food IS very, very good... different and creative but the service is terrible and it is way to loud inside !!  Can't even have a conversation with someone sitting across a small table from you.  Too many young kids acting like children and being too loud !  I understand how restaurants operate and they do get busy but come on, way too many loud children devoid of parents or adults to relax and enjoy the meal and ambiance.
