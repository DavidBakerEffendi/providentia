I like this place I think the food is good and a little different which the Caldwells definitely needed since every 700 feet there is a pizzeria with the same menu or burgers.  My daughter and I love the chilli dogs and the hot dogs with pepper and potatoe.  Our babysitter raves about the BBQ chicken sandwich so I'll try that next.  I hope they stick around.
