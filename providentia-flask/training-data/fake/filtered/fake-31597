I love this place! The view and food have always been wonderful, but this time I had the best waitress ever, Stephanie! She was so friendly, and prettier to boot. There was also a mojito special, though I'm not sure if this is every Tuesday. The drinks, arepas, and service were the best this last time I went. If you go, ask for Stephanie, she'll treat you well. The chicken was also so delicious and creamy!
