I was there yesterday to pick an order up. I waited for the hostess for maybe 10 minutes to appear and to tell me to go to the bar. I waited at the bar for 30 minutes until I got the order. The restaurant was not full. I was not happy with the service and the food that I really enjoyed when I was there the last time was salty and not as good as the time before.
