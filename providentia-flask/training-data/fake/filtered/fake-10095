I love this place.  It really is a neighborhood spot.  I popped in the other day for brunch alone.  I've gone a bunch of times with friends for brunch and dinner (even did my birthday dinner here one year with family).  I came in alone after the gym because I really wanted their "eggs any style" with greek salad.  I don't frequent restaurants alone, but this was a perfect environment for me to just enjoy my food, enjoy the atmosphere and not feel rushed.  Definitely start with appetizers, this is a great restaurant to share.  And, I almost forgot to mention, their bloody is SO delicious.  Kinda spicy but it's like a meal in a glass with so much flavor.
