I went on a Sunday afternoon for lunch . I ordered the PYT Burger with a side of fries. Everything was tasty except the burger was closer to the size of mini burgers. When I arrived I waited to be seated but I never saw the host or hostess so I walked to the bar and asked the bartender if I could get a table outside. The bartender found the hostess and lead him my way. The service was a little bit slow but I wasn't that much in a rush to be anywhere so it was okay. This is definitely not a date type place but more of a hipster spot and it's in a great location. I still haven't decided if I'll eat there again or not.
