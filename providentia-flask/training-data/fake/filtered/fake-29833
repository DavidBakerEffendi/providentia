Seabra's Marisqueira is a Portuguese restaurant that has character. Every time I go, the food is consistently well cooked, well priced and very good. Traditional Portuguese cooking and steaks and seafood are cooked to perfection. It's a type of place where their own would be seen eating, if something doesn't come out right, words are said, corrections made. The servers are a little older but....sorry to say the Portuguese (mostly older generation) may be teensy bit ornery but so would anyone if you are undecided and fluctuate back and forth with indecision, if there is anything you don't about the menu or food, ask. The knowledgeable servers work hard and I'm always amazed at the tiny kitchen fulfilling several orders in a timely manner. You hear sizzling food as the cooks are cooking, chopping of the knives as they prepare food, the guys WORK and the plates that come out, makes you want to sneak a piece as the servers deliver to the guests... If you are asking if I would recommend this restaurant...100% yes!
