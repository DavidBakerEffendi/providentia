If you're looking for a good spot for a romantic date this is the spot to go.  Beautiful inside, dimmed lighting and candles on each table to set the intimite mood.  Did I mention the beautiful garden seating area as well!  I reccomend definitely ordering the cheese platter and wine to start.  This is the place to go for great Italian food.  This is oe of my favoirte restaurants out of the entire city.
