A small pub like atmosphere with the best Portuguese food. Owner Maria has a large menu for lunch and dinner. The prices are so reasonable you wonder how she does it. Lot of locals at the bar and the dining room tastefully done. Pork & Clams are a favorite. Monthly specials are 17.95 for three courses. Portuguese rolls and olives come with everything. Codfish cakes are great appetizers
