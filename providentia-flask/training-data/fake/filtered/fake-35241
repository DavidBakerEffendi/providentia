SERVICE IS TERRIBLE - BUT THIS IS MY FAVORITE SPOT IN NYC.  My first experience here was with about 8 people thinking this was a sit-down restaurant.  Well, it's definitely not but SO MUCH BETTER.  The food is phenomenal..very classic italian dishes at an amazingly affordable price served piping hot with the  freshest ingredients.  It's like a home-cooked Italian meal made just for you.   It's not the best place to come with a group of people since they have limited cooking space...The chances of your food coming all at once is slim to none..but again, it's still worth it. Love, love, love gaia - If you are looking for a traditional dining experience and are typically impatient, this place is not for you so please don't come and take up the limited seating!  :)
