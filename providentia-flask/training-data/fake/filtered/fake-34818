This review is long overdue! I went here on Valentine's Day 2 years ago to have brunch with a friend. It was great! A woman who is normally a waitress was filling in for the bartender and she was wonderful! She kept us laughing the whole time and she was very personable. She was generous with the amount of alcohol going into a Vodka and Cranberry. The waiter who brought the food out to the bar was very polite. The food was excellent! The deep fried pickles are amazing! They have a lot of unique things on the menu. While this place might be located in New Kensington it is very classy without being too stuffy. The prices are reasonable. There is a very mixed crowed and the beer selection is amazing. I was very impressed at how well it is run, especially on a crowded Sunday holiday. We were never rushed to leave and the wait staff/bartenders seem to want you to come back. I felt extremely welcome here and want to compliment the owner and staff greatly! This is the nicest River Ward Bar/Restaurant in the area.
