I loved this place the Ribs and the mac and cheese were amazing, it had an awesome taste to both of them and the service was great everyone looked happy that i was there and it made me feel welcomed. At the end of my meal the waitress had offered me free desert and that too was great. Everything about this place was great and i will 100% be back in the next day or so keep it up butcher bar !
