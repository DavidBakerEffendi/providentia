Every time I come here the food is always great.  Their dishes are very fresh and I've never had a meal I haven't liked.  I enjoy sitting outside when the weather is nice and I really like the fact that this is a BYOB.  My only concern is the waiting time before you are seated.  Even if you make reservations, there is often a wait.  Otherwise a great place to grab dinner.
