I wasn't sure what to expect after finally breaking the code of getting a reservation. Sometimes the hype isn't worth the price of admission. But, I was determined to make my way into the back of the butcher shop to experience the "members only" mystery that is Bohemian. The decor, clientele, music, and service were unflawed in my opinion. Minimalist, with just a few tables and comfortable upholstered chairs (which you will need after self inducing into a food coma), fantastic garden built into the wall, and amazing graffiti on one of the walls. If it were appropriate to raise a plate to my face and lick it clean in a restaurant, I would have done so here. We started with the Mushroom Salad, went into the short rib sashimi, Uni croquette, miso cod, waygu sliders, and ended with Foie gras soba noodles and finally the food coma... Dessert sake panacotta and chocolate creme brulee. Steer clear of the cucumber drink and go for the Mint Gold, Mojito, and DEFINITELY do the Indian Summer! I have already made a reservation to go back next week, and I plan on putting this gem on my list of regular haunts. If you get the chance to go, wait it out for a table and not bar seating for your first time. I promise you will need the chairs... If you are a seeker of new food in New York City, then you know that most hot spots are loud, crowded, and overdone. You can't help but notice in Bohemian that the atmosphere is relaxed, quiet, and enjoying conversation with your party will not result in laryngitis the next day.
