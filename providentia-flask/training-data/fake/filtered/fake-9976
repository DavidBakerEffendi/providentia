My girlfriend drug me here.  After waiting for over an hour in line we finally got shoved into a small corner spot.  Some may call it a cozy nook, I call it an attempt at trying to cram 2 more people into the restaurant.   The food was pretty good.... I had some cleverly named thing which was really eggs and beans.  Could have used a little more salsa, and a little more salt, but I never got a chance to see because my waitress was nowhere to be found.  My girlfriend and her friends liked what they got.   It's dog friendly.
