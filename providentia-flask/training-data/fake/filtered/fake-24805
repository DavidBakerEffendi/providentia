First off I'm holding this place up against one of the best German restaurants that once was, the Original Brauhaus now the Blue Ox (which now serves rubbish non traditional German fair).  That being said I'll start with what was good about Schmitz.  The beer menu is extensive with all the best Germans. The spaetzle is spot on and the gravy isn't bad either.  Unfortunately that's where it ends. The potato pancakes are standard at best. I also had the Wiener Schnitzel which had enough oil in it to choke a horse and the taste was nothing to write home about (other then a 2 star rating on Yelp).  For dessert we had an apple strudel that should have been lemon because that's what it tasted like.  The atmosphere isn't bad if your looking to hang at the bar but for dinner it's way to loud.  We sat upstairs and the speakers were deafening.  So overall, I commend them for opening a German restaurant where there are far and few between.  But I doubt I'll be back other then to grab a liter and spaetzle.
