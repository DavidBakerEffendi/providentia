This is one of my all time favorite places.  We always eat at the bar as the bartenders are the best and so friendly.  The food is fantastic.  Very subtle flavors and great taste.  You can't get these flavors anywhere else.  Agnolotti - unbelievable - youtube how they make it.  Polenta and mushrooms - not exactly low cal but worth every calorie.  I have tasted spagehetti but their's is unique and top three i have ever tasted.  It is worth ordering without a doubt which sounds crazy!   I can't get enough of this place.
