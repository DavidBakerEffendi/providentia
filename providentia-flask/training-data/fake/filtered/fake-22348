Ordered a pie from this place and will never again. They skimp on the cheese and sauce. You can literally see through the slices they are so thin. The taste, well they are just your average pizza makers. Nothing to brag about. The Mexican cooks they hire in the NY City pizza parlors make better pizza. Been in Lyndhurst 25 years and seen pizzerias come and go, I see this one go soon.
