Well worth the short trip to Queens, Trattoria L'incontro delivers a really special Italian dining experience. This wasn't our first visit, and it certainly won't be our last. All the food is delicious, but if you're a newbie, take note - forget ordering from the menu. The treat here is the awesome selection of specials that your server will rattle off when you're seated. There's so many of them that you might want to take notes! But whatever you choose, you won't be disappointed. We had the baked clams, which were juicy and really flavorful, followed by the best beet salad with arugula I've ever had. Then we had the cod, which literally mels in your mouth. The wine list here is great, and although I'm never sure what to choose, our server came to the rescue with a great recommendation. Speaking of which, the service at Trattoria L'incontro is another of its strong points. Friendly, attentive, and constantly checking up on us., our server couldn't have been nicer. The only complaint, although honestly it's not really a complaint, is that the interior d√©cor is a bit flat. Which is a shame because with its high ceilings and spaciousness, they could really dress it up nicely. I guess they decided to concentrate on the food and services - which shows. Definitely recommend you try this restaurant!
