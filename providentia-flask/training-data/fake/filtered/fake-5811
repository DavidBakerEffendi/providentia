Got - steak and eggs       - French dips       - side of Hashbrowns Steak and eggs was perfect , rare. Pomegranate lemonade really good. French dips was ... Good but not great. Meat overcooked and meat sauce not enough dark and consistent. Hash browns : we did not eat it as we sent it back because of a big black hair mixed with it, super visible on the plate... Sad when it happens ...
