Time for the cranky old bartender to hang up his bottle opener. Sorry I offended you by asking for a drink as you gazed off into space. Reality check, buddy, customers ask for drinks. The other bartenders are good and welcoming. The burger is one if the best in the city. Â  Decor hasn't changed in ages and that's a god thing. Nice place for a quiet drink and a quick bite. Avoid the Saturday night all star and you will want to go back to Molly's.
