Some of the best sushi available in NJ HANDS DOWN. Yes, it's a little pricey but the quality of the fish makes the price a non-issue. Creative rolls, tons of options & high quality fresh fish. Trendy interior - loved the mesh curtains. BYOB. Favorite Rolls (so far): -Happy Roll -Spicy Tuna Passion Roll -TNT Roll -Fire Viking Roll Dessert: Order the Fruit Roll, it's AMAZING!
