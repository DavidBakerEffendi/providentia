Good selection of beers, mostly staples throughout the year (Legacy Hedonism, a Sly Fox variety, etc.), but they also have seasonal beers too that are really well chosen for the time of year. Great food, especially if you go for the entrees (might run you about $20 per, but it's worth it as all the veg is fresh and meats is prepared fairly well). Atmosphere is really great and friendly - they just remodeled the place, including chairs with their signature star. Great place! Oh, PS, if you're a Society Hill or Queen Village resident - go for the club card, totally worth it.
