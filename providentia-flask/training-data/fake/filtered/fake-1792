The food at Pio Pio 8 was amazing. We went for my friends birthday and when we sat at the table the service was amazing. The only con was the wait time. I called to make a reservation for a Friday and they said they do not take reservations. When we got there we waited for almost 2 hours to get a table. When others came in they were under reservations so it was confusing. But the food is so fret it was worth the wait.
