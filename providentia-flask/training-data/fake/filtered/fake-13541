My lucky day! Was taken to Catfish for Sunday Brunch and LOVED everything about the place. Friendly welcome, appetising menu, VERY reasonable pricing, fine food (I had/loved Â the Croque Madame avec egg but also heard glowing reviews on the shrimp 'n grits), excellent service, appealing ambiance and killer drinks options made me want to stay all day. Crown Heights: You're lucky to have a place like Catfish.
