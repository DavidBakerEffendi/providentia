The food in the El Merengue SUCKS!!!!!! Poor service, bad food !!!! Roast Pork (pernil) was extremely dry, rice seemed that is was cooked the day before, AND yes the oil seems to be recycled. They are so professional, the owner was laughing with his friends while clients waited upon. VERY BAD PLACE !!!!!! DO GO FOR YOUR OWN SAKE!!! I WAS VERY UNPLEASED!!! Go to NJ TU CASA , whisch is right up the street going towards downtown NEWARK.......
