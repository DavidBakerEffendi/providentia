I strongly reccomend this place. I recently discovered this place and totally like it. foods are very original. had not idea how delicious latin foods could be. I think this palce does not have liquor so BYOB. thats even better I guess. this place is small. not that much capacity but you can still walk in. I also like music here. its kinda bosanova and brazillian music. very relaxing:) im def going back there pretty often.
