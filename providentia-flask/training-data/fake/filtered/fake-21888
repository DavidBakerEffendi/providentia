Without any doubt the "Reading Terminal Market" presents all different variety of traditional Philadelphia Food and a reminder of old Philadelphia's "food market place". Although this is not the first and only food market place in Philadelphia but it is very popular. I am a fan of this place and I like it especially the food is great! This is my personal experience. Please share your personal experience that you had with every business at reading terminal market, especially if the person who was serving you or the business owner was not very respectful or was very kind or even the food's quality so they can correct and improve their services.
