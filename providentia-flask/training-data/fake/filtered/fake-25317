This was my first time visiting the restaurant. I have to say first-off that the food was very good.  However, I noticed that there are several rolls of Clorox clean wipes out that are constantly used to wipe down food surfaces and knives without washing off the residue with potable water afterwards.  This is a dangerous practice.  While I agree with keeping kitchen conditions sanitary, this borders on the extreme.   As for the food, we ordered the Nantucket chicken and the chicken and brie sandwiches, both of which tasted very good.  I would go back provided that I would be able to prevent my sandwich from coming in contact with Clorox.
