Mmm, mmm, mm!  Do you love pizza?!  I totally do!  Want a recommendation?!  Go to Joe's!  You're gonna LOVE it!  Joe's Pizza is SO mouth-watering!  And the pizza can probably give your taste buds a new BFF.  Trust me, because I must have been there about a million, hundred, and eight times.  And now you'll totally see why the food is so fantastical!   The first reason you should, no matter what, try Joe's is because of the AMAZING fluffy, ooey, gooey cheese!  One bite of that warm gooey cheese you will most likely die just to get more! Another amazingly, perfect, mouth-watering reason to get a slice of Joe's is (of course) because of the delicious, nutritious basil sprinkled all over the delicious, ooey, gooey cheese.  Its like heaven just to chomp on that mouth-watering basil! The tasty, perfect, delicious, marvelous last reason I'm recommending Joe's is because of their tasty, rich, sweet, creamy, fruity italian ice.  Plus its right in the fruit's perfect shell!  For instance, say you get a zesty lemon italian ice.  It wouldn't be in a boring old bowl.  It would be in a lemon shell!  How cool is that?! After all the explaining, I hope you can see why their pizza and italian ice is so good.  I hope your next visit to pizza will be Joe's!  (Because it will BLOW your noodle!)
