I was just walking exploring Ridgewood, specifically Metropolitan Ave. when I walked passed this place.  Even though it's a small building, you can't miss it because there is nothing else of interest around that part of Metropolitan.  My wife and I came back a week later and had an excellent meal.  It's a cozy, little place with mismatched furniture and interesting decor.  Even the bathroom is worth checking out.  I love the toilet paper tube dispenser and the plant.  I was also impressed with the simple menu.  In Chinatown you can get overwhelmed with the amount of dishes offered.  At Bunker they focus on making a few excellent dishes instead of throwing ingredients into the same broth like other restaurants. Anyways, let's get to the food.  We split the Crab Banh Xeo, which was very good.  It had lots of bean sprouts, which I like, and the egg, shrimp and bacon combination worked really well.  I'll start making omelets with though ingredients.  The crunchiness made it all that much better, as well. The Suon Nuong Xa was also great.  I flipped the egg over and let the yolk drip into my rice.  Tasty!  I didn't touch the sauce, at first, because I thought it was going to be that sweet, Thai sauce that I don't like.  It turned out to have more of a lemon flavor and excellent.  It was refreshing and a nice surprise.   My wife had the Ca Ri Ga.  I love Roti and this was some of the best I've had.  If you love curry, you'll love this dish. To make a long story short, I'll be going back for sure.
