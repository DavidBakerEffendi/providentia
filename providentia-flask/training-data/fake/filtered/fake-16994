I ordered nachos by phone. I was told 15 miin. I went to pick up.. I had to wait 10 min to get cashed out. The person making a sandwich with no gloves cashed me out n went bk to food prep w out washing hands. Almost 9 bucks for tostito chips with a little cheese melted and tomatoes. I called & asked if it was supose to be just cheese on chips n she said u have to ask for meat. I thought, why didnt the person taking orders ask me? She was rude to me huffing and puffing. i will never go there again and would not recommend because it was dirty, customer service, and quality.
