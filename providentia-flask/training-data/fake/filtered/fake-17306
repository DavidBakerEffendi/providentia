Purists will not call this "real" Mexican food, nor even Tex-Mex.  If you can get over this bias, and taste it simply as something unique, these burritos are really really excellent.  It's particular good for vegans, because they have vegan-replacement options for nearly every item they put in (e.g., tofu sour cream, soy cheese). I am a vegetarian myself, so I usually only get the grilled tofu or seitan options, which are really excellent.  The meat-eaters I know talk positively about the BBQ chicken and steak as particularly good.  This is often somewhat of a crowd-pleasing place to order from when you do have a mixed group of meat-eaters and vegetarian/vegans. We used to order this for lunch 2-3 times a week in my office, and people did find it monotonous after a while, but we still regularly order from there. I should note that I have tried a few of the non-burrito menu items, and I don't think they are particularly good.  This place does burritos, salsa and chips well. If you like extra-spicy, definitely try the green hot-sauce they offer.  It's one of the better hot-sauces I've had, and I am a bit of a connoisseur. Note that their phone system is clunky, and it can actually be difficult to get through during the lunch rush to place an order.  Try to order before 11:45AM or after 1PM on weekdays; your order will arrive much faster.  The lunch rush delay from call to delivery can be up to an hour sometimes. Finally, eating in is not really an option; it's crowded and not much seating.  Target it for carry-out or delivery.
