So I made this account just so I could complain about the terrible service. Took forever to take our drink order, took forever to get our drinks, took forever to take our orders. Food came out quick and it was great, but the service almost ruined the experience for me. Our whole section, which was half full seemed really pissed. We were there for two hours since we had to wait for our check even though we only ordered one course. Food was great though, got a cheesesteak pretzel burger. Top notch.
