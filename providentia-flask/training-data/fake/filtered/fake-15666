Friendly servers, fast service, and huge portions made us instant fans of this place. The food is good too - I had the fish tacos which had a nice variety of interesting sides - some perhaps a little too bizarre, but most quite nice. The fish was OK - could have had a bit more flavor. The reuben is ridiculously big but very tasty. Half of it is really enough for a meal. We'll definitely go back and sample more of the menu.
