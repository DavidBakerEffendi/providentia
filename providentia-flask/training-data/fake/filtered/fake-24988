Huge fan of this Vanessa location. Cheap pricing, sizeable amounts of tasty food, and quick service. Amazing coconut bubble tea. I eat there before I go to see bands. Minor negative is seating. Be prepared to stand and eat or eat outside by the garbage that's outside. Other than that, it definitely worth it.
