Bistro Les Amis is a wonderful downtown NYC restaurant that I've been visiting for years every time I'm in the area. The cozy interior, the always friendly and kind owners and staff, the unique and very tasty food are the reasons that I keep coming back again and again. I always feel like home, going there for a nice lunch or just for a drink. For me, amongst the rich variety of NYC restaurants, Bistro Les Amis have a very reputable and distinguishing place as a restaurant that always exceeds my high expectations. For all of the above, I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone who appreciates delicious food and great quality service.
