Everytime I have ever been here, someone on staff has been exceptionally rude to me. I wonder, from where stems the deep pretention? I was thrown out for bringing in an almost empty to go cup from neighboring Green Line (superior in all aspects) Boils down to overpriced and not worth the barista-tude.
