Le Ptit Paris is a great new addition to Windsor Terrace where we've had precious little in the way of good restaurants. We've been a number of times and the food has been excellent each time. Salads are fresh and beautifully presented, meat and fish are all good quality. You'll find favorites like moules a la moutarde and steak frite, plus salade nicoise,Wines are very good too. Prices are much more reasonable than Da Vincenzo, the previous occupant. The decor isn't much, but I wouldn't expect that in such a small space. It's all very clean and serviceable, the perfect neighborhood restaurant. Wait staff is attentive. All in all, a real joy.
