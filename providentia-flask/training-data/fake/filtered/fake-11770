I have such mixed feelings about this place. The food is great and it's a very reasonable price. The service is pretty much non existant. It's pre made curry poured over pre cooked rice, yet I've waited 15 minutes or more for an order. The place has also become a hang out for college kids who obviously have nothing better to do. There are a total of 4 tables and yet half the time they are occupied by these kids, who are NOT eating... just sitting there talking. Paying customers with actual food should have these seats, but management never does anything Â about it.... If you have 45 minutes to kill, and can manage not to kill these loafers, you will have a good lunch
