Overall, the chocolate and many of the desserts are excellent but the service is terrible.  This place has the potential to be excellent; however, the dining experience falls short of expectations set by the prices. PRO: + The chocolate is special.  The dark hot chocolate is the best I have ever had. + It has a cool/funky vibe. + Desserts are well prepared. CON: - Prices are on the high side for both food and drink.  If you each have a dessert and an drink it will be about $20 / person.  The sampler is probably the best value at about $25 and is plenty for 3-4 people after dinner - or 2 people as a dinner substitute. - Service is terrible.  From getting ignored at the front, to the desserts taking 30-40min, glasses not being filled, absent wait staff, lack of polite communication, etc.  Its all true. - Music is too loud but I guess its a matter of preference. As long as you dont expect good service and you are not in a hurry its a nice place for dessert.  I dont know about any of the other food because I have never looked in their other menu.
