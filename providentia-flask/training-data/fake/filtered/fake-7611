This place opened up near my house recently.  I was excited to have a new option in the neighborhood, and a classy one at that.  So, last night I went, and well, i went from excited to disappointed in no time at all. I'll start with the positive. The ambiance is great. Though the place is small enough to be an eavesdropper's dream come true; it was cute and comfortable.  The server was also excellent, answering all my questions happily. Oh, and the pickle plate tickled my fancy oh so right; very good.  Unfortunately, that is where things started to turn downhill. On to the not so good.  The wait between the appetizer and the entre was right around 40 minutes or so. Granted, we got the last table when we arrived.  Still, within minutes of arriving the place was almost empty with only a few other tables.  The manager appeared to be surfing the internet on his iphone.  Oh, and the table that arrived and ordered after us received their dish (one we had also ordered) previous to us.  Which was bizarre because our only other dish then arrived cold; cold steak, cold fried egg, cold hard roti, and not much of it.  A disappointment to say the least.  Meanwhile, our table sat without water and the manager's iphone glowing in the corner.   The fish curry was good. Not seventeen dollars good, but good none the less.  Still, with essentially only one edible entree between us, I have to admit I left a bit upset and disappointed.  For the price, the quality of the experience just was not there.  It's too bad really because this corner of the neighborhood could really use a nice place to eat.   Mediocre/unreliable food and mediocre service translate to a mediocre dining experience at best, despite the nice ambiance.
