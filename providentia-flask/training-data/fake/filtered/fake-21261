I was there last weekend for the first time in a year. My friend was celebrating her birthday and she wanted to be close to the Barclay's center. I must say this place has growing issues: 1. The food is really overpriced (almost unethically for what you're getting) 2. The food is not authentic Colombian food! (no matter what the restaurant says...ask a real Colombian and they will tell you that this is a Mexican restaurant in disguise). 3. The place is loud and the ambiance is stressful. The staff is forcefully friendly and they also seem extremely stressed out. Also, I am pretty sure the waitstaff does not even speak Spanish. 4. I am pretty sure only people who know nothing about Colombian or other latin foods eat here. This is the only explanation I can think of...why would anyone spend so much money on arroz con pollo? or empanadas? or arepas? or oily kale and salty soup, for that matter? I mean seriously, $15 for arroz con pollo? Most people know you can get a much more authentic and inexpensive empanada or arepa or bandeja paisa or arroz con pollo in Queens. 5. Did I mention this place is overpriced? It just pisses me off.
