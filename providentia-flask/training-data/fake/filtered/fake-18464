Went here with my wife for dinner one Sunday. We had no reservations but got there around 6:15ish and were seated quickly. They had no vegetarian items on the menu but they were able to make my wife an amazing plantain dish that was delicious. I ordered the roast duck and was exceedingly happy with it. The lounge ambiance makes this a prime place for a date or a romantic dinner. The mojitos were strong and the food was great. The only downside is the price. It is rather expensive but completely worth it!
