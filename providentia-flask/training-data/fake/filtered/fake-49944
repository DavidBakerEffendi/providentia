I have loved Rutts Hut since I've been a kid. Â We hadn't been there in a long time and went there about 6 months ago. I was disappointed in that the "ripper" was not crisp and the relish, which I usually slather on my ripper was just not the same, it was missing something. I was very disappointed. Then I heard that new owners took over and that you have to ask if you want your ripper to be crisp................Seriously? I hesitate to go back.
