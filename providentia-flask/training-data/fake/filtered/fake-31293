Let's start with the food. Portions are large. Everything is frozen for the most part with no seasoning. I ordered the New Orleans omelette. The shrimp were watery, and chewy. It was gross. Home fries were bland and did not have a lick of seasoning on them. Sausage came from the freezer. The burger is equally as terrible and comes with fries right from the freezer. On top of the lousy the food, the owner Nora is a complete nightmare. Very rude and goes out of her way to make sure the customer feels uncomfortable. If they learned how to cook over there and Nora quit working they might have a shot at a success. Also, you have the unfortunate pleasure of being able to see right into the kitchen when they are preparing your food. Can you say cross contamination? Â I didn't see one cook wash their hands, but I saw plenty of raw chicken/beef being handled. Get a clue!
