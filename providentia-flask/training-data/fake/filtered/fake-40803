This place is awesome! I loved the atmosphere and the down to earth people. Lots of college aged people here and the seats are closer than normal but I loved it. Yes we had to wait for a bit to get a seat since it is so small but I think that is what makes it great. For the price in NYC you cant beat this place. Burger is so tasty and the fries are great.....lots of flavor.
