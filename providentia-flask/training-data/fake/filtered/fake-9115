Food good...unfortuantely the reservation manager...lets call him Matthew...needs to be fired asap.  Made an ordeal in front of my 4 guests about the chefs tasting menu being mandatory (mind you on a monday night at 10 pm with half of the restaurant being empty) After I mentioned the reservationist didn't tell me he insisted I was wrong...eventually making the "exception" for us to order a la carte.  10 min later as we were toasting he came back with a printed copy of the email confirmation that was sent to my spam folder.  This was so tacky, tasteless and embarrasing for the restaurant not I.  Mind you I was with a table of industry folks who own their own establishments and were utterly appauled at this whole chain of events.  Sucks for Boqueria...there are waaayy too many great restaurants in NYC to treat patrons like this.
