It's not all its hyped up to be. The food was pretty good and flavorful. The drinks were really good. They were running behind on reservations so it was a 15 min wait. The waiter was really nice and helpful but the food service was horrible. We waited an hr to get just our appetizers and another 20 for them to bring out our entrees. And 15min for dessert. I never had to wait that long for food. Very pissed. 3 stars only because the food and drinks are good .
