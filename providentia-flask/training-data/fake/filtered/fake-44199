Can't figure out what Sven is talking about regarding service!  We've gone to Miele's for years and never encountered anything remotely close to what he describes.   The food is great.  A full menu, served in a low key style.  Great Italian comfort food.  My wife has dietary restrictions which they are more than willing to accommodate by mix and matching from the menu.  Mid week pricing for many entrees is truly a terrific value. Parking can be a little difficult in their lot behind the restaurant, but there is always room on Bloomfield Ave.  Never had a problem, particularly if going during the week, or for an early weekend dinner.
