Food is great here. We have yet to try anything we didn't like. We love that it's vegetarian and kosher, especially since we can get take-out and put it on real plates at my in-laws. But I must give only 2 stars because every time we order takeout, the food is much later than the 30-40 minutes they tell us it will take--anywhere from another 20 minutes to an hour. Very disappointing that they have not been able to figure out how to get the food out more quickly or to give a longer estimated time. They also leave dishes out of our takeout order with astonishing regularity, so check your bag before you leave.
