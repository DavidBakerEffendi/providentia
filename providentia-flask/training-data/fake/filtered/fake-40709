Before we begin, I must say that ramen is my favorite food. I spent two weeks in Japan surveying every ramen bar I came across, so my rating might seem a little strict. Let's start with the broth; I found the miso to have an overpowering ginger flavor that stole the show from the rest of the bowl. I also found their tonkotsu to be a little weak, but I prefer a very strong hakata-style broth with lots of fat. The chicken broth was satisfying, buy nothing to write home about. I noticed they had a wasbai style broth that I have yet to try and am very curious about. Their seasoned eggs are on par. The egg makes or breaks the experience for me so if there's a slight mistake with my yolk i am disappointed. Their chashu is tender and fatty, all in all a great bowl of soup, but again, I've had better. My quam is that the hike in price. You're not paying for better flavor instead you're buying the ambiance. If you're looking for some swanky cocktails and a done up establishment you're headed in the right direction. Their service is also amazing, I went through a gluten-free fad and they were more than happy to accommodate that by providing me with a side of rice instead of noodles. Their staff is always happy and friendly. Faves: Akamaru Modern, Shishito Peppers, Pork Buns
