What can I say? I used to live right around the corner from this place when I FIRST moved to NY. I was pretty damn lucky! Totally love this place. Cheese puffs? Hellfuckingyes. I love everything about this place. The simplicity. Yet, the attention to the bigger picture. I always make my way back! YOU SHOULD TOO!
