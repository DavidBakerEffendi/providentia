I have been patronizing this restaurant for some time now. The owner, Mike, gets personal with all his customers and makes sure everyone has a great experience. Now, the food, from dinners to sandwiches, to appetizers, WOW!!! He is on the money with all his dishes, as I have tried almost all. After eating in many Middle-Eastern restaurants, I give this place Thumbs Up!!! Quality and pricing is great. Must try it.
