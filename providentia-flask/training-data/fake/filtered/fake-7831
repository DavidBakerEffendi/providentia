I've never had a bad meal here, ever - its so great! The food is always fresh, ingredients local, awesome wait staff, and the best bloody mary in town for sure. There's usually a wait on the weekends but it's totally worth it - just hang outside on the steps in the sun until they'll call your name and you're fine.
