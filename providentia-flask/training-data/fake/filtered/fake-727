We were a little hesitant about keeping this reservation after the recent LeBan review.  Our Christmas Friends Dinner is usually at one of the Center City steakhouses; we were very glad we kept this reservation.  From start to finish this was a delightful and delicious experience. As we were a group of six, we tried a variety of appetizers, (definitely try the crab cake, wedge salad and the shrimp appetizer).  Those who ordered the filet mignon said it was like "butter melting in your mouth; my ribeye steak was cooked to perfection and tender and the Chilean sea bass was also a fabulous dish.  Our great dining experience was made even more pleasant by our server Crystal.  She was  delightful, a great conversationalist, expertly answered all our questions and made great suggestions!  We will definitely be returning to Ocean Prime!
