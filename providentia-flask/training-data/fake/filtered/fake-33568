I only go for breakfast items at diners or maybe the occasional chicken sandwich, chicken tenders type of things. This diner takes the cake fas being my go to diner. When I lived/worked in the area I would always go to Central for breakfast. The breafast is great. I usually get the breakfast steak egg and cheese which is real steak not the shaved stuff, beef sausage egg on a roll or grits to name a few. They have such a variety of items to offer. Many diners do not have other options in meat other than pork and thats what I love most about central. I can get something filling and cooked to perfection, I have yet to be disappointed. I even ventured off one afternoon and tried a tuna melt, I just knew I would hate it. It was also delicious !!! Thumbs up to everyone there. I live in middlesex county now and there are basically no options, I wish there was a central diner on the go to teach these other so called diners what real breakfast is!
