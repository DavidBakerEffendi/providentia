This place used to be awesome. I went to their new place and i was super disappointed. The fun vibe and the sangria bar is gone. Yes they will serve unlimited sangria but its just not the same. The food has also gone done. The burrito used to the size of a chipolte burrito and now its more like the size of a tamale and not as tastey. Why fix something if its not broken? Used to be my favorite brunch spot but i wont go back :(
