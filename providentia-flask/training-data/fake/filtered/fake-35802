Really like this place! I love the Mango curry with tofu and some Thai ice tea. So good. It is great to pick up after school or sit down for a dinner. I have tried many things and have never had a bad dish. I am very happy with their Thai food and would love for everyone who loves Thai food to try Bangkok, truly great.
