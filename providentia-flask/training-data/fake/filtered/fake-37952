Awesome Beer selection, especially tap offerings.  Mixed feelings about the bartenders.  Bartender Drew who use to work there was awesome.  Patient with all the customers and very knowledgeable.  Also approachable!  Being a bartender at this type of bar really requires staff who like serving and look like they want to be there.  In my opinion, it is hit or miss.  At times the bartenders are great and other times they are either imature or showing signs that they really dont want to be there.
