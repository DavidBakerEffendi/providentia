WOW - Double WOW. What a place to spend an evening eating and drinking. The Sangria's are 1st class, and the tapas cannot be beat anywhere in Manhattan, or the other boroughs. Great Flamenco on Thursday's and Saturday Great place and very freindly wait staff and bartender. This was my 2nd trip, and there will be many, many more
