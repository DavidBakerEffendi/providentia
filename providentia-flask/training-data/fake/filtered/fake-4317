Pros: Building amenities.  Pool, gym, lounge, there is no other building in the city that you will have amenities like these. Dog Friendly Great location Cons:   Doormen - Always 2 on duty, yet none ever help you.  They watch you struggle with 8 bags of groceries, luggage, hailing a cab.  For the price you pay to live in the building they SHOULD be helping you.  they just watch and sit on the phone with their friends/families.  Especially richard! Units - Very small, no view Residents - a majority of the units are studios though they call them jr. 1 bedroom.  Therefore a majority of the people living in the building are students.  The pool as I said is amazing, and beautiful, however laying by the pool is not relaxing as you have students wasted, making noise, bringing tons of friends, and acting like their on spring break. Firealarms - always going off in the middle of the night or 5 in the morning.  Due to students, who fall asleep while making breakfast, or the restaurants in the building setting them off from cleaning their ovens.  The alarms go off for abour 40 minutes at least once a month
