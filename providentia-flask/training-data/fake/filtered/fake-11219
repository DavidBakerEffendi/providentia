Great food - clueless service We expected a wait on a Thursday night, but that wasn't the disappointing part.  While the food was excellent the service was distracted and clueless.  We asked a simple question about the wine list and was met with a blank stare and a mumbled reply.  It's really a shame because the pizza (Cheesus Christ) and pasta we had were excellent.
