I have tried many Thai Food Restaurants, and Sripraphai is by far the best I have been in. My friend from Florida was visiting the city, wanted to go out and we decided to search Yelp for some great places. After reading all of the great reviews we decided to give it a try. I have to say that we were very pleased with the service and the food in Sripraphai. Planning to go there again soon.
