I am appalled by the treatment I just received at City Tap House! It took over 15 minutes for one of the four bartenders working to even acknowledge my friends and I at a not overly-crowded bar. When the bartender finally did come over she stared at us and we said we wanted the beer special. She grunted for ID's and balked when my friend handed her her Spanish ID, as she was from Spain. The bartender insisted that she show her passport, which my friend of course does not carry with her. The policy of needing to see passports is unfair to anyone who wasn't born in the US, which on Penn's campus is many students. That aside, instead of simply informing us of the policy, which is inconsistent between days, the bartender barked at my friend to get away from the bar because she didn't have an American ID. Later, the same bartender raced across the bar when she saw that another of my friends was drinking a glass of wine. She ran up to us and insisted on seeing her ID, embarrassing her in a large group. While she was looking in her purse, the bartender said "you guys aren't even 21 (untrue) and shouldn't be in here." Appalled and infuriated, we decided to just leave. The service is terrible. The treatment of guests is terrible and quite frankly, inexcusable. No one should bother going here. There are plenty of places nearby with excellent beer (Local 44, Dock Street) and better food (The Farmacy, Honest Tom's, Mood Cafe) and Chipotle has better customer service. Trust me. Save your money. Go elsewhere. As far as Penn bars go, enjoy a nice cup of gelato and a spiked cider or milkshake at Capogiro right down stairs. You'll have a much better experience. I for one will never set foot in Tap House again.
