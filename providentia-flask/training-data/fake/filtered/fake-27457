One of the best Sicilian squares I've ever tried. Very big squares though. Only 2 is enough for me to fill me up. The place itself is a nice and cozy, the atmosphere is as well. I was passing by on my way to my friends house, I guess I will be coming here again. And of course I got some Italian Ices as well, just because it's hype, so I'm definitely a regular customer of theirs. Squares are highly recommended.
