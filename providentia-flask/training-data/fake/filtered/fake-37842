Went there on Saturday night with a reservation for 4 at 6:15. No one was in the restaurant when we got there and no one came in until 7:15 even though they told us we couldn't have a 7:00 reservation.  After 15 minutes, we told the waiter we were sorry we weren't ready yet and he said "no problem".  He came back about 5 minutes later and before we could say anything, the waiter put his hands up and said "just want to tell you that we have a 2 hour dining block".  He never said anything about that when we were seated or made the reservation, and since no one was in the restaurant, we didn't feel we needed to rush.  He came back in 5 minutes and we ordered.  The food was good, but not great.  Some of the dishes seemed like they were trying to be very creative, but they fell short and lacked flavor.  Specifically, the dessert which was a butternut squash cake with cinnamon gelato, tasted like a piece of salty roasted squash with plain ice cream, with no flavor.  Then we waited to pay the check about 20 minutes after it was brought and after paying the check, the host came to our table and stated "just want to let you know that you will have to leave in 15 minutes for the people waiting" while there was no one waiting, and there were other empty tables?  This is not the way diners should be treated.  The food is not that special to warrant tolerating that type of treatment!
