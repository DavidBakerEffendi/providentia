Don't enter the hipster's den and complain about all the hipsters, that's just dumb.   That's like going to France and complaining about all the French people. This place  would be cool to have drinks for the ambiance and the outdoor patio if that's your scene.   But $12 for 5 lousy leaves of romaine with a couple of walnuts on top? Please.  Pizza is ok.
