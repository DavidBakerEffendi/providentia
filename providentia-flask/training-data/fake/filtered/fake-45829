After reading the many good reviews, I went to Cantina Dos Segundos last night.  So many things were mediocre about my visit... 1. This place is chaotic! Large parties everywhere, very loud and the servers and host seemed overwhelmed and therefore, not exactly on their A-game. 2. Had one house margarita while waiting for our table...I think it was just lemonade (very tangy and way too sweet!). At the table we ordered a pitcher of blood orange margs and the first glass was pretty much all tequila because the pitcher was not mixed, the top was tequila the bottom was all juice and mixers...not good. 3. The food was okay. I had mahi mahi tacos which had good flavor, but were just fish and tortillas - kind of boring. Their lump crab ceviche special was decent at best, with way too much cilantro. The burrito was mostly rice and beans with very little meat in it.  Guacamole and salsa were tasty. Overall, I was ready to get out of there after our meal and don't think I'll be back...there were a bunch of "eclectic" groups of people there which did make for some good people watching, which was a plus.
