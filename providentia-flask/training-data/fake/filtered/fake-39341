*WORST PLACE EVER*. I took the octopus and caponata and they were both terrible. On top of that, the owner was rude and arrogant. After realizing he had made a mistake in our bill, he started insulting us instead of apologizing. DON'T GO THERE, unless you want to eat awful frozen food and be insulted by a frustrated owner.
