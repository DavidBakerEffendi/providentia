This place is amazing! July 4th brunch with a good friend and the food was super tasty. The drinks kept coming (it was a boozy brunch) and the service was superb. Morgan was our waiter and it is because of him that I will be returning here. He's super friendly and witty, which i appreciate, and he made sure my friend and I got the most out of out visit. The ambience is breathtaking and light fills the place providing a fresh and cool atmosphere.
