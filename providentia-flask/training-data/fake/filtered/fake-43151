Just tried to order delivery through grubhub. Minimum order was $15 for delivery. I ordered $18 worth of food. Then 30 minutes after I order I get a call and they tell me that I will need to pay $6 for tolls. I am in Carteret and they are in Linden. Yes you could get on the Tnpk but it is just as easy to take back roads. I agree to pay the $6 because I just want my food. Then they tell me my order has to be $20 before tax. Are you kidding me? Instead of gaining a customer you lost my business and will receive bad pr from this.
