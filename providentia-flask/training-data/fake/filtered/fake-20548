We just experienced a wonderful South African dinner at Zahav.  Chef Dean Hildebrand did a great job hosting this special event.  I have been blessed  to dine all over the world and Zahav is one of the best. The enthusiasm, ingenuity and talent of Chef Mike and all his staff makes the experience a must when in Philadelphia.
