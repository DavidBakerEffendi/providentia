Last night's dinner exceeded my expectations so much that I created a Yelp account for the first time so that I could review this restaurant! I have been to Hen of the Wood-Waterbury several times, so I knew I was in for a treat. The ambiance of the Burlington location is similar but special in it's own right. Cozy, rustic, clean, modern... I really liked the "open kitchen" with bar seating, it was fun to watch while we dined! Ambiance is important for me when I go out to eat, and this restaurant gets 5/5 for that category in particular. Our waitress was FANTASTIC, which is something you unfortunately can't say for most Burlington restaurants. She was incredibly, friendly, warm, fun and knowledgeable. She was attentive and we didn't feel rushed at all. Our dining experience was definitely improved because of her. There were a lot of staff working, but surprisingly everything seemed to run as a well oiled machine. I was impressed. The food was out of this world, and I am still dreaming of it 12 hours later... The lobster small plate and winter squash crepe large plate were definite favorites. The squash fritters were like tiny fried clouds. The cocktails were also a treat. I was so happy to see a standby favorite "Cherry Coke" on the menu, only it had been all jazzed up! The switchel cocktail was also delicious and felt very seasonal. The desserts were fantastic, anything would be worth a try if you have room after dinner. As someone who dines out frequently in Burlington, this dinner became my top favorite last night. I really appreciated the fantastic service--a standout for the area. Thank you Hen of the Wood Burlington, we will be back soon!
