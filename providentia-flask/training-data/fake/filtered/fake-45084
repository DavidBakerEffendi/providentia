Well, I grew up in Boonton Township about a 10 mile drive from The Reservoir Tavern, but when we ordered pizza, this is the place we went.  My dad did the refrigeration for them for many years and I remember going with him and sitting at the bar having a draft root beer and eating pretzel sticks.  It's hard to believe it has the same owners.  Next time I am back to Boonton, I will stop in and have a pizza!
