I have been to blend on the water several times and I must say that each time has been an amazing experience!! I usually like to arrive early to my reservations to visit the bar and have some drinks by your amazing bartender John!! He is very welcoming and makes sure his guests are having a great time! One of the many reasons why I enjoy going to blend is to have John mix up drinks for me and my friends for some good laughs and fun. All of the waiters and waitresses have enthusiastic energy and keep the fun going once we're seated!
