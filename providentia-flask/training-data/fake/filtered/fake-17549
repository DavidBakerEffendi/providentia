The atmosphere was exactly what I was looking for-- fun and bustling but not crazy crowded. The ambience is beautiful-- "authentic" Mexican saloon without being kitschy, and the tequila menu (including various margaritas and mojitos) was right up my alley. But the service was pretty terrible. We sat for about 20 minutes without drinks-- we had to beg the waitress to even take our drink order-- and we only finally got them when we hailed down who we think was the executive chef who, as an apology, gave us some free appetizers that were tasty, if lacking in variety (a dozen different deep fried meats and cheeses). The tacos were pretty good, though the enchilada lacked a certain something. The table-made guacamole too, was just sufficient, definitely could've used some citrus and salt, but I dug the freshness of the table-made process. I would try this place again but, if we have the same type of service-- you know, when the waitress walks right by you without even glancing over to see if everything's ok-- it will be my last time.
