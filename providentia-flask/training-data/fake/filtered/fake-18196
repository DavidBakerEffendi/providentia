We have been to NJ to visit my sister.... When we finally made it into the restaurant, the wonderful aroma tickled our senses .. We started with samosas Â which were delicious. Gongura chicken was SOOO... good. Hyderbadi chicken biriyanibiryani here is amazing. i've had authentic hyderabadi biryani IN hyderabad, and i can definitely say that this is the closest to it. additionally, the prices are very reasonable and the food is fresh Overall, for the value, you absolutely cannot beat the complexity of flavors and tastiness of this food.
