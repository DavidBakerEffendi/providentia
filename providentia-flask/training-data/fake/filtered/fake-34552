We couldn't have asked for more kindness, teamwork and willingness to accomodate our lifestyle and vegan diet to make our wedding nothing less than perfect.  Long before we found Hartness House Inn, we looked at a couple other Inns; only to learn they were not interested in a lesbian couple holding a wedding at their facility, nor were they all that willing to create a vegan menu.  The main rooms were fantastic(and a friend could even bring her dog and stay in the cottage rooms)and the entire place had a romantic and relaxed ambiance.  The Chef went above and beyond in creating a delicious vegan menu for our guests on our wedding day, as well as for our breakfasts.  Their incredible job has won them not only our gratitude and admiration, but the loyalty of some of our guests who told us when they visit again, they will stay at Hartness House.   If you want your wedding to be memorable for all the right reasons; call the Hartness House Inn - you won't regret it.
