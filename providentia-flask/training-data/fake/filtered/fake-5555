Would definitely never come back. The waitress was overwhelmed and would not come to the table for 20 minute intervals. Took us 30 minutes to just receive the check at the end of the meal. The seating/reservation process is brutal and even though we had a reservation it took 45 minutes to get seated, despite multiple tables being open and available to sit. Seems like a silly complaint but they have 2 small individual bathrooms for the entire restaurant, no separation of mens/womens, and the line was 5-6 people long waiting in the hallways the entire meal. Why this wasn't improved upon is still a head scratcher. The sweets are definitely delicious, but not worth the horrible service, especially with all the options available in Philly.
