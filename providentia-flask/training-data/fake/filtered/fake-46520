Came to New York for a short vacation so I searched on Yelp to find good places to eat.  Ippudo did not disappoint me at all. I came just before noon rush so I didn't have to wait.  I asked the waitress what she recomends.  She said Akamaru Modern Ramen, so I just ordered that.  It was really good.  So much better than any other ramens I tried in CA.  Also got the green tea creme burlee for dessert.  It was so good.  Nothing I see in my area. Overall, a nice experience here.  Would come back in the future.
