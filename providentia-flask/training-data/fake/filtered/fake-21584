This place is great! I came accross the menu online and had to go try it.  The prices are amazing , ingredients are delicious and creative. I had the Vietnamese wonder , yummm! The speciak looked so good and it was only 4$! It was a Portuguese chicken and kale soup.  The place is small but nice and clean. The people behind the counter are sweet!  Try it and you will love it! Deffinelty worth the trip, next time ill try thr quinua salad!
