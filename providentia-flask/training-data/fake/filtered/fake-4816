To Bill Â M. from Mass. Stay in Mass. You showed up on a slow night. They were problably closing early. " Food uninspired, inauthentic and Buffet quality", You don't have a clue. I've eaten at Lisiano's at least fifty times. The specials are outstanding and authentic in every aspect of dining out at a fine Italian restaurant. The owners/chef make their own sauce. Nothing compares to the unbelievable taste. The veal is the most tender I've ever had. They make thier own salad dressing that is fantastic. The bread which is made fresh daily, easy to eat a whole loaf before dinner arrives. Bill M. from Mass. Sorry you had an unfortunate experiance at Lisiano's, but you are truly missing out. Locals from Milford, Orange, New Haven, give Lisiano's a chance. I trust you will not be disappointed. Mark H.
