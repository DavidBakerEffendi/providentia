This was one of the worst NYC dining experiences I've had. The waiter forgot about us for 15 minutes Tried grabbing his attention a couple times but he somehow was so focused on one other table that he continued to "miss" us.  I had to get another waiter to complete the drink order for the table. After 10 more minutes of being ignored, I went to the maitre'd/manager. the manager was not vailable. The maitre'd apologized profusely and sent our now sullen waiter back.  He refilled the bottled water without confirmation or request.etc etc. Needless to say the service only got worse hence the one star. Overall,the service was horrible and the food was mediocre -- Avoid the Chicke Valdostana. You needed an axe to eat this. Avoid the calamari. It was chewy Grilled Shrimp with beans -- just OK. Nothing special Grilled lamb was dry. The table of 6 savvy NY diners gave the food a rating of 4 out of 10. The total bill was $440 (wihout tip) it included $100 for wine A very expensive meal for such a poor product.
