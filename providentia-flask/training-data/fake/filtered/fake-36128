Huge, delicious pancakes and VERY generous portions! Yum! I had blueberry, friends had FRESH peach and ate HUGE luscious strawberries!  I had tea, but they said the coffee was great. i couldn't believe how quickly we were served our HOT food. Will come again when we return to New Haven.  Worth the drive from the hospital - less than 10 minutes in traffic.! If you like JAZZ and the JAZZ greats, you'll find it here as well! We are from Bergen County, New Jersey and found the prices here to be very reasonable in comparison, and in consideration of the size of the servings!!!!  Worth every penny!
