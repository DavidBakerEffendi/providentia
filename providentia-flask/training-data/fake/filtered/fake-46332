Love the ramen, it is the best ramen ever! Long wait if dont get there before 6pm. However, the bartender at the entrance is the RUDEST bartender we ever met in New York. She walked past us and said that there are lots of non tipper this evening. She said it loud enough for all of us to hear her Â Excuse me, WTF!!!! You want me to tip you for pouring me one beer under like 10 seconds and you call that service!!?? Never in million years I am going to tip you horrible attitude and service! Cannot believe a top list Japanese ramen restaurant would hire such bartender, fire her. And if you are going to the place, DO NoT recommend to order anything at the bar. Just go into restaurant, service is way better!!!
