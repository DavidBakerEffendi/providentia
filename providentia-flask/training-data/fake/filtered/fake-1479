Solid beer list and great atmosphere, sub par food experience. We were there in the evening of 11/14 (party of 2) and sat at the bar. Asked the bartender about the 'roast turkey sandwich' and he described it as "thanksgiving leftover sandwich". 10 minutes later they brought me an open-face roll with 3 slices of cold cut turkey with some bacon bits, stuffing and a few arugula leaves. Not sure if they had run out of roast turkey that evening and he didn't know or if they celebrate thanksgiving with cold cuts but this sandwich was worse than any pre-made $5.99 sandwich in a grocery store's deli section i've ever had and it cost $15. Â It was served with parmesan garlic fries, which were decent. We were going to a movie nearby and didn't have the time to return the falsely advertised item and order something else and were starving. the other food item we ordered were chicken wings and they were of below average quality. I would not recommend eating there.
