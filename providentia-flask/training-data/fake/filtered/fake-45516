Went to the Capital Grile on Saturday 12, 2013 with a party of six after a friend highly recommended the restaurant after his first visit. Service was great the atmospher was great but the food was not. I expected much more considering the high end prices. I ordered the Filet Oscar which is a standard in any good steak house. The bernaise sauce was almost inedible. It tasted as if the cook poured lemon juice into a packaged white sauce. Absolutely terrible. I did not send it back because my friend was dealing with his swordfish dish he ordered that was overcooked and dry. He did send his back and I regretfully said nothing because I did not want to disrupt our Â night out. A restuarant that features the high end prices and high end decore must ensure that every order that goes out to the customer is right on the money. For this night the $600.00 bill was extremely disapointing. I probably will not return or recommend this restaurant to anyone. The cook or chef must taste the sauce he places on the $46.00 filet mignon before he sends it to the customer.
