Hi everybody , The Resturant service is nasty , and if you look In the kitchen you will defiantly get sick Rats everywhere and they don't wash their hands At all . The person who helped me basically didn't Care about me or my order . They also change the menus around they add bacon And ham to food that didn't have it before . Also the way they treated us was the worse Please do your self a favore and eat somewhere Else .
