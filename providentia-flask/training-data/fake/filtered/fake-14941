I work near by this place for long time before even this place opened, & I'm really pizza fan. I tried their Pizza 4 times so far, but still i don't like their test. It's really horrible.!!! Owner is ok but staffs are not cleaned. Usually if I go to Mama Palma's brick oven pizza place right around corner on 23rd & spruce St., they're really really good pizza place but problem don't open for lunch. Gusto :"The worst pizza!"
