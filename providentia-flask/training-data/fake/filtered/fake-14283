You can find my boyfriend and I here on almost every holiday- I have nothing but good things to say about this place! It was heartbreaking that they were out of alligator bites when we had gone the last time, but where one appetizer isn't, another is there to make up for it. Have a meal with a pitcher of sangria, and you're good to go!!!
