ok, im from NJ and have been in this area for business several times over the last few yrs and I finally tried DelRossi's. the menu was over whelming and since I figured I cant eat all my favorites at once I would try the texas wiener and cordon blue burger, with a side of onion rings...WELL... for the next 5-6 trips down that's all I was eating, it was DELICIOUS!!!!. so then Mike the owner suggested I try their cheesesteak, well another winner!!! actually the last time I was there,11/11/2014 I had the cheesesteak, texas wiener and onion rings again, and as usual they were PERFECT!! I LOVE THE PLACE and wouldn't think of eating this type food at any other establishment!!!
