My favorite tapas place in any city!  Comfortable and cozy atmosphere.  All of the food I've tried was delicious and unique.  My favorite, oddly enough, were the roasted brussel sprouts.  Held off going back this year due to the hepatitis breakout, but will soon go back.  I'm a health nut and sad to see one of my favorite restaurants in the city go through that negative press.  Hidden gem!
