Hi, I just had some of your food. It was absolutely delicious and I really, truly enjoyed the taste. The chicken leg, rice, the green spicy sauce was excellent taste. The french fries and salad was good. Everything was excellent, what a nice meal. Compliments to the cook. I just spoke with a friend who lives in East Hartford, told her about it and she said she did see your sign. I told her she needs to try the food, she would like it. thanks again for a delicious meal. Linda
