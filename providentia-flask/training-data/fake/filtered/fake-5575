My fiance and I had dinner here during Restaurant Week.  We made a reservation on Open Table, knowing it would be busy.  When we arrived, it wasn't anything like what I was expecting - given their normal prices, I was expecting an intimate, romantic date spot, this was more like a loud, open, cattle pen (think your typical chain restaurant).  First, we had to wait awhile for a table - they were clearly overbooked; I hate when restaurants do that.  Second, they tried to give us a table that they had randomly plunked down in the middle of the walkway by the bar.  This was clearly not a normal table location, the waiter even remarked that it was unusual.  There was no way I was going to try to eat dinner with people walking on top of us, so I asked to be moved.  The manager did apologize and offered us another table.  This was only slightly better, but we didn't want to wait another 30 minutes, so we accepted.  Our server was right over with water and immediately asked for our order - okay, I guess they don't take your drink orders first.  We ordered food - and placed our drink orders at the same time.  Well, those drinks sure took a long time getting to us.  When our server brought our first course, we asked about the drinks.  She had to ask us to repeat our drink orders, clearly she had forgotten about them.  Overall, the food was decent, but not outstanding.  We had the spinach artichoke fondue, the southwest salad, the Brenner burger, the waffle prosciutto sandwich, the chocolate pralines with espresso and the chocolate fondue.  Even the chocolate was not memorable.  In short, I expected more and got less.  How disappointing.
