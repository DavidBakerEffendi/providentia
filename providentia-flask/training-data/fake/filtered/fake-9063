In town for business and thought I'd give it a try. [+] Lots of food for the money [+] Great soda choices (I got a key lime soda and birch beer) [+] Great bread and fresh veggies [+] Sweet cash register [-] So-so meat. Nothing special. I wouldn't get the cheese steak again. [-] No tables, so to-go only. [-] Cash only.
