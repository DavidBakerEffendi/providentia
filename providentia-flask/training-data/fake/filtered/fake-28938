Albanese is one of the best delis I shopped at. Bread is fresh, cooked inside, and crispy on the outside. They have the best kinds of cheeses and meats. Everything is fresh and authentic. All the kinds of high quality pastas. Prices are reasonable. A family oriented place that provides great service. The owners are very nice people, The store is old fashion and takes me back in time. They cut and grate the cheese in front of you.
