I LOVE Tom's.  Went there over the summer and it is the BEST brunch place I've ever been to.  It was so homey, with the waiters offering all sorts of delicious things, I ended up with a side dish of stuff I picked up while I ate the food I had ordered.  I got my coffee while I waited for a seat, and once my boyfriend and I were sat, the owner(I think) came by and told me the seats weren't good enough and that he could do better, and took us out to a patio like area.  When I went back a few weeks a go, it was closed, but I think I showed up too late(really late because they do brunch super late and it's awesome).  My pancakes were delicious and made with seasonal ingredients.
