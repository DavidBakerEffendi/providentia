Best bar in Greenpoint/Williamsburg! Great atmosphere and a big selection of beers. Spristzenhaus is the most sociable bar I've ever been to. There is a great sense of community even though the majority of us moved here from other parts of the world. Love the dining hall style seating areas, no booths and small tables mean the place is one big social house. And you can play jenga! Huge islands of beer on tap featuring many German beers and other great brews! Beers are on the more expensive side average $7-8 per glass, although they are damn good beers served in their original glasses. Food options are limited to pretty much fries and bratwurst. Not a place for food, but definitely a place to drink! I used to come here every weekend with friends, and now all my friends are bringing their friends here!
