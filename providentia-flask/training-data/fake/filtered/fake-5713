If you want a great Philly Cheesesteak, this is the place to go.  Being from out of town; I was surprised to find the place in the middle of a neighborhood.  Dalessandro's is not in the tourist part of Philadelphia, which means locals are the people keeping it in business.  Keep that in mind if you want an authentic cheesesteak.
