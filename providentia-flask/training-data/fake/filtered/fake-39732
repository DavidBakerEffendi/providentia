Ate at Talula's Saturday night, we got there just as it opened for dinner so garden seating (which is first come, first serve) was not a problem. Server was efficient and friendly, it was our first time there and she explained everything wonderfully. We started with the domestic cheese plate which was delicious, I even ate the goat cheese and I normally hate goat cheese. One of the cheeses (my fave) was made by the Von Trapps, of Sound of Music fame, in Vermont. They also brought excellent brioche rolls with basil butter to the table (so warm and flaky). Since it is a bit pricey I got an appetizer portion of the ribbon pasta with truffles and ricotta, it was amazing. Very flavorful and not overly filling, plus the zucchini and summer squash tasted like they were just plucked from the garden. We also got some crispy Yukon Gold potatoes with ricotta and lemon zest for the table, so good as well. My friend got the bluefish with sweet and sour eggplant and kale. I am not exaggerating when I say the eggplant and kale was the best I have EVER eaten in my life. I didn't even think I liked eggplant much until eating Talula's. His bluefish was also perfectly cooked and really fresh tasting. Finally we finished with the ricotta donuts which are served with plum jam and covered with cinnamon. DELICIOUS, it is so worth getting dessert here. Highly recommend this Â place, the best food I've eaten in Philly in awhile, fast service and beautiful atmosphere. Talula's is definitely a MUST. Can't wait to try their brunch!
