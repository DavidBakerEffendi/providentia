It is appalling how this attendant behaved with us. So my husband and me gave our names to her and she told everybody to wait outside. Her tone was bad however we understand it is her job and it's to maintain the decorum. My husband requested her if I could sit inside because I had fever with the allergies. Here us what she said in an extremely nasty manner " she has fever and she is coming to eat" . I was flabbergasted at that comment of hers. I asked her if she has fever does she stop eating ? She said " I eat at home. And it doesn't make any sense. "   Is she's going to decide for us???? I told her she is being stupid . Because clearly she was. She said " u call me stupid , get out" Are you kidding me. This kind of behavior? What did she think she was ? I would never behave like this with anyone. She is clearly spoiling  totto Ramens image. I know a lot of food bloggers . I am definitely going to tell this story . I know it might not affect anything for totto, but definitely this knd if behavior is appalling . I think she thinks she is serving God's food !!! Ippudo is so much better and the staff is sooooo good!! With best Ramen in the city! Totto ramen is not even close!
