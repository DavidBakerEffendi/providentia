This place was AMAZING! It's cash only (as their T-shirts say) so just make sure you've come prepared, but it is totally worth it. Their food was incredible, I highly recommend the buckwheat, mushroom and swiss crepe, and for dessert make sure you get something that has their homemade chocolate sauce. I will definitely be going back!
