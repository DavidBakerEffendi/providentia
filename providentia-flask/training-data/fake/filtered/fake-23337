They just redid the diner in a kind of "rustic" look--I can't say I'm a huge fan, but I'm definitely glad it's open again. The prices are higher and there's less variety of food than there used to be, which is sad, but overall the wait staff is friendly (which goes a long way when you're dealing with the younger crowd--not up the caliber of say Holstens, but very polite and quick. Food came out quickly (and was scrumptious) and we and our guests were on our way! Thanks guys!
