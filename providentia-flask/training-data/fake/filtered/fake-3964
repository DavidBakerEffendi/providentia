The atmosphere is excellent: simple, clean, and not all fussy.  This nearly casual vibe plus the BYOB was such a refreshing contrast to the high quality of the three star plates that came out.  The $25 prix fixe was really fantastic.  I won't describe the amazing food in detail, because the menu changes every day, but highlights were a braised and seared pork belly and the out-of-this world bread pudding.  Be prepared- the portion sizes are reasonable, which compared to any other restaurant seems miniscule.  But four courses (including dessert) and endless glasses of your own wine mean that you don't leave hungry.  Our waitress and maitre d' were nice, and presented us with free coffee cakes at the end of our meal (we ate it for breakfast and it was divine).  The only complaint I would have is that the time in between courses was a tad long, but good conversation makes up for this easily.
