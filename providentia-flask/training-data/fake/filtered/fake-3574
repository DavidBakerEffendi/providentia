We had a really annoying meal at this place last week.  We were a party of three, and arrived at 7:30.  We were told that there would be a table for us in an hour.  At 8:45 the hostess came over to us and offered to make space for us at the bar.  We sat at the bar for another hour - the bartender at this time never once asked us if we wanted a drink - while we watched the restaurant seat several four tops with people who arrived after us.  When we complained, they said that they reserved the fourtops for groups of four when they were crowded, and that we had to be seated at the end of the communal table, which was apparently the only place that they seated groups of three.  At 9:30 the manager actually asked the group of three that had been hogging "our" table to leave, and we finally sat down. The service was okay, although it took me about 1/2 an hour to get the refill of the water i asked for.  The food, however, was really disappointing.  The cheddar waffles on the vegetarian menu were cold, and served with an anomolous group of random vegetables.  The soup I had was fine, but had way too much cream.  Dessert was good. All in all, don't think we'll be going back
