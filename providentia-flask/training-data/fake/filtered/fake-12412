I've been to Laduree's in France, England and Japan. The quality is always consistent. I am obsessed and addicted to macarons. With that said, it was a gift from heaven to have a location finally open in the USA. As of right now, its the only one. Its worth making a visit. Qlty is just as good here as any of the other locations. These are THE best macarons. I have had many from several places. These are probably the most expensive ($2.80 each) but my advice is to stop wasting money at other places and splurge here. You won't be disappointed. The store is small and busy but elegant and just euphoric. Laduree's always have beautiful window displays. Â Strawberry marshmallow and salted caramel are 2 of my favorites. The location is walking distance to Central Park. I literally had macarons in the park. I was there last month and enjoyed their holiday flavors (gingerbread). Fingers crossed for more locations including California or Vegas.
