Recently ate at The Smith - Midtown and suggest never ordering the salads. We had a roast chicken salad, which was probably the worst salad I've ever had in a restaurant. It had a few piece of chicken, which looked like scraps from leftover chicken, and basically nothing else. We did complain, which I rarely do, but it was just so disgraceful. The manager came over and offered to put more chicken in. The salad came back with a few more scraps of chicken. Either revamp the salad or take it off the menu. Another salad, the the Ahi tuna, was better but was totally overdressed to the point it was inedible. The other food ordered was ok but whether the salad person was off that night or what, the food we were served was totally unacceptable. Liked the atmosphere at the restaurant but will not be going back. Any kitchen that would let that chicken salad out to the customers is one I don't want to go back to.
