I went here for brunch for the first time after reading yelp reviews and I was not disappointed. Â My friend and I ordered from the prix fixe menu which was only $15. I ordered the steak and eggs and a guava mimosa. From my past experiences, steak and eggs usually come with 1 dry piece of strip steak but at Beco, it is a filet and it is cooked just the way I like it, medium. The place was fairly small but we got there around noon and got seated right away. We also had an option of indoor or outdoor seating. It started to fill up about an hour after we got seated so the earlier you come for brunch the better. We will definitely be back.
