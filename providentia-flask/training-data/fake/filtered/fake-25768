We ordered two dishes for lunch.  Pollo Siciliano and a lobster. shrimp, and scallop pasta in Vodka sauce.  The shell fish dish was satisfactory, but not memorable.  The Pollo dish left a lot to be desired.  The sauce was tasteless and the chicken was too as it was definitely poached.  Most pasta dishes with chicken breast usually have sauteed chicken.  The puff bread that most people rave about was a puffed pizza dough with oil and garlic spread on top.  The bread itself was without taste.  I was at this restaurant about 10 years ago and had a disappointing experience.  I doubt whether I will ever return..
