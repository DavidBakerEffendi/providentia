BEWARE ----- horrible service/horrible waitress to discriminate on guests. so fake it was sickening.. Horrible customer service. The waitress LINDSEY and 2 employees made fun of my table in a very discriminatory way steps away from us and I could hear what was being said. It was appauling. I contacted the company through email on their website and explained the whole situation and how hurtful it was, and never heard back from them. All I wanted was an apology. The waitress never checked on us once after giving us our dinners. I will NEVER return. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!
