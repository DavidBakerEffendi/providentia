Been a regular here since they reopened after selling their 45thst location. I've always been a big supporter having referred many collegues and friends. Four colleques were celebrating our 60th birthdays.Made reservations the night before,notififying them in advance that we would be staying past the "normal " business lunch hours.We offered to give up our table and finish our deserts at the bar area as the Â wait staff started rearranging the restaurant for a private party.By the way, I was never told of a private party when I made reservations or else I would have gone elsewere.An owner (Marco) rudely asked us to leave before we finished our deserts although we volunteered to move to the bar as a convenience to the wait staff. The restaurant was recently downgraded to a B rating from an A and quite franlky the food has gone down hill since they reopened.A member of our party got food poisning from the special (Stripped Bass over spinach) and the other dishes were satisfacrory at best.. I will not go back here and recommend you thinhk twice before before making reservations here. .
