What a nice surprise. The diverse group of patrons included young hipsters, families and bed-stuy locals.  The fried chicken lives up to the hype.  Crunchy,  moist, not greasy and the hot is tolerable if you are used to spicy food. Save a piece to eat the next day, tastes even better. Fried green tomatoes - excellent.   Forget the waiter's name, but he was a big guy and very nice. The bad:   The service was slow. I'll cut some slack because it was packed on a Friday night, but  we must have waited an hour for the main course.   The place is quite small. Some of you mentioned free cornbread. We sure didn't get any, neither did we get pickles with the fried chicken.   The mac and cheese - not great.  They need to rework  the recipe to make it more southern style. I thought I tasted nutmeg in mine. I plan to go back, think I'll  try the ribs next time.
