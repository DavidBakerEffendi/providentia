A great addition to Fairmount.  Food is delicious, coffee is some of the best I've had around here and the staff is super friendly.  They work quickly and efficiently to get your food prepared, but not too quickly that it feels like a typical deli.  It's still got the gourmet cafe feel to it.  I highly recommend the brownies, cookies and cakes too - delicious and fresh.  All in all, a very welcome addition to the neighborhood.
