I order take out from here probably around twice a month. It has great flavors and good portions compared to some of the other Indian restaurants around. The butter chicken is wonderful and I am now working my way through the vegetarian menu. The service at the actual restaurant was friendly but a bit slow, however I haven't eaten in there for about a year. Overall, better food, better portions, and a bit cheaper than Tiffin.
