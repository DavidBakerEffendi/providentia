Wonderful restaurant! Beautiful interior! And above all else, absolutely delicious food! I was first brought to Rucola by friends who were so excited to have this great new addition to their neighborhood. I have since been back no less than 3 times! (in the short time they have been open, this means I'm a HUGE fan). The menu that some described as being too short is entirely seasonal and fresh, has been different every time I have been, and is quite complete as of my last dinner. Last night,  an amazing Pork Loin  was the perfect combination to a rich and unctuous Bucatini. The salads are to die for, and this might be the only place in the city where you can have a delicious wine for less than $30! Speaking of price, I have never paid more than $40 per head (appetizers are around $9/10 and entrees $17-20), including wine and desert (so good! save some room). Portions are straight out of Italy, enough for a normal appetite, might want to go appetizer, entree and desert if you are feeling ravenous. I recommend 100%. Dining here is wonderfully pleasant, service is great. Mosey down to that lovely corner, and open your eyes for the beautiful plants that decorate their facade. Love it!
