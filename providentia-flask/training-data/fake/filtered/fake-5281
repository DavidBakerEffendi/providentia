The food was delicious, with good veggie options for a set menu, the ambiance was beautiful. Service was very prompt and courteous. The lamb and its sauce were superb if a little dry/tough at parts, and also came in quite a large portion size. The other components of the dish were quite forgettable taste-wise, although an honorable mention goes to the chestnut polenta for inventiveness. Overall a great experience!
