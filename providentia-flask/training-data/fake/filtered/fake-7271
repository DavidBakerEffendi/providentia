My, oh my.... get over yourself! Not only does the venerable Balthazar NOT deliver on weekends, Â you cannot even place a takeout order and do the dirty work yourself. My call was greeted by an icy hostess who told me dismissively, "Balthazar doesn't DO carryout on weekends...", to which I replied,"uh, what!?". Seems the way things are going in the restaurant world these days a wise restauranteur would beat down your door for a $50 brunch pickup, but perhaps their time is better spent bowing low for a Topshop party. What,EVERRR... jerks!
