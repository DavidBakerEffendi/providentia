Love this place easily became one of my favorites.  I went on a Friday night and had to wait 15 minutes.  My friend and I sat downstairs by the bar while we waited to be seated.  The fifteen minutes felt more like 5, the bartender was friendly and was great at suggesting drinks he made us a passion fruit cocktail and a basil gimlet both were to die for!!!! The dinner was excellent as well, I had the country fried steak heavy but well worth it.  Everyone raves about the mac & cheese and there's a reason for it I suggest w/ the truffle oil!!
