Pomme Frites looks like a crap hole in the wall but don't be fooled!! Yes, it's open late and yes it's great drunk food but it's home of the Mango Chutney!!!  MC dipping sauce is absolutely delicious and according to the staff it's 'New York's favorite.'  For those not in the know, you're basically eating homemade French Fries, Belgian style with a huge variety of dips.  Be adventerous, try something other than catsup and mayo...and why not...it's FREE!!  Yeah, they have a free sample that I personally abused thoroughly all through my teen years.  When you do buy it's very inexpensive.  Tiny seating area.
