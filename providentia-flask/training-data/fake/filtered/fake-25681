I had the Hakata Classic Ramen. The ramen serving a little small compared to conventional Japanese servings.  Broth was good, chashu pork a little on the sparse side but soft and well-cooked. The nigirizushi (hand-rolled sushi, not the rolls) was small and overpriced.  The sushi bar was not the freshest quality and the serving sizes, again, smaller than conventional japanese standards. I've spent many many months in Japan and have come to recognize good ramen and good sushi (which is soooo common over there !) Overall, great ramen but would increase the serving sizes by 1/3 to justify the prices charged.    The nigirizushi price should be about $6 for 2pc instead of the $9-10.
