This is a South Indian restaurant, not the standard North Indian fare.  The variety of tastes and subtlety of the spices make this interesting -- there is a new agey feel to some of the dishes.  The service and setting are so-so at best.  A note of caution:  We (an office group) included a generous tip, but were still charged a 20% gratuity.
