HANDS DOWN- the best food in Chittenden county! Every last bight was mouth watering, I couldn't be happier that I stumbled upon this place! The beef tips were so tender and perfectly cooked and their rocket salad is to die for! My friend had the fresh baked haddock which was equally fantastic, LOVED the cabot cheddar mashed potatoes!! Everything is made fresh from scratch with all and only local ingredients, from the dressings to the desserts! Our server was very friendly, personable and informative which made for a very fun and inviting evening! I can't wait to bring the rest of my friends to The Lakeview House Restaurant to experience truly amazing food and service!!! After our meal in the dining room we were able to cozy up in the lounge for a drink and had a blast joking around with the other guests and bartender!
