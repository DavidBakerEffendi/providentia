This place is pretty much amazing and the best place to get sushi in Philly.  Hit up the yellow tiradito (might be off menu but you can certainly order it or something similar).   Their specialty rolls are creative/fresh/awesome but this is one of those places where you should really try some sashimi and some non-maki roll options. I'd definitely recommend sitting at the sushi bar if you can, order a few things to start, and then order some more things once you've had a chance to check out some of the pictures from the TV up front (you'll end up wanting almost all of them). You can even go with people who don't like sushi because they have things like paella (which is awesome there) and other entrees. Churros for dessert!
