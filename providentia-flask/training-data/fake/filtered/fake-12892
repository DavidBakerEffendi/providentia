I want to give Cafe Ollin les stars due to the service but I can't because the food is so delicious. The problem with the service is the dine-in wait time. I've been here many, many times and I've never waited less than 45 minutes for my food. This is ridiculous because friends in the neighborhood have told me that if you order delivery, it takes 30 minutes total. I think the restaurant focuses on having really good delivery times but force their dine in customers to wait. I actually sat near the waitress/hostess once, heard her take a telephone order and the person came in to pick up their order, all while I was still waiting for my food. My food arrived about 20 minutes later, even though I had placed my order before that person called in. Not good. I always go when I'm not in a rush. They make some of the best tortas around so I suffer through the long wait.
