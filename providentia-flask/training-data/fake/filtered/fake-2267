3.5 Stars Nice little place in Alphabet City.  Tight space, pretty loud, nice bar, good drinks, helpful waitstaff. Here is what we ordered: Cocktails: Jamaica 107 - the hibiscus infused whiskey and lemon juice made this drink too sweet for my taste. Last Word - Very good. Beefeater with lime juice, green chartreuse and maraschino liquor. Pisco Punch - again, very sweet, but I would expect this from a "punch" drink. Dark 'n Stormy - Meh. I was anticipating a really good mixture, especially with the ginger beer...this was not my favorite. We snacked on some Guacamole and Chips while we read the menu.  The Guacamole was ok.  I have had better. Entrees: Chaufa de Costilla - the beef short ribs should have been more tender.   Black Cod - very good.  The miso glaze was also quite good. Lechon Confitado - The pork was fatty, however the truffle puree and the chilies gave it a very nice flavor. A La Parilla - I asked for my Rib Eye to be done Medium Rare.  There was no pink it it at all. Side Dishes: Espinaca - A very nice combination of spinach and dried figs. Chocio - Very good. The corn was sweet and the butter was delicious. Arroz y Frijoles - your typical rice and beans. Dessert: 4 Cafe Con Leches - good. Flan - for such a traditional dish I expected more. Panqueque - very good. The crepe was light and I enjoyed both the spiced pumpkin seeds and the pistachio ice cream. Tres Leches Cake - the hibiscus salsa was a nice touch. Churros - the dulce de leche sauce was good. Overall...it was ok.
