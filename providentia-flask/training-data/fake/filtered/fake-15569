Easily the best lunch spot in Newark, hands down.  Our entire office picks up lunch at Cafe Airlie.  (Most of us also stop by on the way to work in the morning for coffee and an egg sandwich or muffin.) Always clean and comfortable, incredibly friendly people (they'll know your name and your favorite sandwich within 2 or 3 visits), and good, freshly-made, healthy food. Definitely add Airlie to your list of Newark lunch spots!!
