Extremely gorgeous!!! We love sitting outside, with the views of Monet's Bridge. It absolutely great to walk around Grounds for Sculptures, and then in the late afternoon to come to Rat's. The cul-de-sac where Rat's is located is simply gorgeous. It has this huge tree in the center that bends over gracefully, there were also misters on the ground which provided a welcome mist after a hot day. Location- Did I say extremely gorgeous?!?! They have koi fish outside on the left hand side of the patio. Food- We went to the Fourth of July Lunch and I was really pleased!!! The meat cut like butter and was really yummy. The salmon was also really delish, with its golden crispy shell. The beans were deliciously sweet and I was really happy. Another time I came I ordered a hamburger which was really undercooked, but the waitress just brought me a new one. The fries are amazing!!! THIS PLACE IS NOT FRENCH THOUGH!!! Service- Good in general. Just DON'T FEED THE DUCKS!!! We got yelled at for doing that. Dessert- Just really really good. Even the watermelon at the July Lunch was really crisp and sweet. And the tea is really fun and brewed perfectly! I hope you end up going!!!
