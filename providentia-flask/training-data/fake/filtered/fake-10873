Geez, I love these guys' pizza. Been a fan of the family's pizzas since I was a kid, back when we would go to the Hudson street location. We were all sad to see them close on Hudson st, but the Robbinsville pizzas truly live up to expecations as we continued frequenting BOTH locations until the end! The antipasti are traditional (NOT a "salad"! so if you want lettuce, order a salad! they're delicious too!) And they serve birch beer.
