ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE!  We ordered penne vodka and rigatoni with meat sauce tonight.  We wouldn't even feed it to the stray cat that lingers around our house.  We had to order a pizza to feed the kids.  What kids turn down pasta?  Not mine, well, usually not.  The penne vodka was extremely dry, with a somewhat resemblance of vodka sauce on top.  But it wasn't vodka sauce.  There were these dried sticks in the sauce, I guess they were dried spices but I had to spit them out they were so hard.  And the meat sauce?  Tasted like it was straight out of the jar.  The sauce was brown, not even red!  Gross!!!!  NEVER, Ever again.
