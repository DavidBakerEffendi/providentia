This was my first Cheeburger Cheeburger experience and I really liked this place.  Ordered the Pounder Challenge with BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese, & crispy onion rings, and maybe a few other toppings that I can't remember.  They have a huge list of free toppings & a few specialty toppings for a small fee.  Also ordered a side of onion rings. I crushed the Pounder Challenge and will live in infamy on their wall of fame (at least until they run out of room).  Despite a huge burger, it was REALLY good.  They cooked it to a perfect medium, which I was quite impressed with.  The beef was quality and the onion rings were crispy.  The choice of dipping sauce for the onion rings was also a nice touch. Service was attentive & friendly.  Good place!
