This place rocks! What a nice addition to the options in the LES.  The antipasti and insalata dishes are both creative and delicious (in particular the insalata di riso, the spinacini e finocchio and the noci e asiago) and all loaded with ultra fresh ingredients. Meanwhile as for the namesake risotto dishes? Fugeddabouddit! Have tried the medley, the swordfish and the pork so far and all are as good as I've had anywhere.  And the portions are more than plentiful, easily enough for 2 sittings per order.  Surprised there have been no reviews yet, I've been ordering here for close to a month now, so I guess I must've caught them right at their opening.  Check 'em out for sure, they're a great find and welcome addition to the area culinary fare when you're in the mood for what they offer. Def enjoy
