Can't make comment on any if the food but if you're on the hunt for coffee then I probably wouldn't bother. Â The gentleman who served us wasn't exactly friendly but it wasn't poor service either. Back to the coffee - percolated coffee plus a bit of milk doesn't equal a latte. I had begun to think that it was just how things were in New York but have since found plenty of places who know how to make it right.
