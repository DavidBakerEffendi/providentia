Yelp said that it was the best spaghetti in NYC, my wife will disagree.  She spent the remainder of the night feeling ill.  I ordered the top sirloin, someone needs to inform the kitchen that when a piece of meat is cooked properly there is no need to drip some kind of sauce on it.  I have had $44 steaks at Flemings, Morton's, McCormick and Schmick's and this was not a $44 steak. I don't know if the regular chef had the weekend off, but I could've received this "steak" from Sizzler for half the price.  Waiting 2 months was not worth it.
