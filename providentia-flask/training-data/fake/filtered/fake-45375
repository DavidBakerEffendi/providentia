I've been here several times and each time was enjoyable. Chicken & waffles, Lobster & grits, salmon... They're all great dishes. Only down side to Soco is the price. Â As a party of 2, we easily spent $150 on dinner and drinks alone. The portions aren't huge so we did leave just a bit hungry. What you're paying for at Soco is a great, trendy atmosphere. Wile the food is good, the prices do not equate.
