We came to eat here after our wedding in 2000.  My entire family, mostly from Bangladesh, still talks about this place.  Everyone remembers the pumpkin puree.  My husband and I have come back every year with my in-laws and the food hasn't changed a bit.  I have been getting the Montoo and Pumpkin puree year after year.  We love the live music that has been added recently and the new location.  We also love to chat with the owner's son, a dapper entrepreneur and engineer.  It has been a joy to track his progress over the years as we enjoyed the food, music, and environment.
