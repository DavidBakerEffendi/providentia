We must have gone on an "off" night, because it was not a good experience. I ordered the beet salad, and my husband ordered the mussels in a curry sauce. The beets arrived as if they had dumped a whole can on a plate. The presentation was very unappealing. The mussels had the wrong sauce, (mustard), which my spouse hates! I took two beets, and the small amount of salad that was underneath, and then couldn't fathom eating  anymore. The waitress took the mussels to be replaced by the correct order. Fifteen minutes later, with little attention from the waitress, I decided to cut my losses and leave. We told the hostess that "it was not working", and that we were taking our unfinished bottle of wine and leaving. The truth was revealed, that the waitress had mixed-up the mussel orders, and the other table had gotten the  curry sauce. Yet no apologies were ever made, it was if they just wanted the whole mess to disappear. It was our last evening in NY and to say the least, a downer!
