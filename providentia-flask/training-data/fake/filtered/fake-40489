I took day off ,long drove to Philadelphia ,may have little eat or bar make fun. stopped Bridget Foys', walking to south street ,had very friendly staffs in there, very cold outside, not like winter but cold air is fresh, seeing not busy today in it and inside outside tables for new year holiday time.  I was  hungry and took quick for my stomach, the shot rib hash delicious and hot coffer warmed all over me.  I'm not a big proponent of the whole half-star thing, but... *if I could, I would give Bridget Foy's a 3.5 star rating.* but I still give four star.
