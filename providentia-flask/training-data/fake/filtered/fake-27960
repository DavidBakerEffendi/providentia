I went to MEAL this past Saturday for a birthday celebration. As one reviewer wrote, Nutley def needs a some new places and this hit the spot. We were a group of 8. We ordered several appetizers including the mac n cheese (had to get 2 of those because it was so good), the spinach dip, steamers and salads. Everyone was able to get some of everything and we left the plates empty. For dinner I went with the braised short ribs and was not disappointed. The ribs, carrots, potatoes were great. I only wish I had more of the sauce/demi glaze because that help put it over the top for me. Others at my table got the filet mignon, salmon on the cedar plank and the red snapper special. For those that got the steak each one of them came with a side roasted clove of garlic that was great. Â I did not hear one complaint at the table. The best part of any meal: DESSERT. Again we split desserts around the table. We ordered 2 cheesecake lollipops (which comes out on this tree with 3 fruit dipping sauces), a chocolate cake for the birthday girl, the gelato of the night, the bread pudding and apple crisp. I had more of the crisp and bread pudding. The raspberry sauce for the pudding (also one of the dipping sauces for the lollipops) had a bright, clean and refreshing taste to it. Overall we had attentive waiters, the place was clean and had just a great overall relaxing feel to it. As of now its BYOB but they mentioned they should getting their bar soon. I know my friends and are already planning to return there and we live about 40 mins away. If you are in the area, you can't miss this place!
