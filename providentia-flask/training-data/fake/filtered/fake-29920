I have eaten at Jumbo Palace for years. Most of the time I took my food to go but this week my family ate there. To our dismAy, during our meal there were cockroaches crawling around. They just smashed the roach and walked away without cleaning it up or anything. With how many other reports of bug problems I have read since this happened I will NEVER eat there again.
