Let me just say that I go to Bite all of the time. It is my usual breakfast/coffee stop in the morning and sometimes my lunch stop in the afternoon. Ordering can be difficult if there is a crowd but I have yet to have a bad experience. Bite is just so convenient. It is close to my office, the food is decent and the prices are manageable.
