Have I ever got disappointed at any meal after dining in Malagueta once every two weeks for a year?  Never. Friends from Brazil, Greek, China, Taiwan, or U.S. having meals there all get impressed. Most claim it is the best non-steak-house Brazilian restaurant  to them. I talk with the chef and owner, Herbet, about his food. He insists on using only fresh ingredients. He loves fresh herbs, and always applies them magically and delicately to his dishes. I have tried almost every dish on his menu, and never hesitated to order the same meal whenever coming back. My boyfriend especially likes the median-cooked shell steak. Our Greek friend, who grow up believing only well-down meat is eatable, tried the same dish once and changes his mind forever.   The restaurant is very family friendly, especially on the weekend afternoon. The restaurant becomes more romantic when it gets darker with candle light and fresh daisy flowers at each table. Inexpensive place to dine, but interesting in many ways for a try.
