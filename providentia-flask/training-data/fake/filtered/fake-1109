Food here was OK.  Very inconisistent.  Chicken Liver Pasta was great as well as the Octopus Pizza.  The Pork Special and the Steak was terrible. Service here was really weak.  Seemed uninterested and very annoyed with us.  We do not look like the ritzy customer they are used to so didn't give good service but in the end she was wrong because we had a BIG check and I've been in the business for 15 years and still am and she definitely hurt herself in the tip area. All in all a little inconsistent, weak service, cool vibe, and very very pricey. Will not return, will not reccomend to anyone, but will not stop anyone from going either.
