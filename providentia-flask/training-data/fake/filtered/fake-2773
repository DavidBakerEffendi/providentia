In 45 years of my life and in the customer service industry for over half my life I have honestly NEVER been treated so horribly before. The owner is beyond rude and so is the staff. Horribly managed and quite frankly he is discriminative.  We had a party of 10 and we could not make a reservation because they do not accept. It was my son's graduation and we drove close to 45 minutes. The owner does not seem to like big parties. Maybe because they can't turn tables quick enough.  Regardless he actually did us a favor.  I would never spend my hard earned money somewhere that treats people so poorly and could not care less about their customers.
