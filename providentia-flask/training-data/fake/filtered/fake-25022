This place is great! I love the pork dumplings, with chive or onion. The pork sandwich is great too. Everything is better with the duck sauce. figure on about a packet of duck sauce per and item ordered. I haven't had their sushi but i would expect that it is very good for the money. The only knock on this place is that they don't clean their tables off and quite a few people can't seem to keep their mess on the tray or remove their tray when they are finished with their meal. but what do you expect for a 5 dollar meal great value in the notoriously expensive union square area.
