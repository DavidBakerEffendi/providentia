Dropped in for lunch and sat at the bar in The Tap Room.  Bennett, the bartender, was delightful - warm, efficient and adorable - even when extremely busy.  The food was great and a good value. All of the staff was incredibly welcoming and seemed genuinely happy to have us there.  This is wonderful spot and we will definitely return!
