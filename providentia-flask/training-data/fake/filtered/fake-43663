Hands down the best brunch and burger place in Williamsburg. I can honestly come here every single weekend for the Moroccan Scramble or Ricotta Pancakes and, of course, the Truffle Fries. YUM! The owners are sweet, hospitable, and accommodating Â and the of the waiters are welcoming and funny. i, however, had an unpleasant experience with a female maitre d' who was flat out rude and nasty. Sometimes you get stuck with a kooky waitress that has no idea what she talking about, but you honestly can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Treat yourself to dessert :)
