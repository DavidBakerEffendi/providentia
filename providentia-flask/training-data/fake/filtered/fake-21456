Excellent food--flavorful, lots of choices, fresh, interesting.  A superior choice if you're shopping the Sixth Avenue corridor.  They need to work on the service model a bit-- the ordering system is kinda convoluted; we weren't sure where to start or how to order--but the staff was friendly and the end result was worth the wait.  We were actually smiling at the end of our meal.  Pricey?  Eh.  No more than other choices in the neighboring and far, far more satisfying.
