We recently enjoyed dinner on a Friday evening at Cedar Point's outdoor patio. Cedar Point  was crowded but the hostess handled the seating well. We didn't have to wait too long.   The waiter was also attentive and our food came quickly. As an appetizer, we shared tender chicken wings which were spicy but not too hot, and which came with grilled Brussel sprouts, a  great contrast.  My husband had fish and chips- the batter wasn't greasy and the fish was moist and really tasty; as good as any we enjoyed in Ireland and England. And  the potato  fries combined with sweet potato fries were a yummy compliment. I ordered the kale burger- it was good but it could have used more spice for my palate. So I borrowed the sauces that came with the fish and chips. Definitely recommend Cedar Point for good food, good atmosphere, good experience at great prices.
