I stopped in here the other night with some friends and it was awesome The menu had something for everyone on the table, even my vego friend. The pork chops were to die for and that dessert pie was yum! I also tried some of the cocktails.. the Dudley drink was lovely and so was the devil one with tequila... that i am coming back for! But what caught my eye was the cider on tap served on the rocks... it reminded me of London!... so refreshing on summer night... i think we sold them out of it that night.. Ha. Â  Definitely be back Mr Dudley and with many ciders to follow.
