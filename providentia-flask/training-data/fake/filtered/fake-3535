This spot is NYC's PREMIER TATER TOT CLUB. Most good NYC nightclubs will charge you at least a grand for table service. But I was able to score a table at American Retro for FREE. So sick. At first I was pissed that they didn't offer (traditional) bottle service. But after I threw a bit of a fit, the manager explained to me that we COULD get bottle service - just that the bartender would have to serve it to me and my bros one drink at a time. Seemed like a pretty tight idea. Wonder if more places will start doing that? Sickest of all, Retro (unlike every other premier NYC nightclub I've been to - and I've been to A LOT of premier NYC nightclubs because I'm a wealthy businessman/sex addict) offers a wide variety of tot-based dishes. My boy J-Dubb got an order of "Pizza Tots" - an Italian take on the grated-and-fried potato dish. I went with the "Tot-chos" - Mexican-style tater tots. Long story short, I don't see myself ever going to another nightclub that doesn't offer tots. OTHER REASONS RETRO IS NYC'S HOTTEST TOT CLUB - Conveniently located next to a Mobil gas station - Also down the street from Larry Flint's Hustler Club - which doesn't serve tots despite the pricey cover - Retro has this dope robot-DJ that will play whatever song you want in exchange for a dollar. - There's not a ton of room to dance, so me and J-Dubb just played skee ball and split "Disco Tots" instead.
