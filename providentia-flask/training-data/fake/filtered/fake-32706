So many of my friends in Astoria speak highly of this place that I felt it was long overdue to visit. Â Its really good but sometimes when you give five stars for a pizza and regular italian joint could you be stretching a point. However this place has some genuine original dishes and a few surprises too. The night I went I wasn't delighted with my meal but my friends were gushing about theirs. Its definitely a cut above average and after visiting you will understand the high rating.
