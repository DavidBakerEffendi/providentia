Walk by Twenty Manning daily and always wanted to check the place out because it felt like a nice environment/atmosphere. Great look for a date, but because of the high ceilings it gets a little loud inside. Aside from that everything was amazing nice beer list, seafood was amazing. I don't usually do seafood in Philly, but out of the few places I tried this is by far the best I've had here. Everything on the plate from the salmon to asparagus was fresh and cooked just right. The service was also really good considering it was packed that night.
