I recently had a party there.  The food was very good.  The service was fine (tapered off as the evening went on and food/liquor started to disappear far too early in the night when the party was still in full swing). Major issues working with the management to settle party details, pricing, etc. When the final bill came, the headcount was off (they counted high) and they charged the per person price higher than what was agreed. They tax food/liquor and more importantly warrant 18% gratuity on both.  (I have family in the restaurant business .... never seen anyone charge gratuity on liquor). They were unrelenting to do the right thing and adjust it accordingly.  Mind you, we're talking $150 on a $2,500 bill.  Hope that money goes a long way cause you just lost a customer (not to mention, I won't recommend the place to any of my 40, errrr 39 guests).  Hope it was worth it.  Sad. Get a contract with these people including details.and don't let them do business without it.  Otherwise, you'll regret it. I've thrown many a party and spent some big dollars in the process.  Never dealt with people like this who put the dollar before customer satisfaction. These are the types of places that no matter how good the food is, you take your experience and run the other way.
