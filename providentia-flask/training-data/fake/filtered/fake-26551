We were two couples who made a reservation, but when we arrived, there was no record of that reservation. That should have been a sign. Nevertheless, it was early enough on a Friday to secure a table for four. Reminiscent of a railroad car---long and narrow--the space was dimly, albeit ambiently lit. It's BYOB and there are several wine shops around if you so desire. We tried between the 4 of us an assortment of appetizers: menage a trois, a carpaccio-arugula-garlic-ice cream salad, and a wild mushroom soup. Lovely plating and easy on the palate. The entrees we chose ranged from the salmon belly special, veal, cod, and mahi. The black orzo of the cod was over-salted as was the salmon seasoning. Again, pleasant plating. The nutella dessert was fine. But the coffee should have come with the dessert as requested. Our service was fine, but the waiter was of that arrogant ilk (unlike the staff at Asbury Park's Porta who enjoy what they do without the airs). And never, never in my life have I been rippe off at a restaurant. The maitre d' who took the cash and credit card slipped himself a 20$. I've never experienced the like and as a result we won't be going back to Blu. So count your bills and dig in ---not into your plates--to your wallets.
