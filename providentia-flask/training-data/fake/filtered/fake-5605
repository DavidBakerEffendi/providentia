Mixed veggie and paneer tikka to die for!!!! I am addicted, literally! They are cheap, delicious and perfectly spiced! My office is 3 blocks from Spice end and I almost order my every 4th meal from here. I actually miss them on weekends.. It might sound as over exaggerating and this craving ,I am hoping, will go down soon but as of now I am infatuated! A friend recommended this place to me when they opened but I was skeptical about it,and he was the one who forced me to try them once and now I am thankful! Their paneer tikka is to die for!top them up with the perfect blend of white and hot sauce and I bet u ,anyone would get addicted! Their sauces are the icing on cake..especially the white sauce. Guys I recommend you to just give them a try once n you wont regret it!
