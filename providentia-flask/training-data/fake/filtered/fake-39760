First visit on a Friday evening between 7-8, not real busy. Very nice place, great food, 3 stars on waiting staff. Could have 4-5 stars but we waited a bit for water & then again for refills. We had purchased a mid priced bottle of wine so we had something to drink but at this level water is a given. We will give it another try and review again.
