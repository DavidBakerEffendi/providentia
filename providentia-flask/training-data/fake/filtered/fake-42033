Was really looking forward to eating at this place. Left feeling frustrated. I am allergic to shellfish.The waiter gave me the wrong dish, which contained shellfish. When this was brought to his attention, he stated that  all soup broth served at this restaurant contain some type of shellfish and that I should have known that. His "assistant" waiter had the audacity to ask for a tip...he also wrote the word on a piece of paper...and  when I stated that I could wind up in an emergency room due to their mistake he responded by saying "that's your problem". I was appaulled by the attitude of these male waiters and have vowed to never return to the restuarant. So IF YOU ARE ALLERGIC TO SHELLFISH BEWARE!!! I must say the prices are cheap, the only plus to the place.
