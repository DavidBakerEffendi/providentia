I had my baby shower here and it went amazing!  The back party room  was large enough to fit over 75 guests and it had fun lighting, pretty chandeliers, and they work with everything you need to make your party the best day ever.  The service was great ,on point and courteous.  The food was just as delicious and presentable! My father in law , brother in law and husband also attended but sat in the bar area and got served like kings!  I would definitely recommend throwing any type of party here.
