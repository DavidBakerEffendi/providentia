So good! If you've never tried Ethiopian food, you definitely should! I was in the mood for something...different and the bf found this place on yelp. We live in Queens and drove out here yesterday just to dine here--it was definitely worth it! Glad to see yelp reviews are on point again! Started off with a Kategna--soo good! The spices, the flavors--and the best part, no meat! :) Then we shared the vegetarian combination plate with one of everything since it was our first time. Everything was good--I personally didn't love the green saucy one (likely the Aterkek Aletcha aka split pea) but that is just personal preference. My favorite of the vege plate was definitely the Misir Wett--mmm soo good! We'll definitely be back! Likely sooner rather than later.
