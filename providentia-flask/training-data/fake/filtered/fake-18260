Hello yelpers!!!! This is Christian!!! I recently moved into Montclair from Manhattan. I've tried every pizza place in town but they where all yucky until I came across soho. All I can say is THANK GOD for this place it is Devine. I work on valley road so it's an easy walk from my job the other day I came in for a couple of slices and ohhhhh my god amazing!!! I had a slice called the supreme-o pizza and it was heavenly so I decided to try it again for dinner but I ordered food and wow it was just as good if not better than the pizza I had a chicken parm sandwich and a salad salad was nice and crisp very fresh and the sandwich was so tasty the sauce on the sandwich was so good could of just ate that LOL. Overall I will be back!!!!! Cute place with amazing pizza and food.. And the staff is very nice keep up the good work guys!!
