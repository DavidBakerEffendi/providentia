I heard some great things about this restaurant and decided to try it out for myself. I was impressed for the area, but it still has a ways to go to impress my standards. The food was good - but I've had better in Manhattan. The service was great - again, impressive for the area. I just didnt like how they sing 35 specials to each customer. Wine list was OK. I'll give it another try sometime soon though...
