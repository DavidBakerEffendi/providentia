The Reading Terminal Market is a MUST for getting locally made goods in PA, fresh seasonal produce, or a bite to eat. My favorite thing is to pick up some delicious homemade cinnamon rolls from the Lancaster County Amish community. It is good to note that the stands run by the amish close an hour earlier than the market. Also the amish are not at the market on Sundays. This is a great place to take out of town visitors as well.
