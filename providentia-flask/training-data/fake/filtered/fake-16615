I LOOOOVE Yakitori Boy! I've been going there since it first opened! (I live a couple of blocks away). It's dirt cheap, the food is amazing. They have some traditional japanese food that you won't find anywhere else (ie: okonomiyaki, my fave). Tuesdays is 1 buck skewers and 1 buck coors light, can't get better than that! Waitresses are great, the bartenders are awesome. Upstairs is equally great too. Everytime I pass near there on my way to another place, at night, I hear people singing their guts off and it makes me smile.Love Karaoke too! the rooms are great! I'm sure this restaurant will do better than the new Stephen Starr's japas place (don't know when it'll open but it'll probably be a japanese version of the continental.)
