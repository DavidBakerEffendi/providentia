I love this place! My girlfriend and I have been a few times. The food is always amazing, I love the ambiance, and the staff is friendly and awesome. I love that the owner is always so calm and engages with customers. I also enjoy the hostess and the charm that she brings to the restaurant. One of my favorite places to enjoy a delicious Southern meal!
