The food here far surpasses any expectations you might have walking in the door, and the menu ranges beyond your standard tex mex fare. I've had almost everything on the menu at one point or another, and its all very good. If I had to recommend one thing, it would be to check out the specials. They aren't always right in front of you but they tend to be a step above the already good standard items. The beer selection is great, and--not sure how they control this--the crowd is generally a really friendly laid back bunch. I wish they were open on Saturdays during the day.
