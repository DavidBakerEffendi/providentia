I wish I owned Grimaldi's.  Lines out the door and cash only.  Nice. What's not to like about this place? The setting right under the Brooklyn Bridge is awesome, the pizza is fantastic. Not much elbow room and the waits can be excrutiating, but who cares? And you can get kick-ass ice cream at the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory after gorging yourself on a delicious pie. Polish waiters, Mexican pizza makers and an Italian owner. The Pope would be proud.
