I recently visited Pylos while in New York on business, and it was fantastic. We didn't have reservations, but were sitted at the public table, which was still quite comfortable. Our server was attentive and knowledgable, recommending a great Greek wine. Everything from our appetizers to dessert was excellent, but I have to particularly recommend the moussaka. This was Greek comfort food at its finest!
