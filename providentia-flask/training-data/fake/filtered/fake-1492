The White Dog Cafe is quite good! Some colleagues and I went here when we were in Philadelphia for business, and I feel it was a good choice. A little pricy, but not bad. You get what you pay for in this case, because the ingredients are quality. While the menu may seem a little pretentious, it's ok, because it is really quite delicious. You can tell they take their food seriously here, and it shows on the plate. Also the servers were knowledgeable but not as snooty as you get in some locavore type places. They have a cheese menu that changes out often. I would suggest getting the 5-cheese plate so you can try one of everything. Their cheesemonger really knows what he is doing! It's not an everyday sort of place, but for a fancy night out, it is worth it. Two thumbs up from me!
