Best chicken biscuit i have ever had. Unbelievable gravy and radish combination. They put an enormous chicken finger on a homemade biscuit, which lays on a bed of radish. Also salmon biscuit is great. The guy who owns it is the man, so nice and friendly. He gave me a free french donut. Two annoying things -- the door to the restaurant is a nightmare. He should get rid of that door. It is a swinging glass door that doesn't open all the way, and is really heavy to open, especially when its crowded. Secondly, it takes a while to make the sandwiches, but that's not really a big deal.
