We'll definitely be back! As NNE-ers, we often head to the pricey restaurants downtown for breakfast, coming out wondering why we paid close to $50 for eggs and pancakes. The Guilty Plate has an excellent omelette and quality pancakes, and you can't beat the price. It's also roomy and therefore a great place for our 2-year-old. Lots of places downtown never leave room for high chairs at tables. We found the service excellent. They only opened 5 months ago, so maybe they were working out kinks.
