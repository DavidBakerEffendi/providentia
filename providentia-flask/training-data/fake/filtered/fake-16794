this is based on my last visit about a year ago... I did not post at the time but feel that I should I raved about this place to visiting guests (having gone once before) and we went for a post theater dinner. I understand by 10 pm things are slowing down but if you are going to take reservations for that time and still serve food I believe you ought to be on top of your game regardless of the hour. this was not the case: -- multiple servers asking us the same questions then disappearing for a long period of time -- I ordered apparently the soggiest mushroom pizza I have ever seen...it was so greasy and soggy that parts of it ended up on my dress as it was served to me by one of our waiters...the rest oozed on the table. -- who allowed this dish to go out of the kitchen? it was an utter mess (dripping everywhere)... even if I made this for my home I would not serve it to guests and I am not professional cook -- when I told another waiter... he brings me one of these "pre-wash pens" after 10 minutes... hmmm my dress was silk and this was certainly not cut the grease (it did not) finally we leave... the host/manager at the time asks me about the experience.... I tell her I am not happy...she apologize profusely at which point I have hopes... she offers to pay for he dry cleaning of my dress (silk) and gives me her email address (she did not have cards) for over 3 months I email her about this and nothing happens. Over a year later: still not paid for my dry cleaner and even though she has my receipt I never saw a dime. It's really not about the money but the principle... Do what you say you are going to do! Maybe Jean Georges needs to focus on the consistency of the experience as well (I have a few friends who have been to his other restaurants and from one time to the next it's been night and day: best ever one night and worst experience the next!). I feel this would never happen in a Boulud/Meyer restaurant...
