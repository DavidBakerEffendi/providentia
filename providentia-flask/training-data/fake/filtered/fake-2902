Presentation is EVERYTHING!!!!  After coming from Puerto Rico and eating AMAZING food, I was curious about Cuban Petes.  The place is cleverly designed and the staff looks colorful.  And then it is all DOWNHILL after that.  I know what Carribean food is supposed to taste like and this isn't even close!!!  $50 for what tasted like BS microwaved food!!!!!  HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND!!!!!!!  Trust me, if you know what this food is supposed to taste like, DON'T GO.  I suspect that the majority of people that enjoy this place have no idea what cuban food really tastes like.  As far as I'm concerned, this is referred to as false advertising!!!!  HATED IT!!!!
