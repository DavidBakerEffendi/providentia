I recently had a rehearsal dinner (actually, brunch) for my wedding at Farm on Adderley and I was really pleased with the service. Everyone was seated right away, the staff was polite and courteous and the food was excellent. The menu offered a nice variety of foods to choose from, which was great for our diverse party. A great time was had by all.
