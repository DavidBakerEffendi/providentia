So I've heard of Pies and Thighs for a while now. I finally ventured there last week. Let me say what a great set up, and what fun options. With that being said lets start on the food.  I am in love with the fried chicken , my family is from North Carolina and I've eaten fried chicken my whole life. The chicken here was moist and quite flavorful.  My friend got the catfish, she was pleased with the color, texture and everything else.  I had the  butternut donut one word " Lifechanging"... Oh and their Arnold Palmer was really good too.   Now for the cons the MAC AND CHEESE IS HORRIBLE.... How dare you tie yourself with the word Southern and have bad MAC... The cheese is chalky... yucckk.... Bake your Mac and cheese  and use good cheeses please.... It made me upset as a customer that everything else was soooo good and your mac and cheese was SUB PAR!
