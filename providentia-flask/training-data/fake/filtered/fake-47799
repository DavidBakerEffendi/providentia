Our work department was out to dinner at the Oyster House last night for food and drinks to celebrate the upcoming holidays.  Unfortunately, three of us (out of ten) came down with a nasty case of food poisoning.  We suspect that it might have been the fried clams since none of us ate the same entrees, but we did all share the clams around the table.   From a non-biased opinion, I thought that the decor and service at the restaurant was great and definitely felt modern and cozy, all at the same time.  The only complaint that I have is that some of us ended up sick not long after leaving.  My advice is -- please check your clam inventory and/or the sauces that were served with them.  My main focus is ensuring that no one else gets sick, too!
