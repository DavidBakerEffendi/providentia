We used to be regular visitors to Lalibela. Used to think of it as one of the best vegetarian Ethiopian fares in the region (there are couple of others in nearby towns). The food used to be great but the customer service was always questionable. But last night was the tipping point. On arrival, we weren't even welcomed to the place and shown tables to sit. We ordered the Beyanitu (Veggie Combo) and picked 6 veggie entrees. Two of the entrees had too much salt. Now, we know how they usually taste but on this occasion they were over the top salty. Â We complained to the waiter who wasn't even remotely interested. We wanted to see the chef and his reaction was worse - told us that's how those dishes were 'supposed' to taste. And he wouldn't even acknowledge the fact that something is wrong with the dish. We took off right then and there. The chef tried his half-hearted apology when we told them we're not coming back here. Sorry Lalibela, you lost two regular customers.
