I went to Eataly two weekends ago expecting to be blown out by the prices...but ha!  Eataly's prices, especially for fresh produce, were CHEAPER than here in DC.  And the $10 glass of Prosecco with either chunks of Parmesan cheese (this must be an Italian hors d'oeurve, since I haven't had it since I was in Ravello) OR a generous slice of Panettone was a BARGAIN!  I can't imagine why DC food prices are so much higher than NYCs, but they are.  You guys should quit whining up there.
