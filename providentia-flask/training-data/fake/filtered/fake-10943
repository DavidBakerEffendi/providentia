Blue Point is a nice BYOB seafood restaurant in Princeton.  They feature fresh, high quality seafood. They have high prices, but it is well worth it. I am not usually a big seafood junkie, but their Halibut (when on the menu) is fantastic. I went there last Thursday and had their Skate special which was delicious.  I haven't seen that offered too many places these days. I'm a fan of their soups, shrimp appetizers, and calamari. My boyfriend loves their raw oysters, a nice variety to choose from.
