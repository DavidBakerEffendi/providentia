LOVE this restaurant.  Best BYO we have ever found.  This is our go-to restaurant for a consistently perfect meal. We love the pumpkin ravioli and the short rib ragu.  Incredible cheese plate for an appetizer.  Also, the brussel sprouts (what? brussel sprouts?) are so incredible as a side dish.  So great that we are now believers in brussel sprouts. Dessert is good too...if you have the room.   You can feel the energy of the kitchen since the restaurant is so small. Definitely expect a wait on the weekend, but they will take your cell phone number and allow you to have a drink across the street at Valanni.
