Tampopo has a very basic inexpensive decor. You order at the counter and the give you a pager that buzzes when you order is done. They a a few specials that are good values for the money. I chose the Bento box with the inari special(4 inari for $3.50) They didn't have any suaces(including soy) except for a spicy sauce(pretty good) which is unusual for an asian restaurant My bento box(spicy hot tofu) was well prepared and presented. My broccoli was cooked perfectly, the curry potato gyoza was light and crispy, the baby carrots were fresh and crunchy The rice was nicely sticky with good texture. The tofu wasn't as hot and spicy as I wanted but that's typical nowadays from all the `Oh I want my food REALLY spicy' people who then cry when they get something with four turns of the pepper mill There is free water from a water dispenser if you dont care for any of their cold drinks
