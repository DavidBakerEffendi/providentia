Went to Ducks for dinner on a warm-ish Friday night - they have great outdoor seating and open windows to the tables and bar inside. Loved the décor  - brick interior with a large barn door in the back, subway tiling on the bar, artsy lighting, nicely done. I had a "Bloody Julius" to drink - refreshing with orange, an herb (rosemary or sage?) and a hint of cream. I can't remember the liquor involved, but it was tasty and not too sweet. My fellow diner had the Empire Brewing company's "White Aphro" beer - yum, the beer actually has a hint of lavender in it! The beer selection is unique, and though they don't carry a ton, the options are quality. Ducks seemed to be featuring all small plates at the moment, so we decided to try several. I wish I could look at the menu again to remember all of the dish components, but everything was scrumptious: Scallops plate, short ribs, BRISKET!, and "Deez nuts" - which make me never want to eat normal trail mix again. The nuts are a sweet/salty combination of housemade jerky, cocoa krispies, bing cherries, nuts, etc... (yes, they are served in a paper bag w/ Ducks logo, and I thought it was a great idea! I even asked for another order to take them home). Looking forward to going back, especially to try more cocktails (they all sounded/looked delicious) and entrees when they are available! Get the brisket if you can. Seriously. Like buttah.
