The Narrows is by far the best bar in New York City and I'm a New Yorker who knows my bars! It is friendly, gorgeous, elegant and the garden surpasses the ability of words to adequately express its green lovliness. Nothing like having one of its signature cocktails in the garden's lovely quietness surrounded by green and more green and mosquito free that's to those citronella plants. And those bartenders!!! I could look at them all night.
