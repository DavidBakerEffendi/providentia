Hmm. I've just started going to Pepe's in West Orange about 10 months ago, though I've known of the place in West Orange for about 3 years now I guess, as I frequent the Chinese place next to it. Anyway, as mentioned I finally tried it about 6 months ago, and have held off writing a review of it until I had eaten there at least 8-10 times. Not sure about the a couple reviews that can be found, but the food is excellent there, I mean absolutely delicious, made home style. Mind you, I've not had the entire menu - primarily the Pork & Beef Ribs, Rice & French Fries, Lomo Saltado & the Peruvian style steak served with eggs - they offer more of course but not had everything Never had a problem with portion size, etc. Actually, it's quite a value - especially $19 large rib order with a choice of 2 sides... it's a full 2 meals, at least. So you get 2 home made delicious Peruvian BBQ meals for about $10 a piece. Not sure how one goes wrong in that scenario. Most stuff is made to order, with a couple items pre-made (but not frozen and fried!). - Jonathan Sands
