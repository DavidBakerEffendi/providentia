This place is a great hole in the wall, you'll miss it if you're not looking for it restaurant.  I love the spices that they use in their foods!  My favorites are the chicken salad (HUGE portions) with extra grilled vegetables, hummus (of course) and any of the kebabs, which are generously served with rice and veggies.  Delicious!
