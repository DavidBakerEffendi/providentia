I have been meaning to go to this restaurant The view is amazing... The decor and lighting was elegant..host was nice.. Our waitress Michelle was attentive and a sweet heart she earned her tip.. The staff in suits kept checking up on us but maybe because we were hot looking girls hahaha..just kidding...i had the passion fruit margarita it was awesome but i like anything with passion fruit lol for appetizer i tried the chorizo with mac&cheese and dinner was the churassco steak.. the prices were reasonable and affordable nothing crazy.. I will definitely go back
