WOW! Is how I'd like to start my review of La Follia.   My wife and I have been meaning to go since it opened and it greatly exceeded our expectations.  This area is severely lacking a good, warm, go-to Italian restaurant and now, at long last, we have one. We started with the eggplant caponata which had capers and raisins.  I don't normally even eat eggplant and this little dish was phenomenal!  We also had the chickpeas balsamico which was very tasty but paled in comparison to the eggplant. Next up were the Crostinis, which were absolutely out of this world!  The Ricotta with pesto was delicious and the mascarpone with clover honey was so good, I considered ordering it again as a dessert. For entrees we split two dishes so we could sample as much as possible.  The orichette with fennel pork sausage was incredibly flavorful and the penne with cauliflower and squash was an excellent, seasonal dish. We finished off the meal with a nutella, banana panini. OMG! The staff was extremely friendly and attentive and we can't wait to go back.  We're looking forward to the opening of the wine bar!
