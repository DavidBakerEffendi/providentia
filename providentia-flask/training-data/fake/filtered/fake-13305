Have yet to conquer half of Maharlika's menu, but already they've captivated my heart and palate. The atmosphere is pure family and good food, but still as accessible as the the next food joint. I'll be back in hopes to preserve such a lost tradition of home-cooking to it's finest. Making all the mommas and aunties proud.
