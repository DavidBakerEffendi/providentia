I and cousin about noon eat a meal in Traif. There is fresh seafood, such as Scallop in Shell like for us to enjoy. Although yelp Traif inside on the duck praise or a lot, but we did not try the duck courage. We as always, point we are familiar with the Seared foie gras with a fried egg. this is a dish, we recommend not greasy, and garnish with special foot. Bacon doughnuts but we must point the dish, because my cousin and I were like crispy taste. With the Burrata and figs and Fresh Fruit Salad, we eat very satisfied. And the spaetzle is very normal. We do not recommend this dish. The service here is amazing, the entire restaurant atmosphere is very soft and nice, especially the table by the window. I give 5 stars
