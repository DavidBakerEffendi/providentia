Sandwiches are great.  Service terrible.  Ordered 2 sandwiches to go on a Saturday.  I didn't have time to sit for table service.  Paid in advance.  It took over 45 minutes to get 1 sandwich out!  Canceled the other.  They said I can come back and get it whenever I want since its already paid for, however, I don't have that much time to kill!  There were 3 others having the same problem.  People were turning around and walking out.  If you're going to expand you better make sure you can handle it.  Making a good sandwich isnt enough around here.  When you charge double you better be able to deliver.  Went to amity meat market around the corner.  Good sandwich, no wait, reasonable price.  Katz's never again.
