We love iMunch. Typically we get the herby chicken sandwich and the chicken panini.  Both are excellent and, in my own mind,  these are among the better sandwiches in Philly.   Coffee is great too, they use coffee ice cubes.  Thinking they don't want to dilute their coffee and I thank them for that.  Thanks iMunch! They made a very comfortable eating area upstairs so like a nice mix of eat in and take out.
