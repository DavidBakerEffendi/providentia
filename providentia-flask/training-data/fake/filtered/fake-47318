it was definately better.  I enjoyed it last time, but the  BRUNCH WOW'D us.  I never new they did Brunch. Apparently all new according to the waiter, but you'd never Know. I was impressed.  So were my 2 kids who loved the chocolate Fondue fountain and of course their eggs and bagels 1st. I loved the omlet station and the fruit... love the strawberries very fresh. Great Brunch!! Coming East Sunday.
