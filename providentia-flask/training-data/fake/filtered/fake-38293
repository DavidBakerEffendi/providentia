Stay away if you don't want to ruin your evening/night Yesterday (Saturday night) me and a couple of friends were craving some decent creole food. We came in, the place was packed, so we put our self on the waiting list. We were sat at 8 pm, our orders were taken promptly. We chatted, waiting for our food, that was not coming.... . Our appetizer arrived around 9 pm......and the main course......at 10 pm. I have no idea what has taken so long to cook a couple of fried items. What upsets me even more is that the waitstaff kept on assuring us that it will be just another minute, that our food is on the way.... I ordered fried catfish platter, that came out without the coleslaw and my friend never got her soup. We got some free deserts, which was nice, but by that time we were done with that place. Overall the food was nothing special and clearly they have some problem with the kitchen staff.
