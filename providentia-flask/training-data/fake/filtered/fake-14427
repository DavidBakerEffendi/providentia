I used to order from this place because they're one of the only non-pizza places that will deliver in New Haven. No more. They are CONSISTENTLY rude on the phone, keep changing the delivery minimum (sometimes $15, sometimes $20), and the curries are watery and tasteless. Noodle dishes are so-so; sometimes the noodles are fresh and sometimes rubbery and old. If you order something "spicy" they'll just throw chili flakes on top of it. Then, the last time I ordered, the shrimp in my drunken noodles had gone bad--they had a strong rotten fishy smell that permeated all of the noodles (which were rubbery). One bite and I threw it out--it was food poisoning waiting to happen. After reading Haran T's review, I didn't really feel like getting in a fight with them over what constitutes bad shrimp, so I threw it out and swore to never order from them again. If you're in New Haven, just walk or call a shuttle for take-away (FROM ANYPLACE ELSE!).
