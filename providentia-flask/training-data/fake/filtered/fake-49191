Insultingly cheap ingredients used to make what should be baseline-passable dishes gross. Didn't know you could serve bad vanilla ice cream. The pineapple fried rice was mushy and gag inducing. My mother and I laughed through the entire meal at how unbelievably bad the food here was, and how they didn't even try to hide the fact that they were spending all their money on decor. Created a Yelp account before the bill came to try to help keep them from cheating anyone else out of money.
