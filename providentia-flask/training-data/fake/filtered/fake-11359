This is the place to eat on Manhattan! We where a group of four from Norway and we just loved this place! *If your on a budget it's probably not for you, but the food is amazing! We had a blonde waitress from Australia, and she was THE BEST! Joking and having tons of fun with us! We loved her! *We had the chefs tasting menu and it was delish! And the rose that went with the second course was insane! Best rose we ever had! *Had to wait 20 minutes for our table so we had oysters first at a bar-like-place (inside the food house) and wow, what a perfect place to have oysters for the first time! We'll definitely go back there the next time we are in NYC!
