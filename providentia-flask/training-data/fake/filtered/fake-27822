I chose to register with Yelp just to write this review. If I hadn't known Lucali's reputation beforehand, I would never have the patience for the experience I received. Our party of four waited the infamous hour and had to remind the "gatekeeper" that we were next to be seated. And it's a good thing that we did, as she had forgotten... Our waitress's service was shameful. When prompted, she struggled to recommend a combination of ingredients to us. Instead she shrugged as if to say, "I don't know, like, whatever."  Brilliant. The saving grace was the pizza. It was delicate and well balanced, but it was also unjustifiably overpriced. 25 for plain cheese and three dollars for each additional ingredient is tantamount to robbery. Wait: Long Service: I can't believe you remembered what I ordered Atmosphere: Pretty cool Booze: Every other restaurant but this one Pizza: Pretty good Bill: Too damn high Payment: Cash only Conclusion: I think paid way too much for a mediocre and exhausting pizza experience.  If Lucali's didn't have descent pizza, it would have died a quick death many years ago.
