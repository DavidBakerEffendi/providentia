i just placed an order for a blueberry bagel with a little butter...the delivery came and it wound up being a blueberry muffin....i called them right away to have them bring me the correct order and the guy on the phone who by the way hardly speaks english (surprise, surprise) says they dont have blueberry bagels...REALLY? why not say that the first time?! oh i know because they dont speak english!  not only that  he hangs up on me...i called back and got someone else who in turn told me the driver is very busy and cant delivery for at least an hour...OK thats fine...told her im not paying for the bagel since they delivered the wrong thing and i'll keep the muffin....as i was gonna ask if she had the address...she hangs up on me....called a third time...got yet another person who said she can credit me or it wont be here til an hour...ok fine...2 hours go by and nothing....called back and they proceed to say the driver is still busy and leaves at 3 and it wont be delivered til monday.  WTF??? the previous girl i spoke to took my phone # and couldnt call to tell me that? even so, i hadnt eaten lunch at all as i am waiting for my lunch to show which never did! Terrible way to treat any customer...why? because my order was only $2.25 and not $20.00.... Just unfair!! Lost another customer!!!
