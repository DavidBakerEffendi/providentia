Passing through from Virginia and was looking for a place to try a vegan Philly Cheesesteak--I'm glad I stumbled upon this place!! Ended up ordering the cheesesteak, a bubble tea, and a chocolate chip cookie. All were delicious and better than anything I've had back home! Service was fast and friendly and I loved the appearance and atmosphere inside. Highly recommended. Hope I get to come back and try other things from their awesome menu one day!
