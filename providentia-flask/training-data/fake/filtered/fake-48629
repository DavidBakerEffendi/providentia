Ok! We had an horrible experience just few minuts ago, the waitress (Melanie) was so rude and Â unrespectfull, we decided to leave without to order, because she said "If you don't like me there is the door" what kind of service is that? I hope that the manager of this place read this review and understand that is impossible to have people like that working in a place where the food is so good but the service is awful!!
