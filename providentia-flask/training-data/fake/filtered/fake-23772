I'll make large exceptions for somewhere with so few options for vegetarians such as we when the food is as good as this. The place has the word 'pig' in it's title, not 'tofu'. So it would be particularly stony-hearted of me to withhold any praise based on that. The one thing that does catch your eye is the sign saying that it is licensed for 90-something people "in the interests of safety" or something. It *seemed* as if that was being flouted on this particular night, although that could be untrue, as they seemed to be having a meeting for agoraphobics anonymous (West Village branch). And the whole of West Village seems to be agoraphobic, what's more. But a good thing too, think of it as a test of character and discernment. I personally will gladly risk being crushed to death for their sheep's' cheese ricotta dish, the only veggie option on the menu, but frankly the only one I need. (However, if the chef does decide to stick one or two more choices on there, I won't complain.) Service is A1, brisk, timely, and I can't help but admire how swivel-hipped the wait staff are as they carry trays through the marauding hordes of clientele. The fact that the place is crowded doesn't seem to affect the experience, which is testimony to how slick the operation is. They don't take reservations, and quite right too. It would be like booking a spot in a rugby scrum. Wine list is extensive and covers just about all bases, with a better than usual European representation. The place seems to be loosely based on a British-style pub, but it's far too pleasant, amiable, high-end and non-violent to bear any close comparison. To sum up - if you want a quiet night with a sweetheart, this place would actually work, strangely. The fact it's so busy only adds to your anonymity. If you're bringing a party of 6 or more, it might be a little tricky judging from the glum expressions on the party of 6 waiting by the door - but I just don't think it's that kind of place.
