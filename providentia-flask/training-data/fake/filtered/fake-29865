So I have been eating from Urban Chicken for almost a year now.  My first order was in person and was quite cook.  Subsequent orders were done through a delivery service - not from Urban Chicken directly. The food took forever to arrive and the chicken was cold. Called Urban Chicken to complain and was told that I should order from them directly which I have done several times over the last several months. Delivery directly from them has not been substantially better and the food still arrives sometimes cold.  The quality of the food has also gone down over the last few orders.  While the delivery person is a delight - the girl taking the orders on  the phone is NOT.  She often sounds like she bothered that she must speak with you and when you call to say the order was wrong, you will never get an apology.  You may think writing to their website would help and that you would get a response - 3 emails to them and not a single response.  My experience with them has caused me to decide to buy my chicken somewhere else in the future. Too bad as I would rather support a small local restauranteur than a large food chain but I am afraid to say that I am done!
