Came for lunch and left extremely satisfied.  The decor is clean and bright.  Service was quick and each of our entrees was delicious. Started with the papaya salad and the crab nuggets.  The papaya salad was exceptional - so much flavor and still felt light. I had the vegetarian jasmine friend rice which was very flavorful even without any additional sauce.  One friend had the panang curry which was fantastic.  I've had panang curry at other Thai places and they tend to be overwhelmingly spicy.  This one was spicy but let the sweetness of the curry come through.  My other friend had the pad thai - a simple dish but done exactly right.  We will definitely be back!
