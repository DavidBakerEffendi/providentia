We were shocked when we read the other reviews, except for the negative. How disappointing. I will agree that the decor is pleasing..but that's where it ends. Service-The service was okay. Our main server was knowledgeable about the wine list and menu items. The other one was clueless. They were not overly attentive. Management "managed" to spend their time at one particular table and never came by to see how our meal was until the end..when they noticed we hadn't eaten everything. Food-We had the soup first. It was lukewarm but somewhat tasty. More broth than anything. We then had the wild mushroom bruscetta. Good but not memorable. The bread basket was great. All made in house fresh and warm. Best part of the whole meal. We then chose 3 pastas. The gnocchi with lobster bolongase. Awful. The pasta was not fresh and not properly cooked. Flavor was odd.   Gnocchi was crab. Even worse. Then the "pillow" ravoli with hazelnut oil. Are you kidding me?  Tiny portion and neither light nor airy. Dessert we had the espresso and orange sorbet. Also the chocolate gelato. Nothing was memorable. Way overpriced. I would not return. We have so many other amazing choices of Italian food in the city. This is a very weak example of Northern Italian food.
