This place had some line, just to eat this roast pork with Â broccoli rabe and provolone cheese. I enjoyed it the peppers added more flavor to it. I advise everyone to try this place. it is superb. The service is excellent as well, and the sandwich is juicy. the market reminded me of Essex and Delancey Street in Lower Manhattan.
