My boyfriend and I went there last night. We were originally planning on going to Pepe's but zero parking and there was a line outside the door. We drove around until we found Portofino's free parking and figured this would do. Walked in and we were the only ones there. I knew this was a bad sign since watching every episode of Kitchen Nightmares... we sat down, they turned on the music (Frank Sinatra - typical). It was 6pm and only one other couple shared the restaurant with us. I got the Manicotti and my boyfriend had some special with fuscilli noodles, cheese and tomatoes. It was awful...terribly bland and the sauce was like a chicken-noodle extract with zero taste/flavoring. My manicotti was decent. Waste of money. Liked the staff though and feel bad they won't get many tips at all.
