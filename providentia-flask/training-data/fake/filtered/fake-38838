Very over rated. I found the food to be a comic disaster of "minute proportions". We opted for the ten course tasting menu with pairing. Each course was smaller than the next. The first was a tiny cracker with a caper on the plate.  Even a single piece of sushi would have been 500% bigger than this pretentious insult that had no flavor and was thought to be a joke at first.   Degustation tries to serve food like single pieces of sushi at some of the trendy sushi places in New York City.  Yet the food is not as good, the portions are smaller than a single piece of sushi and the prices are much higher. Of all the pairings only two were right.  So the two of us left with a $300.00 bill. And then WE WENT OUT TO EAT. That's right!   We were starved.....  If you love to eat....  I mean FOOD!!!  You'll hate this place.   This is NOT Tapas for humans. Anyone who thinks this pretentious, unfriendly, overrated, overpriced place is GREAT....  needs to get a reality check.
