I love Juventino! This place is the best-o. The food is fresh, delicious and has a home-cooked quality, yet is not unsophisticated. The room is very nice, they have a great back yard area which is gorgeous when the weather is right. I LOVE this place for brunch. Best egg dishes, you can't go wrong. They have a great mixed greens salad which you can get them to 'supersize' if you ask, no extra charge (leave a little extra tip). Friendly staff, what's not to like! Muy Bueno Juvento, muy muy bueno. (I don't speak spanish)
