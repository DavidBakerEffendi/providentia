I went to Sefarat Mediterranean cuisine with a group of friends and it was our first time. We loved the location very friendly and family oriented, the manager recommended us to have mixed appetizer and mixed Sefarat platter. It was a great choice because all of us got to taste a little bit of everything and see what we liked I absolutely loved the shish kebabs the meat was tender and juicy precise to my taste. The price was decent we had lots left over and we were able to bring our own wine. Planning to visit this cuisine often. Would recommend to others and order the baklaba for dessert it was out of this word.
