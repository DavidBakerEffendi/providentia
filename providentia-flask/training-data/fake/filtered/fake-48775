I like the menu and atmosphere. Had a group for dinner. Service started slow but improved once they saw that - we didn't need to say anything. They have a tight menu of food, beer, and wine so that choices are easy and worthwhile. Started with a cheese & charcuterie selection. Small plates but quality is there. The Butternut Squash Soup was very good. Thick and full of flavor. The Roasted Chicken was great. Corn bread that came with it was interesting - made it his own way of course. The gravy wasn't as pleasant but I didn't need it as the chicken flavor and moistness were perfect. The Scallops also were perfect - no more needs to be said! The Flat Iron Steak with hot peppers was delicious - though I could have used bigger peppers. Missed out on dessert but I'll try that next time. Worth more visits. Right next to the Amtrak/Septa station so easy access for commuters like me.
