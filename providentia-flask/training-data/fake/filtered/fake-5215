I have been coming to Marzullo's since it was a little deli in the early 1990s; they had best Italian subs around and at that age my metabolism was such that I could eat them.  Now, I stick to the salads, which are truly amazing.  The green salad with chicken is enough for both my husband and me, and the staff will put anything in them you want.  I also love the rice balls; they are just so good.  And if you want a treat, get their cannollis.  They are seriously better than any cannolli I've ever gotten at any bakery - they fill them for you while you wait.  Great.  Now I'm hungry.
