We recently had a surprise birthday celebration that included a party of 24 people at Cafe Goodfellas' new location.  It was an absolute superb experience.  The service was impecable and the food was excellent.  It turned out to be the best time and a great experience for the many guests who had not been there before.  This place is rated #1 in our book and we would not even think twice about having another party event there again.  It  has become our favorite place in the New Haven area to dine.....absolutely top shelf food and service with an awesome atmosphere.  Our guests raved about it and we were totally satisfied.  The new location decor is beautiful!
