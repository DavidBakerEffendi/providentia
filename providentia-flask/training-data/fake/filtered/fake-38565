Not worth the wait! We had high expectations after waiting an hour to be seated, then 40 min for our eggs but were very disappointed. Food wasnt anything spectacular. They also gave me my ice tea in a cracked glass. When i showed the server it was cracked, she said it must have happened when she poured the cold ice tea into the hot glass. She kindly said she would get a new glass. I watched her pour the ice tea from the cracked glass into a new glass. However, fearing there were already small pieces of glass in the ice tea i didn't drink it.
