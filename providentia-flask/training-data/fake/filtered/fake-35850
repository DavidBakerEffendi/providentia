Loved my first visit to The Gryphon! I really enjoyed that they had light fare options as well as full entrees to choose from. I didn't get cocktails that night but the menu for them looked amazing! I got a simple burger Gryphon Burger and my date got the Gryphon Style Cuban, and we were both blown away and MORE than satisfied. We also got the carrot cake - TO. DIE. FOR. Dear God, it was delicious. Not to mention the service was amazing and super friendly (our waiter was Jeff, YAY JEFF!). Will definitely be coming back to try the lunch menu and hit up the wine list!
