Excellent atmosphere. The server was really sweet and friendly and seriously insanely delicious shrimp and grits with well poached egg. And their signature fried chicken and waffles was spot on amazing. Crispy batter and moist chicken. The waffles were well prepared and the choice of three flavored butters (blueberry, Rosemary and lemon honey were all incredible) and also nice to get real maple syrup with it. Overall could not rave enough and can't wait to go back!
