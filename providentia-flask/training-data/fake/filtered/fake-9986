I went to sabrina's a few days ago. I went around 2pm and there was still a bit of a wait but it wasn't too bad. A friend of mine got the breakfast burrito which was pretty average to be honest but the stuffed french toast was delicious! The portion was really big as well and I'd definitely come again. Great atmosphere and our waitress was quite friendly!
