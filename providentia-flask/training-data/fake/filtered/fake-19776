Owner of this place deserves FIVE STARS for rudeness and is exactly what the customer service should NOT be. It was embarassing to be talking to with him in front of my family as he is one misfit character for any sort of people facing work. I would strongly recommend that you consider other places and not spoil your evening at this loser of a place. Â Good chance that you will end up hungry and mad after you visit this place. Try other Indian resturant like Mirchi etc on the next block.
