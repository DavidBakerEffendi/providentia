Great spot. Simultaneously hip and unassuming. Casual atmosphere with great cozy vibes. Went here for brunch. ordered the avocado benedict. The brioche wouldn't have been my preferred bread choice, but it was scrumptious to say the least. Also ordered a bloody mary, beermosa and mimosa. If I had to chose just one perfect brunch drink I would go with the beermosa made with ommegang witte. Check. it. out.
