My daughter and her husband live in Williamsburg, and believe me when I say there is no shortage of incredible restaurants there in which to dine.  Traif is one of our favorites, and I always insist we dine there each time I visit.  We usually start off with the calamari and I have never been disappointed with this dish.  The strawberry-cinnamon glazed Berhshire baby back ribs another favorite--the meat is so very tender. The pork belly is a must--fatty and delicious.  We ended our meal with the bacon doughnut--glad we ordered, though I'm not sure I'll order a second time.   The service was very good, as were our drinks.  This restaurant is so good that I will often call Traif to purchase gifts cards to send to my daughter and her husband for special occasions.   I will be back!
