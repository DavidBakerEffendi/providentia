I am sorry. The service is good but food isn't. It is too expensive for such a small portions. And not the best sisig I have tasted. I have been eating filipino foods all my life, soooo I would say that the money we paid for isn't worth it. And the drinks..... I mean the juice is on a very slim glass with a lot of ice. What a rip off. Very friendly and nice crew though.
