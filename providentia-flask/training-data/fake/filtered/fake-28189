I had been waiting for this place to open for months, i walk by it everyday. I ordered 3 things 1. cheese steak 2. mac and cheese and 3. cheese fries. I took them home with me and was disappointed with all three. The cheese steak had a slice of cheese and not good quality meat on wonder bread. I was expecting better cheese, meat, and bread. It was also soggy. result, one bite, threw the rest out. Next up...cheese fries- too salty, not enough cheese. result: threw this out too. Finally, the mac and cheese was amaz---nope, it sucks, through it out too. In addition, the atmosphere is for little kids. Overall, it's overpriced, bad food, and has cheap ikea furniture. You get more for your money by going to Cars (if you do take out, i wouldn't eat at Cars either). I would have felt better if i gave someone 5 bucks and let them kick me in the nuts rather than wasting $20+ on this crap
