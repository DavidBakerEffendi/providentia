One of the best Italian restaurants I've been to! Despite how busy it is all the time, the service is great. Becco has delicious pasta and they have a great all you can eat special. One time they gave us complimentary dessert wine for slow service.But we didn't even notice the "slow service." We were pleasantly surprised.
