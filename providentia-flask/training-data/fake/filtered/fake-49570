Came here for Saturday brunch with a few friends. The food wasn't the worst, although serving sizes are extremely skimpy. For the amount of food received, prices are exorbitant, and should have been reduced by at least a third. The presentation of the food was sloppy, with food arriving jostled and out of place. However, it's possible that this was a result of negligence from the waiter. Service was lackluster. The food took a long time to come out, and the waitstaff were rushed, inattentive, and somewhat rude. This may not be important to some, but I was unsettled at how long we had to go before empty water glasses were filled or before empty appetizer dishes were cleared. Overall I was very underwhelmed. If you're hungry and/or don't like overpaying for tiny portion sizes, I'd suggest that you eat somewhere else.
