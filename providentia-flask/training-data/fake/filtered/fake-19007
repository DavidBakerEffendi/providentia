Any pizza that you order from here will be amazing.  Their signature Artichoke pizza is what keeps me coming back - creamy sauce, perfectly baked crust, and whatever else that gives it that full flavor. The vodka pie is also really good when you're craving something saltier but similar to a regular slice.  The pizza margerita is awesome.  As you can tell, I can rave about everything that they serve here.   This location is very small, but most people tend to order to go so it doesn't get too crowded.  It's a little pricey, but rightfully so.  A whole pie costs $25 - $30, depending on which one you get.  CASH ONLY. Be sure to eat it with a cold beer just to make it that much better (just when you thought it couldn't get any better)
