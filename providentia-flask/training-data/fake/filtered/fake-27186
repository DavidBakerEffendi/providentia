One more added to my favourite and frequently visited restaurants. Good decent food. We tried the Tejas chicken for Appetizer and for entrees the blackened sword fish and shrimp and crawfish salad. The portions were real good. Chips and salsa was awesome. The rice was the best I ever tasted in a Mex place. we loved the food. The wait wasn't bad for monday evening around 8 pm. The place was buzzing by the time we were there. The service was fast and real good. Thumbs up!!
