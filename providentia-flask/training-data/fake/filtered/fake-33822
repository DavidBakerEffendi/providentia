We had reservations for a party of nine. Drinks and apps came fairly quickly, but dinner was a wait. When we'd had dessert, the manager came and said he needed our table for another large party. To be fair, he offered to buy us drinks in the bar area, but we wouldn't have fit comfortably together there with the size of our party. I've never been pushed out of a dining area like that before, and considering the extended time it took to bring our meal and the amount of cash we dropped, I was embarrassed and appalled. I won't book another 'special' event there again.
