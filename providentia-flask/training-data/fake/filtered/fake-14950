My husband and I come to Mama Palmas all the time, simply because it is the best! The owener is kind, wonderful , and always treats us well. He is always accommodating, and we have no problem waiting on the weekends for the the best food! The salads are huge and the pizza is AMAZING. This will continue to be our go-to place every weekend. Also, look out for our favorite waitress, Kate! Great service. You can't miss her friendly award winning smile and personality. She will be happy to help you with the amazing menu choices. All around, awesome place. Mama Palams is our favorite!
