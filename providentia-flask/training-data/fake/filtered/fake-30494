Just what this this culinary mecca needs, still   another Italian/pizza joint. Why won't someone open a nice bistro somewhere nearby? Why? After returning to my hometown after living in Brooklyn for the past 20 years, man do I miss great little neighborhood bars and restaurants. This area needs some. Desperately. But instead we get another ancient Trenton transplant. And ancient is a good word to describe this place. The menu is the same as it was 20+ years ago. The same cheesy 1970s bottles of oil and red wine vinegar on the table, an antipasto that still consists of iceberg lettuce, beets (?!!), and little bits of chopped up salami and cheese that look like little dog food kibbles, same as it did in the 80's. The pizza? Eh. Barely decent. It may have a new location, but this place is dated and tired. Which is fitting because while the place was packed, almost everyone in there was 65+.  I guess they're reliving the Papas of their youth. In short, It can't hold a candle to Delorenzos, which actually evolved when they moved to Robbinsville with great and unique modern salads, and the pizza is just worlds better. Sorry Papa. You're living in the past.
