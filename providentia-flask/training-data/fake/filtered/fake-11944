On 2/13/14 I called an order for pickup...first person I spoke had an accent....annoyed that I called....rushing my call...when he repeated the order it was incorrect....I had to repeat the order. ..I had to call back to add another item....the phone was answered by a woman...I was placed on hold for 6 minutes....a man picked up again....placed me on hold again for 4 minutes....a woman picked up and said are you waiting for Bobby....I answer I just want to add to my previous order I do not know the persons name ....she placed me on hold for another 6 minutes....a man picks you....not the same voice/man I initially gave my order...I explained to him ....I was transfer to many people just to add to my order....he said to someone in the background laughing....she said she has been transferred many times....I told him not the call transferred but Put on hold and various people picking up...I asked him if he was the owner ....he reply no...he was over talking me ...just kept repeating what do you want to add...I told him he was unprofessional ....I am the customer....I told him to stick the previous order up him a**....and hung up.... That is my experience with Arlington Diner....
