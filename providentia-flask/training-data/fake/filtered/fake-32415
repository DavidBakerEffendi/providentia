Second time in a short period of time where I have negative things to say. This last visit was the weekend after Valentine's Day. - Service was very slow: to take our order and to deliver it. Our waiter was nowhere to be found when needed. - They raised the prices of drinks/food again - this time just for Valentine's Day weekend. How do I know? They left the previous menu (with prices) underneath the new menu. I noticed when the top page fell off to reveal the changes. - My steak was overcooked and small. My wife's steak was fatty. The manager said that happens some times but made no attempt to correct it. At this point: dissatisfied with tired service, over-price meals, and poor food preparation.
