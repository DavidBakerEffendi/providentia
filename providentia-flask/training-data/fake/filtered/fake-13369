Consistently good food, Shanghai Bun has never dissapointed of the times my family and I have gone. Would recommend one "pork soup bun" appetizer to start (comes in 6 so adjust to group size) but you can't go wrong with anything on their menu! The Guava drink is refreshingly sweet and the menu is full of well priced items for lunch and dinner combos!
