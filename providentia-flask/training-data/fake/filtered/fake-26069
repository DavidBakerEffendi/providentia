It's actually funny how terrible this establishment is.  I have been there a few times, and each time it takes about 15 minutes to get the attention of your waiter/waitress, 20 minutes more for them to take your order, and they also hold the world record for longest time taken to make a sandwich (20 minutes).  The last time I was there will be the last.   Waitress was RUDE, they had three mistakes on two sandwiches (one was omitting a side order).  When I brought this up the waitress sneered, grabbed the bill and gruffed out "I'll take some off" and marched away in a hurry.  The check was just dropped at our table without a word.  At no point during my dining experience was an apology offered or sympathetic disposition displayed.  Not worth going for the average food & menu.
