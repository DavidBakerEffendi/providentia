I wasn't much into sushi until a friend of mine recommended we visit Sushi Palace. Just the very IDEA of raw fish and seaweed made me want to gag, but I have to say that Sushi Palace broke me in gently. I've been happily hooked on Sushi and Sushi Palace ever since. The service is fast (though not the most joyous people), it's only $20 for whatever you can eat, and it's BYOB. The whole place is a lot of fun with a group of friends, and I'd recommend it highly. The only thing is that there might be some serious wait time, considering the place isn't very large. Â The wait is well worth it though, and you will leave bloated and HAPPY. Make sure you eat everything though, because you WILL get charged.
