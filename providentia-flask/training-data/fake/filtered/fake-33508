Very excited to have Hamilton's in the hood.  It's a bit of a wasteland, foodwise in this area and we usually make the 20 minute walk to The Farm for awesome food, so it's great to have something closer.  We had an excellent dinner, starting with a tasty kale salad and then a hearty chicken pot pie for me (perfect winter meal) and a very juicy grass-fed burger for my husband (loved the seasoned baked fries that come with it!) We will definitely become regulars as long as the service stays great and the food remains tasty.  Brunch begins this weekend.  Stay tuned...
