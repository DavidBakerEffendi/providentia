I had heard about Adela's for many years and on this site.  So, last year, since I was graduating law school, my family and I decided to order our food from here.  That was mistake #1.  The second mistake we made was in actually paying for the food that was mediocre and with an incredibly rude staff.  Nevertheless, we decided to give it another try and returned today (12/17/12).  Guess what...nothing has changed.  The food was tasteless and they are still just as rude.  BTW, we are Puerto Rican's so we thought perhaps the food might be as good as abuela's.  We were wrong.  We thought if we spoke Spanish, they might be nicer.  We were wrong.  Adela -- I don't go for 3 strikes but I'm sure you don't care.
