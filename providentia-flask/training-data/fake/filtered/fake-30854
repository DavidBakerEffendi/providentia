My wife and I went last night - opening night at this new, cozy restaurant.  We loved it!  We live up the block and welcome Giovanni's as a very nice addition to our neighborhood.  They were hopping and busy on their opening night and we expect them to continue to thrive. The hosts and servers were friendly and attentive.  The dining room is small but it's comfortable and looks very nice.  The large windows looking out onto 8th Avenue create a nice atmosphere. The food was perfectly done.  We each enjoyed our salads and our entrees were spectacular.  I had the branzino filet special which was served with broccoli and would have liked it if the dish included a small dollop of rice or a potato...something.  The plate was just a little bare.  My wife had the shrimp risotto and was disappointed that the dish only included 4 shrimps.  We had zero complaints about the preparation or taste.  Everything was delicious.  We just wish they'd have offered a little more. It was opening night so some other constructive criticisms would be for them to install something to keep the cold blast of air from rushing in each time the door opens.  It's a small dining room so there are diners sitting very close to the entrance.  They need a heavy curtain and one of those external installations that many restaurants use to fix this problem.   We'll definitely be going back (frequently) and encourage everyone to try Giovanni's.  With a few tweaks this little gem of a restaurant could easily change my 4 star rating to a 5.
