I was here last week after a movie and was totally blown away by the fact that after not having been here for 14 yrs, it is just as wonderful as it has always been. The hummus, babaganou, thaniai lamb, were all fantastic!! Service was great !! Portions were perfect!! Everything was flavorful and yummy!!
