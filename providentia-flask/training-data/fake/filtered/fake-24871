I'm Venezuelan and was told by a friend about this place . Thinking I could find a little bit of relief from my home sickness i went... boy was I wrong. The ropa vieja was HORRIBLE tough tough tough and no seasoning watsoever. The arepas were cold and very disappointing. the waitress was nasty and when we complained to the owner he looked at us like we were stupid.. overall a horrible experience if you can avoid this place at all costs soooo not worth it
