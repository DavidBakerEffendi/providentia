What can I add to all the superb reviews. Loved the Dosas, Loved the Samosa's, 8 stars for the Vadai,and mouth watering Mango lassi. Sambhar for a $1 is a steal. YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS to my new fave, not good at writing but had to do it for splendidly sumptuous meal. Superb prices. Thank you Raveee, the manager for your superb service and my pain in the ass questions.
