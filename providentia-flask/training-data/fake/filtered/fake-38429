Low salt, no MSG,...also no flavor.  I ordered chicken & string bean in a brown sauce.  The chicken had no flavor, like it was steamed with no salt or seasoning of any kind.  The string beans also, tasted like they were steamed, then mixed with chicken and brown sauce just before serving.  Very disappointing.   I would never go back.
