Went there for lunch, very nice decor, great service. Amuse-bouche of salmon mousse is a bit fishy. Tuna with foie gras is simply delicious. Black bass is perfectly grilled. Lobster was ok, and I am not a big fan of monk fish, tastes like meat. Maybe it was lunch, the dessert choices are limited and not that impressive as Michelin 3 stars restaurant.
