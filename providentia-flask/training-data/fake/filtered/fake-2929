Tables are packed really close to each other, not for the claustrophobic. Waited over 20 minutes before the waiter even came to the table for drinks. When he did show up he spilled water on me when handing out our drinks. People are literally bumping into you when moving out of their chairs. Most importantly the food was alright, nothing special. Nice place to have apps and drinks with friends, especially when you are seated outdoors.
