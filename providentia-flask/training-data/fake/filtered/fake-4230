Sort of hard to believe there are anything but stellar reviews here.  I have never posted on Yelp before but I felt compelled for this place.  All I can say is I've paid way more for way less quality than here.  Fish is choice and extremely fresh.  Easily best sushi in town.  It is a classy place and feels like NY--the owner/chef is the real deal and the place stands in stark contrast to faux metro restuarants in Burlington
