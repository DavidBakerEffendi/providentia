This restaurant is a gem! We found this place on a walk by and just happened to notice the people inside and decided to try it out, glad We did! The food was excellent and the price was reasonable...WINNER! We had the Snapper and Duck, both were very tasty and a nice portion. Â The service was quick, friendly and unintrusive, so we got to enjoy the atmosphere. Nice date place, or if your just looking for a relaxed scene.
