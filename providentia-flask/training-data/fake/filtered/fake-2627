I had dinner here with two of my girlfriends on Sunday night. Cute ambiance, good decor, good menu variety. The service was fine, but did not go above and beyond. I found the food to be a bit flavorless- including the pizza & riceballs. While I didn't think this place was overprices for tapas, the $12 cheese place included a small glob of gorgonzola and about 4 slices of some other cheese along with about 6 blueberries and some nuts. It was not a cheese plate. It was a fruit and nut plate with some cheese. $12? This is not Nolita. This is Astoria. Let's get to my favorite part: The end... ...where the waiter told us it was cash only. AT THE END OF THE MEAL. The waiter apologized that he forgot to tell us prior to the beginning of the meal, but I asked to see a manager. I've worked in restaurants my whole life- and I've never experienced such rude behavior from a manager, let alone, the OWNER. We were confused as to why we were never told it was cash only and he proceeded to point to a sign, in the front of the restaurant, about 15 feet in the air (see the picture of the small smudged chalkboard). My friend told him we didn't see it, I'm pretty sure no one in the restaurant did because two tables next to us heard our conversation and were disappointed to find out that it was cash only. The owner told us that their computer had been broken for weeks (odd, considering this place JUST opened like 2 weeks ago) and that was that. I've experienced this before with "cash-only" places like this and they usually don't get it fixed so they can avoid paying taxes and make more money by not reporting all their sales since they're only accepting cash. After telling is it was broken, the owner facetiously apologized, told us we'd get a discount, told us there was an ATM around the corner and then DISMISSED US before abruptly walking away. I was appalled, as were my friends and the other customers around us. We never even got the discount. I will definitely NOT be back.
