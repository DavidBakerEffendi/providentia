Eight of our book club members came here for dinner two weeks ago after being snowed out of our original luncheon reservation due to the December blizzard.  We were the only group seated in the side room, giving us a wonderful environment for gift sharing and loud conversation.  We were provided with our favorite seating arrangement - the round table.  The prix fixe menu was extensive for entrees.  Everyone was satisfied and able to find something they liked.  In addition, the kitchen accepted some modifications to the menu as well.  They were so accommodating, what a pleasure.   The waitresses were very nice, informative and tolerant of our ever-changing minds.  We all ate off the prix fixe, had drinks, appetizers, salad, wine (included) dessert and a beverage.  I ordered the stuffed tilapia which was mostly crabmeat, not overwrought with bread and very tasty.  The clam appetizer was just OK - I've had better, but I admittedly ate it all and dunked bread in the nice sauce.   No one held back on ordering, and yet our bill was very reasonable.  The food was quite good - no complaints, which is very unusual for our group.  It was a perfect spot for this type of gathering.  We would definitely return, especially for the rice pudding.  Nice ending!
