The meal was fine--nothing special AT ALL. So you can imagine my disappointment when this restaurant--one of the "hot places" in New York right now--overcharged me by $30 (after I signed my receipt for the correct amount). $30 is basically just enough to make it annoying. I have since called THREE times to be told each time that it was the restaurant's "rush" hour, but I would receive a return phone call first thing the next day. I have still not received a return call. I think this behavior--basically credit card fraud--is extremely unprofessional for a restaurant of this caliber. Also, the "sundae" that I heard raves about is something I could make myself. Are you kidding me, New York? Your city is FULL of vibrant, exciting places to eat. This is not one of them.
