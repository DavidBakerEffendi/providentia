As a Wazu customer for over 20 years, I can say that this is the best place around. The sandwiches are great, the staff is friendly, and overall just a great place to visit. I've initiated my kids as second generation Wazu fans, and we make it a family ritual to enjoy the best subs together. Thanks for treating customers right for the past decades Joe!
