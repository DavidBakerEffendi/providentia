Best food cart at Penn hands down. I'm so so sad it shifted away from Sansom, earlier I could just call them up, place my order, and collect it on the way back home. The torta here is to die for, as is all the other food! It's also a hugeee portion. Only downers - 1) it's more expensive the avg food truck (5-8$ approx per item) - but the portions are pretty big too 2) The wait is super long because it's so popular 3) And now it's shifted to Arch
