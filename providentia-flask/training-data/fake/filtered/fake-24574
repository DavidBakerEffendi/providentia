The pizza was pretty good but not sure if I would walk over the Brooklyn Bridge, stand in line for 30-40 minutes in the bright sun and get a dropping of bird poop on me for it again.  Nevertheless, glad we took the time to check Grimaldi's out after reading about it so much.  It's a good "day trip" for Manhattanites that are stuck in the city for the weekend.
