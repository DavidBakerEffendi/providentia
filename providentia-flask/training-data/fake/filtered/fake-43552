Second time at Han Dynasty - first at new location - I will be going to back - we had a party of eight - we were seated in the private dining area - which was great - Since being with such a large group we decided to do the tasting (25.00) and it was well worth it - the food continuously came out- it was impeccable - if you like spice - this is the place to be - the staff is personable and the host did everything to accommodate us
