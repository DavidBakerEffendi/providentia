PIZZA, PIZZA, PIZZA!!!  I havent seen Kathy in about 7 years and today we finally had a chance to see each other. I don't go to NYC much, so the lunch spot was Kathy's choice. She took me to Lombardi's. I am still trying to decide if I was happier about spending time with Kathy or that delicious Pizza. I must say that from now on I will be taking trips to the City just to eat their pizza.  The place is great!!!
