A definite got to spot in the neighborhood and city as a whole.  All of the dishes are specail - the ceviche, salmon tartare, oysters and shrimp special, in particular.  However, the Fettucine with clams is the game changer!!  And the whisky pound cake finishes off the whole process.   Great people, great bar tenders, great proprietor...  All around great place in the midst of the best food neighborhood in the city.   Great happy hour too.   Awesome for a date, for a group of 4, family, whatever....overall top 5 spot in the city for this gent...
