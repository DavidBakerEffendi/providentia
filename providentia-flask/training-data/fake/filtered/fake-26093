This is my favorite Indian restaurant ever.  I have tried many Indian restaurants within thirty minutes from my house and Satish is the best, and lucky for me, the closest. I've gone there about five times in the last two weeks alone! (I can't stop craving it!) I've tried a few of their appetizers (the veggie samosas are my fave!), all are delicious. And I don't eat goat or lamb, just chicken, so the chicken is all I can speak for. I've tried practically all their chicken specialties and all I can say is "wow."  Currently, the meal I can't quit is their "murg madras," and I order it in mild for when I'm not wanting anything spicy. I can't praise this place enough and I will miss it desperately when I move in a couple weeks.
