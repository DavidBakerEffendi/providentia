I read reviews about Miya's Sushi before I went there with my schoolmates. I was not sure why some people gave it one star rating, but I thought as long as they serves sushi, it was not going to be too bad. I was wrong. Everyone complaint about food severed there, it tasted really awful and might be too creative to be called as "sushi". I was expecting something normal rather than potato with eggplant.
