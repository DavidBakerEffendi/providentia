Good burger!   Not great.  But good. This place is like the Big Mac of burger places!  Some might even say they're the burger King!  I got one Whopper of a burger with truffle fries and a Coke.  My Extra Value Meal came to about ten bucks...who do they think I am?  Mayor McCheese?  So it was a little high-priced and I didn't want to be a hamburglar so I forked over the money had it my way!   I like to rate any dining, shopping or salon visit as an experience but first I think it's important to have an expectation that's realistic.  Me expectation was that I was going to have a good burger in a cool new joint.  Mission accomplished.  I didn't go in expecting that Bobby Flay was going to cook me the best burger I've ever eaten for $10.  Hell no.  So if that's what you're expecting, move on.   I read some of the reviews on Yelp and I just LOL at the dork who said she doesn't know "what they put on those truffle fries but it made her lose her appetite for the rest of the day!"  It's TRUFFLE OIL, you DORK!  And truffles cost about $700 a pound so they're supposed to taste awful and you're supposed to love them just cause they're so expensive!  Sheesh! The joint was jumpin' so I sat down with a local office lunch party group and Miss Saigon was none too happy with me for sitting at the family style table with her and her chumley's but I asked her to pass the ketchup anyway.  Only two tables inside and a bar along the wall with stools.  The place is small but effective.  Lined out the building at lunch hour so don't plan a quick in-and-out and don't expect to be able to sit inside.     Still think Good Dog does it best in Center City...and 500 is a little bit too expensive for my pre-executive budget.
