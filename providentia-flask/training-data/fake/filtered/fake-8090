I love Mint Thai Cuisine! They are great for their special food and recipes. The food is always delicious, the takeout service extremely efficient and they usually beat the delivery time they quote. Favorites include the Little Buttercups, the Green Curry and their meat dish with peanut sauce over cabbage. Honestly, I haven't had anything I didn't like here. Their pricing is also quite reasonable for the quality. Unlike Black-wood Thai who is a total rip off! I am moving out of the city next month and I will seriously miss my weekly dose of Mint Thai Cuisine.
