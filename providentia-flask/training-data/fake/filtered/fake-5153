This is a well-reviewed restaurant, so my expectations were fairly high when I went there. I was extremely disappointed. The food was ... meh. The service was ... meh. The bill was ... really? Expensive and underwhelming. I assumed I caught them on a bad night, so I went again. Nope - same thing. Not even a simple dish like linguine with marinara was worth eating. :-(
