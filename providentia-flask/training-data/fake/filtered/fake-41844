Went to Trattoria Trecolori before seeing Phantom. Similar to others, we were seated promptly and a waiter came by almost immediately for our drink order. There is not much of a selection in terms of appetizers (if you like to split an appetizer like we do, there are really only two options), but we both enjoyed our entrees. My husband had the veal sorrentino which he said was excellent, and I had the ravioli of the day which happened to be ravioli stuffed with crabmeat and spinach, all topped with a creamy cognac sauce. Not sure if the pasta was homemade, but it was very good. For dessert, we ordered the tiramisu which sounded promising, given its appealing name of being homemade. Frankly, however, we both have had much better tiramisu at other italian restaurants in the city and if I come back to Trecolori, I would not bother ordering it again. !!!! On a side note, the parking garage directly across from Trattoria Trecolori was TERRIBLE. Not only did they take forever getting our car when we were ready to leave, but they also oh-so-conveniently rifled through our middle console and pinched the forty bucks we had there. Yes, I totally forgot the money was there and had I remembered, would not have left it, but it left quite a sour note at the end of the evening to know that someone working at that icon parking garage could be so grubby. I would never park there again!!
