Positives: Nice atmosphere.  Friendly staff.  Decent Food Negatives: SLLLLLOOOOOOOWWWWWW Truthfully, if they ran more efficiently & better, this wouldn't be a bad Friday night place to go.  We ordered 5 Tapa's & 2 salads - we were there for 2-HOURS & 15-MINUTES!!!!   We saw two tables get up & leave, and several folks complaining.  This is tough to sit through for anyone, but my 6-year old was going stir crazy. I hope they can get their service issue fixed soon, or they're going to be out of business in a hurry!
