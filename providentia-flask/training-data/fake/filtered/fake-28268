I've been coming to this place for years, but lately the hostess has been so rude. I have to say that the hostess needs a vacation or something. She is so rude and obviously seats her friends before the rest of us. She rolls her eyes and slams menus down on the tables like shes mad or something. She is over worked i mean she's basically there everyday. I love this place but great food doesn't merit bad service or a rude hostess.
