The incompetent waitress caused about $200 worth of inaccurate charges (multiple charges happened to all six other people in my group) on my card, with basically the only solution being to wait a week.  The waitress was inattentive and clearly overwhelmed.  This is the only restaurant I've been to where the manager is the only one who can split a bill (even when at the start you ask for separate checks), and it takes him/her about 30 minutes-- according to the waitress. The atmosphere was... interesting, but not really my scene.  Prices weren't a steal.  If this was a rating solely for the quality of food, Varalli would get 4 stars.  But it's not and I won't be going back.
