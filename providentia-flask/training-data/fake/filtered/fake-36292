I don't care what people say I am the karaoke king and proud of it!  The place was really nice and the food was good.  However, the place was packed to the max when we got there so a couple of us had to stand up.  Eventually I started to get irritated because of it, UNTIL we went upstairs and rented one of their Karaoke rooms, for a cheap 15 dollars an hour!  We stayed for like 2 hours drinking and bringing out our inner rockstars.  I had so much fun and just had to go back again the next night!
