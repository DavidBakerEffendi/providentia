THIS REVIEW IS FOR TAKEOUT/DELIVERY SERVICE ONLY:  Me and my wife LOVE Song.  The food is amazing.  But dont try to order over the phone.  EVERY time you call, they "can't hear you".  It gets to the point where you're literally yelling into the phone, yet they still "can't hear you".  It's actually pretty ridiculous.  And what's even worse, Song doesn't participate in Seamless Web/GrubHub or any online ordering site, so you HAVE to call.  Whether it's 4pm or 11pm at night, they can never hear you and you have to repeat yourself a dozen times.  I just tried to place an order now and it got to the point where they hung up on me.  And it's NOT our phones, this happens with multiple phones, different people. NOTE TO SONG:  Get new phones.  Or get people that can fucking use their ears.  Thanks.
