My family and I have been to Shogun, Sushi Palace, Sen's and Kanoko before it closed. We tried Sushi King and have gone back at least 6 more times since it opened. We found the food to be fresh and the staff very welcoming. The food is prepared quickly and the atmosphere is relaxing. The prices are right even for the all you can eat menu. If you are looking for good sushi at a good price I would highly recommend. We had no issue with the way the food was prepared. We were more concerned with taste and given the fact we have been back a number of times since then should say something about the foods overall quality. Sushi King is on par with Sushi Palace and more convenient to get to for us.
