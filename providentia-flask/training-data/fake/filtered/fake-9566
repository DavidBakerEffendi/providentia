I don't know what the hoopla is about this place. Maybe because it's a Monday and they borrowed a chef from the local elementary school? Who serves coffee in metal cups? Nothing like a metal taste with your cup of Joe, unless of course that is the taste of the coffee...blah. Guest #1: The Glory cakes had no flavor. I doused them in their "real" maple syrup thinking this would help- ah, no...is that stuff dietetic? It had the worst flavor and after-taste. I did not finish these cakes because they weren't worth the extra calories. The Orange juice was good but warm. Guest #2: The ham-steak - We took it home so we could re-soul an old pair of shoes. You think you could make it any tougher/dry? The potatoes might have been good had the chef not dumped the entire container of rosemary on them. The scrambled eggs dry and flavorless and last but not least...the biscuit, although huge and crumbly was dry and flavorless not even worth the attempt to eat because no amount butter or metal -flavored-coffee could get this thing down. People wait in line for this place? - We were wondering why their last award on their wall was from 2010. On the way out we noticed another customer who had bacon that was completely black...I hope they ordered it like that because it looked pathetic. This place gets a one star, only because our waiter was efficient and nice. Ew is my final comment - don't bother. Maybe the weekends are better but I am not standing in line or wasting another $23 to find out.
