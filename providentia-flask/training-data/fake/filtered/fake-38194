Ok so I have been to The Greek Lady a number of times and I usually take the easy way out and get chicken Caesar on pita bread. Today I felt brave enough to finally try their Gyro. I got a chicken one as I'm not yet brave enough to try their signature lamb gyro. The chicken gyro was awesome who would have thought french fries wrapped in a sandwich would be so great!! On top of that the tzastki sauce brings the while gyro together. I got the chicken gyro platter which comes with two sides I chose mashed potatoes and steamed brocolli which were good as well. I would say the only downside is it can get really crowded and your waiting in line for 15 mins before you even place your order but I gave it 4 stars because the workers in there aren't very friendly and customer service is a deal breaker for me.
