Yup, this could be a hidden gem tucked into a little nest somewhere in hell...just be glad there is security camera's on the parking lot...another bonus is the obvious patronizing of local cops for lunch..which makes me and my car feel a bit warm inside. This pizza is one of the top five of all time for me..In my fifty years of existance I have traveled all over this world. and sampled endless tomato pies.Not as good as Naples "La Fortuna restaurant" but pretty good for this lifelong New Jerseyite. Only Lido in Hackensack was better for thin crust. Oh how I misss Bergen county. I would recomend the portabello mushroom garlic,,,awesome*** plus the sicilian which is really a "formagia parmagiana" pie not quite a true sicilian which is risen all day in a proofing oven, but this one holds water enough to piss with the big boy's If you havent tried this pizza yet, please do, If you have, you don't need me to blow smoke up your ass, you allready know this place is the real deal...also If you try the clam pizza try topping it with a little balsalmic. the acid cuts the briney taste and brings out the sweetness of the clams...Happy munching!!
