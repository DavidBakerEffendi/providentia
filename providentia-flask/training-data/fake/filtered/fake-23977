Such a disappointing experience at Le Virtu tonight.  Our delicious meal was spoiled when we were asked to leave our table shortly after our dessert was cleared.  I am very aware of "lingering" when others are waiting for tables and that is not what happened here.  This was just embarrassingly bad service at what I had previously thought was a very good restaurant.   My party of three arrived on time for our 6:30 reservation.  We ordered and ate three appetizers, three entrees, and two desserts.  We shared two bottles of wine.  Eating a meal that large takes time.  Eating a meal that large is also expensive, and at least part of what we were paying for was space at a (two person, actually) table.  Our waiter asked us to leave less than ten minutes after our dessert was cleared-- I literally put down my fork, went to the restroom for a tissue, and when I got back to the table he was there saying, "I hate to be a jerk, but I need this table.  You can finish your drink at the bar if you want."  We had been there 2 hours and 15 minutes, which I don't think is an inappropriate amount of time for a meal with three courses made to order.  This was Le Virtu, not Olive Garden.  Quality meals take time.   We complained to the manager (owner? not sure) as we left.  Rather than apologizing, she told us, "There was someone with a reservation waiting at the bar for almost a half an hour and this has happened to them before!"  Regardless of how the food tasted-- which at this point seems totally irrelevant to me-- the whole experience left me with a bad taste it my mouth.  Le Virtu has long been a neighborhood favorite of mine; I've recommended it many times to friends and neighbors.  Unfortunately, I don't know that I'd feel comfortable going back now.
