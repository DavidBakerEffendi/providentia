Love this place. Went here for my birthday dinner with a few friends. Went in around 7 oclock on a wednesday and at first thought it was closed because no one was in there. However, the owner walked out of the kitchen a immediately seated us. It has a very cozy atmosphere with pleasant latin music in the background. It was my first Venezuelan cuisine experience and i fell in love with it. The grilled tiger shrimp as an appetizer was delicious as well as the simple but flavorful cheese sticks. For dinner I had a empanada and it was tasty and filling. The red stripe and sangria we brought complimented the meal very well. The service was excellent and very friendly. Highly recommended as I plan on making it a regular lunch and dinner stop. The intimate atmosphere would be great for a date or small gathering.
