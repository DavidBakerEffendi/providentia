My  survey of ordering veal parmesan at numerous local restaurants results in  declaring Mamma Rosa having the best veal parm  dinner in Mercer County .The very large portion of  tender veal and generous amount of delicious sauce ,plus your choice of pasta on the side and a salad makes for an unbelievable meal at a great price . Definitely the BEST ! Bring your own wine and have a meal fit for a king
