I tried the grilled cheese with bacon and a cup of tomato soup. It was the perfect meal -- the sandwich was delicious and had a just-right amount of cheese and the soup was a tomato wow. My favorite childhood meal has grown up to be a stunner. Isn't grilled cheese one of the food groups? Can't wait to go back!
