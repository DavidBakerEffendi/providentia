The best Tacos I ever ate in CT... Really people. I'm Mexican and I have really high expectations, even if is for TACOS ON THE STREET ... They are so good that you will ask for more... I been in a couple of "OK" restaurants in CT that have or say that have mexican tacos.... but these ones have the real Mexican Flavor and for just $1.25 each one ... also try the Quesadilla con Carne
