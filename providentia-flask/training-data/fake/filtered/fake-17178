Food. --  Good Quality 5 star (except Pav( bread)  hard than rock in Pav Bhaji dish)                But, some time not FRESH we noticed. Drink --  Bought Kesar faluda for Take Away and it was worst faluda I ever had in my               Life. Customer service ---   worst . Specially during the weekend. Employees and                                     Management both are not good eye detail or lazy.They                                     Don't like to serve customers and keep them waiting                                     Out side and inside. Suggestion for Owner. --   They can Improve their customer service.If they really like                                           To make customer happy.
