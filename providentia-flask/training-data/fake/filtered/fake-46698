One of my favorite restaurants in this neighborhood. Try to sit outside or downstairs, much better ambiance than the upstairs dining room, which is a little too plain. Best to share a variety of dishes. My favorites: Iskander Kabob (love how the layer of bread on the bottom of this dish soaks up all the sauce) and the vegetarian platter (especially the spicy vegetables). Greek salad is also pretty decent -- the stuffed grape leaves that come with it are fantastic. If I'm dining with one other person, I'll order two of my three favorites. If there are three of us, I'll order all three and it's the perfect amount of food! I'd give it five stars but occasionally the service can be a little slow/aloof.
