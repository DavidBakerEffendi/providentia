My wife and I love love this place.  The service is great and the food is better.  I recommend trying everything on the menu at least once.  My favorite is the chicken rollatini.  The owner is always available and is usually seen walking around talking to the customers.  The espresso for dessert is make perfect each time.  The bar area is small but the bartenders make you feel right at home.  They recently updated the venue and it looks great.
