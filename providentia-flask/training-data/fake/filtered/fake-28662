Iskender Kabab was great in my last visit. I am from Turkey and it is hard to find the original taste of any food outside of Turkey. Istanbul Restaurant is little different in this category. Iskender Kabab was as delicious as the ones you would taste in Turkey. Lahmacun is my other favorite when i eat here. Highly receommended.
