Come on guys: it's 2010. Â No reason not to accept multiple credit cards. I'm a big fan, and have eaten at the Chelsea location at least ten times since it opened. BUT explain to me one thing: how can any restaurant, let alone one in New York, justify a "policy" of not taking more than two credit cards? Newsflash: it took significantly longer for our server to count cash, do the math, and then split the bill among two cards than it would have taken her to swipe five cards and split the check evenly. I find it ridiculous that a neighborhood restaurant can't take 30 seconds to split a $200 tab five ways for the convenience of its customers. It's good, but not that good...
