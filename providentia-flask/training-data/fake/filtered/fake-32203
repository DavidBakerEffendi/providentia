Cooper's sandwiches speak for themselves...The guy Warren @ the bottom says the food is "inedible"  Forget about it. He meant to say "Incredible"  Anytime theres a forum for people to exchange info...even if 99% of the people participating are on the same page, there's always one who has to stand out just because its a different opinion.  If you're ever in Newark...on either Orange St.  or South Orange Ave and Grove Streets...Stop in for the Pastrami and Mustard on Rye...They also make a mean Brisket and Gravy....
