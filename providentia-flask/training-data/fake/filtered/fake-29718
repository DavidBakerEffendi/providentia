I was not prepared to be as impressed as I was. We went for dinner for Mother's Day along with our son and his girlfriend who were visiting from NY.  The atmosphere, service quality and food are among the best in the city. I know many reviewers felt that the portions are too small, but it may be because the portions at too many Philly restaurants are too big. Also, the quality of the food-- sourced from sustainable farms-- does not come cheap.  The portions are the size one usually finds at the best restaurants in NY, SF, and other culinary centers.  This is a great addition to the Philly restaurant scene.
