Been going to Lupa for years and it never disappoints. As reviewer Eric Asimov suggests in the Times, stick to the pastas. They are not only wonderful, they teach you something important about simplicity in cooking. Portions are not huge, but on the good side, pasta prices can be as low as $14 so you round out your dinner with superb appetizers. Gnocchi is astonishingly good here, so order that if you can't choose. One complaint, they recently changed the incredible pecorino/escarole salad. I hope they change it back.
