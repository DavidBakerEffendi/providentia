I just read a couple disparaging reviews about this place that I was surprised at. I think that it is a great place, and I always recommend it to people visiting from out of town. It has such a nice atmosphere. I love it. It's very nice. I think the problem is that some people are looking for what they know and this is different. Colleen C. thinks it is going to be super cheap or something. It's Manhattan New York. In consideration of that, I think the prices are ok. This other dame Jenn T. is complaining about rudeness, but she doesn't really say what was so rude. She doesn't know what those tables were for. I think that she is right in thinking that her problem was more specific to her, which makes me just like the place more! hahahahaha I really like Cafe Sabarsky, because it is not a pig out slobby American Applebees kind of place. I think that was what Jenn and Colleen C. was looking for, but Colleen probably wanted a Pizzaria UNO, which I also love, but she could brake out the coups.
