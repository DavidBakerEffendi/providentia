I attended a family party at Il Castello's. The experience was fantastic. The appetizers were served family style and the courses seemed to be never-ending. The ambiance of the restaurant was nice. Typical Italian decour, but not over-done. The food and service were both on-point. I especially enjoyed the mussels and eggplany rollantini. I was so impressed with the party that I decided to return to Castello's, but this time as a dinner patron. My experience was even more enjoyable than the previous. Firstly, the restaurant is easy to access from many main highways and parking is abundant -- convenient in every way. Secondly, the food and service were on-point again. Meals were served quickly, and our waiter was friendly and well-spoken. The bar selection was somewhat disappointing; however, the wine list was impressive. Moreover, my server had an extensive knowledge of the wine list. Overall, a great place to dine. I will return again shortly.
