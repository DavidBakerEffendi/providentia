Can't really recommend it, though I would've liked to. The decor is cute and the food is not too pricey, and the accents seem authentic. Unfortunately, I ordered a tuna sandwich -- perfectly serviceable, but the bread was a bit soggy and the service was minimal at best. My partner ordered a coffee that never arrived. Not a good thing to do for a caffeine addict! (Thankfully she didn't tear off my arms and bludgeon the waitstaff with them). She liked her baked egg Cocotte and I enjoyed the frites, but I shan't be standing in line to get in to this fine establishment (though a line was forming as we left) . What is it with New Yorkers and lines?
