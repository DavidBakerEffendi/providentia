Best Restaurant in Montclair, NJ.... Last night my wife and I had the best dinner of our lives. The service was great and the food was even better. Tatiana and Jeffrey took good care of us. The restaurant atmosphere is very friendly and relaxing. Â I love this place for some many reasons (food, ambiance, music..etc), but the most noticeable one is that they take the time to get to know you. Now lets talk about the food... Everything in the menu is out of this world. I highly recommend everything in the menu, specially the Ceviche... Thank you Costanera for making an unforgettable night (New Year's eve - btw) ... WE LOVE YOU! Ps: Last night one of their customers got stuck in the snow, few of the Costanera crew went outside to help the customer. I tell you... this place, they out of their way to help you!!!!
