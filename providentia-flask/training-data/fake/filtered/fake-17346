This is the best sushi I have had in Central NJ.  Everything is very fresh and presented very well.  Even the salad with ginger dressing is amazing.  Highly recommended: the Volcano Roll and the Black Ninja Roll and the steamed shumai.  They are also very open to suggestions - they even added ginger ice cream.  Biggest problem: they are hidden away off the beaten path in the middle of a residential area off Cozzens Lane.
