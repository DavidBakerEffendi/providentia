The quality is getting worse. The management is getting greedy.   What is bothersome is that, yesterday we got some samosa chats. We found a green full rubber band, the ones that hold corriander leaves.  We could not differentiate that and it looked like just corriander. They are NOT paying attention to quality. Krishnan
