I picked up an order of Rice ball, pizza pie and lentil soup.  The soup was watery and very salty just like it came out of can. I have eating there many times and take several time, this was the first that I had problem.  I asked to get credit for the soup the next time and she said that we do not do that and that I had to go back and get another soup. She just brushed me off the phone and hung up.
