Lovely little wine bar. A hidden oasis in midtown east. Turn the corner and you're actually in a cool, little wine bar not at a homogenized wine bar chain (oops did I say vero wine bar, oh, guess I just did!). They have a wonderful selection of wines, some interesting beers, and tasty italian appetizers and pizzas. I highly recommend this wine bar to anyone in the area as a welcome contrast to the vast majority of generic 2nd Ave haunts. It even has the loveliest bathroom...they take so much pride in the entire place and every detail exemplifies it.
