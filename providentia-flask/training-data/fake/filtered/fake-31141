Wafa's is soooooooo overrated. The falafel has no flavor. Spiniach pie the same. Have no clue why this place got a good review in the NY Times. It's a big nothing. The restaurant is decor and charm free. Takeout is yuck. Only in FH do meh restaurants get rave reviews. We had lamb and it tasted like mystery meat. Then we ordered take out to give it another chance and it was all bland, nothing special. Who are all these people going yum? Are their tastebuds working? Or is it that they live in FH and are used to lousy food? Have they ever eaten GOOD MIddle Eastern food? This isn't it. No more take out, no more eat in. Wafa's, b'bye.
