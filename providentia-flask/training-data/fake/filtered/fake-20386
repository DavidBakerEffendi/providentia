We booked the restaurant for our daughter's first BDay. We reached the place before time and everything was ready. The staff was friendly and catered to all our needs. All the guests were looked after well with drinks being served constantly. Decor and arrangements had a clean and a modern look. And above all, the food was awesome! Everyone had a great time.
