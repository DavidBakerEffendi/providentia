wedding's are fun... but when you find out that you'll have to travel to connecticut for one, you only think one thing... let's drive and hit all the pizza spots on the way!   Pepe's is simply amazing.  I've had pizza from coast to coast and Pepe's is certainly a spot to hit on the map when you can... always make it a point to get here when I'm up in the northeast.  I must say though, stick to the specialty pies that  they;re known for when you stop by.
