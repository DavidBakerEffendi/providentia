Great food, not a fancy place but the food is authentic and the staff is friendly.  Can't beat the quality of the food for the price.  Comparing this place to Braza, I say thanks but no thanks, brazil grill is much superior when it comes to how Brazilian meat is prepared. Nothing like real "churrasco" (google it if you are not familiar) cooked over real natural hardwood charcoal (sorry Braza, but I will pass on the gas grill cooked dry meat).
