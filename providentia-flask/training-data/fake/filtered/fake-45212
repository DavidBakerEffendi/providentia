Had lunch here on 1/19/14 and thoroughly enjoyed it! I loved the decor but it's the food that will keep you coming back.  The empanadas were the best I've ever had -- I highly recommend them! We also had the ham croquettes, cubano de Pavo sandwich, and el capitan sandwich and all were delicious and substantial.  The pineapple upside down cake was wonderful.  The wait staff were so pleasant and accommodating -- I would highly recommend this place. Just don't leave without ordering the deliciously cheesy empanadas -- you will love them!!
