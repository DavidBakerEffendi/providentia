Easiest review ever. The ambiance, service, food, smells, sights, other patrons.... this restaurant is truly transforming. There is simply nothing like it anywhere. My husband and I celebrated our 29th Anniversary at Bouley. Our former favorite was a very special french bistro on the coast in Mendocino. The bar was set very high. The wall of apples, tasting menu, velvet frames, cheese plate, Riesling...Bouley cleared it with no effort at all. Thank you Bouley - now we have a new favorite.
