Have just returned from the Argyle feeling very disappointed. I'm Scottish and grew up in Scotland regularly eating fish and chips and even working in a chippie while I was at school. A fish and chip restaurant serving frozen chips in Scotland would have been burnt down by an angry mob!! The decor was very dingy, not reflective of anywhere I have ever eaten in Scotland and overall quite dirty. The only good point was that the staff were friendly, but unfortunately that does not make a restaurant.
