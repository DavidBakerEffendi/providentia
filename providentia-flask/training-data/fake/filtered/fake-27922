This is our favorite place! Great service and exceptional food! Our party of 4 arrived Friday night at 8pm and the place had a nice crowd. Great, cozy, relaxed atmosphere and the food was spectacular as usual! We shared brushetta, calamari AND warm romaine lettuce with Gorgonzola cheese and strawberries! YES this was completely out of the ordinary and wonderfully delicious!! The 20 oz. Porterhouse with mushrooms (I tasted my boyfriend's) melted in my mouth. I ordered Parpedelle Pasta with Shrimp, asparagus, crabmeat in a Cognac cream sauce which was perfect...a pleasing combination of flavors (not heavy at all). I described it as a "little bit of heaven" as I was eating it. We finished our night with espresso & tiramisu and chocolate lava cake. Do not miss the dessert no matter how full you are! Definitely a fine dining experience every time! Â Thank you Frankie & Ernesto..you always treat us so well!!!!
