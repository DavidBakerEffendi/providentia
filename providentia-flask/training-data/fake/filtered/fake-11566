I had my daughter's sweet 16 party here and the food was AWESOME. The Cortez room was beautiful and i was extremely pleased with the set up. Steve G and Dominic made sure i was happy. Â They went as far giving her a bridal suite to change her clothes. All of our guests had a great time and raved about the food. I would highly recommend this place and looking forwarded to having events in the future.
