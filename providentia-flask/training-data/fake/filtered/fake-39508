We were driving by around dinner time so my wife, kids and I stopped in for a quick bite to eat.  First impression of the diner was that it certainly was not the cleanest of restaurants we've walked into.  Food was ok at best.  French onion soup, the worst I've ever had.  My son ate spaghetti and meatballs, he said it wasn't good at all.  My wife and I both had burgers and they were ok.  My wife said that there was no soap in the ladies room and that the toilet was stopped up.  When I went to the mens room, there was soap, but the restroom was filthy.  One of the toilets was stopped up and one of the workers was in there trying to clear it.  When we walked in, he walked out without washing his hands.  That guy was wearing an apron....the cook?  the dishwasher?  Either way, he should have washed his hands.  Needless to say, we didn't even finish our meals, no dessert, and we will never go back to this establishment.  On a positive note, the waitresses were very nice!
