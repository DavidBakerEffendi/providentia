This was my first time in Philly, and a local that I met on the flight to Philly mentioned that this is one of the best restaurants to try - and so I did. First of all, the staff is extremely professional and delivered the menu and all of the associated ingredients of every dish as if he were the chef himself. We had a party of 8 people, and ordered the tasting menu Tay'im and therefore could try just about everything on the menu (mezze and skewers). It was a palate rollercoaster ride, as each dish carried distinct flavours and textures. There was not one dish that was like another. The top dishes would have to be, but not in any particular order: 1. Laffa bread (warm, moist, and chewy) 2. Hummus Tehina and Turkish Hummus (I could eat it all night) 3. Fig Salad (very refreshing) 4. Crispy Haloumi (very nice blend of flavours with the apple and dates) 5. Fried Cauliflower (melts in your mouth, and cooled with the lebaneh) 6. Spiced Eggplant (again, melts in your mouth with the smooth tehina) I would most definitely return again to Zahav when I visit Philly again.
