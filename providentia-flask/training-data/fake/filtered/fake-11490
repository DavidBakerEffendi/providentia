Ok, my family is from the South - home of hush puppies, Brunswick stew, pulled pork, fried okra and key lime pie. Hush puppies - good taste but a bit greasy, great honey butter on the side. Brunswick stew was ok, but not the official and original recipe from Brunswick, GA - not enough corn and no lima beans.  Fried okra has a great cornmeal crust. Key lime pie was good and tart, with an awesome cinnamon whipped cream, but graham cracker crust was soggy. Chocolate Chess pie was pretty good.  Wings, mac-n-cheese, creamed spinach and mashed potatoes were great. Overall, a pretty good place for a bbq place above the Mason-Dixon line. Next time, I will try the pulled pork.  I hope it's NC bbq sauce.
