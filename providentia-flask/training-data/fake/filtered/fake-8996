Came here on a date on a Wednesday night. The ambience was really nice, not too crowded. As we were waiting to be seated, we sat around the bar while there was a musician playing, I believe it was Jazz night. Decent crowd, not too noisy at all. The champagne was good. There wasn't much too choose from on the food menu when we got seated. The Classic Cali Roll was really good, apparently they make theirs differently. Wouldn't exactly go there to eat again. But overall it was good. The location for this venue is quite weird depending on the entrance you take, we actually entered from the opposite side of the building and had to walk through Barnes & Nobles to get there.
