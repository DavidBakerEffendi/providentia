Delicious and affordable two words most people  hunting down a restaurant want to hear. From the rice rolls to the soup dumplings everything's a treat.Tthere's something there for everyone not excluding those with less adventurous  eating habits or food allergies. I would highly recommend this restaurant to those looking for an authentic Hong kong dining experience.
