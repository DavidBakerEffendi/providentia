This place has awesome food. AWESOME. It's so funny how Richard C. complains that the menu was written on a chalkboard - it's seasonal food that changes! Which is part of what makes it so good! What would be the point of printing menus if the menu is always changing. Anyway, food is great. If you see the chicken/waffles on the menu - jump on them!
