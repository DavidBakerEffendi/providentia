:( Very disappointed !!!! I wanted to give this place a shot so we did.I was just at Jersey Macs for breakfast and was the biggest rip off out there. I would not recommend going here there are too many other places out there that are GOOD yet reasonable.  I don't mind spending money I am not cheap but the price I paid for breakfast was criminal.  Also their hours are 10-2,  which are ridiculous, most people want to eat breakfast esp on the weekend before 10.
