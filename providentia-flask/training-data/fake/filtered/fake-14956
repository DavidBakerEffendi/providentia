OKay let me start from the beginning. They might have great pizza from what I heard, but I never had a chance to taste it. I placed and order for delivery. Been asked all the usual questions address, phone number etc. It was supposed to take 30-40 minutes. An hour later after I called them someone who was supposed to deliver the pie, called me and asked for the address. When got it he said its to far and they will not deliver it. So like I said, they might or might not have the best pie in town, Im not the one to judge that. What I know they have the worst delivery system in the world.
