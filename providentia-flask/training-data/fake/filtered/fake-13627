After having dinner here on New Year's I can say the service was fabulous. Â The food on the other hand... The lamb was overcooked yet the mashed potatoes were cold. Our reservations were at 7:15 and after ordering we were informed they didn't have enough lamb to serve everyone. I can only imagine coming later to find they were out completely. I would have enjoyed the 80's music a little more if my meal was prepared better. Overall it was a good experience but it could have been so much better.
