Where to begin, from the moment you enter you are TRANSPORTED!!! The attention is in the details......and everywhere else that is needed for a beautiful experience. The country vibe is very authentic......and the food is fantastic. The bread is well you must take my word for it excellent. We did the Vegetarian feast everything was so amazing I didn't miss the meat. From the appetizers to the dessert was truly an amazing FEAST!
