As Dutchies living in the States, we wanted to taste the Curry Ketchup again, off course combined with Mayonaise and Onions on Frites. Very nice fresh pommes frites and nice sauces (we also had Mayonaise combined with peanut satey). This place looks like a typical Belgian Frietkot, a small place were everybody sits with each other eating their fries. Nice discovery for us!
