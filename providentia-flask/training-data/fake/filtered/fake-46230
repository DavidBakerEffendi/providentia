I finally got a chance to see what the hype was all about.  I've heard about Carmine's from at least a handful of people who adamantly recommended this restaurant.   The wait was pretty long -- but once again, sometimes you have to wait for good food.  After about an hour of standing around, hoping our party would be called, we were seated in a much quieter location on the 2nd floor.  What a relief! The entire menu seems to be family style.  No menu to be seen where we were seated, we had to walk around to find it on the wall.  After selecting a handful of family style dishes to share, I was anticipating an average Italian meal.   Thankfully, the food exceeded my expectations!  The dishes were hot, tasty and plentiful.   Even though we were all stuffed, we had to have dessert.  That too, is served family style!  After eating our hearts out...we anticipated a crazy bill.  No menu table side, no gauge on pricing before hand.  Surprising, the dishes were extremely affordable considering the quality and touristy location.  Definitely not NYC prices. If you are in the mood for good food with a bunch of people, it's definitely a place to try!   Not so great for a small party unless variety isn't your thing.
