went there with my fiance for the first time last night for valentines day dinner. They had a V-day special that was $35/pp and included 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts. The Filet mignon with creamed spinach was sooooooooooo good!!! And the salmon was also tasty! The drinks were perfectly made and our waitress was super nice and bubbly! Also the choice of music was great...an r&b mix. The hostess said that their menu changes every 3 weeks so if u plan on going....check the website for the current menu!!! I don't know about everyone's BAD reviews....I've only been there once and everything was PERFECT!!! It can't hurt to try it out!!!
