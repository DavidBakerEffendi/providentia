OVERRATED!  Do NOT go here, you might as well throw your money into a blender.  They don't take reservations, but my friend and I were tired from the day we had, so we decided to sit there for the HOUR AND A HALF wait (and by sit, I mean on the window sill, since they only have maybe 5 seats in the waiting area).   It was packed, to say the least.  THEN when they called our names, we crawled through all the people and walked up, and they had given our table away.  It took us less than 15 seconds to get less than 10 feet, and they had ALREADY GIVEN AWAY OUR TABLE.   Food was okay, definitely not worth the price.  I was still hungry after 2 appetizers and a bowl of ramen.   The waiters/waitresses are nice, but the hostesses should go back to the corner they were picked up from.
