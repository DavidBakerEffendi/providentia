This review is for weekend Brunch over the weekend of December 27-28.  By my standards the place was excellent.  I am hoping to go back for dinner soon.  The hostess attended to us (party of 2) right away, the host was equally polite, attentive and friendly.  No snootiness from either.   We were seated in the dining room along the booth that is set up for the squeezed in tables for 2.  No problem--ok, so I do get why some would not like this but I am a New Yorker after all, love loud places, and love the vibe of a busy, social restaurant.  And yes, you do kind of shout at each other across the table--again, no problem for me because I am a yeller by nature :-).  I started with the oysters and pork sausage.  Excellent, very tasty.  I loved the drink menu, especially the selection of different bloody marys and whiskeys--can't wait to go back just to drink!  And the drinks and app was perfectly timed.  I like to be 3/4 through my drink BEFORE I get the app at the table.  i finish the drink and app, THEN I order another which should arrive just a tad bit before the main course.  It does.  We both ordered black label burgers.  Delish-no disappointment there.  The meat was great.  Fries were fab.  I decided to try the duck hash as a side.  Since I am a low carb eater generally, I wouldn't order it again becaue there were more potatoes than duck.  However, standing alone it was a very good dish and I could see getting it with a couple eggs over top.  My waiter was great and I gave him  a 25% tip.  The atmosphere is great--it is very old New York....a classic.  I wouldn't hesitate to go back....and next time I'm trying out some whiskeys.
