After almost 2 years I went back to Knock last night 10/19/2010 around 7 pm with a friend. I could see the diference that time makes on a place. The waiter was funny without crossing the line, allowed us time to talk and order. The timeing on the food serving was perfect, enough for you to enjoy not only the food but the conversation, the food was great, good taste, hot and the salmon was exquisite. Is one of the best experiences I had in a restaurant in years.
