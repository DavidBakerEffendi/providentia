Fantastic tacos and bowls.  I guess this is the non-corporate version of Chipotle.  I've been eating at this place since it opened in my neighborhood and have to say that the food is great. The food is fresh and made in front of you.   You can smell it grilling from a mile away, which is one of the best things for this place.  The tortillas are not overly greasy like how some places make it.   I almost always order the steak plate - tho some of the servers in there insist on calling it the Carne Asada platos. At one point early on they advertised delivery, but I think they took that away in like 2 weeks.  It's too bad, because if they delivered I'd probably order a whole lot more.
