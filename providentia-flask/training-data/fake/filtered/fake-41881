A theater-district gem.  This restaurant has delicious food, is immacculate and offers superior service.  We average three Broadway shows a year and Trattoria Trecolori is our very favorite, pre and post theater. We love it for many reasons, not the least of which is MJ -- perhaps the finest server in Manhattan. We will keep going back, and back and back!!!
