Fantastic beer list which is constantly rotating. There is always another great beer for you to try and they regularly have "you buy the glass" nights with some top notch brewers. The food is excellent and everything is made from scratch. I don't even know where to start with recommendations. The hummus plate is crazy good. The chicken fingers are thick and juicy. The veggie burger is awesome - I am about the furthest thing from a vegetarian, but I get it often. The cheese steak is unique and also serves as an great standby. My wife loves the fries! The specials change pretty regularly and there should be something good for everybody's tastes. My vegetarian friends love this place because of the excellent selection of veggie options. Brunch is fantastic, I love the Texas Bennie and pretty much stick to that, but I've never had anyone I've brought in with me say anything other then the food was wonderful. Treat yourself to a Bloody Mary while you're at it. I've always received good service here, even when they are busy. The bartenders and servers are attentive and pleasant and while I hate quizzo, both it and their karaoke seem to have a solid draw with everyone having a good time.
