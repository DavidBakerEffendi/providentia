Delicious beautiful food. The flat iron steak with kimchi, chimichurri, avocado, and potatoes looked like a painting and tasted sooo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o fly. I think the chefs might be on drugs all the time (seems to be mostly girls in the kitchen - stoner, acid chugging girls - which is totally alright by me), because the dishes have the creative process of a seasonal chef combined with a four-year-old making mud pie (Foi gras doughnut, dumpling nachos, banana-split-pea soup). "A Fish and some Chips" seemed like a crazy deal for the amount of food (could feed two). Go to their brunch on Sunday and get the ramen, they don't serve it other nights for whatever reason. They should. I also wished they implemented their creativity on some killer desserts - they offer snickers ice cream bars for now. Comfortable atmosphere and patio. Sweet and chill waitresses. The people who work here are attractive, which is always a plus. Music was too loud once, but that was okay because I was so happy with my food I didn't want to talk to my friends anyway (I kid. Turn it down an teensy bit?). Will be back.
