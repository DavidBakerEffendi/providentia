Went with a group of 8 and got the family style BBQ dinner... At only $24 per person this is beyond a bargain! The food was out of this world good! Everything was cooked to perfection, there wasnt a single thing on the table (6 different meats and EVERY side dish on the menu) that left anything to be desired... I will be going back, and I may be having my wedding reception there... it was that good!!
