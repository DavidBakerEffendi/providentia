It's a toss up for me to say which is better:  the subs or the service.  High quality bread and meats made to order.  Definitely worth a visit over any other sandwich shop.  If you're looking for authentic subs then this is your place!  Service was incredibly quick and you feel welcome and appreciated for your business.  Would rather support these guys than any Subway or Quiznos- they deserve it.  Class management and a great meal make for a definite return visit!
