I was really looking forward to this place opening.  My first trip there was pretty average.  The food portions were just very small.  I have had a similar grip with Pita Pan across the street and it turns out they are the same owners.   Thought I would give it another try, maybe my bad experience was due to it being their first day.  No, portion was even smaller!!!   I won't go back.
