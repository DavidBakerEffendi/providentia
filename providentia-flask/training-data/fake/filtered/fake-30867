I heard from a second hand source that the employees working do not receive tips. This is so miss leading and false advertisement because the owner is making us believe our money is going to the friendly employees that serve us. Not only is this wrong, but illegal. I hope you reconsider the actions you are doing and treat your employees the right way and give them what they deserve. Shame on FunniBonz.
