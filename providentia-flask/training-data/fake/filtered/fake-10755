Went to two weddings at Il Tulipano over the years, and always heard great things. When I got engaged we went to many venues, and Il Tulipano just kept standing out for so many reasons. We booked it and couldn't have Â been more impressed with just how incredible they were to deal with. Leave it to us - of all days to have picked a wedding date, we picked the hurriane. We had to cancel our wedding and reschedule. Everyone at Il Tulipano, especially Vincent, were beyond supportive and couldn't do enough to help us. In the end, we ended up with the perfect day, and perfect weather...and our guests still keep talking about how wonderful the food was!!! To everyone at Il Tulipano - thank you - and to anyone looking for a great place to have your wedding - this is it!!
