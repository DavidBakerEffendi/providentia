I want to tell you about this place.  The word needs to get out. This place blows.  Is it a pizza joint, a restaurant or a radio wine show (told over and over, "at the root of it" show), hosted by Erin Fitzpatrick?   It's both, and that's why Roberta's sucks.     My brooklyn buddies wanted to check this place out, and we discovered it's filled with weirdos, over achievers, over intellectualizers, and chatty cathy's.  I'm already OVER Roberta's at this point.   You can't relax at this "pizza" joint because everyone who works there, including the radio talk show hostess in the back kitchen (who loves to hear herself talk), forces you to sit there and "listen" while your dining there.  Their round pizzas were soggy and the crust was tasteless & dry, nothing special about it.  I've had better street pizza in nyc than this place.   Roberta's pizza and the radio talk show hostess made me want to vomit.  Save your time and money (they only accept cash).  Roberta's isn't worth the trip out there.
