What the hell happened. I would praise this spot. Tell people/strangers to get their burrito fix from this lil spot. The last two visits have been a huge disappointment and I wont be giving them my business any longer. The scenario was really simple, my chili con carne burrito was not hot (temp) as it has been in the past. When asked to bring it up to temp of my liking the rolled their eyes and grunted and heated it so hot I had to wait 20 minutes to bite into it. So today I decided to have the same thing, again the temp was not hot. I asked If temp standard had been changed and he said the temp today is what it has always been. So I asked them to just pack it up so I could got home and heat the sucker up. Service has never been their strong point, but the food always made up to the lack of people skills. Although I have to admit the ONE female who works the register something is more approachable. Don't know what their demeanor is about im not interested in doing research to know. I have to say their burrito size wasn't enough to feel my belly. This is my experience and you may not agree, its okay. Not good. Bad service, less then receptive to solve the issues I had.
