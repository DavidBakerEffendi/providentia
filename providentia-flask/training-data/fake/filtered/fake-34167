Though the food is tasty, the service at Shalimar Grill stinks.  On three separate occassions, we ordered Beef Kababs for pick-up and they gave us Chicken Kababs.  After confronting them the last time stating that we specifically stated beef, they argued with us.  Besides the need for a store clean-up, they need to clean out their ears because they don't hear so well.   The customer is always right rule does not hold here and I would steer clear away from Shalimar.  Afterwards, we went to Ali Baba Grill, which is a small space just next door and their kababs were amazing and they had great customer service!
