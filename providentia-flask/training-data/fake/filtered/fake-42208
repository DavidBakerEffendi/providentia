I though LA used to have the best tacos but boy was I wrong. They have small plates that you can share and have large portions as well. Their appetizers and rinks are good and filling too if you just want to go for a cheaper alternative although their prices are beyond fair. Sometimes they do get ridiculously busy but that's because they're so good. Again, no matter how busy they are, service has always been impeccable.
