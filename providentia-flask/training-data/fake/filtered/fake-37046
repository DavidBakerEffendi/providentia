I went here on a whim after reading all the rave reviews on Yelp, and I have to say: eh. The noodles with minced pork sauce was pretty tasty, and $4.50 for a bowl I couldn't finish in one sitting is a bargain.  But the dumplings were just so so.  Obviously they had been frozen, and cooked very quickly.  If you've never had home made dumplings rolled by a real Chinese mom, then maybe you'll think they're good.  But at least the 10 were just $3. Watching (and hearing) the guy make the noodles was fun, but maybe someone could have swept the place up a little?  There was some garbage under a table, but I guess that's a lot like China. If I ever head back, I'm definitely getting my stuff to go.
