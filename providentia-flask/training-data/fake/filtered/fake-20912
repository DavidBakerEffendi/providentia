Went here after they re-opened and it has definitely improved. They expanded the place aswell as the menu plus they had some great specials. I had scallops with this truffle broth stuff and it was awesome. The servers were very friendly and attentive. There are still a lot of tables in the place but all in all it was worth the food. I'll be going back next to try the burger.
