went in to the over-crowded bar to stand awkwardly and pay $26.00 for a single glass of wine. literally, $26.00 for a run-of-the-mill glass of white. turns out they ran my credit card 3 times. when i figured this out i went in to talk to the manager who quickly took my information and told me he'd look in to it promptly and call me the following day. still haven't heard from him and am now in an ongoing battle with the CC company to get my money back. weak customer service aimed at getting you in and out in an "outta-sight-outta-mind" sense. the food is good, but nothing great, and the wine list is out of date... nice as a novelty, would never make it a regular stop
