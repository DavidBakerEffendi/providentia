Visited the restaurant twice. The bar is nice and most of Â the staff is pleasant. However I feel the restaurant buys into its own hype. Our last visit I ordered redfish entre and had about three pieces. The lady who served the cheese was unable to relax and was upset when I asked her question more than two times. You would think the staff especially in such an exclusive atmosphere would show some patience and modesty..So when I go there again have the bread at the bar with the beer (although it the bread is not free), the cheese is excellent no need to look at the rest of the menu.
