This place is decent but a little bit overrated. You hear people from this neighborhood talk like this Pizza is made of gold. It's good- crust it a little bit thin for my taste. There are better places on SI to get pizza though (Brothers down the block for one). The staff is nice the dining room is kind of tight on the weekends and it's LOUD there. The most hilarious part is that when you sit down a waitress comes over and throws a stack of paper plates on the table with some forks and napkins and you set your own table. When you have it like that as a place you know the food must be pretty good, which it is, but it's just not so good that it would win any awards. I will say this though--- if you want a cool summer date night, Denino's and then a Ralph's Ice across the street is a pretty sweet evening.
