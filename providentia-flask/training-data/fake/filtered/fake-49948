Ok...the hot dogs are very good and relish is tops...French fry order is too small for price and the drinks are way to small and over priced...the greek platter was the worst Â one iI ever had and they say that they are owned by greeks? Some kind of mystery meat and 1 pc. Of pita bread with fries and a bowl with lettuce and tomato...no feta or olives... stick to the hot dogs and a cold beer here.
