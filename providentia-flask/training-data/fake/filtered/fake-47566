The first thing to mention is the line . Its a HUGE tourist location so there aren't many days when the line isn't Â stretching down the block. When you do get in its small and always crowded. Added to the line and small amount of tables is that they shut down the oven in the middle of the day to clean it so if you time it badly you can sit and wait over an hour for pizza all of that aside the pizza is very good
