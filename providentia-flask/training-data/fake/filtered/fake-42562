Moshulu was a fantastic venue for our wedding day. Chris Baldwin, the wedding sales manager, was very helpful and accommodating. We had our ceremony outside on the deck and because it was January, Moshulu provided complementary heat lamps to keep everyone warm. The temperature was very pleasant even though it was in the 20s that day. We had a very small wedding (just 10 guests plus the 2 of us) so we were able to use the Captain's dining room for our meal. The server was very good at his job, attentive but not overbearing. The open bar and Moshulu's cake added a nice touch to our meal. It was definitely nice to have these things included in our package so we had less to worry about. (We chose not to have a reception because we don't dance but I'm sure they would have had a nice reception as well). Moshulu was great!
