I have always loved the food at this restaurant from when it was Houston's.  The hamburgers and salads are great.  A hidden treasure is that you can still get the chicken fingers even though its not on the menu.  They are so good.  Recently they have added  jazz music.  The Sunday night trio is really amazing.  There is no restaurant in this area that offers music every night.  This place just gets better and better.  The only downfall is the wait.  There is always one.
