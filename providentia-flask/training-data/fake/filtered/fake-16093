I don't watch that horrible Food Network show and pay no attention to its even worst host - but this is a great spot with great food, that's clean with a very attentive waitstaff. Food is made to order and tasted fresh, and it was great to get refills without having to ask. It can get pretty busy, but it's a terrific option when you're in the area.
