I just have one question...Why was the chef standing outside of the kitchen on his iPhone, in front of a full dining room? Also...Why was his foot out of his shoe? Good food, unprofessional environment, and bizarre interactions between staff. Seemed as though chef was in the way of workers, dawdling on his phone. Never seen anything like it.
