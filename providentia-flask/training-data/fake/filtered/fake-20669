I signed up on Yelp so that I can write a review about this place. Yes, this place is THAT good. I visited New York from LA over he labor day weekend and Minetta was recommended to me by a bartender at Triona's. I took her recommendation and went to Minetta that night for dinner and I had the time of my life! Let's see what makes a good restaurant, well .. Good. FOOD - 5 Stars - If you like steak, naah .. If you LOVE steak, this is the place to be. I ordered the Veal "porterhouse" Chop and it was made to perfection! SERVICE - 5 Stars - I showed up to Minetta by myself and grabbed a seat at the bar. The waitress (Molly) asked me how I was doing and genuinely spoke to me about my visit to NYC. She took her time to recommend dishes and made sure my glass of water was always full and that if I am good on drinks, promptly. She was very careful about little things that matter. ATMOSPHERE - The place is dimly lit and is great for dates. But as it turns out, in my case, it is also fun when you are by yourself. There were a couple of regulars sitting next to me. They introduced themselves and even offered to share their dinner with me. Additionally, Molly poured me another glass of 12 year bourbon that I was having and did not charge for it. A few minutes later, Arnie, the General Manager came by and introduced himself. He made sure that the dinner was prepared well and that I was having a good time. After exchanging niceties, Arnie asked Molly to pout us all (Molly, the regulars, himself and I) shots of a 12 year Russian rum. That never happens!! So, there I was, after having walked in by myself, I had made a few new friends and shooting rum with them. It didn't stop there. Molly and the regulars asked me about my evening plans and provided me with recommendations for the rest of the evening. In all, I had one of the best restaurant experiences and I cannot wait to go to Minetta again when I visit New York!
