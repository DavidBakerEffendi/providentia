What can I say? Ippudo is insanely addictive. I love the Karaka Men -- spicy red Ramen -- with egg. The steamed pork buns are sinful. The shishito are served hot and sizzling -- fantastic. Five stars on the food. Only drawback is the ridiculous typical wait time. If you're eating alone, though, you can usually get seated at a big table; can be a lovely lunch.
