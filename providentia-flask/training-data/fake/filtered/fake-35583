Mmm..I'm hungry just thinking about a burger from Bonnie's.  Sit at the bar and watch the cooks make your burgers with poise and elegance.  The juicy burgers are seasoned to perfection and come with yummy crispy fries.  The turkey burger is excellent as well.  If your heart can handle it, have the buffalo wings as a starter.  They also have some pretty good healthier fare, hummus and pita, and a great garden salad.
