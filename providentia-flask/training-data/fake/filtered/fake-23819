I have only been in this country six years, but consider myself a burger guru having tried hundreds. Â Spotted pig's burger could well be one of the best I have ever had!!! It was great and so were the fries cooked in a garlic and rosemary infused oil. Just be ready to wait for your chance to sink your teeth into a brioche bunch which gently holds a roquefort covered piece of beautiful ground beef as I waited over an hour for a table-It was well worth it!!!
