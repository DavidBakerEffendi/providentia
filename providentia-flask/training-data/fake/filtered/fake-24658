I was in Philly for the weekend and a friend recommended this restaurant.  I thought it was a super cute spot and they had outdoor seating.  We were immediately seated (we were early for a reservation).  We ordered Chicken Bao Bun, Vietnamese Spring Roll (just an FYI- its cold), Kobe Beef, Korean Fried Chicken and Kobe Beef Fried Rice.  This was a lot of food for two people.  The food comes out staggered.  The sauces weren't great.  I thought the food was full of flavor and interesting. My overall experience was great.  I like small plates because I'm indecisive and it lets me pick a few things.  I did think that all the chicken were prepared the same with different sauces (I'm allergic to shellfish so what I'm able to eat can be limited).  Overall I would recommend to another person who was visiting the area.
