I've had several good dinners here. It's cramped and crowded, but the food is consistently delicious. However, just had my first brunch experience at Tartine, and it left me with a bit of a sour taste. Word of warning: The prix fixe menu might say "includes orange juice and coffee", but refills of oj are definitely not free. We didn't find this out until the bill came and it included a $3.50 charge for each additional glass of juice ($10.50 total). Mind you, these were tiny glasses, our server never told us that refills cost extra, and they never brought us water. These are pretty sneaky tactics, and I'm guessing we weren't the first group to fall victim to them. Hopefully you can now avoid the same trap.
