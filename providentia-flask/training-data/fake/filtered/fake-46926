We really enjoyed our dinner last Friday night. The food was delicious and service  was the best with our head waiter Jim M . My wife selected from the  4 to 6 course menu ( she only ate 2 1/2 portions and I had the other 1 1/2. I chose the ala carte menu starting with tuna sashimi followed by the the marinated pork dish. Jim's wine recommendation was perfect and reasonably priced.We will be back !
