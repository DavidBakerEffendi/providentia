I'm scared of the Lower East Side (after dark) but I gave this spot a try and really liked it. It's in a semi-awkward location, as I found myself in an alley unsure if I was entering the wrong way. But once I got inside, I met a girlfriend at the bar for a glass of wine while we waited for our table (no rezzies...gotta wait at least 15 mins if its packed). When we got seated our waitress was very friendly and prompt. We got the artichoke dip as an app which was delicious. For our entrees, we both ordered the filet and loved it. Overall great spot for a date or just a casual catch-up!
