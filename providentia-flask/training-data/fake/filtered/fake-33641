So let me start off by saying this place has the WORST customer service I have ever experienced in my life ( I worked in the restaurant business so I'm usually very patient and understanding) however this was such a HORRIBLE experience I can't even begin to describe it. We chose this place to celebrate one of my brother's birthday. It was 10 adults in total and a 2 year old (which we didn't mention since she was only occupying a high chair). We had my brother and his girlfriend join us a couple of minutes late due to an unforseen, unexpected circumstance.The manager who was totally rude did not even want to give us 1 extra chair to have them sit at our table.  They forbade them from being able to order food and did not allow my father to have an extra entree. They treated us as if they were doing US a favor when we ended up spending about $300 on their average food.  Overall terrible service. NOT WORTH the wait, the money, or my time ( if it would've been my birthday I would've gotten up and left )
