My husband  and I both being foodies and a fan of Django and Talula's table found Chef Sikura and David Fields latest venture to be terribly disappointing and borderline vile and offesnive. We sat at the chefs counter so that we could see the action first hand. This proved to be a horrible idea. We witnessed a line cook drop some tongs on the floor and and pick them up with out washing them.  We were dumbfounded but hungry. My husband who had worked in NYC restaurants while in college and grad school was in complete and utter awe. We didn't care if it was a busy Saturday night, the health department would have shut the place down. We found the menu to be confusing and without focus. I asked the waiter what was some dishes he recommended and he informed us  that he was not allowed to give his opinion on his personal favorites. He rather suggested that we get 4-6 things to share. So we did. We found all the food to be either over or under seasoned, and over and under cooked. We both agreed that certain combinations were not " bold simple flavors"  as described but rather absurd and misinterpreted  concoctions and recreations of other local successful restaurant dishes. While sitting at the counter we also witnessed BOTH the Chef and David Fields berate two different servers within our listening and viewing range. We found this to be unprofessional and disruptive. Mr. Fields was also drinking from a bottle of wine that he stashed by the end of the counter and was touching food to test for temperature before sending it back to be reheated. We never noticed him wash his hands, but who knows, we can't see everything.   It scares me that that while being a frequent guest of the AKA chain that this is the caliber of restaurant they are funding. This place has not even been open a month and is in my opinion a disaster. The cocktails were superb. That's the one star.
