Friends and loved ones always hate this place. I've never had luck bringing anyone here. It's always something different and pointless to explain. All businesses on the prospect/franklin cross-street have always been cursed. However, they have frozen margaritas on tap and serve them in a tall plastic cup. I simply support that in no uncertain terms. Too few places are meeting this need. I don't want to get out the blender, or have any local bartender go mixologist on a frozen marg for 15 bones before tip. I simply want a decent, giant, frozen margarita, flushed out of a slushy machine and into a plastic cup with a straw. That is 5 stars period. The staff is nice. You would have to be.
