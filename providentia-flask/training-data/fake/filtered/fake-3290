My first time eating here was with my husband and two kids.  They were friendly, accommodating of our gluten free buns (they are getting their own soon), and had a very clean place.  The burgers were seasoned well and delicious.  The fries?  Also seasoned well and wonderful!  Loved it!!  We have gluten and corn allergies and had no problems eating here!
