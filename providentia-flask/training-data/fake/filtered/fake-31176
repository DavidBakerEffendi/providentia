Freshly prepared Lebanese food is healthful and delicious, and Wafa does it right and she does it with pride.  Hummus with olive oil was creamy and tasty.  I had never seen split pea soup in a Middle Eastern context before but it was hearty and hit the spot on a cold and gray day.  Wafa came out to make sure all was to our liking. Service by Wafa's son was attentive and friendly.  It is definitely worth a trip.
