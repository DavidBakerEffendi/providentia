I hosted a late night university happy hour here with 98 attendees. The Staff was excellent to work with for planning and our group was very happy with the event. Since it was a late night event, we stayed at the bar and out on the patio deck.  The fire pits were a huge hit. The place is gorgeous, great beer selection, and the service is great.  i highly recommend for a large corporate party or happy hour.
