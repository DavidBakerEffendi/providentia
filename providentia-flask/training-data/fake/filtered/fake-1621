They tried to steal my money!  I ordered 2 items, and when one of them never came out, I went to see what was going on.   (20 minutes after the rest of the food came out).  When I told them I didn't want it anymore, they swore at me and threw the money on the counter in a huff.  Afterwards, they stood over my table harassing me and the other guy I was with.  Never eat here!  If they will steal your money, think about what they will do to the food!
