I ate here with my girlfriend while we were on a spur-of-the-moment vacation, and it was wonderful!  First of all, we were lucky to have perfect timing!  It was a Sat night, and we got there just before it filled up!  Still, despite how busy they were, the service was still surprisingly fast, and we enjoyed every minute of it.  They didn't seem to mind us lingering as long as we ordered something every once in a while. The food itself was very good, and I was lucky enough to try beef tongue, chicken hearts, and chicken oysters -amongst other, less exotic things.  Everything was melty and cooked perfectly.  Only downside was that we spent more than planned because we kept wanting to try different things. Another thing I loved was that the young Japanese waitresses were absolutely adorable!  I'm a fan of cute things, so I have a lot of cutesy accessories -including a lot of game stuff, anime stuff, and Hello Kitty.  One of the waitresses stopped when she saw me, squealed "Kitty!!" and went to get a few of her coworkers.  What followed was a lot of fangirling over my accessories, which was really fun! I definitely recommend this place!
