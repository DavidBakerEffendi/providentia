I think Claire's is amazing. Not because I used to work there five years ago, but because everything is made from scratch. I visited there a while back and I absolutely love the zucchini pancakes. The cakes are delicious and so is the muffins and cookies. Some people over expect for this almost at home restaurant to be nothing but perfect but every restaurant has their flaws. Claire is an excellent person and loves what she does. I 100% would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good meal, and a home style feel.
