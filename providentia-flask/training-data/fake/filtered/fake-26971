Would probably give them three stars if the prices reflected the experience, but you should get what you pay for. Fish was undercooked--twice. The rest of the meal was OK, pasta was pretty tasty but not the best in town, and there were other successes and failures around the table between our party of six, so not consistently great food. Have to agree with some other diners that the restaurant is way too loud, and it would be a much more relaxed, enjoyable atmosphere if it wasn't all one huge room with an open kitchen. An open kitchen is nice, but not when the place is already overly noisy--it just adds to it. The service we received was fine but have heard horror stories from some friends. Wish the menu had more options, but I guess that's what you get with a steakhouse; the location is also not ideal or central to anything, really. Will go to Trattoria, L'Amante, Kitchen Table, etc., before going here again.
