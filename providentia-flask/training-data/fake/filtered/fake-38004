I was honestly a little disappointed with my experience here. Everyone I know, including myself has been waiting months for this place to open, and honestly, it fell short of my expectations. I sat in the back with my two girls and it seemed like there was only one waitress for the entire restaurant. It took the server forever to talk to us, and to my surprise, the Mac and Cheese came with mushrooms, which my daughter hates... I felt so bad for the other patrons who had to put up with her crying. To top it off, the biscuits were really dry on our "biscuits and fixings", and we were given a larger order of pickles than I requested AND charged for. While I loved the chicken, and tasted bits of brilliance in the making, I couldn't get beyond the strangely disorganized atmosphere and surprises with the size and contents of my food. I don't want to discount the possibility of coming back and changing my rating, but I would seriously hope for a better experience in the future.
