Their roasted red pepper pizza is absolutely fantastic. Unfortunately, because their pizza is so good, the wait for a table on most evenings can be quite lengthy. It is worth the wait though, especially if you have never tried it before. If you are coming for lunch with a larger group, take my advice and call ahead. You can not only reserve a table, but put in your pizza order over the phone. This takes care of the potently long wait for multiple pizzas that other reviewers have noted. If you come in expecting great pizza and well, nothing else, you will leave happy and stuffed.
