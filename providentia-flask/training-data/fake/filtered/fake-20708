My wife and I came here the other night for some wine on tap, and a few nibbles at the bar. The decor is lovely and warm. You can tell these folks care about detail. The staff is inviting and knows their stuff. We enjoyed a few glasses of wine on tap that were fresh and well priced. Their fried pickled veggies are marvelous. An absolutely wonderful addition to this stretch on Fulton. We will return for often thanks to atmosphere, food , and drink.
