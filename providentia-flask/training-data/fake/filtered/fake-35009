First let's just get this out there... this place is pricey. If you can't afford it, don't go and then complain it's too expensive. That being said, everything I've ever tasted at Agricola has been phenomenal, fresh, and flavorful. I've never had a single bite of something that wasn't a combination of warm childhood memories and sophisticated tastes. Whenever I go there I feel like Remmy from Ratatoille. My brain dances. Get the Rye P. A. the fried green tomatoes, the roasted beets, the chicken, and the black pepper meringue cake. You'll feel like a million bucks (even if you spend $100). Your soul will thank you. Service was super polite, accommodating, and fast. Our table was beautiful and when we asked them to turn off the A.C. they did. The ONLY reason it's not five stars is the price. Not everyone can afford this place which is a shame, but it's not out of this world expensive. Our entrees were $25-$30 each. Save up and go for a special occasion.
