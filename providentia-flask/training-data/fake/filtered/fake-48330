I really don't understand why people love Pat's so much. I was very excited to eat a Pat's steak, but I was very disappointed. I've been there twice and each time my cheesesteak was cool and the steak was tough. It tasted like they had pre-prepared the cheesesteak before I had even ordered it.  I've gotten better steaks from food trucks near Temple and UPenn.  Go to Jim's if you want a real philly cheesesteak.
