Save yourself time, frustration/ anger and money. If you go here you will experience all three of these emotions plus have to wait in life. Staff is rude, food be prepared to wait for it for a while. Ohh while you are waiting better serve your own drinks or worse twiggle your fingers hoping the food will be ready. When the food does arrive its luke warm, certainly not worth the wait. Ohh if you think your trip here is over be prepared to wait in line to pay as well. To sum it is the place is small, over crowded, food is ok at best, customer service is slim to none, staff is very rude and specials are overpriced. To add icing to your trip here, expect to leave a little hungry as portions are small. Avoid this place and do yourself, your group, friends and hunger a favor . Please go somewhere else.
