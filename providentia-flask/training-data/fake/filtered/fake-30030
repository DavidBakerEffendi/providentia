Non-franchise good ole diner breakfast in chelsea. Breakfast was ok, had the Farmers omelette platter. However I'm looking forward to going back and trying out lunch because the description of the Munchie sandwich sound awesome. Customer service is very attentive but only draw: no gloves when taking money then handling the food with bare hands...not cool.
