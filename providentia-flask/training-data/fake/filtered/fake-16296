I just had really poor quality pizza. It seemed as if it was sitting around for hours and all they did was heat it up (and burn it). It wasn't a slice (and therefore one would expect it to not be that good because it had been sitting around and reheated) but an order of an entire pizza. I used to go to the one in Williston/Colchester, which is the best pizza around, so I thought that I'd try the Burlington one. I've gone on many occasions to the Burlington Jr's, each time thinking the next would be better given the high quality food at the Jr's in Colchester/Williston. However, time and time again, it only seems to get worse. I won't be ordering pizza from them again. Staff is very friendly/nice and the atmosphere is pretty nice too with a decent location. Â Outside of the staff/atmosphere/location, very poor quality pizza.
