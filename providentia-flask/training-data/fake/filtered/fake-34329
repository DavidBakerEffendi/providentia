I enjoy eating in at Nyonya but the take out experience is not as pleasant. Â The man with the mullet that takes the order is not the friendliest and they have made mistakes with my order- turning things spicy that are not supposed to be spicy. If possible try eating in- b/c the food is really good although it's noisy in there.
