Irish Pub? Sports Bar? Burger Joint? Who knows?!? This place is suffering an identity crisis, and what's worse, none of its many identities are all that appealing. The menu is big, with everything from "philly cheesesteaks" to burgers to sandwiches to fish and chips to corned beef....pretty much the kitchen sink. Unfortunately none of it was done right; paid $13 for a burger that was overcooked and tasteless. Atmosphere is wall-to-wall TVs....I was expecting a pub, not a sports bar. Truth is, they don't know what they are.
