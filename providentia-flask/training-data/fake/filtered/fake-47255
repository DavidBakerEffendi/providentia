Honest to God, the BEST Italian food in New Jersey! The chefs passion for food comes alive on the plate. My personal favorite is the selection of homemade pastas. No matter which one you try, you will not be disappointed. And I absolutely love how everyone who works there has a hand in the food prep. Truly an enjoyable experience, well worth the drive (I drive forty minutes)! One piece of advice, make a reservation or you may have a very long wait.
