My boyfriend and I wanted to try a new brunch place, so we settled on Isabella's. We got there on a Saturday around 1pm and were seated immediately outside. The waitress was attentive but not overbearing. We placed our order and the food came soon enough. I had the mushroom benedict and my boyfriend had the steak benedict. I've been to many a brunch spot with over poached eggs, but I must say these eggs were perfect. The yolks exploded nicely when you cut into them. The homefries were excellent, and the portions were perfect. Not too much, but not too little. Also I cannot say enough about the hollandaise sauce. And the strawberry butter. Delicious! So why not 5 stars? A few minor things that are easy enough to fix. First, we really could have used sharper knives. It's hard to cut through a nice crispy English muffin with abutter knife. Also the tables were very cramped once our plates came. The plates were big, and the tables were not. It was like a puzzle trying to figure out how to fit it all on the table. All in all, we'll be back.
