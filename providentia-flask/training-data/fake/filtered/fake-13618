Lea is a regular for my friends and I but our last visit was very disappointing. Called in advance to find out the dinner menu. When we arrived at the restaurant we found out that the original protein had been substituted by a regular pork sausage that is usually served for brunch for two thirds of the cost. What's upsetting is that why was the protein substituted and served with cabbage for the same price as the original item and not 86ed. The substitution was so unproportioned that we had to order pizza on the side to compensate for a meal that wasn't even close to an entrée. The decision making on this was a big hit and miss. Lea please reevaluate and be  more relative. Get it right or don't have it on the menu. Please don't sell customers short...
