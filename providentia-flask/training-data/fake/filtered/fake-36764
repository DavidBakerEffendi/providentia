Wildly overrated and overpriced .   Anyone with even borderline high blood pressure  should avoid this place,  as it tasted like everything was sauteed in sea water.  It's THAT salty.   mock eel, which all positive reviewers rave about, would have been much more tolerable with half the salt.  I know that Asian cuisine consists of lots of added salt , but this place is over the top . Combined with about a twenty minute wait after our reservation time, the whole experience made for a very unsatisfying meal.   One other note to the owners... Not sure if you fixed the swinging door in your waiting lobby, but when we were crammed in there waiting for our table,  the rather heavy door swung closed from someone exiting and hit my shoulder pretty hard .  That would have taken out a child for sure.
