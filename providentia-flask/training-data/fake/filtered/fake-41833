Went here on a Saturday night with a reservation for 5.  My son and his girlfriend showed up first and were told to wait until the rest of us arrived by the hostess.  The rest of us showed up three minutes later and were told by the same hostess that our table would be ready in a few minutes.  5 minutes later, we still were not seated, and then the hostess seats a party of 6 ahead of us???  I go to the manager  and tell him what happened, and he starts berating me.  He says "do you really think that we would purposely seat them ahead of you ? "  Guess what moron,  you already did.  Memo to the owner of this restaurant: You need to fire the idiot that was managing on Saturday night 6/29/2013.  He has no customer service skills, and he couldn't manage a Burger King.   And the hostess is another prize.  She is clueless, and has a bad attitude.  After listening to the stupid manager lecture about "managing our reservations, and how we could never seat 5 people at a table for 6", we walked out.  What a joke.
