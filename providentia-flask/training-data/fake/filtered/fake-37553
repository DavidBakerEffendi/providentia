I don't know what it is about this place that makes me want to write reviews, but alas I'm back to talk about Nish Nush, and to say one final goodbye to a not-very-good restaurant. If you see an earlier review of mine, it was a matter or cleanliness that I assume they have resolved because I never witnessed it again. I've revisited a few times this year, wanting it to be everything I think it could be, and I always come away disappointed. Â Today was the nail in the coffin. My Popeye falafel sandwich? Falafel was cold, perhaps stale. My pita was definitely STALE. Today I ordered French Fries, which I never get. They were perhaps they worst french fries I've ever eaten. They smelled of dark old oil, were incredibly soggy and were more like french fry pieces, most no longer than 3/4 inch. Simple rule, don't serve me nasty things. Disappointed that it had to end this way. I recommend looking somewhere else for lunch.
