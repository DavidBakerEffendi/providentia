In an area with hardly any non-chain Mexican restaurants, Tortuga's offers very good food; unfortunately this means there are long waits at dinner hour on weekends. They have moved to a new location across the street from their old location - the new location seems a little larger, and has the space broken up into an upper and a lower level. The seating seems less cramped than it was at the old location. Great chips and salsa (the first round is free, you pay if you want more). BYOB is a great help; the food is not especially cheap (though far from prices at upscale restaurants), but bringing in your own beer or wine makes it much more economical. Fabulous refried beans and rice (not something I usually notice or note). I tend to get the tacos or enchiladas, which are fine, so I can't speak about the range of other items. The ambiance is bright and informal and homey - just what I want in a Mexican restaurant. Parking on the street and in their parking lot is very limited; fortunately there is a public parking lot around the corner and down a short block so it's actually much easier than trying to find a space in town. I definitely recommend Tortuga's, but I also suggest trying to get there before 6:00 if you don't want a wait. Also, they do NOT take credit cards (a definite nuisance), so get cash ahead of time.
