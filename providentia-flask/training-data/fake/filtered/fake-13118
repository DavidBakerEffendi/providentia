I don't get  it. The burgers are very ordinary and served on two slices of ordinary bread. There are no fries, just potato salad in a cup. The place is tiny so if it's busy it will be difficult to find a seat.  All this plus an air of arrogance. There are several signs advising you that you will have your burger their way or you can take a hike.
