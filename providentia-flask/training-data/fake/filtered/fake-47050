This pizza is so yummy!  They have an arugula pizza that makes you feel like pizza is a healthy choice. Its great for date night and a group of friends. I really love this place.  Try what ever speciality pizza they have when you go, you can't go wrong. I have found interesting flavors on pizza that I never thought would work.
