Loved this place. We were in town for a show at McCarter Theater and walked in without a reservation. Good thing we came early because about 20 minutes after we walked in we started seeing people having to wait for a table. And we soon found out why: The service is top-notch and the food is excellent! The host, the waiter and even the bus boys treated us extremely well and kept coming back to check on us, refill our drinks and make sure everything was to our liking. I had the pork chop, which was gigantic and extra delicious. My date had the roast chicken and it was succulent. Even though we were stuffed after the main course, we chose to have dessert. I had the chocolate lava cake and my date had the brownie. Though they were both good, I think she had the better one. We loved Witherspoon Grill and will be back very soon!
