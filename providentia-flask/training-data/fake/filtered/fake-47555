I'm so torn between giving this place a raving review or a terrible review.  The food: best pizza in Brooklyn.  Fresh mozzarella and basil, not greasy.  You could eat the whole pie and not feel gross afterward.  Everything else: awful.  The service is atrocious, it's obvious these people do the bare minimum because so many people eat there, even with a mass amount of bad tips they'll make bank.  The line is always a mile long, because it's such a tourist attraction.  We once waited for a half hour before they even opened, and just as they started to take people in, a tour bus came and the entire tour bus was allowed to jump ahead.  We asked the guy at the door, and he said they have a contract with them.  So it's just about the number of people in the door, not the customer service.  Also, and maybe most importantly, check all of your dishes, silverware, and glasses for cleanliness.  I opt for a bottle of soda every time, since I've consistently found floaties and flies in my water.  I try not to think about what might be in the pizza because it's so delish. We did some background research, and the Grimaldi's family that started the business, sold it.  They have very recently opened a place directly next door (which I think is the original Grimaldi's location).  It looks a bit more expensive, but I'll be trying that place next.  Maybe they will care about the cleanliness and service a bit more.
