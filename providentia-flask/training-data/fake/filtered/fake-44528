I had friends visiting from Michigan and we wanted Indian food. I used the navi system in my car and choose Karma. What and excellent choice!!! The service was Awesome (Shout Out to Michael) the food was the BEST I have had. We met one the of the owners, Bobby, personable, friendly and a pleasure to chat with. I will Absolutely be back to experience The Wonderful buffet as well.
