If you're reading this, you probably want to know about the food. This is the only reason I'm writing this review. The place turns a huge business. The Mexican food is on the salty side, so be ready to drink a lot. I've had better salsa from a jar and the guacamole, not made at our table, was hardly chopped up (avocado chunks were too large). Golden margaritas were very good. The entree I had (chicken burro) was good, but rice and beans...salty. If you don't mind the wait for a table, the noise and getting decent Mexican food for a good price, you'll accept Jose Tejas. If you're going for great tasting Mexican food, maybe you'd want to look elsewhere. Where I come from (Orange County NY), the Mexican food is MUCH better.
