This one is a little bit of hard for me to rate the stars, Igave the really clean green dine room a 4 star,$4 dollar yummy soupy dumpling 4star,but another thing I need to mention is their attentive SERVICE and a lot of smiling faces,I gave 5 star. It's a lot better than a lot of other restaurants in  China town area, I've been craving Sakura Mandarin since my last visit to Philly... And this time, I was with family, and they knew the "secret" of coming to the location in ChinaTown, for better parking... YUM! The Yummy dishes: - Pork soup Dumplings (xiao long bao) - the bestest! - Crab soupDumplings - great! still not sure how they pour the soup inside. (6 pcs of dumplings is 4 bucks! nothing beats that! and this is better than any of the places i've tried in The bay area (CA), and NY area. Clams with baiil brow Sauce. Yum! (Finally clams without the sandy grit from uncleaned seafood) tasty, even just the sauce with white rice was a plus.$4.95,wat a good deal,even my bf likes here better than Joe Shanghai in Flushing better. I was surprised that they have Sushi,my bf tried is Paul is big fan of Sushi,he had  Angry Dragon roll it was a little bit different than we expected ,with fried shrimp tempura,spicy tuna and soy wrapped but it was so good with the sweet miso sauce. GOOD DISHES WE HAD : XIAOLONGBAO(soupy dumpling) EGGPLANT WITH GARLIC SAUCE (a little bit too sweet) SNOW PEA LEAVES PORK SHOULDER(daddy's favor) ANGRY DRAGON ROLL(very different) At the end the server Ben brought up some sweet dessert soup on the house at the end,it was a thick soup with little tapioca stuffed sesame inside it was so gooooooood
