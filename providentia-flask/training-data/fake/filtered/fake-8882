It's small place and not very appealing. Medu vadas are not good - I will never try it again. It is basically half-cooked inside.But we always go to this place for vangi bath, tamarind rice, yogurt rice, mango rice, pongal. Never tried dosa here, so no comments there. I must mention - though the prices are cheaper, rice items quantities are always less. If you take a to-go order of any rice item, expect to get only 7 to 10 spoons of food into your mouth.
