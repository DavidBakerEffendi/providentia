I came here last monday for dinner, with my girlfriend after hearing reccomendations from friends.  Not only was the food delicious the service was excellent!!!  For an appetizer I started out with the avocado salad, everything in it was very fresh and quite well prepared.  As for my main course i ordered a kamakaze roll and chicken teriyaki. My girlfriend loves the salmon tempura in the Kamakaze roll. They put in Jalapenos in the roll, it's taste a bit spicy to me at first, but the sauce make it taste pretty good! Lastly, we had a pretty cool desert "Rockslide Brownie", they served the brownie with Vanilla ice-cream on top.  That is fabulous! We got our check....$42, which is pretty reasonable for a salad, 2 main courses and a desert.  We found out they have a pretty decent lunch menu, i think i will try it later this week. Anyway, we had a wonderful dinner there, everything was great.  Good atmosphere and we had a great experience.
