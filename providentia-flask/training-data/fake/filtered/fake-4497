My friend and I had a wonderful experience Thursday night! This is one of her favorite local places and I finally got a taste myself. The hostess was extremely accomidating, the margaritas were 100% on point, and our server Jared was out of this world! The new executive chef definitely deserves a big 5 stars, for one of the best meals at any Mexican restaraunt I have had throughout the city!
