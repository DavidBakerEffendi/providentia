This place is VERY popular, and with good reason. Well done Italian served without pretense or snobbery. Fantastic prices. Get here early in the night or expect to wait. It's a tad claustrophobic and loud, but charming. The mussels are PERFECTION, the broth the mussels are cooked in is perfect for dipping in their rustic bread. Salmon was excellent. My dining companion enjoyed the Bolognese. Intriguing yet approachable wine list. We've been here twice and we will continue to return, a true gem in NOHO!
