The only thing good about this place is the the free salsa and chips, which are VERY good. I live a couple blocks away so I've been to the Cantina many times. I don't know why I keep going back , but every single person who has ever waited on me there is an a**hole. They're like mean hipsters. And I'm not a jerk customer. I work in the restaurant business too and I know it's difficult sometimes so I'm an ideal customer. I'm patient, respectful, and I tip well. It doesn't seem to matter at the Cantina. No one smiles, everyone rolls their eyes, and most act annoyed when a question is asked...even when it's a reasonable question associated to a food allergy. The food, well, it's OK. Mexican-"style". But if you want real Mexican food go northeast a couple blocks and get some authentic stuff for half the price. Ambience- The decor is hip, not legit. They play the music WAY too loud, to the point where I can't have a conversation with someone sitting right next to me. Also, why would a food establishment have scented candles on the tables. I don't want to smell perfume when I'm eating. If I return it will be just to the bar because I'm sick of tipping nasty waitresses and left feeling like I did something wrong.
