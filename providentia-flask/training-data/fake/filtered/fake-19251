We went to Lulu & Po last night as we are here on a 10-day holiday and want to try as many places as possible around Fort Greene, where we are staying. The service was great when we arrive and the food was delicious (although we can't help but agree with others about the fact that one octopus tentacle for $15 is taking the mickey). When we ordered a second round of drinks, my friend got a glass of corked rosé. It was so spoiled you only had to smell it to know it wasn't good. We let our waitress know and she served my friend another glass of rosé...from what appeared to be the same bottle as it was still corked. We tried to explain again that it was not drinkable and the waitress suggested it was because my friend "didn't like the wine" (even though she had had another glass of that same wine beforehand). She then brought a third glass which was still corked so probably from the same bottle unless Lulu & Po managed to buy a whole box of spoiled wine. After such a good start we were quite disappointed by the poor service and the way the waitresses made us feel like we were just being fussy. Sadly this is not a place we will recommend to our friends from NYC or travelling to NYC.
