First off, let me begin by saying I am definitely not the type to go on these things and write stuff but I just had to today. From the moment we walked into the restaurant Bogota Bistro, we felt welcomed. The food was delicious, so good that I ate my boyfriend's food. LOL .. the food was delicious but the best part was definitely our server. Our server Christian was a great server, paid attention to detail and checked on us often. He made us laugh and he did the impossible.. he had my boyfriend talking up a storm. He turned a usually quiet person into a non stop chatter box. We felt comfortable and happy. Definitely coming back.... mustttt try that guava empanada(way too full today..but it shall my mission) Thank you everyone at Bogota Bistro.
