Shockingly rude waitstaff.  This place is not worth the aggravation of dealing with waiters who cannot be bothered to be gracious or helpful. The burger is nothing special. Incredibly oversalted and undercooked.  I felt terribly sick the next day.  I'm considering calling the health department to complain.
