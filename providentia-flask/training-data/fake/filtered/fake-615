This restaurant is meant for take out ONLY. It is to small in there. I fell like I have no privacy; unfortunately the food was TOO sweet! It was like I was eating a desert the whole time! The pad Thai wasn't cooked all the way. It was like eating hard noodles. The crispy spring roll was cheating. I thought it had meat in it and it didn't. It had an old taste to it! Â Did they make this a month ago? The servers didn't look happy. It looked like they were being watched. They are not interacting with the coustomers freely. In addition, the place is way to small to have that many people. In conclusion, the boss or what ever you want to call him "claims" that the food he makes is an original from Thailand. But its not, ive been there and the food at jasmine rice taste americanized.
