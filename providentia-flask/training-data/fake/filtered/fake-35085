A splendid top notch dining experience, I first reviewed this restaurant upon my first visit last year and have been back consistently since, Marshall & Paul at the bar make you feel like an old friend and are true professionals, the menu never disappoints and the specials are creative and delicious. If your looking for a spot to enjoy a great meal or just a drink at the bar in a beautiful atmosphere Halcyon is for you.
