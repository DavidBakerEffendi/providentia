My feel is eh... The discontinued my favorite drink Ace perry, and asked numerous times to restock it. Im not thrilled with the menu, not enough to choose from. All heavy and greasy. I have to say I like the atmosphere, nice beer menu, and the soups ive had. They were really really good, and the burgers are superb. But not enough to save this this review. I would suggest a better mix of fresh menu food some on the lighter side, and please cater to those who drink cider too ;) 1 cider for a trendy place like this is the pits for me. I like to support local business but Im never really satisfied, so hopefully you'll take a few hints
