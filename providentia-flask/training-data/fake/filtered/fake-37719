Not only does this place have phenomenal miso soup, and an super-friendly staff, they also serve absolutely incredible sushi. It really can't get much better than that. This small restaurant takes me to another place during my lunch hour. They're prices are reasonable. Kim's give the high quality service of a mom and pop--but Â the quality of food of a restaurant in the city. Never gets too loud, great atmosphere, delicious food. What more could u ask for?
