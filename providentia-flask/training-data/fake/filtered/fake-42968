I'm a fan of Indian Hut, but I have only eaten here twice.  Now, I always order the food  to go.  I find their staff very friendly, and I find that they take special food requests.  I have noticed that over the years that their food has changed slightly, but I am still a fan.  Also, you can order online!  I find that a huge plus!
