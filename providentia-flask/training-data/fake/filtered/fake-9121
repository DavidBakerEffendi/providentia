The food and service are great. You'll find the best Calamari ever at Joya. I mean THE BEST,!!!!  Food never goes wrong, great outdoor setting for summer. The food here is really good.  Though not the BEST I have ever had, it's up high on the list.  I especially love the Pad See Yu.  Their fusion dishes are definitely worth a try.  Delivery is always prompt. Because it's right near Smith Street, the place is a hipster death trap on the weekends.  Don't bother going unless you want to wait for at least 30 minutes.  Also, it gets LOUD, crowded, and unpleasant at these times, even by NYC standards. Great ambiance with really chill music and hip crowd. A great experience after all! We will be back! Its CASH ONLY!!
