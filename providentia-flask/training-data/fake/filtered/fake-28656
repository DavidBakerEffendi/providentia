I went here for the first time after graduation in May. My mom was going on and on about how she always sees this place on her way back from BJ's and basically forced us to go. I'm happy she did! The food was really good and the atmosphere was family friendly. I actually think there was some kind of engagement party going on when we went, but we still had quick service. Though I have had better Turkish food, I haven't had any better in this area, so it's definitely worth a try.
