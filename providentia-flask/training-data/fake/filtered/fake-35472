Went here with my mom last Thursday 6/24/10 and the service and beer flight was good; however since then I've been recovering from a particularly nasty bout of salmonella poisoning from eating their crabcakes.  It's been 4 days and I'm stlil recovering (first time this has ever happened to me -- and I love seafood!).  My mother's salad was fine, if you go there I would forgo ordering their seafood.
