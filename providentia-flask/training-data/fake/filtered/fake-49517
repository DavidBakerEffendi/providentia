A testimonial: I was at El Vez for the first time Tuesday night for my friends 24th birthday. We had a lovely time, the food was amazing and they didn't charge us a plate fee for the cupcakes i'd made her. It was great fun, and the owner was super nice, as was our waitress. Fast forward to today: i realized my wallet was missing when i went to purchase a flight home for thanksgiving. Talk about a nightmare. multiple important ID's i need for work, my drivers license, my ONLY credit card and about 100$ cash, GONE. Naturally i was frantic, i left work early, ripped apart my car, my apartment, etc. Couldn't find it. I had called the restaurant earlier in the day and left my information, but they said they hadnt seen it. I was about to cancel my credit card, call my boss and tell her to cancel my IDs, and well as polish off a bottle of wine and bemoan my existence at loosing 100$, when i got a call from El Vez at about 8pm. They'd FOUND my wallet, with my life intact inside it. I cannot tell you how thankful i am for the El Vez Staff & management, 1) for finding it and 2) for saving me hours of hassle in getting new ID's and returning everything to me. You guys really impressed me, if i wasn't so poor i would have tipped somebody, needless to say you will be receiving my business again (and that of my friends who i'll be sure to drag along with me) THANK YOU SOOOOO MUCH!
