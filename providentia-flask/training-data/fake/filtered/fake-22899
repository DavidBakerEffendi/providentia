Been coming here on and off for over a year. A friend of mine from Portland turned me onto this place as we rode by one day and he freaked out when he saw the sign (in a good way). Long story short, I may not know much about coffee but I know good coffee when I see it, and Bodhi has it. Aside from the coffee the service is excellent, never had an off day anytime I've stopped by.
