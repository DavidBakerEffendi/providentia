Absolutely delicious! My friends and I spent all day trying exotic meats (rattlesnake, alligator, elk, wild boar, ostrich) and The Thirsty Koala was our last stop: to try some kangaroo! We had the kangaroo filet and all agreed it was THE BEST of all the meats we had! The prices are good, the atmosphere is really nice, and the employees were all very nice and welcoming. I highly recommend it!!
