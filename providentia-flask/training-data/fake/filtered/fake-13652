I called to make a reservation last night and asked a simple question. What is the name of the Parking Garage across the street. The young woman who answered the phone was quite rude an unprofessional. I was surprised as I have been to Cuba several times and even had a huge dinner party for family and friends.My husband loves the food and the freshly made cigars. Very disappointed that I was treated so poorly:(
