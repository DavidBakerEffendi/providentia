Disclaimer: I am not a fan of hipsters; in fact I'm a notorious hipster-hater, but I have to give them credit where credit is due: political awareness, bicycle promotion and morning cuisine.  When it comes to making a slamming breakfast, nobody beats the hipster, and Café Lift is standing proof.  On the savory side, their frittatas are amazing (especially the mushroom frittata).  For those with a sweet tooth, I have yet to find a superior French toast.  They have specials every so often to mix things up, and their diner-style bar is nice when there are only two of you.  The only downsides are that the neighborhood is a bit (i.e. VERY) seedy and the place gets really crowded on weekends.
