Both the chicken and lamb look gorgeous on their respective displays.  Staff is very frienly, and they spoke English fine to me.  I ordered the chicken pita sandwich, which had amazing homemade bread.  The bread is definitely the best part! The chicken was just o.k., some pieces were a bit hard or fatty.  Next time I'll try the lamb which from other reviews sounds far better.
