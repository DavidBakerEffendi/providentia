I really liked this place. And, yes the food's a little pricey, but it matches the value of the food. It's a fun little place. And the food is excellent! I had the honey fried chicken salad, which I loved. I also had a Ginger Lemonade, which was refreshing, kinda spicy, but very good. Everything was FRESH. Yes! And it's not the same old menu you will see at every other soul food restaurant. It was a new experience for me, and I really enjoyed it, so I'm sure I will be back.
