I have been to this place several times and it does not ever disappoint. I only go on a weeknight and I never have to wait more then 5 minutes for a table but from my understanding the weekends are much longer wait times. CASH business so make sure you have it. Service can be sketchy but the food makes up for it.. You MUST get the watercress salad and don't forget the crispy fried pork belly entree..Heaven!!!
