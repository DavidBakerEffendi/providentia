Awful!!! The food was like La Choy Chow Mein. I asked for "Thai Hot" and could have rubbed the sauce on my cornea without the slightest discomfort. Service? There was none. After taking our order, the server NEVER returned. She didn't even drop the check! In a city with so much good food, I can't imagine why anyone would come here. I'd think twice even if it were free...
