When you go to a bar you think of fries and wings only.  Pub 46 has amazing food.  You can actually get Penne and Vodka Sauce, a grilled chicken sandwich, and even Steak!  The staff is really cool.  Sometimes they even give you free shots.  On Thursdays they get super packed and sometimes give away free trips to Vegas or Mexico or Jamaica.  They also have like 20 flavors of vodka.  It's truly a great place with reasonable drinks, great food, and a very welcoming atmosphere.
