Will never go back. HORRENDOUS service, appaling, disrspectful, and rude to say the least. No cuisine is good enough to make that level of (or lack thereof) customer service acceptable. I concur with every review on Yelp/Citysearch, and any other review website voicing the terrible service of this place. Â  Too bad Michelin is solely based on the quality of the food and does not take service into account. Otherwise, there is no way this horrendous venue would be awarded a star. Sadly because of all the hype and the "Mario Batali" effect, they will most likely never be short of customers.....but if you want quality food and decent service, there are TONS of other places in NYC to go instead of here.
