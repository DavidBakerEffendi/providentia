Yelp took down my original. Annoyed. So here it is again, censored for the children.* Apparently, Manhattan Proper doesn't understand what it means to be a sports bar. I live in tribeca and have been anticipating the opening of any new alternatives for night life in the neighborhood. Ward III is good but got too expensive and no TVs to watch the Yankees. Busters Garage is, depressingly, now a luxury apartment building. Reading the review about Manhattan Proper got my hopes up. Big TVs, hot bartenders, good food, the place sounded like the end game in my search for my local neighborhood bar. I got home from work, changed into tshirt and jeans and walked over. Barflies smoking cigs outside, so far so good. I peek in through the window to see big flat screens and exposed brick. FINALLY! but wait, what's this? I bouncer in a suit taking himself way too seriously? WTHeck? am i in the meatpacking? Stopped at the door figuring i'll be ID'd. Noooope. I didn't even get that far because i was told i'd need a collar to get in. Whoa. Who do you think you are, Proper? Nobu, Megu, Tribeca Grill, Wolfgang's; not one of them would stop me for a dress code but, to my surprise and chagrin, he was actually serious. I'm not sure what the point of this policy is but the result is a bar full of banker bros who wandered too far outside of their FIDI radius for happy hour. People who actually live in Tribeca and are looking for a cool spot to hang out, look elsewhere. It's ok to be pretentious once your bar is popular but, until then, just be grateful that anybody cares enough to shlep down to no-man's land (Broadway and Murray) and give you their money. Oh well, the search continues. (Also, i know one star is harsh but everyone giving this place five stars need to start assessing it like a real person and not a shill. So my one star is here to temper expectations like i wish someone had done for me) *flag me for being inappropriate, i dare you.
