I love their pizza but the service is terrible when it comes to delivery! I placed an order at 10:45am for 12:30 pm delivery and ended up picking it up myself because at 1:30pm it still was not ready. Still wanted to order from this place. They might have some difficulty during that time. I ordered again. This time the delivery service is quick. Thanks
