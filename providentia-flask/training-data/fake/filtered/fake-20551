Zahav is easily one of the most delicious restaurants in Philadelphia. I came here for a friends birthday and we did the tasting menu. From start to finish the flavors and ingredients are fresh and delicious. Being an avid travelor and loving Israel, i love thier take on middle eastern flavors and spices. I cant wait until i get to dine here again!!!
