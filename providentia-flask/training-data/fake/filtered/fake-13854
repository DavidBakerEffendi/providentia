I live in Bangkok, Thailand, and I can attest that the food here has a real Thai taste. The Country Curry is excellent, with real Thai ingredients. The chicken dumplings with roasted garlic are extraordinary. And the sticky rice with mango is a perfect dessert. As for price, it can't be beat. And the fact that you can bring your own wine or beer, is terrific. I cannot recommend this restaurant too highly. It's GREAT!
