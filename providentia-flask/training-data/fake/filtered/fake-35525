Pizza was great, antipasto salad horrible, rubbery provolone if that is what you want to call it...no real Italian meats, iceberg lettuce tasteless and not worth the extra money. Server was rude when we asked for bread with the salad and kept saying it's an extra charge over and over....this guy needs not be in the business of serving food. Sorry!
