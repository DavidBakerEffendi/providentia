Montana sure does have a lot of friends... its unbelievable that this place has almost no bad reviews... other than in the press I can't fathom anyone returning to this restaurant... unfortunately because i live in the neighborhood I have returned multiple times and each time has been worse than the rest... The food is obnoxiously over priced. under portioned. and not good... watery greens, greasy chicken... even greasier vegetables (which is weird vegetables shouldn't be greasy) The service literally couldn't be worse... never in my life have a heard the word "chill" used to describe menu items... and not just once it was for every single thing.... there was nothing "chill" about any of my experiences... The commodore is a perfect bar/restaurant severing similar food at half the cost, half the wait time and twice as good. I whole heartedly agree with the review written in the observer. Â  this is a Disney land theme restaurant trying to cash in on and aesthetic... the saddest part is what they don't know is that they're not pioneers... North east kingdom has been in the neighborhood for what? 7 maybe even 8 years? There's a cafe down the block with a waterfall in it!!! They're not trailblazer or trendsetters... the neighborhood is already dead and over... they might as well be selling "jefftown" hats and T shirts and beer cozys at a lil stand out front... if you want a drink. go to pearls. From what i can tell its an honest version of what Montana is trying to rip-off... it was nice of him to at least not open too close to them... oh wait.... it's a block away....
