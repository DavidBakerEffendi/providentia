Perfect for a late brunch in NY. I went last Saturday and they were able to get us in without a reservation, but I think this is rare. The service was fast and the food was out before we knew it. Bread, a bloody mary, and a frittata made for a perfect choice. I loved the energy of the restaurant and it was nicely done inside.  There were people of all ages, dressed up or dressed casually.  The next time I'm in NY I'm going back.
