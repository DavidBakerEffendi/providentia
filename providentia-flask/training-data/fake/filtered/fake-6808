I'm a huge sushi fan and I have eaten sushi all around the world. Hon is definitely on the top of my list! They offer a unique variety of sushi rolls that would be difficult to top. My family and I go to Hon at least once a month. I have also brought many of my friends and they have all loved it! If you want fresh and high quality sushi, Hon is the place to go!!
