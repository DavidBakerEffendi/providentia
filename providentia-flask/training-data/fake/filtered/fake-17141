I've been here a few times and have not been disappointed at all.  Such authentic Greek flavors and with other options too. We've had the Athena Pear Salad both with chicken and without.  It is absolutely delicious with the fruit, nuts and the balsamic.   The burgers were juicy and fresh.  The spanakopita and the moussaka were both so flavorful and seasoned just right.  I can't wait to try YiaYia's Meatloaf and some of the pasta dishes.  Portions were good too. Service was great - very attentive by all servers not just our waitress.  Beautiful view of the canal too.
