The first time I went to Koto I was smitten. Now that I have eaten there 4 times I have decided that this restaurant really isn't that good.  The menu hasn't changed in a few years, the Hibachi tables were dirty, our plates were dirty, and it took us 90-minutes to get our entrees.   Can't say I will go back, or recommend this restaurant to friends.
