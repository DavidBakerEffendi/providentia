We were recommended to this restaurant by our hotel concierge and also read the great reviews on the web.  I had the Boston clam chowder and crabcake and my wife had the house salad and the lobster roll.  The food was excellent.  Unfortunately, our experience was marred by sub-par service and the restaurant was not overly crowded or busy (it took over 15 minutes to get a soft drink and it was wrong when it arrived) and the waiter never checked back with us but instead we had to try to get his attention instead. We took a pass on dessert, in part because we did not want the hassle of trying to get service for this phase of our meal.  If the service was at least good, then we would readily give the restaurant a higher rating. update:  We went back today and had a very good experience.  The lobster rolls and oysters were excellent.  Our waitress was very efficient, knowledgeable and more than made up for our disappointment yesterday.  We will be back.
