I went to Panini's the other day around 4pm with 3 friends. We were just looking for a place to get out of the cold and have some coffee, but after looking at their menu- and hearing about their great deal on Sangria, we decided to try a couple of the smaller plates. The cannoli as particularly good. The waitress was very attentive, knowledgeable and friendly- I was very impressed. 3 of us were vegetarians, but since we were just there for a late afternoon break, we were fine. The layout is lovely
