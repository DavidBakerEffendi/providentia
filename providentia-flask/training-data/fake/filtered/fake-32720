We had the Thanksgiving To-Go take out. I went to the restaurant twice. The first time to meet with Giuseppe, one of the owners, about the meal planning; the second time to pick up the food. Both times, everyone in the restaurant was very welcoming and pleasant. Giuseppe gave me an espresso on the house while deciding what to order. The interior space is very simple and charming, not overly done. I knew right away I wanted to come back sometime to have a meal at the restaurant because it had a very friendly vibe. The Thanksgiving meal was really well made and delicious. The food was a roasted boneless turkey to feed about 12 people. This actually fed 12 people and had leftovers. Brussels sprouts with pancetta and lemon, olive oil mashed potatoes, cornbread stuffing, creamed kale and a large loaf of bread. I wish their menu was still online so I could share the ingredient details of each side dish. Â  I cannot rate table service, but I can tell you that Giuseppe was so accommodating to my emails and phone calls, always responding in a very timely manner. Just seems like a person and a place that truly appreciates each person's business. If the take out experience was this good, I will definitely go there for a meal...and hopefully soon!
