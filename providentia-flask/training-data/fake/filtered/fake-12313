I go to this place regularly because their food is fresh cooked each day. Great Italian American selection of sandwiches, wraps and hot specials each day. Great Taylor ham, egg n cheese sandwiches also! They make a to die for freshly made each morning mozzarella! Then you have the freshly cooked broccoli rabe. Most fridays, I stop in for their fresh mozzarella , broccoli rabe and grill veggies and I call it dinner. The service is fast and friendly. A MUST to eat at if you want delicious fresh food FAST.
