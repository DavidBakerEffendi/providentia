Went to Battersby on Wednesday night around 9:00 to a packed house. My girlfriend and I were able to grab the last 2 spots at the bar. Glad we did. For an app we shared the Spanish Mackerel with grapefruit, radish and pimenton. After one bite I realized I should have just ordered one for myself and let my girlfriend get something on her own because it was delicious. It was very busy but one of the servers gave us what was a liver pate with shaved mushrooms on a crostini bread. Hopefully one day that makes the regular menu because it was very good. For our entrees I had the Roasted Chicken with lentils and vegetable. My girlfriend had the Seared Scallops. I normally don't order chicken when I go out, but I'm glad I did. The sauce it came with was fantastic. The atmosphere was cool, in that, they have an open kitchen and the place is on the small side. I don't know if "intimate" is the right word, but you get the idea. I like how you can see the kitchen going a few feet away yet you can still hear the people next to you. The bartender and server we had could not have been better. Nice staff. Definitely didn't seem like a place that's been open for such a short time. Seemed like it had been open for a year. Nice draft beer selection. All-in-all a great experience. Highly recommended.
