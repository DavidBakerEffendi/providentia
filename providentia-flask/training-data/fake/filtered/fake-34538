Went to Yummy Sushi for dinner with family and friends the other day. Service was very nice and the waiters were very attentive. The resturant itself was also clean and relaxing. My dad ordered the Sashimi Dinner and found the fish to be exceptionally fresh. We also ordered the Dragon Roll which looked and tasted delicious. I'm vegetarian so usually I would not enjoy a sushi resturant, but I found the vegetable tempura to be very tasty. Definitely will go back soon! =) Oh and one more thing, the mochi ice cream dessert is a must-try.
