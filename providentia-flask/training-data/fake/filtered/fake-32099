The food is mediocre , too much oil and butter . The service is so horrible in the wait area, whether inside or out ,  i think the hostess need better training . As far as . the waitstaff they are pleasant and friendly this is the reason i keep going back .  Why each time i visit the menus are so dirty can someone please tell me why ?
