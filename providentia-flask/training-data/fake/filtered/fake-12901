Very good pizza. Â It seems different from some of the other pizza on SI which is a good thing (not that other pizza is bad on SI, actually it is awesome) as SI has a bunch of old school original pizza places not all trying to be the one that begins with a G and ends with an S. It is in a bar so if you have little ones or are looking for a quiet night call ahead and get a pie to go.
