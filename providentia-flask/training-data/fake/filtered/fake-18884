I ordered 5 pies via phone.  When I showed up they said that they had called me back to confirm (which they never said they would).  I had been driving around in a party bus so never heard the phone obviously - and explained that to the guy behind the counter.  He said he didn't care and that I had to wait for 40 minutes for my order - completely defeating the reason why I had called earlier.  I really did not have that kind of time so he said to leave.  He was extremely rude and nasty and I will NEVER give them business!!  I don't care how good your pizza is - that's no way to treat people!
