I've been to a lot of Cheesecake Factories, including Bridgewater and Menlo. The first thing people should understand is how small this one is. There was a long wait because it's such a small restaurant. The most redeeming qualities were that it was very clean, and the staff was very attentive. There were two hosts (I think they were related) who were very helpful with the menu and actually had a conversation with me during the hour long wait. As a diabetic, I hate long waits. They offered me bread and a soda as soon as I told them I was diabetic. The manager came over and spoke to me about getting something to eat too while I was waiting. They seated me in less than the time they told me and the server came over immediately and helped me order an appetizer. (Avocado eggrolls are AMAZING). The server was a really nice boy with a complicated G name. He got the food out, no mistakes, no excessive waiting. My soda never depleted, and the manager even comped the appetizer. Food was pretty good (I got the avocado eggrolls, skinnylicious chicken pasta, and slice of lemon raspberry cheesecake:). The service was what made it really good. From the host stand to the manager to the server, they were all nice and professional. I will definitely be going back again. (Only downside is you can't make a reservation for 2 people)
