Llama Tooth was a great choice for our family get-together of 30 hungry relatives. The outdoor garden is huge and tropical feeling with colorful Haitian country scene murals on the walls. The manager John worked with us to come up with three entrees...chicken, steak and crab-cake and the rest we just ordered off the menu. This made the service to our rather large group doable in a way that left no one's stomach grumbling. We started off with drink orders that featured an amazing selection of local craft beers and not so local wines and spirits that put us all in good humor and set us up for the delicious appetizers and salads. The fried eggplant was piping hot and extremely tasty with it's picante dipping sauce. I really enjoyed the grilled peach salad with goat cheese, arugula, prosciutto and almond clusters...it could have been a beautiful meal itself and was only $6.00. We did a lot of food swapping and got to sample most everything. The three entrees we choose were fabulous...everyone raved and we all ended up partying till midnight... a great night was had by all at a very reasonable price. I highly recommend Llama tooth for groups or a romantic table for two.
