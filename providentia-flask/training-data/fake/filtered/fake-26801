And I thought Chipotle was bad.... I know some of you have commented that you can't compare NY burritos to SF or So. Cal, but why not? The two cities have access to all the same ingredients and yet, it still falls short. I don't appreciate the comment about people from Caifornia not knowing good Mexican food. I'm sorry, but I was born and raised there and have been eating amazing burritos from the time I was a wee tot. Obviously, this person hasn't been to the Mission District and tasted anything better than Chipotle quality burritos. That said, I ordered the carnitas burrito and it was severely disappointing (this coming from a pregnant woman who will devour anything). There was too much rice, several beans (I could count them--not a good sign), and very greasy pork. The grease was so abundant that it soaked through the bag, receipt, napkins and leaked all over my hands. And to top it all off, who charges over a dollar for a tiny container of salsa?? My goodness, as if they couldn't afford to hand out some salsa to customers. I hear there's another place opening/opened by San Franciscans that I will be sure to check out. For now, I may have to bribe my Cali friends to smuggle me a burrito or two when they visit NY.
