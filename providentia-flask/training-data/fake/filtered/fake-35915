Unfortunately, i had quite a disheartening and insulting experience at Roberta's tonight. I have been going there for years, since they opened, and have had some really good food times there. I arrived around 7 to join a few friends, and they were finishing, but I was hankering for a quick pie.The waitress treated me as a nuisance for asking if I could order some food, and said that their policy forbids walk-in additions to a seated party. I politely said " I just want to order a pizza, I'm a paying customer". By then 2 of our party were being served their pie. She called a manager over who said that if I didn't want it to go, she could relocate us to a counter because "people were waiting for tables". The place was not that crowded and there were empty seats around us, our friends were just served, what's the big deal with me having a pizza here at this table? Another 15 minutes? Doesn't that meet their bottom line? The attitude of the staff really sucks, unless you are of the party at the table adjacent, who were apparently VIP and were being treated as such.
