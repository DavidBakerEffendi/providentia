We visit East Haven several times a year but never knew Bistro was here.  Out first visit today, but will not be the last!   Great food - great variety - friendly service by one of the owners, "Claudio" - what more can you ask?  Four of us had lunch, only a couple other diners on hand at the time.  Turned into a 2 hr + meal!  In addition to the printed menu they feature an extensive list of daily specials - we had Calamares from the menu and then added Cheese croquetas, bruselas salteada, and escargo/shrimp as the tapas/appetizers.  All were great.  For main courses we had snapper over lentils, caesar salad with shrimp (lot of them!), cheese ravioli (one of the specials) and the churrasco skirt steak -- wow what a portion - this was enough to feed us all!  For dessert we had chocolate lava cake, flan, profiteroles, and carmelized fruit along with a spanish coffee.  Wine was the excellent carmener at only $6/glass.  I probably would not have the snapper again as it was a bit overcooked, and if you are in a hurry don't go here - the service is "relaxed".  That does not change my rating -- 5 star all the way.
