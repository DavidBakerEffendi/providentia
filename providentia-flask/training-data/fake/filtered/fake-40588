I have been coming to Lombardi's for years. In that time I have sat in every dinning room at one point or the other, I actually prefer the dungeon downstairs, because its quiet. I work at NYU during weekends so Lombardi's use to be my Saturday night dinner spot for its relaxed, good food, and surprisingly for a pizza joint - great service. For a series of weeks now I have had to deal with the same incompetent waiter - jesus or HAY-ZUZ. Not just inattentive as a waiter but straight to the point rude. The first time I dealt with him I was trying to ask him a question about the menu , he answered but I could not understand a word this man said. It sounded like he had marbles in his mouth. I politely asked him to repeat what he said, to which he acted beyond offended and was really surprisingly rude to me, eyes mumbling, storming of, never checking in, etc. This happened more than one time. On my second to last time, I went to Lombardis, and I asked for a stella at the beginning of the order. Time passes, no stella, the pizza arrives, no stella. I recieved a call and the reception was bad down there so I go upstairs to finish my call. As I go upstairs, this guy is behind the bar sipping on juice and chatting and chatting away. I never got the stella. Last saturday I specifically asked to sit upstairs, to avoid this guy, and lo and behold I get him again. Lately the vibe to Lombardis has changed and its not what it use to Â be. There is a general "cheapness" that permeates everything there, from the cheap air conditioner that barely works, the cheap hand dryers that dont work, down to the cheap of the street waiter like jesus. Needless to say on my next Saturday I will be taking my business elsewhere, which is a shame because the pizza at Lombardis is my fav.
