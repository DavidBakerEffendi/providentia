5 stars for food. -5 stars for service. The pizza is awesome, but the nice thing about New York, there are LOTS of fantastic places to get pizza AND good service.  We met up with some old friends for dinner so the bad service didn't affect our mood but you should be forewarned should you care to be treated like, well, customers at a food service establishment. I have served so I I like to think I am particularly attune to good and bad service. Our waitress never came by, didn't offer us water, and begrudgingly slammed some on the table when asked for some...15 minutes later. She repeatedly wiped down empty tables and chatted with her friends the entire visit and never asked if we wanted a second glass of wine. Any smart server knows to make sure glasses are never empty at a table. Not only will your guests be happier but you'll increase the bill and in turn increase the percentage of your tip. When we were finally ready to leave, glasses (water included, which, in addition to the wine, were never refilled) empty, table completely cleaned (by a buser who was doing all the work) we received the check 45 minutes after asking for it  for the first time. Putting it nicely: lackluster. If this pizza parlor was the only restaurant available in a small town, sure, the poor service could be tolerated for the taste of a great pizza. But in a city like this, there's simply no excuse.
