We went to this lovely restaurant a few weeks ago with another family and had a wonderful time. The food was delicious and the place has a decor that is refreshingly authentic. What a great addition to the neighborhood! We had the Dad's shrimp rolls which were delicious. The shaking beef was a melt-in-your-mouth experience and the shrimp-okra, a combination that surprisingly works so well together- couldn't have enough of it. All the ingredients were fresh and carefully prepared. Staff was very friendly. Henry, the owner, is truly passionate about the food and his culture & was so helpful. We are definitely going back. A great place for a date, big groups and absolutely child-friendly too!
