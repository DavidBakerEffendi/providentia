Food was good, to bad the staff needs a lot of work, we had a very ghetto waitress Christine who needed to share the fact that she is a recovering addict, cuz yea thats who i want handling my food..... The show at Johnny rockets is not about you or kids that aren't even yours.... Its supposed to be a fun fifties style family diner. Get some more polished staff maybe ill return... Train the parolees you hire not to spew their business, especially that Christine rivera chick.....
