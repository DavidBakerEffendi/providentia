Cozy little placed with a Â (hopefully on purpose) distressed look throughout. It actually kind of gives the place a dirty vibe. The floor is unfinished and even had a few cracks, the table had chips of paint missing. You can't really tell if it's on purpose or they just didn't have the budget to make the place look nice. We shared the Chips & Guacamole, pork tacos, and salsa verde chicken enchiladas. The Chip and guac was good and there was plenty of guac. Chicken enchiladas were very good and more flavorful than typical. The pork tacos weren't very good, and in fact lacked flavor. There just wasn't much too them at all. Service was decent, not great but not terrible. They seemed as if they're not used to being as busy as they were as the place was full and there were even people waiting outside. Plenty of waiters but not really fully attentive. Guess that's what receiving a Michelin star does for business. The star was part of the reason we decided to go, and to be honest we prefer the Mexican food at Skinny's just a few blocks away. The spicy margarita was good and very different.
