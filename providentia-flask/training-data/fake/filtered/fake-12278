Their breakfast and lunch sandwiches have decent rolls,  however there is a lack of quality ingredients in the sandwich.  An egg and cheese consists of one egg and one slice of thin yellow cheese.  I'm afraid their subs have the same issue.  Very little meat and a ton of "filler" (shredded lettuce).  I have no problem paying good money for a quality sandwich.  I do have an issue paying top dollar for a  sub I can get at Subway for 1/2 the price.
