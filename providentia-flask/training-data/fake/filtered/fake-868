With Underdogs really close to my hotel (Sofitel), I decided to go there one day. The Warsaw is SO good, the polish sausage is really spicy, and works good with the sweet onions. The fries are pretty good, and the garlic aioli works wonders with it. The problem is really the price. It's 7 dollars for a hot dog and a soda, which is pretty pricey. Underdogs is delicious, but really too high of a price :(
