Amazing barbecue, best in Queens. Rib tips, mac n' cheese, pulled pork sandwich, cornbread... You name it, all quality food. Staff is super friendly, owners are always around chatting with the customers. Definitely a must-eat in Astoria. And now they have a new Butcher Bar venue right next door with a bar and a solid beer selection!
