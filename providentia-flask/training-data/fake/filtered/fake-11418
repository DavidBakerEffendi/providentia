We visited Eataly right after returning from Italy in June, and it is stunningly like the approach to food shopping there.  No all-purpose grocery, but rather, a set of small stores selling cheese OR meats OR produce.  Of course it is crowded because it's NYC, but the prices are not much different than we saw in Florence and Stresa and Rome.  The food was authentic.  Crowded yes.  Noisy yes.  But the food we ate there was fabulous -- just like we had in Italy two weeks earlier.  The capachinno was authentically slightly bitter, just like we enjoyed in Rome.  I fear that many of the reviews I have read about Eataly say more about the reviewers than about this adventurous place!
