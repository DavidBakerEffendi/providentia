The tacos are good - though the chicken taco usually has tiny bones in it (apparently they dont use chicken breast or clean the chicken). Tasty food, but HORRIBLE service!!!!! I went there a couple of times and tolerated their rudeness, but not any more. The last incident was the following: I asked the waitress about one of their soft tacos and she assured me it was made out of chicken so I ordered it. When she returned with my order it wasnt chicken but tongue or something of that nature. I was polite and told her she misinformed me, she denied it at all costs.  I spoke to the manager and he said they were going to charge me for the tongue taco since I ordered it and there was nothing they could do.  I insisted that I they remove it from my bill and that the waitress had misinformed. After 5 minutes of who was at fault with the order he didnt charge me.  This happened months ago and I have not returned since and do not plan to.  They have NO CUSTOMER  skills at all!
