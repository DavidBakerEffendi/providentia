Ok so this place would be lost in a crowd if it were a person. Very hard to find. Wait was unnecessary considering that the people at the bar were drinking coffee and there was hardly anyone there eating, maybe that was the first clue. The girl working behind the bar made me feel like she had better things to do, food was a mistake. oxtail was oily and fatty. My boyfriend had the Tilapia yuk!! No flavor rice hard, the best thing about the place was the empanadas. Never again!!!! WALK ON BYE
