Tried this place after Peruvian friends highly recommended it. Bad experience started with parking. There is a public parking lot behind the restaurant. In addition to paying meter, you need to pay a mean looking gentleman to look after your car. Have never seen this. Initial service was great, very friendly, and food came very quickly. Food was decent, not quality, but good taste. Portions were huge (several people can eat from one plate). Then the waiter dissapeared, and we needed to find anyone to get us more drinks and dessert. The place was less than 40% full, and waiters were just hanging out talking. Then the tab came, and 15% had been added to the total (we were a party of four, so didn't understand this). Then came the credit card voucer which read PRE-TIP AMT (and this amount already included the tip!). So diners beware with this dubious policy. Â I doubt I would return. Then are places just as good in nearby areas that will avoid you all of the issues we encountered.
