Went to see Mazzy Star at T5 and was STARVING and THIRSTY afterwards...a friend said to try this new place and it was on point. Super warm, friendly and the basic antithesis of the area. Had the mushroom pizza - delish - and the smoked side car cocktail - more please! Will actually consider hitting up more events in this hood knowing this place is an option.
