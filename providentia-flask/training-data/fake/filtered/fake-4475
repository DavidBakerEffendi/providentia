I do enjoy their tacos and sometimes their brunch specials makes the grade but the time you will wait to get your drinks or food is unacceptable.  Last time I was there, they took forever to bring our drinks and the glass was covered in someone else's lipstick and has sauce stains on the side.  They apologized and took another long wait to bring out a new drink.  The bloody marys are watered down and full of chili sauce/spice?  Bad balance.  The salsa that came out had a giant black hair on top that shouldn't have been missed.  Times before this when we call to place a pickup order, they put you on "hold" which is really just setting down the phone handset on the busy bar and after 15-20 minutes, hang it up.
