My wife and I went there for the first time last night using a Groupon.  Called earlier in the day and was told would not need a rez for Monday night but when we got there, it was crowded and had to wait.  Reason was this was the last day of the Groupon.  We waited in the bar at a quaint little table in the corner and ended up eating there.  The bar is very cool, old and 'fun' in comparison to the dining area which is traditional.  The service was 'bar speed' which was fine but probably would have felt a little slow had we been in the dining room.  We would def. go back for drinks/apps or to watch a game.  The arugula salad was dee-lish and the fried clam strips were good but had too much batter on them.  The gazpacho soup was very good and we split a burger that was just the right size.  The fries were excellent.
