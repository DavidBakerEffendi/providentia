Best seafood in Rutherford Area for several reasons among them: Great lunch specials, and they add $2 on lunch specials for dinner (rare to find lunch specials at dinner these days), fish/sushi is fresh, service is great (especially the new lady from Massachusetts), delivery guy is super friendly and prompt, and all food is so good. Prices + Great food = CAN'T GO WRONG...EVER!!!
