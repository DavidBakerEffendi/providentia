FANTASTIC...I have been stuck finding myself taking my wife here over and over again...The service is great as the guys have a homely feel, as they make you feel like friends off the bat...They gave us great suggestions like Â the DREAM SOUP, and the Gnocchi...The stuffed Chop, well, that is a meal in itself, out of this world...MY wife's Lamb was great. I cannot say enough about this joint... As my constant return once a mos makes it evident that this place is for real...ENJOY...
