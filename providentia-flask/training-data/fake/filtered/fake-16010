I went to this ace thinking its authentic Ukranian cuisine. When me and my boyfriend arrived there was no one to greet is it seems as though no one was around to welcome us or seat is. When we finally saw some one he seemed rude and uncurious. The food was definitely mediocre at best I have had Ukranian food before and it was delicious this food was under seasoned. It was so fattening and everything was floating in grease. I would not recommend it to anyone.
