Usually go to a place after checking out the review but ended up going here without doing so as we wanted a quick meal close by. The service was not that great and was real slow but then it was quite a busy lunch hour today so thats excused. But it took us a few attempts to get the waiter's attention. And the waitress seemed to be in a foul mood..i thought more customers meant more money and hence a smile. The food is not that great but i guess for that price,one cant expect more. It cost us 38 for five people so not bad. The Pad Thai i ordered was greasy and dry - i am used to a saucier one. The Vegetable fried rice my friends ordered wasnt great either..palatable with some hot sauce.The red curry with vegetable my hubby ordered was good though. Its mentioned in a review below mine, that for students this is good option but not otherwise. Agree with that. Not interested in a second visit unless others in the group want to.
