Okay so i am obsessed with avocado and I generally love this place and there avocado toast. but i have to say that my most recent experience was a bit disappointing. i ordered delivery from this place and ordered the avocado toast and I was so unimpressed. It was cold and soggy and there was really nothing about the taste that was special. basically, i am still a major fan of this place and will continue to physically go there and eat however I do not think I am going to be ordering delivery from this place again any time soon...and definitely not ordering avocado toast.
