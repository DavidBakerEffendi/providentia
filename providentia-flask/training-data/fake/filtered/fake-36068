Very disappointing visit! Chicken was overcooked, primavera consisted of limp carrots and onions, pizza dough was horribly undercooked even after waiting an extra 10 minutes for it. Staff is still great but the food was awful. They comped us a dessert but it was too little too late at that point. Not sure if there's a new manager, owner, or chef but something is wrong with this place at this time... Buyer beware...
