Something that I appreciate in regional-style restaurants is something that you find in Sazon, it is authentic. All the ingredients of their food are imported from Venezuela. It's not venezolanized American food like most restaurants do. The juices are from real fruit, the chocolate is amazing, and all the dishes have a great quality. They're always trying new Venezuelan dishes and if they don't approach the quality they expected, they prefer not to release it. It is the only one of its kind that you'll find in the entire city. All the menu is really good. The asado negro is the best that I've tried in my life. I go as much as I can and I always bring new people to let them know how great is our cuisine, and Sazon have really represented us very well. You won't be disappointed by anything in their menu. Also, the owners are very involved in each detail and are always taking care of their customers
