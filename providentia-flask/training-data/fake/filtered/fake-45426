Hi Pure Fare... I really likED your food, quinoa skillet bread, cauliflower flat bread, cualiflower rice bowl, and others, when they are made right. Recently, I don't know if PF has changed its chef or gotten a different person to prepare its food. The food quality has been very inconsistent. Over the past 2 weeks, I have purchased cauliflower rice bowl that was soaking in sauce with patchy salt pockets here and there in the bowl. It was not edible. Yesterday, I got the cauliflower flat bread. It was burned at the bottom with black ashes floating around in the container. I could tell that the person preparing the food was fully aware of this because this person tried to scrape off part of the burned black bottom but gave up half way through. Please do some quality control. Pure Fare's price point is not low and the customers should deserve edible food after they pay nearly $10 for to-go meal.
