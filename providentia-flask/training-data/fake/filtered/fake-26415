I've been to "Parc" about 7 times now. I prefer lunch and brunch there over dinner, but overall, the drinks and food are excellent. The croque madame is wonderful. The service is Starr quality, as usual, very good, and trained well with the cuisine. It was a little chilly inside during winter, and the sea bream was a little dry during one experience. It is fun to sit outside and watch the people in Rittenhouse Square. Not quite Paris, but close for the U.S.!
