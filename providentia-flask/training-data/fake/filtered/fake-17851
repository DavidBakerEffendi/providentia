We tried to eat here once before about a year ago.  My mother (76) couldn't handle the noise, so the experience wasn't so good for us.  Tonight we went back without her, knowing it would be noisy (doesn't bother me) but did not expect it to take 20+ minutes and my husband asking the hostess for a waitress to actually have someone show up at our table!  And then another 15-20 minutes just to get 2 beers and 3 soft drinks!  We debated leaving before the beverages came and should have.  The service never improved and we actually went directly to the bar to get a 2nd round of beer as I don't think the waitress was ever going to come back and ask us if we wanted another round.  The food delivery was extremely slow too!!  Won't be going back there ever!  Only good thing was I had a tasty hamburger (very unexpected in a fish restaurant) and it turns out my 'landlubber' food was the best thing served at our entire table!!
