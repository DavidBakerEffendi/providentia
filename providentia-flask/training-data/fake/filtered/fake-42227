A truly gourmet experience, in a casual beautiful restaurant.  Upscale, without being pricy. The strawberry and cinnamon encrusted baby back ribs were ta die for!! Whatever you do remember to leave room for the bacon doughnuts.  Traif is a hip casual fun neighborhood place that can stand its own ground in a gourmet culinary new york scene.
