If you like an open airy fresh vibe and seafood that matches the atmosphere, Luke's Lobster is second to none! Honestly, every time I've dined here the cuisine is remarkably fresh, big selection. The staff are true professionals and are very knowledgable in the wine and food. They are to be commended!
