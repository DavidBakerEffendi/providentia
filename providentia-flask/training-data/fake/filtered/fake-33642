I have been going to Jose Tejas since they opened and my wife and myself for the past 10 years. We visit every weekend for lunch and my wife always orders the same salad. Steak fajita salad with iceberg lettuce instead of field greens no tomato no onion and balsamic dressing. We went this Saturday and she ordered the same thing and a minute later the waitress came back saying they cant do the salad with iceberg lettuce. The manager came over and told me it was an "upper management decision " that they cant substitute iceberg for field greens any more because they could run out of iceberg lettuce at the end of the night !!!!!!!!!. Well Well Well an example of utter management genius displayed live right in front of my eyes !!! . With that said we departed and wont ever return. If a facility cant offer customer flexibility then one of 2 things must happen. Either acquire new managers or change the lettuce policy "if there is one" Greatly disappointed Â and wont be going back and have already told our many friends whom wont either.
