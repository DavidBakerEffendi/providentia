Dined at Zinc recently while at a Yale conference.  Really impressed.  Staff and decor most suitable for a romantic evening out.  Conveniently located (right across the street) from the Yale campus.  And, best of all, the food was delicious and innovative.   Their food is seasonal and the menu changes, but if you are there at the right time of year, be sure to try the farro risotto with scallops, pistachios and pancetta.  Mmmm :-)  The chef was even kind enough to share how it is made, which I really appreciated.  Go there, try and enjoy.
