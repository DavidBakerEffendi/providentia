Very cute little place for brunch. Their juices are wonderful, especially their flavored lemonades. The food is great too, but it's more of a place for good atmosphere for a family brunch. The bacon is sweet, and not what I was expecting and that deterred from my meal a little, but my daughter ordered the steak and she loved it. Make sure to make reservations for brunch!
