Not sure what to make of this place. The food was a little greasy but my friend said it was supposed to be. It was good. The decorations were sort of strange, Japanese baseball?? Food is definitely cheap and you get a good portion. Oh, yeah, we had to ask two kids who weren't even eating to get up and let us sit down... which is bad because there are only like 3 tables in there anyway.
