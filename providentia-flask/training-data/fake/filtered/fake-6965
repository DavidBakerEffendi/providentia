Eight of us went to dinner on Saturday night.  Never again.   The waitress asked how I would like my ribeye sliders.  I enjoy it rare to medium rare.  It came out well done and cold.  One of the manager/owners (to be debated) came over and told me the chef doesnt cook it that way.  Why ask how I want my steak.  It took us 2 hours to get our meals.  One of our party did not get her dinner until we were all done eating,   Then another manager/owner came over and started calling us "cheap" over and over again.  We didnt ask them to take it off the check.  He said he could not belive we were to "cheap" to pay for a meal we ordered.   I mentioned that the quesadilla didnt come out until after everyone we finished with their meals.   He leaned over the table and asked if we thought of asking someone about it.  We did ask 2 managers and the waitress.    Who runs a business like that.   Never again.   We have passed the word around not to patronize this restaurant.
