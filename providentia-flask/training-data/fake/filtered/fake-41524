Terrific place.  Went 2 times in 3 days, and each time was fun.  First time was after theater, sparkling and oysters.  2nd time, with 4 others, we had a bunch of appetizers, savarin cheese, charcuterie, terrine (great, creamy, delish), and a couple of salads.  Will definitely go back. Small place, but snazzy, and fun.
