If you want a romantic, quaint, Italian getaway where you are welcomed like you were family, Il Triangolo is where your next date night should be.  The food is so fresh and delicious and true, authentic Italian food. Everything is made on premises and the taste and quality greatly exceeds the moderate pricing.  One dish I would absolutely consider a must is the Vitelo Sorrentino. It is by far the best veal dish I have ever had. Check them out on Facebook and also, I would recommend a reservation be made as there is limited seating. TEN stars for Il Triangolo!!!
