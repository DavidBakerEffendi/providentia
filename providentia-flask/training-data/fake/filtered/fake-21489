I LOVE this place! I'm a vegetarian and sometimes it's hard to find good ,tasty ,healthy food,well i absolutely found it at "The Hummus & Pita Co"!! First of all the people that worked there are very nice and helpful ,they explained how the food is prepared and what the ingredients were.I chose the pita(which are baked there) and i had it filled with the most appetizing  ,grilled vegtables and flavored hummus,morroccan beans,beet salad and spanish eggplant...it was STUFFED:)) I also LOVED the sweet potato fries,they were so fresh and tasty..i can't wait to go back and try the Laffa:) The pricing  is excellent..good n CHEAP!!  and  the 1 train is on the corner( i take the 1 train ,but , the F is also there)On a scale of 1-10 i'm giving it a 10+ !!!
