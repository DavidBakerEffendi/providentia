I love Starlite Pizzeria, the pizza is fabulous and so is my favorite Pasta with Voka sauce (no not the alcohol). Their service is fantastic, it's not like 'WHEN WILL THE WAITER BE HERE!'. They also serve different kinds of bread when your seated. And they also have a bar that looks very well done.
