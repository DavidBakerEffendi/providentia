Extremely RUDE service. Waiter extremely rude, for absolutely no reason, Â when one of our party asked why specials were no longer posted on the board. If my friend had spoken with some attitude I might possibly understand but she is one of the most mild mannered and polite people I know. Spoke with manager and he was even more rude, constantly interrupting, waving us off and rolling his eyes. Completely ignored what we said, made no attempt to make the situation better. Total disrespect for the customer from an arrogant staff. If you enjoy being disrespected and treated like you are just lucky to be there so you should shut up, then go ahead and try Cookshop.
