My name is Tony Walker and I was very displeased with my most recent experience at the Newark NJ location located off Market St. I arrived at the restaurant on 5/20 at around 9:35 only to wait until about 9:43 for someone to take my order. I ordered the new BBQ burger box which to my knowledge came with fries. When I was given my food I checked my bag to see if my order was correct however I was missing the fries, so I kindly asked for them. The employee then went back to the guy who handed me my bag and made him aware and as he had given her the fries he stated "Tell him to get his gay ass out of the store" come to find out this ignorant individual just so happened to be the manger of this location. As a result to that I kindly asked for the phone number of the owner which he refused to give me at first. I proceeded to leave the store however I then realized that I didn't even want food from a place like this, so I kindly asked for my money back which I was given however the experience was still breathe taking. Here is my issue, as a homosexual I have to deal with discrimination on a daily bases however I expect that when I plan on spending my hard earned money at any location I receive the upmost respect. Its ignorant people like the manager Anthony at your location who are the reason why 10 year old homosexual children are hanging themselves in their backyards or cutting their wrist in their tubs. It bothers me that the main person who should be teaching his employee that discrimination at a business is unacceptable is the person discriminating and something needs to be done
