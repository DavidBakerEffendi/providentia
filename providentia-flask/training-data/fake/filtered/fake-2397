These guys make some of the best pizza in NYC by far.  Their fresh ingredients and home made sauce is to DIE for.  Their brick oven is part of why it's so darn good (regular ovens don't get hot enough to cook pizza to its full potential).  The staff is also very friendly.  Another great thing about this place is that they sell pizza by the slice as opposed to whole pies like some other brick/coal oven pizzerias.  Their Sicilian squares are probably the best I've had... yup, better than Spumoni Gardens in Bay Ridge!.  Their margherita slice is also top notch and my new favorite:  VODKA SAUCE PIZZA! Their rice balls are also delicious, not to mention ADDICTING.  Pretty much everything in this place rocks.  I've been going here at least once a week for the past two months and I love it.  Definitely worth going to when you're in the SoHo/Little Italy area!
