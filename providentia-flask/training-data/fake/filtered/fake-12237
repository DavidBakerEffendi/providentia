CO Jones was an awful experience!! The food was sub-par, im paying 10 dollars for a burrito, you think they could spare more than 2 bits of steak in it. The margaritas were good however, thank god, cause i got such a good buzz going, it made the awful food taste better. Im not from area and went with friends who have been there multiple times, and they are disapointed with it as well. They have new rules every time they go in there, one time they are getting charged gratuity, the next time they arent. One week they show up and all of a sudden cant wear a hat. The boss of this place must think he is running a 5 star restaurant in france, get out of here! The place is so small too, its like sitting in a pack of gum, except i think the food in the pack of gum would be better! Besides the margaritas, the only postive of the place was the waitress we had, she was very nice and prompt. If you enjoy getting buzzed and eating horrible food inside a pack of gum, go to CO Jones!!
