Honestly so glad to see a new place in New Haven that finally gets Mediterranean food right. Amazing high-quality food. It's newly opened, so the owners Khaled and his son Gassar have been working extremely hard to keep the prices as low as they are. Unbelievable value (unlimited topping bar, Huge portions, great taste) for what you're paying. The pita bread is a must-have - I learnt that they spent weeks trying to hunt down the perfect pita, and these ones are imported from New York. It's got the perfect balance of softness and chewiness, its warm and delicate, and definitely won't break, even with all the unlimited toppings inside! The baba ganoush is so rich and tasty, it goes perfectly with the super flavorful grilled chicken rice bowl. Surprisingly clean and comfortable. Definitely much better experience than some of the other fast food places around. The staff are impressively friendly and helpful. Plus the bright, open, sunlit space and fresh green walls makes it so welcoming, it really puts you in a better mood - which is so important when you're enjoying food! Â  The late hours on weekends are great too, making this place a perfect late-night pizza stop. They have really cool mediterranean-style pizzas with exciting toppings. Overall, love the food! Will be coming here very very regularly!
