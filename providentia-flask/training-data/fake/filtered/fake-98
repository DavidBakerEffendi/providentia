Cheesesteaks here are WAY too fat and greasy. You can tell there is not much effort put into the cheesesteak or the place itself. It is too flashy and it looks like a wannabe Las Vegas keychain with lights. The policy and kind of racist and I had better cheesesteaks in South Korea and the staff are rude, I don't blame them, I mean that's everyone in Philly.
