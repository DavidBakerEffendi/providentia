The atmosphere here is inviting and the servers are friendly which I think is what drew us in. We waited a really long time for food and drinks to come, but it wasn't that busy. 15 minutes for a soda? The burger wasn't seasoned...the first two ingredients when seasoning a dish are almost always salt and pepper, and this burger had neither. In a word, the meal was bland. A nicely decorated place but dinner was unremarkable.
