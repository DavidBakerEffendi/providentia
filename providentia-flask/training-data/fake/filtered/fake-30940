The food was very good.. the atmosphere was very nice! However, the service was TERRIBLE.  We got there and waited 40 minutes for our table (which was completely fine because they don't take reservations, not even for a party of 7).. When the hostess came up to us to let us know our table was ready, she was EXTREMELY RUDE and unfriendly.. right off the bat had a bad attitude and proceeded to tell us that we only had 2 hours to eat our meal and be done.  OKAY well yea it usually takes that long to eat with a party of 7 but you do not need to be rude about it.  Then our waitress was so unfriendly, looked absolutely miserable!  Did not come and check up on us ONCE the entire 2 HOURS we were there.  The food came out so fast, too fast!  We were still eating our appetizers and our meals came out.  I had to hold my salad in my hands and eat because there was no room on the table.  They kept taking our food away even though we weren't done with it.  It is a shame that the food/drinks were so good and the atmosphere was great and the SERVICE ABSOLUTELY SUCKED.  Mind you we had a $350 bill.  I would think they would treat us a little better.  But whatever, WILL NOT BE GOING HERE AGAIN!!!!!!
