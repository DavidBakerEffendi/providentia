I am not a person who generally writes a review. However, after my experience at the Munkey last night, I feel than it is necessary. I have not been able to stop thinking about the meal I enjoyed with a great friend I hadn't seen in ages. We arrived around 6 pm and grabbed 2 seats at the bar. Ben, the bartender helped us feel right at home. We ordered a couple of craft cocktails, and unwound with those before ordering any food. We happily looked around the place, checking out all of the small details that made the place comfortable and exotic at the same time. Then we ordered our apps... The okra (crispy heaven), the Paani Puri ( the flavor!!) was even better once I realized you just take it in one bite and you don't cut it with a fork and knife, and the Paneer Tikka ( layer, after layer of favors).  We enjoyed each and every bite. On to the main courses... My friend ordered the Saag Paneer and I got the Butter Chicken Tikka Masala. We shared these ( and neither of us could figure out a favorite). Great serving sizes--we both had to pull ourselves away, even though I could have devoured everything on each plate. Alas, we were both thrilled to have delicious lunches waiting for us midday today. I even took a chicken biryani to go for my husband, which he said was"excellent!"   My friend and I opted out of dessert this time around.. It will just give us an extra reason to go back. By the time we left around 10, the place was packed. Even though it was busy, we never felt rushed and it was quiet enough to catch up with an old friend without shouting at each other. The staff was helpful and kind-- you can definitely count on their recommendations for both cocktails and food. I'm already planning my next venture to the  Munkey-- I think it will be when my parents are in town in a couple weeks. A+++! I never knew Indian food could be so extraordinary.
