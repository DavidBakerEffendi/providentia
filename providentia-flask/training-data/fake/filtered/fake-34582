I was looking for something to try for lunch in Center City to break up the work day. Needed a break from Reading Terminal, the LOVE Park Food Trucks, & Mama Veg so I was looking for something different. Read the reviews of PCC and though it sounded interesting. I ordered the #10 spicy (Veg Chicken, Roast Onion & Pepper, Arugula) dosa and it was really good. Just the right amount of food and the Cilantro Chutney was good. My buddy got the #12 (Veg Chicken, Potato, Spinach) with Curry Chutney. His was even better. They also have a nice selection on Boylon's soda which is a plus. I had been to Northern India before but had never tried Southern Indian food. I would recommend this to others as a good alternative to the ordinary lunch.
