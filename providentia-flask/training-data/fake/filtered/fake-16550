Not worth your time and money. Find another place The food is the only reason I would be back. As I have had better, this place does a pretty good job on the food. On the other hand, this place gets a negative, minus sign from me for the service and lack of service. There is absolutely NO acknowledgement that you have entered this establishment. The people running the place could care LESS. You will wait at the counter WITHOUT a hello, hi, will be right with you etc. for a long time as workers talk among themselves. Once you order your food, you will find a seat and the food comes out fresh and hot, again; without any acknowledgement from the staff/server, the server presenting you the food just plops the food down and leaves. You feel like they are doing you a huge favor. The lack of respect, courtesy is unbearable. The only time anything is done with some, minor acceptance is when the owner is there. Hence the saying the mice will play when the cat is away. And the cherry on the top, you have to bus your own tables. Not worth your time and money. Find another place.
