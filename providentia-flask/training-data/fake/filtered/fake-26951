I'm not one to write reviews but I've been to Butcher Bar a few times now - Eaten in, taken out and bought the raw meat to cook myself - but I felt the need to share.   I've never felt so taken care of and appreciated as a customer at any other restaurant I've been to.   Even if the food wasn't superb (which it absolutely is...consistently so....) I'd keep coming back because it is just so apparent that the owner wants his customers to have a good time and leave satisfied.   That's the way to create a loyal customer base.  Thanks, Butcher Bar.  See you soon.
