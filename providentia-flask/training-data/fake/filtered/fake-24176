Unbelievable and definitely the best and most authentic deli around! I went there Sunday morning with a friend visiting Philadelphia and the staff were very pleasant, which always makes the experience better! I couldn't decide between the turkey, bacon and cheese breakfast sandwich and the potato pancakes. I think it was the owner who told me who could do one pancake instead of three so I could get both, then didn't even charge me for it! And to too it off when he brought the potato pancakes to us, he made one for my friend also! Definitely made from scratch and make when you order it! The sandwich was incredible. The portions are huge and worth every penny. My friend got a vegetable omelet which looked really good as well. Definitely not the healthiest choice but you know what you're getting yourself into! I would 100% recommend this deli over most in the market!
