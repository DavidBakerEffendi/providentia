The nutty new england mac is my favorite--apples cheddar & pecans--hmmm.  The triple decker reuben is next and it is decked!  This is my favorite little spot, and fills up fast so plan to go early or late.  Brunch is a can't miss too--the stuffed waffle, hungryman and sweet potato hash all vie for my attention!
