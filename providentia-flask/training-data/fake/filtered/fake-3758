While I was out for an adult  lunch with my better half,HapGoods reminded me of my childhood. Neighborhood kids stopping in the local deli for lunch with their friends. Waited on like we adults were I was even more impressed when the owner ran to the door to make sure the child that left their backpack behind retrieved it before they left the property.  And then the food came... What an amazing eggplant sandwich. Plenty of veggies on fresh bread and the best balsamic I've ever had! Our server was attentive and personable & I walked away full and wishing it were warmer outside so we could linger on their inviting deck.
