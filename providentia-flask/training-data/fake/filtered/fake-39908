From the start I knew something was up. The odor when you walk in almost made me and my family walk out. We decided to try it anyway. My parents enjoyed their meals... The chicken was dry and flavorless and the chili smelled like a wet dog. The only good thing was the beer apparently. Wouldn't come back. Oh yeah! Service was lackluster too.
