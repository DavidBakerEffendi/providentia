I am starting to wonder  if the negative reviews are from competitors. I've gotten take-out from Soho three times and found the food to be great. The Bruschetta Pizza is FANTASTIC!  My daughter and I almost ate the whole pie in one night. I've ordered the Chicken Blossom (chicken and roasted red peppers in balsamic sauce) twice and enjoyed it very much. Salad was fresh and LARGE. (No watery lettuce at all). Best part of their pizza is the crunchiness. I hate soft, doughy crust and even after sitting in the box for more than half an hour while I was driving around it still had some crunch left in it. After reheating a bit (in a skillet) it was absolutely perfect.
