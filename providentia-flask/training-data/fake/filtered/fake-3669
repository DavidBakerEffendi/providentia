This is a snappy joint with a lot of delicious eats. Don't go out much, but when its this good its easy to be enticed. Breads- were warm and tasted just baked Lentil Salad- this is a must and if its on the menu order it. The whole dish is a surprise in flavor and texture. Fried Oysters with a lovely dipping sauce- this is an optimal bar edible. Lightly fried but not at all greasy. Got something caller Shiner wine which was beautifully packaged and made by the owners. This is an excellent choice if they still have it. It was a limited edition. Service could have been faster as we needed to head to an after dinner event but if you are out for the night, lingering and taking int he cool space would be a great option.
