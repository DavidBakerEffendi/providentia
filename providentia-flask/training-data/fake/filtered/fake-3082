Amazing food. real tradtiaonal cuban style food.  guayaveras everywhere.  Estoy loco para pernil asado.  The music was great and upbeat.  The service was amazing.  The ambience was wonderful and the server knowledge was perfect.  they were super friendly and kinda sexy.  It was like I was in little Havana.  Totally want ot go all the time to this place.  One of my top ten places I enjoy that isn't hard to reach.
