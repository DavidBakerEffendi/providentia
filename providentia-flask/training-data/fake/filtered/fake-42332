I've ate a lot of dumplings in my life and just based on the food I gave this place 5 stars ... When I got here there was a line out to the street and with good reason . Best dumplings I've ever tasted and OMG they were so cheap and fast. 5 for a dollar or buy a frozen bag of 50 for $9 to take home with you . This little place is the dumpling capital of NYC. So awesome tasting we traveled across town again to get seconds cause now I'm craving them ! I would've never gone there if I wasn't reading through reviews for dumpling places ... Theirs are no lie ... Excellent dumplings !
