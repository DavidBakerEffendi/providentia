Something worth noting about supposedly difficult to get into New York City restaurants. Be well-dressed, walk in with a smile and a friendly greeting and say you would love to wait for a table; and at 7 o'clock on a beautiful Saturday night after you are halfway through a glass of wine at the bar a hostess appears and offers you a lovely quiet table. What's more, her comment - backed up by the floor manager - was that "you had such a lovely attitude about wanting to experience our restaurant we gave you the first cancellation." Others have commented on the outstanding food and service - personable, delicious, full of imagination - and the atmosphere is every bit as romantic and welcoming as noted. But as in everything New York it's so often the magic of the interchange between server and served that distinguishes the very best restaurants. To remember.
