If you want to try a good open culinary food market you shouldn't try Urbanspace in the 33rd street between Broadway and 6th avenue. It was the first time, so I was happy to go there. The first thing that surprised me was the diversified selection food you can choose.The staff looked very friendly and helpful. But I was quickly disappointed when I saw the price, 9 dollars for a small steak sandwich an a coke Its too expansive !! It was not enough because I still hungry after eaten. It's absolutely not a great value for your money. I definitely not recommend this place mainly if you are a student like me.
