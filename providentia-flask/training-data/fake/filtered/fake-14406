Lena's Deli is fantastic.  There is a reason all these reviews are so good.  The food and service is exceptional.  My husband is addicted to the cubano and the porchetta.  They make wonderful side dishes you will not find elsewhere.  I have been telling everyone I meet to go and check it out.  What a pleasure to find a place that has food you can really savor and is fresh. They have wonderful sides dishes and homemade soups.  Great side dishes  that  are so  delicious, healthy and so satisfying  that  I have them as my main meal. Especially,  if you  really must  resist their delicious breads (carb) . Watch out for the freshly made deserts,  All made fresh  on the premises. Fresh apple pie, hard to resist cookies and assorted breadpuddings.  Today I tried a  fresh strawberry stuffed with a cheese filling with walnuts...so good!.  Lena also makes fresh steamed asparagus then allowed to cool to room temperature then wrapped in a light sliced of cheese and roasted red pepper and drizzed with balsamic. It's a must to try. Please leave some for me!  They recently renovated the front of the deli with chairs, tables and umbrellas.  Great place. Welcome to Yardley, Lena
