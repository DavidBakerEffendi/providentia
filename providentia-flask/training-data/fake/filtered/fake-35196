Don't get me wrong: I am an ardent fan of Gaia's food. The sandwiches are absolutely delicious (try 'Bubi' or 'Elegante') as are the pastries (especially the chocolate filled croissants). The pasta is not for me but the fresh baked bread, Italian meat and cheeses are sent from heaven. The salads are great too and Gaia is one of a few places in town that is actually serious about serving freshly squeezed orange juice (no Tropicana added). Alas...were it not for Gaia's (the owner) temperament, I would go there again. The last three or four times I went I clashed with Gaia's bad mood and felt myself moving back in time. Remember when you were little and your parents would scold you for bad behavior? Only this time I had not come home too late or dropped one of my mother's favorite dishes. Instead, I had asked Gaia for some extra bread, walked in during lunch hour (a capital offense it seems) or 15 minutes before closing. I certainly understand that Gaia is busy. And if there is no extra bread or she's already in closing mood, a simple heads-up would suffice. However, being shouted at in a condescending and abrasive voice is not my thing. It puts me back into my ten-year old shoes, which I kicked off a long time ago - and purposefully so. In sum, the food is great (and underpriced). The service is slow and often in a state of confusion, which I can deal with. But Gaia's mood swings are too much. Maybe I come back when my parents are in town.
