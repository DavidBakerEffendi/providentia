My friend had hyped this place like no tomorrow and we finally ended up ordering take out today.  Let me tell you all the hype is well worth it.  I would say this is one of the freshest sushi I've had in Philly!  Every single thing we ordered especially the Phoenix Roll and Special Spicy Tuna Roll was like eating candy, teriyaki chicken is great as well.  5 for sushi  41/2 teriyaki aka hibachi.
