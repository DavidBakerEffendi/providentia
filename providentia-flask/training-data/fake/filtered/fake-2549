Wonderful little wine bar! This is a great first date place. The noise level isn't too bad, and it is a great alternative to the more noisy wine bar across the street. They have a good selection of wines and they staff are very helpful when pairing it with cheeses. A good pick for either a date, or a drink with a friend.
