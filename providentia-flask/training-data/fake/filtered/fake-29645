I wish I could have added another star!  The Food and atmosphere are AWESOME.  I ordered the chicken and waffles, and my mind was blown!  The waffles are absolutely AMAZING!!! They catch you off guard, they're so good.  You would figure the chicken would be the star, but the chicken and waffles are equally amazing! I cannot wait to go back!!!
