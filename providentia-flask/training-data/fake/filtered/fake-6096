I stopped into Obao expecting it to be the Ember Room, as it had been that last time I was here. After a little confusion, I was told that the restaurant went through a name change, and some alterations to the menu, but was still owned by the same people. Although the menu did not have all of the same items as it did before, our server was very accommodating and allowed us to order our usual Chicken Pad Thai that we loved from before. Fortunately, the quality did not change, and we loved it. We also tried the Sugar Cane Short Ribs as our appetizer and were also very pleased with them. Very cool atmosphere, and delicious food. Will definitely be back.
