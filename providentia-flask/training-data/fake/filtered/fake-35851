I can't believe that this restaurant got a favorable review by the Hudsonreporter on Wednesday 1/26/11.  When I held a surprise 50th birthday party here in 2005, I paid $50.00 a person for what was supposed to be surf and turf.  I made arrangements for the menu with the owner.  I was supposed to have table linens on the tables and he recommended "the Ballon Lady" for the decorations.  After I had paid and the party took place, not only were there no tablecloths, but the Ballon Lady put a couple of ballons on each table for which she charged $300.00.  The dinner was a joke.  Tiny lobster tails, a tiny bit of steak, 3 tater tots (no pasta as promised) and 2 stringy asparagus spears.  I was so embarrased. The owner was no where to be found so I couldn't complain to anyone.  I had to have everyone come back to my house and order pizzas because everyone was starving.  What a rip-off.  Calls to the owner were never returned because he and his wife were having difficulties.  My only satisfaction was telling friends not to have any events there and many listened.  If only some one had warned me.
