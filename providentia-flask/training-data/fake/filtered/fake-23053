Food was good, not great. What sets this place apart from so many in the city is the service. It is outstanding. They are attentive, friendly, and entertaining. It was a nice place to take my parents (out of towners). No embarrasing "how do you live with these disgusting people" glances from my mother, like I would have received at 90% of the other restaurants in the city.
