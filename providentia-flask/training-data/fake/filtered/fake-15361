Recently checked this place out on a Tuesday night. Loved the interior, good AC kept it nice and cool, wine was great but food... so-so. We had calamari followed by tilapia and rib-eye. It was just fair. Nothing special. I can't say that this place is worth the money. Ended up dropping $140 for a mediocre meal.
