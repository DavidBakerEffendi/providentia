Salad was terrible and expensive-don't mind paying a high price as long was what I am getting is worth it and this was NOT; I had to give it away to a homeless lady on the green.  To add insult to injury the staff was EXTREMELY rude.......EXTREMELY!  It's a no-go for me, will never go back; I made sure to warn my co-workers who said they usually steer clear of this place anyways--lesson learned.
