My husband, kids and I went there on 2/2/14.  We are chocoholics, so we were very excited about going there. This was our first and last time going there.  I wish I can give this place a negative rating,  because of Bad service and VERY BAD FOOD. 1.  When we arrived, there was just another patron there but we had to wait a while for a waiter (all the waiters were chatting in a corner). At one point I had to get up and get our waiter, and she barely checked on us. To be fair she was friendly and attentive the few times she stopped by. 2. When the food came, I took one bite of my food and felt nauseous right away because the food smelled funny..., which is unusual for me (not pregnant),  I took a second bite and almost throw up (had to step away from the table).  We called the waiter and she took my food away and offered something else, but at that point I did not want to eat anything else from there. My husband and I ordered the same thing (Cande's Killer Breakfast Skillet), but he ate it all (he did not detect the funny smell), but he throw up 10 minutes later and also got diarrhea. Now I know why " Killer Skillet" is part of the name. The kids food was fine (thank God), they ate mac & Cheese and chocolate pizza. The only positive was that we all liked the hot chocolate, but I will not recommend this place to anyone.
