This used to be one of the must go places I suggest to out of town friends for great food and chic but unpretentious ambiance. Apparently, none of those qualities is valuable to its owners. Beware coming here after hours as the restaurant devolves into a sorry impersonation of a private club. Bouncers and not-prada-but-nada managers sashay like Anna Wintour "filtering" who goes first and who stays out for an hour or so. When asked why, they rudely claim "no seats" are available" or that they "take people with reservations first", both of which are obvious lies as they let some girls walk in off the street. As if that weren't bad enough, they tell girls who ask how long the wait is to "show them what they're wearing" and twirl around so the in-house thugs can decide whether they cut the line or not. Â I have been--and still sometimes go--to list-only, exclusive clubs. But Cafeteria? Give me a break! Neither the smug door staff nor its supposed "management"--ill-fittingly wrapped in their Costco suits--could ever elevate Cafeteria's status to a "private club." It is the epitome of putting Duane Reade lipstick on a Chelsea pig. And while I understand people line up to get into "exclusive hot spots," it's simply pathetic of them to believe that people will do so at 2 in the morning for a piece of fried macaroni and cheese. Yes, i would have stayed an hour or even longer if the restaurant had a long line (like it used to). That would be fair. But to be constantly belittled while you wait and snubbed by staff not qualified enough to even run prison cafeteria is more than a bit unappetizing. The food simply isn't that good. Because in a proper dining place where the menu and service are truly amazing, there would be no need for these gimmicks. It is such a shame that a wonderful place that was known for its wholesome, heartwarming fare has now been turned into "the ultimate late night middle school cafeteria run by bullies."
