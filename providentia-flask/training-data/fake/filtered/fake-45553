This places is really great. Â You never really thing much of it when passing by on the street, but ... never judge a book by its cover, and this book ... is awesome! As everyone else has stated, the decor really does need a make over... and I have no problem with the menu on the wall, and I don't see why people have such a problem with that! Food is fantastic... but you can end up waiting a long time on those busy nights. Definitely a place that is a must try!
