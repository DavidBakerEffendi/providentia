Decent food but not very authentic. had a really good squid salad. my lady friend had a chicken enchilada Â that left something to be desired. place was too tiny for how many people try to fit in there; as a result we had to sit right near the door which was chilling after awhile. Guacamole, salsa and chips were top notch but expensive and they change for extra chips! barrio chino, get real!
