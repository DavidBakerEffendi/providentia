We stopped in for a quick beer.  I haven't been there in about 3 years, and the last experience was fine.  The bartender was initially attentive.  She gave us the beer list only to find that they have no prices on the list.  The only price indicated was for the beer of the month, an IPA.  We ordered two of them.  She came back with only one, saying the keg was kicked.  I asked if they are going to choose something different or the same.  She said that it is really busy and will not be able to change the keg any time soon, so I have to pick something else .  The bartender's tone made me feel as though I was troubling her for even asking.  I asked if she could come back after I review the list beer list again.  She never did come back.  It was during change of shift, so the next bartender did finally come over, even though that was about ten minutes later.  However, the previous bartender was still serving drinks at this time, and never came back.   We did order another round after that, but I will never come back and spend my money here, and they probably don't care.  Unfortunately, customer service seems to be a lost art.  She needs to take a course in customer service and how to make people feel welcome and not like they are inconveniencing them.  Also, post your beer prices.
