Amazing food, ambience and service. Staff very knowledgable about the menu and offered suggestions that were right on point. Food not your typical Chinese that you find everywhere, but seemed unique and authentic. Prices good for what you get-big portions and gourmet food. Ambience-low romantic lighting, not too loud but not quiet either, nice interior, diverse clientele.
