The Prices are cheap and the food is delicious BUT what I would've loved is if meat in th shawarma was a bit more lean. he taste is out of the world and i guess you can't have everything in life. So, a well deserved four star review could've been five if meat was more leaner. That will not stop me from going there every weekend the food is too delicious to miss.
