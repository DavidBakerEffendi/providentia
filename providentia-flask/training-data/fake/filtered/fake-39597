Great place for Italian food!  I love the marsala sauce and pasta here.  The chicken parmesan was so-so only, otherwise I would give this place a five!  It's a family style restaurant, so you can order a few dishes and share.  The dishes are huge!  We always order the calamari here also.  The desserts are excellent!
