Stopped in because of their Grand Opening a few weeks ago, and couldn't pass up the $1 / slice promotion...figured, "Hey, even if it's bad, it's still pizza..." Must say, t'was a good call.  Wound up getting slices fresh from the oven that were absolutely delicious.  Slices were firm, cheese wasn't burned, and the sauce was probably the best surprise. Oh, and the $1 promotion?  WRONG.  Turns out it's $1 all day, everyday.  Certainly going back again.
