I recently celebrated my birthday in this charming spot and I must say that it was one if the best experience i ever had.In a city where there's a myriad of places to choose from,I must say Bistro les amis is on my top list thanks to the tasty dishes they serve in a professional and friendly manner. Our server was very accomodating and knowledgeable so we ended up ordering according to her suggestions .I had the delicious beet salad with roasted walnuts followed by the outstanding seabass special I also had a taste of my friend's Cassoulet that melted in my mouth(I don't particularly like white beans) but I was pleasantly surprised. The music was great,everyone had a good time and left with a smile on their faces.Great service by waiters with personality not attitude,well I guess it is why this place is called les Amis..I can't wait to return with my husband and this time I'll make sure to order the cassoulet..
