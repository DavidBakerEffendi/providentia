This morning I ordered the "Healthalicious" sandwich and it was the best sandwich I've had in a long time! Everything was fresh- I cannot believe I devoured the whole thing! Their arugula/grilled chicken salad is also one of my favorites. Please stay in Maspeth guys and keep up the good work! #yumalicious !!! :-)
