very disappointed in this restaurant. My family came up from North Carolina and wanted to eat at your restaurant. there was a total of 58 . I was told that the Manager that was working on July 1 was extremely rude to them. there were no reservations which were made about 3 weeks ago and they were yelled at by her. Believe me I have never been here and don't plan on every going. How embarrassing ... No kind of hospitality at all. SMH
