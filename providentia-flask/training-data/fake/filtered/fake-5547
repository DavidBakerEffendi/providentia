It isn't very often that I will dive my face into a chicken, lick the bones, salivate while doing so, and shed a tear when the chicken is picked dry. But at Hu Kitchen, this behavior is what I exhibit each time I go. Their paleo-esque meals mixed with a sleek modern atmosphere is to die for. It can be a little pricy, but I am hesitating to demote their star ranking just for that alone. This is, after all, Manhattan, where it costs $20 just to fart in some parts of town. Must-haves include: rotisserie chicken, anything including cashew cream, Hu's chocolate bars, chia pudding, and turkey meatloaf. I hope this place continues to be successful as can be.
