Finally a Mexican restaurant in the area worth going to! My wife and I enjoy a wide variety of ethnic foods, but finding a good, reasonably priced, Mexican restaurant near Yardville has been a real struggle.  Our problem is solved. We had actually been hoping a Chipotle would open up in the area, but this place is actually better - let me tell you why: 1 - Fresh made tortillas right in front of your eyes - you CAN taste the difference 2 - The mixing of the ingredients before your burrito is folded - nothing is worse than taking a bite of your burrito and getting just rice and nothing else, here that will never happen 3 - The portions on the sides are not small - my wife loves guacamole and usually when she gets it on the side she has to get two because they fill this *tiny* little cup, but here, the side cup was large enough to satisfy her (that saves me a buck or two right there) 4 - The staff here was attentive, patient and helpful - since it was our first time, we had some questions.  Sure that meant my burrito took another 45 seconds to make, but I'll gladly wait 45 more seconds to get exactly what I want. Will definitely be back!
