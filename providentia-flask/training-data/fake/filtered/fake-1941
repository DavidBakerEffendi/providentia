Great pasta and a beautiful room. Its not cheap, but the food is really very good. The room is beautiful but its kind of loud. Our server was good. The only con for me was the wine list-it's all Italian, and I've never even heard of most of the varietals. Our server said that sometimes people ask for the "English" wine list!
