A good friend and I came here several weeks ago and I can't get over how amazing an experience it was. The space is beautiful, with the front windows that open to the street, the brick walls that are half covered, half exposed, and the modest but beautiful reclaimed wood furniture. It feels old-timey and warm with decorations and installations that might have been found objects or actually designed to be there. We checked out the back courtyard-- all brick, with enough space to throw a small party! We chilled at the center bar for several hours, had a few drinks and the following for dinner... -grilled radishes and feta -lamb croquettes -rice with yogurt and morels -chicken -lamb tartare We shared the dishes so we could taste them all! The chicken was super tender and delicious. Sara says they source all their food from local farmers, and that the menu will change with the seasons. It was fun watching folks come and go over the course of the night. Neighborhood families, date night, friends meeting up to chat and drink, foodie people seeking out the new place in town. I love it, and I wish Sara/Sara the best of luck!
