holy cow. I just found my go-to pizza place in philly. I moved back here about 6 months ago and have been searching.  How did it take me so long to find Santuccis??   their square red-top pizza is crazy insane good. I had it with sausage and green peppers. I'm doing that gesture right now where you kiss your fingers the way italians do. It was delivered in 15 minutes, by the way. Its about  5pm on a Thursday.
