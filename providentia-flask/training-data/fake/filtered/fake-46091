The food and service was excellent! A bit pricey with tight accommodations. Had an excellent evening UNTIL my daughters mentioned it was my birthday. Then we were surprised with a small dessert dish that we didnt ask for BUT EVEN MORE SURPRISINGLY WAS CHARGED AN ADDITIONAL $10.00 FOR!!! A LOW CLASS MOVE that left a bad impression on what otherwise would have been an extremely enjoyable experience
