My boyfriend and I had dinner here last night, the atmosphere is cute and cozy, with a different range of music playing in the background. The staff was super friendly, sweet and very inviting. We started with the empanadas as our appetizers. Then I had the Camarones Calipso and he had Pescao Guisado O Escabechado...the food is so good and fulling that we had to take doggy bags home. I will definitely recommend this restaurant and visit again.
