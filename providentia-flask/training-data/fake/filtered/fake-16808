I  made a lunch reservation for ABC kitchen and arrived a few minutes early.  I have no problem waiting since I was the one who was early.  I checked in with 1 of 3 hostesses and was told it would be a few more minutes.I waited and waited..then almost 30 minutes later I noticed they were seating people who arrived later than me, before me!  I expressed my frustration to one of the hostesses and FINALLY after standing in front of her did me and my guest get seated.I wouldn't go back since service was terrible.  My food was OKAY and the dessert was fantastic- salted carmel sundae.  But, I wouldn't go back just for  dessert because the restaurant is very disorganized.  As I was leaving I noticed the same frustrated looks on other people waiting.
