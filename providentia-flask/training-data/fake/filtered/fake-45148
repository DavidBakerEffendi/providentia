My husband and myself went to Lo Monaco's for dinner.  We ordered an appetizer, salads and entrées.  The appetizer was fine but my salad contained a very large dead moth.  We tried to discreetly to get our server's attention. Finally she came over and looked at me as if I had put the moth in the salad.  She took the salad into the kitchen, everyone in the kitchen came to the door to stare at me one at a time.  No apology or restitution was offered.  I spread the word about the service and the moth.  We will never return.
