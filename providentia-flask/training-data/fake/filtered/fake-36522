We had Easter reservations for 4:30 for about 12 of us.  We showed up on time and did not get seated for more than 20 minutes. Had to stand outside with a baby.  After we were seated and ordered (5 of us got the Rodizio) we waited until 6:07 when the food arrived.  My daughter did not even get her dinner.  When I questioned the waiter, the manager came out and said they were cooking it and she could take it home -no charge. (Mind you we were all done eating at this point)  When she got home, it was not anywhere near what she ordered.  The SERVICE was Terrible!  We have eaten there before, but never again.   We dropped some good change to wait an hour for food, sit in a noisey - crowded basement and not get out of there full, happy or satisfied.  They lost many good customers due to poor service and poor management.  Never Again!
