I am very confused on why Amalfi's would receive even one poor review! I try to frequent this restaurant as often as possible because it is always a pleasant experience. Â I have tried to order a different menu item every time and have not been disappointed once. The staff is very friendly and the bartenders make excellent cocktails. The owners of the restaurant are always in and seem very passionate about their business. I highly recommend Amalfi's to any one traveling through the Lawrenceville area.
