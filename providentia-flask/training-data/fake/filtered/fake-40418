I LOVE THIS PLACE: This is the hot spot for Thai food in NYC.  The decor is trendy, there is hot music playing while you eat, the service is friendly and the FOOD IS AMAZING.  The only real down side is that there always a wait to get a seat and its hard to get a waiter once you are seated.  But it's well worth it and you get your order in like 10 minutes.  It's Nice, I like.  but it's hard to find cause there is almost no sign on the restaurant, so you just follow the big line outside
