Awesome! Good selection of German and Austrian beers on tap and they're extremely fresh. The cheese platter, meat platter, goulash, and spargel with pork medallions wrapped in bacon are superb. I haven't gotten around to the rest of the menu yet, but I'm sure those dishes will be great too. Pretzels are good too. They have a great selection of liqueurs too, I suggest the Pine Cone or Walnut. The staff is extremely pleasant, the atmosphere is great, the restaurant and bathroom are clean, and they play great tunes. I won't even eat at the Heidelberg, Zum Schneider, or Rolf's anymore...Cafe Katja's got them beat by a mile and it isn't any more expensive than any of those places. If you want great German/Austrian dishes this is the place, hands down.
