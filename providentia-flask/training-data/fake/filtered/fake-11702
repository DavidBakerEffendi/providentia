This restaurant had given me a good impression, until the other night I ate there with my family.  The restaurant owner is monster.  He was speaking Mandarin (Chinese) to his worker and tell them to chop the old tuna and some of the leftover salmon to make spicy tuna/spicy salmon.  After I heard that I feel sick to the stomach.  I don't know what he mean by leftover, is it old fish or fish that people didn't finish eating.  Whatever it was it's not right and I will never, never, never recommend anyone there & never will even think about eating there again.
