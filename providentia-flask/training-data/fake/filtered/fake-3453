Although I have been here before for a mediocre meal, its with in a short walk from a friends apartment so I gave it another try. This time was a terrible experience. After reading the reviews and suggestions to call ahead to put our name in, we did so. Being told it was going to be 40 minutes, we walked down after 30 minutes and still had to wait another 45 minutes due to the hostess calling various names off of 3 very unorganized lists. There was also another man calling names from a list inside. We decided to leave and call in our order for pick up. Big mistake. Our food was terrible...breakfast sandwich's on untoasted rye bread, when ordered on a bagel and english muffin (both toasted) with one, pathetic piece of bacon on one and basically a half a sausage link on the other. The bacon blue cheese fritatta was not enjoyable at all, with a rubbery texture and way to many mustrooms. That will be my last trip to sabrinas..dispite the convenient distance from where we stay when we come downtown. Not worth the wait!
