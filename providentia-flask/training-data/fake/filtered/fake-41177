I love Totto Ramen! The only reason why I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because I would like to be able to order take out/delivery and be able to make reservations as well. It's a great place and I love going there, but I just hate having to wait for so long outside (especially in the heat/cold, it can get pretty miserable and crowded). The appetizers - specifically the avo tuna -- are amazing! I always order the miso ramen when I go and it's probably one of the best things I've ever discovered in NYC. This is definitely my favorite ramen shop to go to.
