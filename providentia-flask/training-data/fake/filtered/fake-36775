I was in Burlington for a business trip and this place was recommended to me by some of the locals. It's in a rather hidden area -- it's in what looks like a house on the fringes of downtown. The surroundings are unassuming but clean and attractive. The service was a bit slow, but the waitress was very helpful with suggestions and seemed knowledgeable about the menu. Since I was by myself, I brought a book, and so the wait didn't really matter to me too much. I started out with the fried Chinese oysters appetizer. They were delicious, but unfortunately I was there alone and simply couldn't handle the massive portion. For my main course, I had the lemon sesame shrimp and it was probably the best shrimp I've ever had. It had a nice crispy outside with just a hint of lemon to it, but the shrimp flavor still shined through. It was on a bed of some kind of noodles and a spinach-like side which was wonderful. I would definitely go back. Other items on the menu sounded wonderful and if I ever do happen to be back in Burlington, which isn't likely, I'm sure I'll try something new.
