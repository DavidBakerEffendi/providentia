Went there for brunch recently. Ordered the Sausage and Eggs because I was hungry and thought it sounded hearty; I was mistaken. 1 tiny sausage, 2 eggs and a tablespoon (no exaggeration) Â of potatoes cost 16 dollars. This is brunch, guys! Which means it is 2:00 in the afternoon and I haven't eaten yet: I am F***ING HUNGRY!
