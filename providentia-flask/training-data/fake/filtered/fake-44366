My girlfriend and I were shopping this past weekend in Blueback Square and stumbled upon Vinted Wine Bar and Kitchen and were we GLAD we did! From the moment we walked in and were greeted by an employee whose cheery demeanor carried on throughout our entire visit(she incidently was our server as well~ Tamara) and her vast knowledge of the menu made us want to order EVERY item on it...honestly we didn't miss much! and what we didnt try this visit we will try on our next when we come with friends this weekend! From the almost 70..SEVENTY glasses of wine that you can just have a sip of...half glass..full glass or bottle..to the outstanding food, not only in presentation but the explosions of FLAVOR... WOW. I am pretty confident we just found our new favorite place~ I was hesitant at first about there not being "full size entrees" but Tamara assured us we would not go away unsatisfied and she definitely knew what she was talking about...She recommended the Veal Cheek Saltimbocca...her favorite menu item, the "sexy" lobster roll(it WAS sexy)and the Red wine braised Short Ribs(on a bed of fresh corn polenta!!!)...and YUM just about sums it up...Garey(the manager) was fantastic...I dont think he stopped moving the entire time we were there...we commented how we saw him talk to every table in there and our server sang his praises saying she loves her job and its the people she works with and the amazing quality of the food that makes it not so much like a "job" but somewhere she gets to meet new people and serve a product that she is proud of...Vinted..YOU should be proud..of staff like Tamara and Garey..of the food that you put out into the world...of the incredible dining experience that you are offering to the people of Connecticut..I think you have found your niche. Job well done! We will DEF be back and have been telling EVERYONE we talk to about the "New HotSpot in BlueBack Square!" ~ Arthur and Betsy
