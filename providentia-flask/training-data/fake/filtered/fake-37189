Overall, the Midtown East location is not as good a dining experience as the Park Avenue South location. I've been to this location about 8 times in the past 6-7 years, and the staff, particularly the hostesses, aren't as professional or friendly. However, the food has been decent, particularly their smoked salmon, when it's been available.
