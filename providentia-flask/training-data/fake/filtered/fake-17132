HORRIBLE new restaurant in Cobble Hill! Bland outside and inside decor - Fake gastropub restaurant vibe with a pedestrian craft beer selection. Bad place for everything- a date, meeting friends, even a family dinner (I was there with my hubby and baby). ---------- A terrible addition to the neighborhood! Can't wait to never come back and try the chicken and waffles. ---------- I have been twice since the opening. The food was disgusting- the chicken and waffles were the worst in Brooklyn! Really annoying atmosphere, with live music! Â Great for watching sports-TV's are placed so that you can't see from anywhere. It is comfortable and boring bar. Can't wait to never go back. ---------- Seriously. This place is the worst. It really does feel like walking into the suburbs, but without the suburban prices. Quantity of beers means nothing when the quality is second tier. The food is bad and it is trying soooooo hard. Enough with the fake good reviews.
