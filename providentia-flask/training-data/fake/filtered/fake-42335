Taking into consideration price, quality of product and satisfaction with the experience... You are not going to find many, if any, better dumpling houses in NYC. WOW -- just wow. I love dumplings... steamed pork and chive ones specifically. It does not get any better. Seriously... I may sound repetitive, but this place is that good.
