I went back to bogota after a while I hadn't been there and must say the service is significantly improved. It wasn't bad a while ago but I was pleasantly surprised by the extreme kindness and courtesy of each person I interacted with. I mentioned I had a little intolerance to peanuts and the manager came out to ensure that my food would have not come in contact with nuts. Not to mention the food was sooo good. The ambience was delightful with christmas decorations of all kinds. Love Bogota thank you for being awesome
