Love love love!! Hit up EV for a delightful brunch!!! I love the open airy atmosphere and the whole vibe the place gives off. Minimalistic and sexy! I came in strictly for the drinks, but began drooling over my friends salad.. I gave in and ordered. Thank god I did.. Crisp, light, and tasty! The place deserves 5 stars, but I docked one due to a watery sangria
