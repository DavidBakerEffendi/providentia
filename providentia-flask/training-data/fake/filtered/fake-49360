We had a team dinner recently. Restaurant is very clean and ambience is very good. We ordered several items and each one of them exceeded our expectations(taste, quality, and quantity). They have a great menu covering both South and North Indian food. Â My favorites are Chicken 65, Chicken Biryani, Naan, and Mirchi Bajji. I plan to give a catering order for my daughter's birthday and will recommend to my friends and relatives.
