I wanted to like Jimmies...I really did. Jimmies looked like a great place to eat: a seafood restaurant positioned nicely on the beach with great views. What more could you want? Sadly, Jimmies left much to be desired - and here is why. 1). Interior - Could have used an update 30 years ago...absolutely ancient ancient. It's dark, and dank. 2). Food - I was thrilled when my order of fried clam strips came out because the portion was huge. However, a couple bites later I was thrilled no longer. Quality wise, it was not fresh. They seriously lacking in flavor. On top of that, they were way under-cooked. They coupled the tasteless clam strips with green tartar sauce. Yes - green. Not like relish green - like food coloring green. Why was it green? Was it actually tartar sauce? So many questions. A customer shouldn't feel like they are being pranked when the food comes out. I don't know if it's a little gimmick they do, but they should stop it. It's weird. 3). Prices - Though I don't have a lot of money, I don't mind splurging a bit for some good eats. Seafood is just one of those things you don't do cheaply. I was not thrilled when I saw the price of my clam strips. When the platter came out I figured that the size of the portion compensated for the price. However, given the quality, it was not a good deal. 4). Service - Our waitress took her own time attending to us and reeked of cigarettes. Certainly not a crime, but not what you want to smell when ordering food. She was generally distracted and unhelpful, despite the fact the restaurant was empty. I was so put off by my experience there, I have not returned. It's not that there was just one flaw, it was the culmination of them all that just don't make it worth it to eat here. The price is not worth the quality of food, the service, or the drab decor. Quality above quantity, my dear Jimmies.
