Love this place! I miss the south, and this place feels just like Atlanta. Loved the salad with real bacon bites, and the mac and cheese was really good too. My favorite part was our waitress, Lauren---she was so sweet and great with helping us pick out what to try! Very friendly and made us want to come back very soon. They have a great 'family' feel to the place already!
