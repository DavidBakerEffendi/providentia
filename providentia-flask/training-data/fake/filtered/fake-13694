Absolutely delicious!!! My favorite cuban restaurant in the city thus far. Went to celebrate my friends 21st birthday and received fantastic service. The atmosphere was the perfect spot for a celebration. Live music set the oarty scene while pitchers of mojitos and sangria promptly arrived. The food was carefully prepared and met every expectation I had read about the restaurant. Overall it as a great experience with a friendly staff!
