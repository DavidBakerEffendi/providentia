I was extremely disappointed.  I arrived around 5:15 and the chickens were not ready.  The chicken was small, rubbery and didn't have any flavor.  I love eating the skin off the chicken, but it was totally inedible. I've had better chicken from the grocery store.  It did not taste like free range/organic chicken.  The sides were just o.k..  Not sure if I'll be going back.  Hopefully, it was just a fluke.
