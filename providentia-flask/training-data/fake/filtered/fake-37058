Excellent! First of all: This is NOT a date place.  Unless your date likes small, non-descript restaurants with 14 seats, half at a counter, that is. If you're looking for absoutely delicious homemade noodles and dumplings for cheap cheap cheap, this is the place to go. My roomie Sarah and I went tonight, got seats right away, and had our food delivered to us in about 5 minutes. It's easy to get to, half a block from the F stop at E. Broadway.  She got the oxtail noodle soup and I got the fried pork noodle soup. We each got a soda and an order of boiled dumplings. Grand total: $17.50. Nice! Everything tasted great and it was fun to watch the staff make the noodles right in the dining room. There are many condiments on the tables, but I recommend the vinegar -- there's something about it that makes the noodles SING. Trust me: Go tomorrow.  Better yet, go tonight. Or right now. Who doesn't like late night Chinese?
