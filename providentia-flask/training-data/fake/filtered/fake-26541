The decor and ambiance are nice but the wait staff (on a Wednesday at 7pm) was slow.  The food was good but the portions were small considering the price.   What ruined what could've been a enjoyable experience was a penalty for sharing dishes (stated on the menu and enforced by the waitress).  We (five adults and 4 kids) were not planning on getting separate meals for all the kids.  Three of kids were below 7 years old and there's no way they would've eaten an entire entree and since many of the entrees were about $15 each, it didn't make sense to purchase separate entrees for each of them.   We ordered five entrees and 2 appetizers and the waitress informed us we had to order 2 more items (entrees or appetizers).  To paraphrase her "We seated nine people and all nine must order something."   Most restaurants would be flexible and waive this rule for parties with kids but not Mesob.  So we ordered 2 more appetizers for the kids.  Being forced to do this made us angry.  We considered leaving but since we drove out of our way for Ethiopian food, we decided to stay.  An adjacent table next to us left minutes after they sat down presumably b/c they had a child with them and I suspect they didn't like the rule. Definitely not recommended for kids.
