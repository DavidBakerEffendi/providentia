Genuinely the most rude and most frustrating experience I have ever had at a restaurant.   We had a reservation and we were sat 1 hr late with not a single apology.  We then were "greeted" by a yelling, condescending waitress who acted like she was doing us a favor by accommodating the vegetarians in our group.  We were frustrated that the group of 9 needed to order the exact same menu to get a tasting menu and when we asked to do two separate tasting menus we were given a large amount of attitude by the waitress... We were told we would have to "come to a decision" so we asked to speak to the manager.  He himself was equally as unapologetic and very confusing.  We ended up leaving and going to El Vez across the street.  TIP: go there instead!
