I eat a lot of Thai food so I know what's good, what's okay and what's neither. I can honestly say this is the best Thai I've ever had in NYC (and I've been here 8 years). Â The quality is outstanding and the dishes are delicious. The service is amazing, atmosphere is very cool and the prices are reasonable. Also has a lot of unique/innovative dishes in addition to traditional ones. It's like getting awesome homemade Thai food in super cool venue. Also has a nice bar area. Perfect for a date or with a big party. This gets 5-stars on food, service and ambience. I'll definitely be going back regularly!
