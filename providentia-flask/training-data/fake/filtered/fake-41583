I love Fish! Every time I go in all the servers are so great & sweet. I especially love Ali & Casper. They are the best!!!! So personable and funny. What's the deal with the owner though? Why is he so weird to the guests? I always feel like he must be stoned & has no idea how to run a restaurant. Hopefully when you go in he won't be there.
