Yum.  I often order delivery from here.  Their pad see yue with beef is fantastic... It's like crack but it's noodles and I'm addicted.  Also love the pad Thai, chicken satay, most salads, all curries, anything in the chili basil sauce.... Yum.  Only item on menu I remember being disappointed w is soup... Stay away from soup. Its cash only. I only order delivery.  They are always reasonably fast, and the portions are ginormous for the little bit of money this place costs.  Very affordable! My only major negative, and the one star off, is because it's often a BIG hassle to get through on the phone; the phone line will be busy and you'll have to keep calling and keep calling and keep calling until you can get through.  Sometimes, I'll get so annoyed, I'll just order from somewhere else where I can actually get through. Otherwise, highly recommend!
