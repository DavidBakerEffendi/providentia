We have been here several times over the years for special occasions.  On top the exceptional preparation and ingredients, its very consistent.  We've never had a mediocre meal or experience and the chef always stops by to catch up with us.  We usually split the aged rib-eye and share another entrée and salad. I am happy they've done well over the years and wish them continued success!
