Great servers, great food and great atmosphere! We went here on a Friday night at 6, and it was packed! The food is family style, and there is plenty of good to go around the table. The house salad was fantastic, with plenty of toppings mixed in and a great house dressing. Our food was hot and delicious, and we didn't have to wait very long for it to get to our table. We told the manager and the server we had a show that started at 8, and they both made a huge effort to ensure we got our food in a timely manner so we could take time to enjoy it and still make our show. The chicken and eggplant we had was delicious and cooked to perfection- not soggy or chewy at all...perfect. The sauce is amazing- I am Italian and grew up eating homemade Italian food and can say that this rivaled our food :) Our server was very attentive, but not in an overbearing way- he knew when to interject and when to silently serve. He made sure our drinks were always full, and we could not have asked for better service. If you are looking for a great restaurant in the Theater District, please go here! You will not be disappointed!
