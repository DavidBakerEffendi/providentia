I'm a west coast guy and I'm finding that food is different out in the east.  They substitute quality for quantity in many restaurants and this is one of them.  The egg roll was fantastic but the egg drop soup was neon yellow (red flag) and the shrimp with veggies was bland.  The table was really sticky too.
