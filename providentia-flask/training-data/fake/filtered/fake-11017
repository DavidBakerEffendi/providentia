It was highly recommended by a friend to check out this cozy little spot. So 3 friends and I braved the rain and made it here on a Friday night at 8:00pm. The food is yummy and so were the drinks. The sangria was strong and yummy but just note that it is not done the traditional way with red wine. 3 stars --Downside was that we kept getting rushed by the servers if we were done like every 5-10 mins ever since they saw that our plate was 50% done. I understand tables need to swish in & swish out given that it's a Friday night but it is still such a bummer when you look so forward to coming here to relax Â and enjoy a meal with your buddies and instead you get interrupted half the time during your meal.
