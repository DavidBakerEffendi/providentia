I came on my birthday during New Haven's restaurant week, but we decided to order off the regular menu.  I ordered the Karisik Turkish pizza while my friend ordered a babaganoush sandwich.  The pizza was delicious with beautifully seasoned lamb! Our waitress was a very quiet and friendly woman. The restaurant is nicely decorated, however it was pretty quiet, but it was a Monday during the day.  I look forward to returning to try some of their other offerings.
