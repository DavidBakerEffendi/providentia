All of the food was great. I will come here again and refer this restaurant to all my friends. The quail eggs were cooked perfectly as they melt in your mouth and are seasoned with just enough sea salt. They were a great accompanied with the chorizo and toast. It was the best mini breakfast in two bites. The food also looked too pretty to eat but were even tastier than they looked.
