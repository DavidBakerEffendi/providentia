The food served here is worth dying for (someone actually got stabbed for cutting the line). I usually get mixed platter for $6 with white sauce (THIS STUFF IS GODLY) and bbq sauce and sometimes just white sauce and a small amount of hot sauce (be sure to get drinks if you're going for this because it's extremely spicy). I usually come here at around 4-6, so the line is really short. It really annoys me to see long lines at the impostor stands. Look at for the yellow bags and shirts people!! The amount of food they give is extremely filling, so 1 platter can easily feed 2 people. I, however, can devour a platter not because I can eat a lot, but because it's just that good. Highly highly recommend this place.
