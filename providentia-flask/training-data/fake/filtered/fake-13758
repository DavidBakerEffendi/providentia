This restaurant has been inspected by the Bayonne Department of Health and forced to hose down their kitchen because it was so filthy! Their food is prepared in a shed out behind the restaurant. The smells coming from the place are not good. We ordered tacos from there once or twice and it took almost an hour. The food tasted burnt and gross.
