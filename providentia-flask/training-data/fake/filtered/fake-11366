This was one of the coolest places that I have been in in a really long time.  The market itself was awesome with so many things from imported fruits I have never seen to dry pastas from every region of Italy.  I only had the opportunity to try one of the restaurants in the market but it was exceptional.  Had a brick oven pizza with cherry tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella, basil and an incredible prosciutto.  The pricing of the location is not all that bad either.  Overall just a great experience in the location and I can't wait to go back.
