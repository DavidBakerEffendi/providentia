Went here once for a business meeting. It was a weekend so it was pretty crowded. I had heard of the place before but never gone so I was looking forward to some good soul food. Wasn't impressed. I suppose it all depends upon your palate but honestly I didn't find the place anything to write home about. The fried chicken wasn't better than what I make at home, the greens needed just a tad more seasoning and the peach cobbler was a little too mushy for my tastes. Recommend it for reheating after your taste buds have been watered down by liquor at the club all night, but not more.
