Don't let the location fool you.  Taste of Tuscany is a hidden gem located on the lower level of the Styertowne Shopping Center.  It's a small, comfortable, BYOB restaurant that offers great pizza (love the Grandma style), pasta and sandwiches.  The service is good and the wait staff is always friendly.  Definitely recommend!
