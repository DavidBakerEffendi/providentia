My friend and I went to Lombardi's Pizza given it's history and being this famous New York landmark.  What a disappointment!!  The pizza and appetizers are mediocre at best.  This pizzeria is living off past glories.  Do not bother.  You will find hundreds of other better and cheaper pizza places in New York City.
