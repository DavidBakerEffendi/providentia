What an experience! took my family here when they came to visit from long island. Great choices on the menu, authentic and delicious. The happy hour options are unbeatable for the area too. Johanna was the perfect server, explained everything with a great smile and made sure we had a wonderful time. Definitely a needed change of pace and somewhere I will be coming back to.
