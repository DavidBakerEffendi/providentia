Thumbs up!!! I recently had dinner at Prime 16 in Orange, and it couldn't have been better. There's something special about this place and the restaurant has a lot of energy. I thought the service was spot on, and I had the fortune of the manager stopping by my table to offer up a few suggestions off of their best in town beers list. He explained that they make everything from scratch each day and the quality of the food backed that up. I chose the Southern Tier Krampus Lager to start, followed it up with their knock out artichoke dip, and a mouth-watering custom burger. This will be my "go to" burger spot and I'm looking forward to working my way through their carefully chosen beer list.
