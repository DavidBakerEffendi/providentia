the guac and soft shell corn tacos are the real deal. I had the fish chiken and veggie versions and they were all great. They also hav cool drink selection, the cucumber lemonade sounded wierd but tasted dam good. this place is a cleaner more artisian form of mexican food. The staff is nice but prices are lil more expenaive then your typical mexican joint
