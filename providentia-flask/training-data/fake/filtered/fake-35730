Last week was our first time dinning at Cafe Triskell. It was amazing there was an older lady serving us. Me and my boyfriend loved it and we went back today. Today, The food was good but surprisingly the service was just awful. It was a different server, her name was Cindy and from the beginning she was rude. I understood that they were busy but we waited quite a bit. I raised my hand and said we are ready to order, which was fine. The problem started when I asked her a question. The brunch menu comes with coffee so I asked her "Does Ice coffee come with the brunch or is it just hot coffee?" She responded with a really annoyed tone "I've already told you that Ice coffee is Â three dollars." Which she did not tell me. She told us that they have "refreshing lemon aid and Ice tea for three dollars." I told her she did not mention the Iced coffee and she didn't even say sorry. Then she goes on and said it nice and s~low, enunciating every word for me "Lemon aid, Iced tea, and Iced coffees are three dollars ma'am." When the food came she didn't even bother to put it in front of me. When our food came it wasn't even busy maybe five tables. I wasn't going to be picky with that. But looking at how she was attentive to the other tables was what made me realized that we are getting really different treatment. She also didn't bring out our coffees until we asked a different server. After we finished our food we just waited for her as she passed by us five times (she couldn't have missed us because we were sitting in the large table closest to the cash register & kitchen.) I was really fed up so I complained to the chef/manager and she apologized. However, at the end of her apologetic talk she said "did you get that ma'am" I felt so embarrassed that I brought my friends here and I told them that food is great and so is the service. But Cindy proved me wrong. Only reason why I give two stars is the good food, the service was zero.
