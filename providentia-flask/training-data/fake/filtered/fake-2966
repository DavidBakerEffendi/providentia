Where shall I start...my boyfriend and I have been here a couple times before and have left beyond satisfied in the past. Tonight was just ridiculous to us. We waited about 30 minutes to be seated which is completely understandable for a Friday night. It is BYOB therefore we did (a bottle of wine), our server seemed to be offended by us having a personal bottle of hard lq and after that everything went downhill. The table next to us were seated after us and he proceeded to take their order before us. He stopped by their table to ask how everything was going, never once stopping by our table. He flew past our table a few times which is also understandable considering the huge crowd that takes over this restaurant almost every night. We finally get his attention to bring the check over and he does the math & just throws the check on the table. My boyfriend always whips out his phone to calculate 20% gratuity, but this guy didn't even deserve pocket change. Never in my life have I experienced such terrible service. Yeah the food is great but there are plenty other restaurants that provide the full package..great food AND great service.
