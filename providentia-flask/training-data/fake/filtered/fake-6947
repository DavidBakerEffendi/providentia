It doesn't deserve the 1 star but zero was not an option. First we ordered drinks and they arrived 1/2 later and only 1 of the 2 drinks were served.  Took another  20 minutes for the other drink be brought to table.  Now the food was even worse. They first brought the wrong dinner and after asking for the correct dinner to waitress. It was brought out after my husband finished his and it was still gross and not what the menu stated. The WORSE restaurant in N.J.  I will NEVER go back
