Ate there last night for the first time (recommended by our daughter), and it was spectacular.  The decor is woodsy, classy, and very comfortable.  The food was exceptional, sustainable local farms, fish from fresh water, non antibiotic filled meat. I am a vegatarian (my husband is not), and I am still thinking about the mixed green beet salad with a delectable dressing.  Our out of town daughter (who is vegan, but her husband is not)  and her husband always eat there when visiting CT, and now we know why first hand.
