We went to celebrate a friends birthday on Friday. We had a large party of 12 and it took over a hour to accommodate us. Since this place is small for large groups we had to be broken up in groups. They did accommodate us when 4 more people showed up.  We were spread out amongst 4 tables with our table being the biggest of 8. We had two waitresses one for our table and another for other three.  Quick observations were this place is more suited for couples 2 or more max. The other tables in our party received their food and drinks in decent amount of time. Ours on the other hand took a long time to receive drinks. When we did inquire about them they informed us to be patient they were out of glassware. It eventually took 30 min to receive 2 mixed drinks. Overall the food was good and they were nice size portions.  I would eat here again but only if I went out with a party of 4 or less.
