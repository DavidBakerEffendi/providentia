This place is a great place to go to if you a have a huge appetite because a lack a food is the last thing this place is known for. Â This place is full of culture and high energy. If your looking for a quiet, candle lit dinner this is not the place for you. I have been here 3 times and every time I have went the food and service was great. I love how their culture is not only seen in the food but also felt by the little things they do like sending out employees with drums and musical instruments to sing and dance. I would recommend this place not only because of the amazing food but also because the location (Monclair) is a great place to walk around before or after and get some shopping done.
