Only ever been here once but my Puerto Rican best friend lives in Newark and we came here to eat one time and their sancocho was to die for! Never really had pig feet the way they made it here but it was delightful! However it was a little crowded when we got there and the place is a little small but I mean I guess everyone just loves themselves some of this cafe! I recommend their sancocho to any first timer here!
