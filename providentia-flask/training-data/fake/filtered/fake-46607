I highly recommend this cafe if you want to find a place to go "where everyone knows your name." I've read a lot of reviews on yelp critiquing the service, portions, prices etc. etc. but I haven't been anywhere in New Haven where I've been treated more like family. I can honestly say as a parent and as someone who lives in an apartment, I have grown to rely on this place. Yeah it took a few times to get familiar with how things work and yeah it works a little differently depending on who's there but I linger with my daughter and have never been anything but welcomed for it. I've watched people have business meetings there, have family parties there and as a mom with a small child this is one of the most family friendly places in town. The bathroom is big enough for a stroller (and I have a stupid big stroller) and no one bats an eye if you need to breastfeed. I enjoy the food, the pastries are always fresh, great smoothies, great coffee, lovely comfortable patio, cocktails! Real food, real drink, real people, real community. The folks who work here take pride in their place, their food, their style. They've made it what THEY want it to be, what they hope to offer New Haven. It might not be for everyone but then again if you try and work for everyone you end up Starbucks.
