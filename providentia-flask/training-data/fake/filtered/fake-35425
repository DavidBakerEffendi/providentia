BEST ITALIAN FOOD! Chef Rocco and the staff are impeccable with their service. From the lovely ladies at the front to the kitchen is perfection. Grilled octopus and braised short ribs are a few of my favorite dishes. But theres over 30 specials so never get hooked on the menu. Love Trattoria Lincontro!
