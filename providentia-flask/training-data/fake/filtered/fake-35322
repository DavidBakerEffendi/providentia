Ask yourself: how good should food be if you have to stand on line for over an hour to eat it? That's the deal here. There were 34 people on line when we got there; it took over an hour to place our order. The problem is that there are no menus outside, so when people get to the counter they have no idea what they want. Everyone has to ask a dozen questions. It takes each person a long time to walk away with a tray of food. Maybe you have nothing better to do with your time than to wait in a line. I do.
