The bread alone is worth a visit to this lovely little restaurant. They serve real Turkish pide: subtly crispy crust, a soft, chewy center and just the right amount of sesame seeds. I was in a state of culinary heaven when I caught a smell of the freshly baked pide before I took the first bite of my sandwich.
