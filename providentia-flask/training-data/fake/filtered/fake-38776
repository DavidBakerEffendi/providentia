The best place for my breakfast and Brunch is Red Eye Cafe Â . I love their accurate spice in foods. My best ever salty dish is Chicken Potpie with delicious puff pastry. I mostly love to try their variety of pancakes and last time I tried sweet potato pancakes. Each and individual part of this cake was incredible. I use to eat pancake from here and try to make at the home. My mom likes my pancake but I couldn't get the exact taste of it.. Mostly my friends and me visit the same place for our breakfast or Brunch and recommend everyone to take one visit of this place and must try pancake's variety of this place. You'll love it. Thumbs Up Red Eye Cafe!!!!
