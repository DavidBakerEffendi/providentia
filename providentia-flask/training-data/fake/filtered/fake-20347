I'm not sure what others are referring to here about staff being rude- we went during very busy time on 11/2 and everyone was so nice! In fact, they had 2 people walking the floor assisting customers with custom orders and picking out Diwali gift packs. The operation was very organized, you could pick a number and wait to be served or you could self-serve and pick your own sweets!! This was our favorite part- Imagine walking into a sweets buffet. We took a box and a glove, and walked around to fill our own boxes. Super cool idea- the kids had a BLAST!! Sweets quality was AMAZING when we brought it home- so happy to eat Sukhadia Sweets on Diwali :)
