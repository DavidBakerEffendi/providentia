this restaurant is a wreck. they got shut down by the department of health today WHILE CUSTOMERS WERE EATING. the whole staff got sent home. its absolutely terrible. RED HOOK DOESN'T WANT THIS RESTAURANT, GO BACK TO WHERE YOU CAME FROM PLEASE. I'D GIVE IT ZERO STARS IF POSSIBLE. THE KITCHEN WAS FLOODED WITH DIRTY WATER, THIS PLACE IS A DUMP. THE FOOD MADE ME HAVE THE WORST STOMACH VIRUS IVE EVER FELT WHEN I GOT HOME.
