Really such a charming, cozy gem.  The family put up a fuss about stopping in because it didn't seem as down to earth as they ordinarily prefer, but we were in the area and were starving and I insisted on trying something different.  So glad we did.  Everyone really enjoyed their meals and the server explained some of the dishes that the kids weren't familiar with.  Everyone was very nice and patient with us, which can be hard to do with my kids!
