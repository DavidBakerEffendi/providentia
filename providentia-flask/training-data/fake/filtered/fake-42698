A sports bar is just what the upper valley needed. However the service is terrible. Waited an hour and a half for a pizza and salad, and an extra half hr just to get a box and our check on a Sunday afternoon. We also came to watch the patriots game, and had to ask three times for it to be on the tv. This place needs more servers, they doubled in size and added no employees. Need two bartenders and three+ servers especially on game day. Been here three times and will not come back until the service picks up.
