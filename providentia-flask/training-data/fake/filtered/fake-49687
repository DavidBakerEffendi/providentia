I hate having to do this as we went to this restaurant to celebrate our anniversary.  So we got dressed up and were excited for this special restaurant.  Sadly it did not live up to the expectation.  The grounds are beautiful and sitting outside overlooking the lake was a nice touch.  The service was ok not particularly attentive or timely given the nature of the restaurant; however, they were attentive to the surrounding tables. Maybe as we were on the younger side things were different.  That is something to look past if the food is dynamite.  Sadly it was not.  It was mediocre and left us feeling like our special celebration was just wah wah.  The following year we stayed home in order to avoid a repeat sad night.  (which goes to show how long it took to right this review!!)
