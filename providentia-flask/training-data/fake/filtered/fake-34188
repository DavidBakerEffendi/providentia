I finally went to sushi Yasuda for lunch before we plan a festive dinner in the near future and it was highly disappointing. Actually I have never had this terrible sushi for a long time even in NYC. It was worse than refrigerated take-out sushi. I know Monday is the worst day of the week for sushi and the prefix lunch would be much worse than omakase at the sushi counter, but the sushi restaurant with such a reputation should not serve that crappy sushi at that price. The decor is simple but clean; the service is swift and nice (They gave us numerous cups of tea without noticing it). But the most important thing: sushi was terrible, which I cannot believe they thought the customers would not complain about. It was unforgivably insulting to Japanese sushi connoisseurs. I ordered prefix sushi and my friends chirashi. Sushi rice was not cooked and seasoned well. It was al dente in a bad sense. It should not be soggy but it should not be too firm either. We even suspected they are using some old rice. And it was salty!! Â Seafood smelt fishy and tasted too soft and salty. I wanted to use soy sauce to erase the fishiness but I could not, because it is already too salty without soy sauce. Again, we suspected they are using old seafood and sprinkle some salt to fake freshness. My friends had chirashi and the waitress told us that they have soy sauce on it. It is a bad idea and we could not understand the reason why they did that. Soy sauce was even on the rice and nevertheless to say, chirashi was also too salty. We mentioned that to the waitress. She said she would escalated that, but there was no feedback from chefs. No explanation, no apology. They don't seem to care about the customer feedback. Maybe they stop making efforts because they already have a good reputation. But they will fail sooner or later, unless they change their attitude and improve the quality. I already started to spread the bad word about this place.
