I love this place for so many reasons. They are basically always open so its easy to get in unless you're trying to around peak times. The food is amazing, music is perfect, decor is adorable. This is my kind of place. Relaxed and refined all at once. I've had the skate a couple of times and recently a cauliflower salad that was just beautiful. Bottles range in price but they have a bunch of great ones that you don't have to break the bank to try.
