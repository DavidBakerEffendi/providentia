My girlfriend and I have been trying to get into this place for months, FINALLY we are in! We are a party of 6. We wait a friggin hour and a half at the bar. Margarita was ok, how can it go wrong. Finally we are seated. Â We are seated in the hottest corner of the place, with the sun blazing on us. The waiter was rude! I ask if the blinds can be drawn and he ignores us. So I shut them. I open a menu and there is a dead fly in it. I order a lemonade and there are black particles floating in it. My girlfriend has a shellfish allergy so all she could order is chicken or beef tacos! Per the waiter! Really? Food comes, it is spicy as heck! We are Puerto Rican and have no issue with spice, it was SPICY! My brother sent his swordfish tacos back because they were drowned in spice. The waiter was offended when he sent it back. He sent the manager over, who was shocked that the order was sent back. They tried to offer him something else but we were done. And no dessert? Don't let me bring up the dirty ass bathroom! If I can put no stars on this review I would have! Skip this damn place!
