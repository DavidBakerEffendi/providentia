My friend John Warner treated me to breakfast today at a kewl lil place called SKETCH. Great colors (I'm a sucker for decor). I ordered a Bacon, Egg & Amer. Chz on toasted Round Roll and John & I split home fries. It was just like home cooking - at such a cheap price. Filled me up and lasted thru the day. They have 'sketched' art pinned up all over the walls. You'll find precut sheets of paper and bins of crayons at your table... sketch a pix while you wait for yer food. Cute lil place in Fishtown around Girard & Columbia... btw: Thanks J Dub All Stars for the tasty breakfast!
