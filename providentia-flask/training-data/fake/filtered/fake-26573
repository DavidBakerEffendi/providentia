We have been to nearly all the Ethiopian restaurants in NJ and Mesob is by far the best.  My son can't get enough of the kik aletcha (a mild, yellow split pea dish ).  I always order the fasting platter (vegetarian platter) and must get the butch (a ground chickpea dish) it is served cold and is a wonderful contrast to all the warm wats (stews).  The injera is terrific and keeps on coming.   It is BYOB, which is no big deal, and has the best iced tea I have ever had! I am big one for ambiance, I have even gone back to restuarants with mediocre food just for the feel of the place.  I love the ambiance of Mesob- dimly lit with traditional Ethiopian garments and paintings on display.   We have not had any problems with the service and we tend to dine at a relaxed pace- as relaxed as you can get with a two and a half year old! Hands down, Mesob is worth it every time!
