I had dinner at Cafe Ghia, on what I learned was their opening night, last weekend and it was phenomenal. I can't believe it was opening night. The service was impeccable and it seemed like the menu was something that's been curated over time. The beer and wine selection was great. They had a few familiar choices, but I'm anxious to get back and try some of their beers that I've never heard of. On top of that, the prices were so reasonable that a second round was a no-brainer. The food was incredible. The homemade apple chutney was delicious and the cheeses they paired it with were great choices. That will a go to each time I'm there. I caught a glimpse of their brunch menu and I will undoubtedly go back for that. I highly recommend Cafe Ghia.
