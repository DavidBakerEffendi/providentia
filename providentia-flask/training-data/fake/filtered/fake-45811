It being Valentine's Day, I was surprised there was no wait, at all. Though busy and out of menus, we were accommodated with some quickly and received efficient and Â friendly service. As well, my butternut squash soup was perfect with a delicious blend of flavors! The kids' burgers were cooked as ordered and the ambiance was comfortable and casual. Hip music was playing while we enjoyed watching the Olympics. Great experience, overall!
