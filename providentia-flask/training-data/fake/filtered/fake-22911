Visiting a friend down the street, and remembered when this little cafe had another owner. Decided to stop in, and what a surprise! Greeted by an owner with a smile, and felt so welcomed.  They obviously love what they do. Ordered a few things on the menu with  suggestions from the waiter. Loved the hummus...very different, and so tasty... the ravioli delish!   The desserts...amazing.... Creative drinks.  Love the decor!
