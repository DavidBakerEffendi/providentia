A couple years ago, I rated this place five stars. Sadly, that's no longer the case. Since being bought a month ago, this place has gone from good to bad to awful. There is no music playing anymore, almost all specialty drinks are gone, the cafe (in a prime location in Center City) now closes at 7 pm, and the espresso is so bitter that I actually threw my mocha away tonight. Touting the politics of your new coffee is irrelevant when it tastes like swill. The last thing Center City needs is another cold, stark coffee house with a generic menu, bad hours, and even worse coffee.
