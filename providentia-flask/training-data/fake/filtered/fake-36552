I recently went there with some buddies of mine. I couldn't help but notice another review as I was surfing this website today and I must say that I entirely agree. They mentioned how they came to Percy Street and the meat was fatty...because I felt the same way during my dining experience there I feel obligated to back up the fellow reviewer. One of my buddies ordered the PST sandwich (pork belly) and I ordered 1/2 order of ribs. My friend was so disturbed by the "meat" that he insisted I try it. There was literally no meat in that sandwich, just plain greasy fat. My ribs were decent, I am a big meat/bbq fan so I can be a little picky...they were decent and that's about as much praise I'm willing to forfeit for the ribs. However, the quantity was not decent, I was left feeling very hungry and unsatisfied. The sides of beans and mac n cheese were decent as well. The main complaints are aimed towards the meat that Percy Street serves. I expected more from a bbq joint.
