All the scared tourists  go to Vanessas instead of Fu Zhou. I was first introduced to Vanessas. After having a cigarette outside I noticed Fu Zhou and saw a local eating dumplings that looked amazingly fresh and authentic. Holy Sheep Shite! are they good. $3 or $4 dollars for 12 large dumplings. Not only that, they serve them to you and clean up after you. Very nice of them. Once you try these dumplings you will never go to Vanessa's again - except for the pickled cucumbers. I go to Vanessas first and purchase an order of the cucumbers and avoid the dumplings - then bring the cucumbers to Fu Zhou and order dumplings there. I wish Fu Zhou would make the cucumbers. It would save me a trip. They know me now yet have always been very friendly. Yes!, It's decorated like a torture chamber - SO WHAT?. Many should learn not to judge a book by it's cover -  I used to be scared of the wonton soup here - looks like jellyfish in broth - but definitely the best wonton soup I ever had after a friend of mine ordered it.. Our local chinese restaurants,  in areas outside of chinatown,  should be ashamed - or maybe they feel we should be ashamed? - suckers!
