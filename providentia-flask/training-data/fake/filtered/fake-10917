Love love this place! The food is great! The reason im giving them one star is cause I was there about two Sundays ago with some friends. One of my friend she over heard the young lady saying something like "I will beat her up" I thought she was kidding but I kept looking at the girl giving her dirty looks out of no where. If you are going to have that attitude towards the people that walk in there maybe you shouldn't be working here. My friend felt very very uncomfortable so as soon as we got out dinner minutes later we asked our excellent waitress for the check :/ I'm not sure if I would bring my friends here in the future
