Tonight we held my parents 40th wedding anniversary celebration dinner at the Stone Terrace.  There is not a single thing I would have changed regarding our experience.  The room fit all 16 of us perfectly.  The staff was exceptional.  Our waitress Jenny was extremely accommodating, friendly (the kids loved her), and she showed much enthusiasm regarding the menu food choices.  The food was perfection from appetizers to the main course.  The seafood risotto, Joe's calamari, and portobello crab appetizers are not to be missed. Our main dishes from crab cakes, to NY strip steaks, to macadamia nut crusted grouper, stuffed shrimp and swordfish were all spot on, flavors were blended perfectly.  They allowed us to bring our own cake and cut and served it for us.  The bar kept the drinks coming all night.  I can't wait to have another reason to celebrate just to go back.
