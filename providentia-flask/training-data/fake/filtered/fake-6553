Not your typical Mexican food place, but in a good way. My wife and I recently moved to West Hartford and dropped in on a Tuesday night. The laid back atmosphere is great: you put up a card on your table when you need something or want to order more food or drinks, and otherwise you're left alone. So nice! We sampled three kinds of tacos and several of the small plates. Overall, the food was pretty good - only downside was the overcooked corn on the cob, which was sad because that's the thing we were most excited about. We opted for non-alcoholic drinks but the menu looked inviting and we will definitely be back.
