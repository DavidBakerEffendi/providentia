The food is delicious - I had a mozzarella appetizer that was incredible! I'm blanking on the name but know it had a balsamic demi-glaze. Â  My only negative would be the tight seating arrangement. My friend and I could have joined in on all of the conversations around us we were all so tightly packed.
