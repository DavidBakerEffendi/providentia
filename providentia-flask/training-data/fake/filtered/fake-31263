Owner responded (below) to my negative review on this place and is assuming I am a competitor.  I do not own any restaurant or bar.   I am just a street customer.  His judgement is pathetic, just like the food. __________________________________________________­___________ I'm sorry to say but this seems like a business sabotage. No customers advertise other businesses with a sole purpose to belittle another restaurant. Also, it is not mandatory for us to give anything complimentary.
