The ambiance is amazing, especially for this bereft neighborhood. But with a pitcher of the worst sangria I have ever had on nearly every table (literally, as well as 3 or 4 on the bar), it is hard not to wonder why people crowd into this place, waiting for a table (no reservations except large parties), only to have them ask you to leave as soon as you finish eating (which happened the last two times I went, although both times I spent over $200 on dinner for 2). I will not be back.
