My experience was different than the reviews here would have led me to expect.   Like Elements, down the street, this place is located in a difficult location, right on Rt. 206. Parking at the restaurant itself is nigh on impossible, at least during dining hours, but we found a spot around the corner and walked over.  In bad weather this will become mightly inconvenient, but the restaurant obviously can't improve the situation.   The renovation (which must have gone through a few owners along the way since it seems like it took three or four years!)  is top to bottom, but the decorating is sort of "so what" and a bit lifeless.  The bar is just not very comfortable, but they do have a liquor license.  Hallelujah!   The service seems not very adept, just yet, and given the prices we were not particularly impressed.  Our server was not terribly welcoming, was difficult to find at a few points during the meal, and didn't keep my water glass filled (and, I was thirsty too!). But our real issue was the menu, which is just not that fantastic.  I'm not much of a steak eater, but after failing to find something I wanted to order and to end my indecision that's where I finally went.  My wife was similarly unimpressed.  In our opinion, the menu needs work.   The restaurant is new enough that we intend to keep trying it a few more times, and I hope to update my rating for the better over time.  Since we live less than a mile away we would love to have the Peacock Inn be a wonderful place to go.  Perhaps we will even walk!
