It's always crowded, but you can get a seat for 2 still sometimes. The lamb chops and half chicken are the best I've tasted yet, especially the lamb which is very tender. The ambiance is nice, a little loud at times, but if you can get a reservation and have seats in the back, it's great for a small group or a date.
