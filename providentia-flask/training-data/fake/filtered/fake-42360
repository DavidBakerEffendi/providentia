Terrible experience at Saxon & Parole! I was not seated until almost 45 minutes after my reservation and then I tried to speak to the manager Maria and she completely brushed me off. How embarrassing, especially since I was on a first date. My server was extremely nice but the food was lackluster, just OK. You can tell that this place tries too hard to be different. Would NOT come back here again.
