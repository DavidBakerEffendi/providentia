My friend and I came here before about 2 years ago and we loved it so much we decided to come back; however, the experience wasn't as amazing as it had been the first time (the lobster special I had that night was amazing and fulfilling)! This time I ordered the market fish special. The waitress explained it was sea bass in their special leek soup with vegetables, potatoes and bacon pieces. Sounds great, right? And it was, but after I finished the entire entree I was still pretty hungry. The waitress's description was misleading. The entree came with two pieces of fish each half of the size of my palm in a broth-like sauce (NOT soup). There were about 5 pieces of bite sized potatoes and bacon all for $28 + tax. I would have been satisfied if it were an actual soup... Or if it at least came with at least half of a potato on the side or something to compliment the fish. Heather, the hostess that had seated us, brought me a side of mashed potatoes after I told her I was anything but satisfied. This helped :). Wow, they really did slap on 2 tiny pieces of fish on some sauce and called it an entree. Can you believe it?!
