BreakFAST? Not so much.  When you order 'fresh herbs' in an omelet what's your expectation?  Ours too: finely chopped greens sprinkled throughout the mixture.  Well, it appears that the 'chef' at Cafeteria has a different idea.  He believes that a stalk of basil dumped into the egg qualifies!  We have never seen anything like it: as my friend tugged at the first sign of green she hooked onto a four inch tree and pulled it out of the omelet like a marlin out of the sea.  Complete with six leaves and a stalk - it was shocking!  As if that weren't bad enough the Gruyere was so sparse and confined to one end of the omelet it looked like it was hiding from the giant basil!  Of course we had to wait for our plates as the pleasant enough server explained that it "takes 15 minutes for the steak to be well done." When I heard that I expected a six inch rib eye to appear.  Guess again: two, two inch medallions arrived some 20 minutes after we ordered.  But no worry: we passed the time watching the hoard of workers (including our server) clean and polish the entire place.  Needless to say neither one of us finished our plates (I even tried to choke down the dry, stale rye toast but couldn't).  Thanks for asking if we wanted to wrap up the remains but no.  My advice: avoid this place for breakfast unless of course you feel brave enough to do battle with a giant basil tree!
