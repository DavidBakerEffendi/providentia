Ever since Bob Koch, the owner of Koch's, passed away, the sandwich quality has unquestionably plummeted (especially, the cold cuts). Most of the sandwiches have become unnecessarily messy and pricy! The hot sandwiches are not grilled, which completely ruins the taste. And the wait-time has become inconveniently long (so beware)! "Meh. I've experienced better"
