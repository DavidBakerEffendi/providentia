My new favorite Chinatown restaurant!! Â Cheap and Delicious!! This place is pretty good compared to the usually shanghai spots that I've been to in city. Very clean, friendly service, feels like a new establishment, takes credit cards, picture menu helps too. The wait here is never long, the Soup Dumplings are juicy, and the Mock Duck, delicious. Overall, a nice restaurant with good food (both their soup dumplings and their dishes) plus service. If you're into Shanghai food you should try it.
