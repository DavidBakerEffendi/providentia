Incredible! I love this place. These are best croques that I've had in the city. However, I recommend going for lunch the evenings can get totally jammed! Everything I've eaten here has been superb and it truly feels like the places I go when I'm away in business in Paris. I am still waiting for them to get Picon to have with my beers! :-)
