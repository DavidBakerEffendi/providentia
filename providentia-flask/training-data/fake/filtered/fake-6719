As for the portions.. it is because this country is so used to gigantic plates and if the food is good enough, you wouldn't need such a big portion to enjoy the flavors. It's also tapas servings so you go for the great wine and atmosphere too. I also felt the service was a lot warmer than a lot of other restaurants in Fort Greene. I am reminded of my childhood in spain (before my family relocated to the Bronx).. and the easy going mood. thanks, olea, for the good times.
