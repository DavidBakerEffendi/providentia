The avo toast was delicious and the actual place looks cool and has lots of stuff like playing cards for table numbers which makes it stand out but unfortunately that's all it has. The hot chocolate and latte was nothing special and the food was ok but it's the service that let's this place down. The wait staff seem to be more interested in being cool rather than delivering excellent service. Our order was mucked up three times and in the end we just gave up. This place looks awesome and has a really cool vibe, just needs some work on the service.
