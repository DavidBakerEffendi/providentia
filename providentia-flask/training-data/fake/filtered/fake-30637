Sam Mazza                 My dad, sister and I recently visited Pizza Brain for lunch. Apparently, although new, my dad has been there several times. For lunch I had the Felix Huppert, my dad had the Kira Tierston, and my sister had the Jane. The Felix Huppert has fresh gruyere, mouth watering mozzarella, superbly caramelized onions and is finished off with fresh thyme and garlic. The Kira Tierston is full of mozzarella and smoked bacon, has a dash of brown sugar, delicious red onions and topped with oven roasted brussel sprouts. Last but not least, the Jane, it's a modern twist on a classic favorite. The Jane has mozzarella, aged provolone, grana padano and fresh basil. The service was like if you went into Starbucks, you go up order and wait for them to call out your name. I think it makes everything easier, and the staff there is very nice and relaxed.                    In ranges of affordability I think the pies are kinda pricey but the slices are a good price. Pies range anywhere from $15-$24. The slices range from $3-$4. What makes it so pricey is its gourmet ingredients.The atmosphere/decor is really cool. It's more of a hipster hangout spot that has an 80s/90s feel to it. there are vintage pizza pictures, old vhs tvs  and a mural in the back of the place, it's also a fun place for a family lunch.                      I would grade Pizza Brain 8/8 slices (aka a whole pizza). One thing I like about Pizza Brain is they use fresh ingredients, they make the pizza so much better. Another thing that makes this place great is the staff is really friendly,and just really chill about things. I think the slices are a good price but the pies are a little expensive, so I suggest going there for a slice instead of a whole pie. Also, the decor is amazing, it just gives the place a fun vibe to it.
