Not sure what all Â the fuss is about. This place is always too loud and too crowded. Won't seat your party until everyone arrives. Always a wait of at least an hour. Reservations not accepted. No dessert menu. Went there last night because a friend was visiting from Germany and she wanted to go there. A waiter broke some glasses; we ended up with glass in our food and all over us. No one even bothered to apologize until we told one of the managers what happened. He offered us a house salad as an apology. Pathetic. I can get better Tex-Mex at Chili's, the prices will be better, and the hosts won't be nearly as obnoxious! Edit 12-2-12... Just got a note from some whiny college brat that works there, didn't appreciate my review, and chose to call me names. Great going, Jose Tejas!! Just one more reason why I won't be going to this dump anymore.
