The guys who own the cart are young and sort of cute. They use a hoagie roll instead of a potato roll which has its ups and downs. A potato roll is one of man's greatest inventions while the hoagie roll certainly provides a heartier meal. However, the inside of my mouth is cut to hell from the roll. The hot dogs are not Hebrew National. I can tell because they are longer than the aforementioned brand of which I was raised on. Not thinking about "lips and buttholes" the tastes was buttery and smooth. I opted for the Coney Island selection with chili, shredded cheddar, hold the banana peppers. Unlike my initial claim to a friend, these aren't Â necessarily "Gourmet" ingredients but the options go beyond ketchup and mayo. Prices go up after 2. What a smart way to take advantage of the drunk post-bar crowd. My final verdict is that I will most likely only order from the hot dog guys when I am really drunk and wondering by, or really drunk and feel like shamelessly hitting on some guys in contained quarters.
