Excellent staff and presentation.  Kafe Neo has a very friendly and upscale casual atmosphere.  The menu is quite diverse and the portions are actually quite larger than one would expect.  They offer a variety of savory crapes, which I most certainly recommend.  The owner even came to our table to ask how everything was.  Will be returning.  Cheers.
