so i went here with my friends to celebrate my birthday and boy was i upset.. the food was horriblely spicy and to top that off i found hair in my main dish. Â the service was so slow that i was embarressed bringing my friends here..the restraunt was loud and annoying. drunk teens underage drinking and waitress flirting with customers. i guess the management should learn more about business before opening one. if u want my opinion do not go to yak restaurant you are just wasting time and money..
