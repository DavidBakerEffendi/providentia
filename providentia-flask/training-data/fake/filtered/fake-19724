My wife and I were displaced by Sandy and Â found temp housing almost right above Peaches. We have been going almost every night and I have made it through almost the complete menu and have loved it. The staff is so friendly and nice. The manager Milo always greets with a smile and a handshake. I will be coming back even when we finally get to go home to Long Beach
