Delicious!  They use nothing but fresh ingredients from the local farmer's market and have been for years (yes, "farm to table") Strangely, the menu descriptions almost undersell the product, which is always so much more amazing than it sounds on paper which is the best thing about Firebox.  The dish that sounds simple IS SIMPLE, but in no way BORING, but rather, "WOW" and the creative chef keeps creativity simple too as you try flavors and combinations you would not expect and not need a pocket Food Lovers Companion to understand.  The food is TASTY!   You can find some nice wines there as well, but the wine selection has dwindled over the years.  The bar is still cool, however.  The tap beer selection changes often and typically veers away from the pedestrian expectation.  Someone there loves beer and you can tell! What is underwhelming about the place however, is that they have lost steam over the years and it is never busy.  By that, I mean, empty.  The atmosphere is .....there is no atmosphere.  Stale.  The service is quite slow because they are staffed lightly, understandably so, as there is little business and the servers seem a bit bored.....  Once a hot spot, Firebox is not exactly on Fire anymore.  You can rack up a pretty good check - You'll be happy with your food for sure, hopefully the rest of your experience will follow suit.
