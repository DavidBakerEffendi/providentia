My boyfriend and I went here last night for our anniversary dinner.  First impression, it's on a great quiet block, a little off crowded 6th ave and I would have walked right by the place if my boyfriend wasn't with me.  I love "hidden places".  It's actually quite big when you get inside and I love the old rustic feel of the place.   We started off with sangria - yum.  I don't know WHY I ordered another glass eventually, because I was tossed after the first glass...needless to say they don't skimp on the alcohol in those.   For food, we took other yelpers' advice, forgot about saving calories, and ordered: -Fried Goat Cheese with Lavender infused honey - was definitely feeling the creamy contrast with the sweetness of the honey.  It was rich and tasted great. -Pulled Pork Empanadas with mint chutney - I could seriously eat this all day long for the rest of my life and die happy.  The chutney was spicy and delicious. -Lamb Meatballs - yummy, it wasn't something I couldn't find elsewhere but great nonetheless. -Bacon wrapped dates and olives - I love bacon wrapped dates, so you can't go wrong with that.  The bacon / olives combo I have never had before and wasn't in love with the salty / salty combo, but I mean, you could put bacon on anything and I'd love it. -Crispy Brussel Sprouts with Apples and Creme Fraiche - AWESOME. My boyfriend hatesss Brussel Sprouts, but actually ate more of this than I did. LOVED it!! For dessert we had chocolate cake, I don't remember the name, but it was your standard delicious cake :). All in all a great meal, great drinks, great vibe.  It's the perfect date place.  I'll be back!
