Awesome everything! The food is fresh and delicious. I had the blueberry pancakes with the pouched pears....OMG. The pancake batter is the chef's secret recipe! The next day.... Yes I went back...I had the fresh vegetable soup! Amazing! Â The staff is so friendly and the owners are awesome! They all are huge supporters of the military and veterans which is A++ in my book! Would totally recommend this family friendly atmosphere.
