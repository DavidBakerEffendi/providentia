I'm sad to write this review. I used to love this place but haven't been there in a year or more. Like others, I admired the charm of it. When I pulled up today, it just looked, well run-down from the outside. Undeterred, we continued inside. I think the staff is quite friendly, so that's not a problem...the food is. I ordered a bacon & swiss quiche and garden salad. The quiche was delicious. Enough so that I was willing to overlook it was cold in the middle. What I could NOT overlook was the size of it. It was the tiniest, saddest cut I've ever seen. Quiche contains just about the cheapest ingredients you can imagine. I don't see why they have to be so cheap with the serving. The garden salad remained largely untouched on my plate. For starts, it had cold, canned corn lumped on top, in all it's canny smelliness. It also had a ton of finely chopped carrots which were wet (I'm guessing corn can juice). I couldn't tell if there was actually any dressing on the salad. I usually squeeze a lemon slice and some olive oil on my salads, so I am content with v little dressing. But I think this salad was just wet- no dressing at all. My boyfriend got a "HAM" sandwich. It was on a sad, generic baguette. Highly disappointing for a French cafe. How can you have grocery-store esque baguettes? I had a slice of baguette served with my meal and felt the same way. Cold, plain, ...not worth eating. His sandwich was smeared with mustard. And that's it. Lettuce, tomato, etc, were apparently extra. So he got a baguette with some lunch meat thrown on. Kinda weak. As I began, I'm sad to write this review. I really used to love coming to this place, but I don't think we'll be returning again.
