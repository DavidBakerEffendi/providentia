White, gay male owner (of Song and National as well) accused me of not paying the bill.  My friend paid AGAIN to avoid drama.  The owner grabbed me by my arm, threatened to punch me in my face and continued to scream "cunt" and "dyke." He randomly mentioned his Black lover and daughter, as if to erase his racist, homophobic, or sexist comments and actions. Tons of witnesses. Waiting for police report. NEVER eat here again!
