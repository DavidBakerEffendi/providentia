Greek Lady used to be better, TODAY I received a lovely chicken ceaser salad accompanied with a BUG (still alive) and a slice of lovely GREEK HAIR!!! I've ordered from them in the past, their food is nothing to rave about but it is a lunch joint so don't expect high quality food, the chicken is probably a day old because its never fresh I've given them chance after chance only because there aren't THAT many choices in the University City area but today was the last dollar I give to this establishment. I actually would like to have given 3 stars at least if it wasn't for the horrible customer service I received when I called and explained about the creature invading my salad along with the hair salon in my lunch :/, the "manager" I don't know WHO she is but she got on the phone and did not even acknowledge the BEETLE I explained that was in my $9 salad she just said "HOW DO YOU WANT YOUR MONEY BACK"... Which was pretty "buggin" if you ask me. All in all, I'll never go here again and I wanted to warn my fellow U city community if you go please check your food.
