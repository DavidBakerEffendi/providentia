Would give 5-stars if not for the long wait. They do not take reservations. If you show up after 6:30 pm, expect to be seated at around 8 pm. What I love about this place - the dining experience is unpretentious. It''s refreshing to dine in a place that serves A+ food in an unpretentious atmosphere... The crispy pork belly dish is superb.
