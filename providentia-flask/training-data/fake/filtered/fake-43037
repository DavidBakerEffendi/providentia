I loved this place when I interned in 2010 at a near-by school. The staff are always super nice and welcoming, I do not speak spanish, nor do I look Latino, but they treated me like family. Their chicken stew is to DIE for, and I absolutely LOVE their Shrimp in sauce....it's soooooooo good. Â I also frequently ordered their homemade empanadas...YUMM I'm looking forward to going tomorrow for the first time in over a year and a half :) you wont be disappointed when you go! **Don't forget to Bring Cash though.**
