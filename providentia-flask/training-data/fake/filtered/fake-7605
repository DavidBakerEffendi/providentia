Great breakfast and good lunch/dinner. Servers are very friendly;  they will remember you and what you like after your first few visits. Food always comes out quickly. Some staff changes since last visit, which I don't like. Where is Laurie, their best server?! If you want breakfast on the weekends, be prepared. Place is packed. Wait is never long, however. Great coffee, btw. For dinner, I recommend grilled chicken tortellini.  Fantastic!
