Been going here for years for the best rolls around. My wife placed an order here last week and was trying to figure out what the name of the usual rolls we get Â while on the phone with the bakery. Ended up with the wrong rolls and asked to change to the correct rolls. By the look on the woman's face you would have thought I farted in her face, and then asked her to run a marathon! She said she had to go in the back to get the rolls. Not positive, but I'm pretty sure they were not the freshest rolls. Never had anything but great products and service with Sorrento. Not sure who she was but she needs a customer service lesson. Next time I'll just walk in and place an order at the counter
