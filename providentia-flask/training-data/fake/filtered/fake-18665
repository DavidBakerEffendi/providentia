Love this place, the best greek restaurant in NYC. There is a reason why this place always has a line, sometimes you have to wait over 1h but what can i say is worth it:) while you waiting they always give you complementary on the house choice of red, white wine:) The food is well seasoned and fresh, never had a bad meal.... if you decide to go there you must to try grill octopus and clams stuff with crabmeat. One more time my favorite seafood restaurant in NY!!!!
