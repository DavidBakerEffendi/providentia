Have been here several times now, and not a single dish has disappointed. Pulled Pork sandwich is wonderful. Tender meat and smoky bbq sauce all served on a bun that's shockingy perfect (who'd a guessed a bun could be so inspirising?). The lamb pastrami melts in your mouth; it's well seasoned and layered on top of a mild, delicious mustard aioli. The home-made sausage is also terrific - packed with earthy flavor and suprisingly light. Flank stank another winner...you truly can't go wrong. Oh and did I mention Brunch is treat?. One of the best additions to Smith Street
