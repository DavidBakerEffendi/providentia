Okay went in to grab a slice. Guy behind the counter was an older heavyset white guy. Let me stand at the counter almost 10 minutes before he asked if I needed anything. Ordered a slice and an order of garlic knots. He left the pizza in the oven too long and the bottom tasted burnt and hard. When he went to put the garlic knots in the aluminum foil, he added SO much grease that it literally leaked through 2 plastic plates, a paper bag, and onto my hand!! I had to go outside and pour the grease out. It was disgusting. The pizza wasn't even that great and the marinara sauce was very bland. No flavor or spices. I would probably skip this place in the future. Better service needed, and better ingredients needed!!!!
