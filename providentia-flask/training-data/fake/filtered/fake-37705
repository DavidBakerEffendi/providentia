I ate here for lunch with a fellow business partner, I must say... HOLY COW! The sushi was so fresh and delicious! The miso soup was terrific, and may I add free with the lunch special I purchased, and free tastes even better. I will Definitely be visiting here again the next time that I am in the area!
