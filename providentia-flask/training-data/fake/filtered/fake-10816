When I lived in University City, I used to visit Bobby's at least once a week. For the client base they must have to serve every day (drunken college students), their servers are generally friendly and the service is fast. They've never screwed up an order and have always been able to do a 'rare' burger JUST right. I miss this place after I moved!
