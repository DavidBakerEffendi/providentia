I'm not sure why this place isn't better known. The food is delicious, the prices are very reasonable, the owners are incredibly friendly, and it's BYO. There aren't really any Balkan places in Philly, so you get something a little different here. The owners, a lovely couple, suggested that we get the family style option--which is great for groups and gives you a well-rounded introduction to the cuisine. They then took charge and paraded an awesome and seemingly endless meat feast.  Try the meat stew, which is quite tasty. We went with a big group of people after graduation with no reservation and didn't have to wait.  Most comparably good Philly restaurants make you reserve a table days in advance or squeeze you in at an awkward dining time. All in all, the place was good enough to actually make me sign up for a Yelp account just so I could post this review.
