The only thing better than Cafe Habana is Cafe Habana outdoors, in Brooklyn! Its a great public space with fenced in picnic tables, an old stationary taco truck where you pick up your food orders, open air toilets Â  that channel summer camp, and a very cool, very Brooklyn crowd. The corn is the same as the Habana in Nolita, thank god. The rest of the menu is a little different. The food line can get long, even on sunny weekdays, but luckily the line for beers or frozen machine made drinks is much shorter. The movies are very cool too, they project the image about 25 feet up on the brownstone next door.... like I said, very Brooklyn.
