Red Onion is an unpretentious cafe tucked within the confines of larger, fancier joints on Church Street. If you're looking for upscale, try someplace else. If you're looking for a low-key place to grab some hearty soup, a thick slice of homemade bread, some pretty decent sandwiches, or a giant cookie then I'd give this place a shot. The prices are comparable to others on Church Street, and perhaps cheaper. I can't comment on the coffee because I usually grab that elsewhere, like Muddy Waters or Uncommon Grounds. Not for any particular reason, it's just that Red Onion serves its purpose as my soup/bread/sandwich/giant cookie place and the others my coffee joints. They also have some outdoor seating, and (the last time I checked) there's a $10 minimum on credit card purchases.
