Food is awesome!  They offer veggie sausage as a breakfast meat and Quorn instead of chicken on request in their chicken sandwiches!  (I am not a vegetarian, btw.)  The fireplace is so cozy!  The bottomless coffee is fantastic!  I love that you can buy all sorts of cool beers by the bottle, pay for it at the counter while you wait for your food, and then bring it over to eat with your lunch!  Seriously: the food is awesome!! The service is usually pretty awesome too.  Servers are friendly, although I've had at least one experience where the server seemed too busy to check on us, and I waited far too long for coffee refills on a hangover recovery brunch.  All in all, though, not bad. And don't be deterred by the wait.  Both times I went on a Sunday for brunch it was crowded and they told us it would be a 30 minute wait (still not bad for the brunch capital of Philly).   But both times, we were seated within 5-10 minutes.
