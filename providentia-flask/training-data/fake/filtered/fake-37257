The ambiance is good for adults and quiet groups,or if it is your first experience with Peruvian food. Latin people will be disappointed of it though, waiters do not speak spanish, the female owner is.... not friendly (to keep it PG) she was having a fit because the baby in our party cried for 2 minutes and apparently the Latin table (us) was being too loud at her (I guess) trendy restaurant, she could not wait to close the door behind us. You can find better Peruvian food at a better price else where.
