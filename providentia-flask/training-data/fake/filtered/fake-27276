one of the best brunch spots in williamsburg, for sure.  i went on a saturday morning afternoon and didn't have to wait too long for a table.   i got the veggie egg white omelet with goat cheese .... to die for!  but honestly, the best part of our meal with the bloody mary with two jumbo shrimp and a pickled green bean.
