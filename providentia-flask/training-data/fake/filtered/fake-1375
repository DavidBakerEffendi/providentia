Tried to convince my girlfriend that Palermo's had better pizza than piccolos down the street. After months of talking up the tomato pie that palermos has we finally decided to get one. The pizza was barely warm, dried out and tasted like it had been siiting out for a few hours. Normally i love their tomato pie but tonight they let me down and it breaks my heart. It will take much convincing to get my girlfreind to try it again but I am not sure that i want to anymore. : (
