We just had the New Year's Eve dinner from hell at Catahoula.   We had a pretty good experience there about a month ago.  The server was very competent, and the food arrived promptly.  We received beignets when we first sat down.  Tonight, we planned an early dinner there so we could make the 6:00 PM fireworks.  We arrived there shortly before 5:00 PM and saw no food whatsoever until 5:45 PM.  No beignets this time.  This is a pretty tiny place, so there were not many diners there.  My husband ordered a catfish po'boy and received a shrimp po'boy.  He did not complain, as he was starved.  I ordered the fried green tomatoes and a $10 romaine salad.  The salad was pretty pitiful and had hardly any croutons.  The tomatoes were not green; they were red.  I had the same meal at my last visit, and the quality of food was much better.  I'm not sure what happened.  I'm wondering if there was a change in chefs.  My husband had called earlier in the day to make sure that the regular menu was available, as we were not interested in a New Year's package.  The person who answered the phone assured him that both menus would be available.  We ordered off the regular menu, however 15 minutes later, another couple was told that the regular menu was  no longer available.  They walked out.  My husband and I were lucky, as we arrived before the menu change, however this was not explained to my husband when he called.  My husband has a greater love of fireworks than I, so he ended up scarfing down his food, paying the bill, and leaving to check out the fireworks while I finished my meal.  I will not go here again.
