Low fi Red Hook Hipster Haunt Have you ever been to a place were everything seems to happen without a word ever been spoken? When my party and I arrived there was a quiet look from our hairy hipster waiter who in Jesus like fashion held out a hand suggesting our table. My party was in the mood for burgers and beer however the menu was limited.   Not knowing what to order they all settled for some broccoli side dish and King Bee cocktails. I had a simple but delicious fish stew and a hearty oatmeal beer.  Some how all my party's grumblings about filling their stomachs with comfort food disappeared with one sip of their cocktails and one bite of the broccoli. There are some unique choices on the menu and the portions are moderate but everything is surprisingly tasty in this low fi relaxed neighborhood haunt.
