Very nice atmosphere, food is fresh.  bathroom is very clean!  price is very resonable.  I like to eat there.  have to say their hostess is very pro, because i always go there with my friends and sometimes there are many kids in there, and without us mentioning , she always sit us away from the screaming kid!  I like that!
