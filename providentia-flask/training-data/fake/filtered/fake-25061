Ate here over 4th of July weekend. One family member had the salad bar which was nothing special. Another member had the nachos with grilled chicken, this was filling and a good choice. My wife and I had the Chicken Pot Pie, which had the potential to be very good, but was in fact disappointing. WHERES THE CHICKEN!  The crust was baked crispy and well done. The pie was loaded with potatoes and carrots. I had 4 tiny pieces of chicken my wife had 6.  We had to hunt for it.  I am a big fan of Chicken Pot Pie this one was severely lacking in chicken. I would probably not give this place a second chance.
