After hearing great reviews, I ate here for the first time. My expectations were high and the food was very good, however, we were seated upstairs and the ambiance was subpar. Lack of music, stark walls, and you could overhear everyone elses conversations. I would have preferred to sit downstairs if given a choice. I had a veal dish and it was amazing.
