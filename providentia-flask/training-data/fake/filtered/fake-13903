Not sure if its the bad economy or the hostess was just having a bad day....Iused to  order a few times a month - a frequent client. Yesterday,  I called her from NJ Tpk and ordered a Biryani ( which I think is overpriced to begin with) and within 10 minutes called her back to cancel the order as there was a possibility of getting stuck in traffic.... she started telling me that the biryani is cooked and now it will have to go to waste and I should not be ordering from the highway in future.... Guess what grumpy lady - I won't be ordering in future- PERIOD I am sure this place will close soon- if they continue to treat their regulars like this
