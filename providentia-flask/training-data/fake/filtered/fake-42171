Ordered the chefs special pre fixed meal which consisted of 10 tapa dishes and 2 deserts for $50 pp before tip and tax . The dishes are all for sharing. Only 2-3 bites per person per dish. So the dishes were quite small. Since it was a holiday they had the special holiday menu which had a Chinese twist. And I think that's where it threw me off. Yes the food was amazing .. But it really wasn't worth that price . Â Bill came out to be about $70 pp after tip and tax .. And yes it was good... But with Chinese food , you can get amazingggggg Chinese food for a fraction of the price. For example.. One of the dishes were gyozas, walnut chicken, sweet and sour soup . So... Those dishes didn't wow us. But their other dishes were really good.. Like their pork belly, short rib, sashimi over peanut soba noodle. As for their drink menu, the cocktails and beers are not your typical drinks. They are very different. We got the 'rude pig' cocktail and 'pumpkin maitai' but they tasted kinda weird. The rude pig was very smoky with salt and bacon bits on the rim. The pumpkin maitai had a gingery taste.
