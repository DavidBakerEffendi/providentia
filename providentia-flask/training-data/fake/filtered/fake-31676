Just what the neighborhood needed.  Fantastic food at reasonable prices.  The staff was friendly and extremely helpful.  The atmosophere is trendy but still really cozy.  Had the Junk Salad first time and it was fresh and delicious, second time back I went with the Gnocchi Lasagna which could very well be their signature dish as far as I am concerned.  Portions were pertfect.  Overall a great experience and a welcome addition to the area. Can't wait to try everything The QUICK FIXX has to offer!!!
