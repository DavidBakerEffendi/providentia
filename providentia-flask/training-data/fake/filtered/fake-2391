Fav place in the city. Awesome burgers, pastas and salads - bronte and roasted veggie are my fav. Their sangria is sooo yummy I have no problems finishing a carafe with a friend. Their banana bread with passion fruit spread is TDF. The only downside is their cash only policy but I keep coming because the food is just so damn good.
