Friends have raved about this place so much so I figured I would give it a go on a lazy Saturday. Its easy to find so that's a big plus. The wait was okay and the line moved really quickly. I think I was expecting to have a "it's so good I want to lick my fingers' moment but I didn't. The portion sizes were reasonable, the meat is tender and the staff is friendly. I liked the ginger beer and sweet potato- the cinnamon was the perfect touch. I feel like I have had better BBQ at this other joint in Harlem which has the best corn bread ever. Its worth trying out and hey it may give you the finger licking moment but for me it just didn't.
