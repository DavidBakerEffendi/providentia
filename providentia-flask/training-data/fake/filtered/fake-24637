If you suffer from a major salt deficiency and  you're having a medical emergency this is the place for you! For about $100 Bucks you'll get the same amount of nutrition and enjoyment as you would from a  piece of rock salt available from any fine equine feed store for $2 bucks. We ordered two entree's, a salad and a side dish. Presumably there was a little food mixed in with the salt, but if so, it was so well disguised by the salt (and sugar) that it was impossible to discern what exactly it might have been. Luckily they ply their patrons with overpriced liquor, so most of them probably attribute the stomache aches and blinding morning-after headaches to hangovers instead of the additives. This joint is yet another attempt at trendiness in the the most tragically unhip little town in America. It takes a lot more than simply snapping pictures of the interiors of restaurants in Los Angeles or New York, then replicating them with similar sounding names, in the hopes that customers in 'the provinces' won't notice the lousy food. Far and away the worst dining experience we have had in this town - quite an achievement! There's more honor in mugging people than taking money off them by hawking  this sort of junk - at any price.
