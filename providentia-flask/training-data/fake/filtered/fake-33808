I've been to Flatbreads about 4-5 times in the last few months.  Each time the pizza and salads have been quite good.  I'm a big fan of the Medicine Wheel and the Cheese and Herb and the Revolution salad.  The gluten free crust is surprisingly good - it does however take 20 minutes to cook, so order it straight away.  The servers have all been great so far.   The only downside to this place is the location.  It's great for groups, one of the most affordable places in Tribeca, and simply delicious.
