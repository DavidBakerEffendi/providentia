My friends and i decided for a mini trip to Burlington from the other side of Lake Champlain one week. Naturally we Yelped for some food. My friend LOVES crepes so the second we knew this place existed it was a must. Sorry other cute cafes. We came here on a Wednesday at around 11-12pm. Super busy! It was raining outside and I guess that drove all the people here. Came back Saturday around the same time and it was pretty empty, on a nice day. Who knew? Food was simple to good, depending on what you ordered. I ordered Nutella crepes the first time- small but filling. My friend ordered the apple-y ones and she was stuffed. Second type I got the honey-sugar crepe and it was pretty basic, but I guess that's my bad! Best part of this place is sometimes on Church Street there will be a little portable stand that will make them there. They're a little more expensive, but then you don't have to go down by the waterfront and deal with the annoying metered parking.
