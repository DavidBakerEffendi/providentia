seriously, i wouldn't even venture to this area if it was not for my friend's strong recommendation. it took me 10 minutes to find this place because my friend didn't know the address nor the name of the restaurant. Eventually i came to a tiny hole-in-the-wall enclave with lots of posters of magazine/zagat reviews, as my friend has described to me. but what awaits me was one of the many hidden gems in chinatown: great broth, great beef, great, springy noodles and not to mention, GREAT PRICE. like the Â magazine review on their wall says, this is truly the best 4.75 you'll ever spend in your whole life. if you're seriously tight on your budget, do give this restaurant a try. moral of the story is, cheap food does not equate with bad quality, chinatown for the win
