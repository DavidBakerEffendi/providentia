Had a dinner date here during the week - early evening.  My date was rather late, but we were graciously seated when she arrived.  I was so into her that I can't even remember what we ate (I think she had steak frites and I had trout) - the tables are a bit close together so conversation couldn't be too intimate, but overall, I liked the atmosphere and food.
