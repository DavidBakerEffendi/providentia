I know there are many burger places in Brooklyn to choose from but this is my favorite. The burgers are delicious and made with meat from my favorite butchers. The grilled cheese is perfect as is the BLT. Greek Salad is large and fresh. Full bar to keep me liquored up! And any place that serves good onion rings is a winner with me. I go there every time I visit my mom.
