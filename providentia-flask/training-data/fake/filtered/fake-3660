My gal pal Mel and I went here about a week ago and we had such a blast, even having to wait a bottle of wine's worth of time for a table. The ballz are solid. I only tried the porky ones, but I'm going back tonight to sample other flavors. The sides were delishious. And the wine list is decent and reasonable. The best part about this place is when the host comes over and asks how you are enjoying your ballz.
