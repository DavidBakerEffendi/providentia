I was told this place was overrated, I didn't listen and wasted $15.00 on a veggie burger that took 20 minutes to make even though there were only 5 people total in the restaurant including myself and my friend. It also smelled horribly of vinegar. I will never go back, the burger was mediocre at best and the waffle fries seemed like they came out of a bag in the freezer. Definitely nothing special and not worth the high price tag and slow service.
