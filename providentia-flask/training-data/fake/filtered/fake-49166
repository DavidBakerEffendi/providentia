Finally, an authentic Italian sandwich place. The food is unbelievable. Everything is imported from Italy. The bread is from a famous Italian bakery in Brooklyn. Their sandwiches are as good as they can be in the best delis in Italy. I am originally from Rome, and I can guarantee you that they use the best ingredients available on the market. My favourite is the porchetta sandwich, but I also like the prosciutto and the mortadella a lot. For the bread, I would definitely recommend the sfilatino. The price for the sandwich is extremely reasonable, considering that one sandwich easily feeds 2 hungry people. Overall, going to Pisillo is always a great experience. Carmelo and Antonella, the owners of the place, are very nice and put their passion for their work on each sandwich they make.
