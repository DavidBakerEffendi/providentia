Good pizza, rude service!! I ordered the grilled steak and asked for it to be cooked MW.  The waitress said that it's served MR only,  I explained that I don't ever have my meat raw.  She rudely said to me "then you better order something else."  No, I think to myself, I better not go there, good pizza isn't enough, I want to be treated nicely.
