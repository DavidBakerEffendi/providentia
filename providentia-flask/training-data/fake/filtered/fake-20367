They have some really nice food, very laid back service and the atmosphere is wonderful in the summer time.  Its great to sit outside, sipping on some tea (great mint tea - order it in the little pot - the extra price is worth it) or enjoy dinner with a bottle of wine (its BYOB) in the beautiful garden.  What's said about the coffee, however, is true: it's only so-so.  So get the tea. For food, I especially recommend the lamb tagine and the chicken couscous.  For something lighter, if you like the chicken couscous, they use the same chicken in the chicken salad and it is very tasty.
