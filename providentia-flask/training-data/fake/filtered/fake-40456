I stopped by today and ordered a lobster roll, chips, soda and a crab bisque soup. Â I was awaiting my order (only three orders when I arrived) and the "cook" called out my order, not my number. I approached him and asked what number that was as a young lady just picked up the order (and started to open it). He said lobster roll and crab bisque. I asked if it was number 16 and it in fact was. He says to me "here". I thanked him. No response. So he basically he gave away my lunch, the young lady opened it, and he says "here". Thank you for a great lunch. You are welcome for my patronage and patience. Please use my tip, the only tip in the jar, to buy a can of manners. I will stick to cheesesteaks.
