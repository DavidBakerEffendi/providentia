Why go to Little Italy? Honestly, there is no reason when you have the folks at Basso56. The dining experience is immaculate. From beginning to end, they give their customers great service and attentiveness. I can not rave enough about their table-side manner. Â  Then, there is the food. My dishes were so pack with flavor. I had the scallops app. with sauteed portabello mushrooms and for the main course, the duck w/ bal. ving. and figs.They were beautifully presented, and the time between courses was spot on. Wine: They offer a lot of Italian wines. They are knowledgeable and can match up all their wines to food and individual wine characteristics. I would like to see them get a few micro-brews. Their beer list was sub-par. This would be my only critique. This place has a bright future, as you can see from the other reviews.
