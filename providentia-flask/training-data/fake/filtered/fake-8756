I recently went to Casa Lupita with two friends.  One of my friends was born in Mexico City so needless to say he knows great homemade Mexican food.  His review was "Outstanding" he said he hadn't had mexican food like that since he was back home a year ago.  I of course can't claim to know Mexican food like he does however I was extremely happy.  I am vegan and the owner Isabel was extremely accommodating and made me a delicious veggie burrito.  It was so big I couldn't finish it so they gladly packed it up for me and I had the rest for lunch the day after. It was even better the second day.  My other friend had seafood soup (only $12 dollars) he said it was amazing.  So fresh and the seafood was plentiful.  We love our new find.  Now we will go there all the time.  The place is cute and unassuming so you can eat and be comfortable without feeling rushed.  I have already told many people about this place. I definitely recommend it to anyone.
