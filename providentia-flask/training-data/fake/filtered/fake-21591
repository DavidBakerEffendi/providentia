THE MUSIC IS GREAT .... ATMOSPHERE NICE TOO. Great for after work drinks or watching a game BUT...... The food is terrible!!! I went there twice with a groupon coupon. Well technically three times (on one occasions they were so backed up in the kitchen that they said they would not be able to serve us that night) I have tried the corndbread catfish w/ mac n cheese and grilled Chicken red beans rice and the blacken salmon with Collar Greens.  Each item was probably 5 out of 10. The City Wings were 9/10. Carrot Cake was dry very dry 2/10 SERVICE WAS TERRIBLE!!!! They automatically put a 20% gratuity on our bill on both occasions. The first time they tricked me into say it was groupon mandated. However, months later, after having to walk OVER to our  waitress on a SLOW NIGHT for water, ordering food, cleaning our table, packing  (it appears we had interrupted her twitter/text/facebook session because she was on the phone each time we went to get her) ... this list goes on. Practically neglected our whole stay we spoke to the manager and had it taken off We wanted to leave with out giving her anything but gave her 10% What bothers me the most about this restaurant that it is New Orleans Style Restaurant and do not offer beignets HOWEVVVVVER!!!! I love the music there on both nights.  Didn't try the drinks. Will i be going back  .... i doubt it.
