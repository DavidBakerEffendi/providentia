The food was absolutely fantastic.  I mean, fantastic.  From the mussels to the houlimi (AMAZING), to the arugula salad with warm goat cheese (AWESOME), to the pear gorgonzola flatbread, to the rib eye steak (with the most amazing "ham of the woods" mushrooms).  Our waitress was friendly, but not annoyingly so.  She was helpful and credible.  I was so full by the time the desserts came that I thought I couldn't eat one more bite, but apparently I thought wrong b/c I went at the creme brulee and panna catta like I hadn't eaten in a month.  We waited a while for a table, but just opened up a couple bottles of wine and sat outside enjoying the night.  The food made was great.  Well done guys, I'll be back.
