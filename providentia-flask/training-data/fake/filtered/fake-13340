LOVE THIS PLACE! Amazing service, great food and fast delivery! What more could you ask for? Their chicken wings are soooooooooo delectable, super crunchy with a thick sweet and spicy sauce. Their chicken and beef tacos are great, so are the rice balls. Guacamole is well done too. One thing they can definitely improve on is the temperature of the food they deliver, I've gotten cold food from them one too many times, which is more annoying than anything but certainly not a deal breaker for me. I'm always happy to support them, and you can tell they appreciate it because they are so pleasant and so nice to talk to. Even their delivery guys are nice! Oh yeah, and their delivery area is huge, which is another plus. I highly recommend them on every level! Enjoy!
