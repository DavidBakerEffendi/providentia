After a terrible experience trying to get coffee at nearby Les Enfentes Terribles, I went to find Cafe Grumpy. It was the end of the day and the barista was re organizing the pastries. I was telling him about the terrible bartender at Les Enfentes as he asked me whether I wanted more or less water in my americano. (I said less and asked for room for milk). He was really gracious and nice and my americano was delish. Upon leaving he offered me a free pastry since it was the end of the day and he was most likely going to have to throw them away. I had a really good little almond cake that went perfectly with my americano. It made my day and got me through a long evening of work ahead. Only minus is that there's no seating.
