In one word: meh. I was really excited for this place to open, but upon visiting it today, I was underwhelmed. First, when I walked in, I had no idea where to order - was everything ordered separately, as in I order bread at this counter, sandwiches here, and waffles there? Or at the register? Turns out, you order and pay for most things at the register, but you can also order bread at the front counter. Second, when I asked a staff person to clarify, she was both unclear and not welcoming. Â It was a little disappointing. We ordered (a yogurt parfait and brioche raisin roll for me, a belgian waffle with fruit for him, coffees for both) and it turned out they were out of fruit topping for the waffles- at noon on a Sunday! So he switched to syrup, which was definitely not maple syrup (fine, but not as advertised.) My yogurt was quite good, coffee was passable, and the brioche roll was good if not particularly brioche-y. The waffle was so light and airy it was definitely more of a snack than a breakfast item - again, all about expectations. Would I go back? Yes, for the bread and desserts, but for anything else? Skip it.
