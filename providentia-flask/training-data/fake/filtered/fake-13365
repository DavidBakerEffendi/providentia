Took colleagues from work there today and food was great.....but watched my waiter grab a bite of his lunch, lick his fingers repeatedly and then go directly to the computer then to the kitchen.  Didn't have much of an appetize after that.  Thankfully, I was the only one who saw.  I would have been devastated after I was the one who recommended it!
