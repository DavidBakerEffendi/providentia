I have been to Kobeyaki 4-5 times now.  My favorites are the Spicy Tuna Burger and a Spider Roll. The Spicy Tuna Burger is outstanding!  It is light but filling.  It does not me feel greasy or like I need to run to the gym right away to burn it off.   The Spider Roll was fresh and very very tasty.   Service was crisp, and the place was impeccably clean.  I would definitely recommend.
