skip this place big time/ Had a date here and we were disappointed and disgusted, ordered the candied ends and got steamed part of the meat. This place serves beer no wine. Sides are just terrible, got 2 dry crumbly pieces of stale cornbread. Not coming back here again, we just walked out, service was less than ideal and portion sizes are quite small for the cost. Save your money and go elsewhere,I hate to give a bad review but this place sucks.
