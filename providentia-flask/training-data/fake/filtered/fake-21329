Tonight I went on a date and I asked my date what kind of food she would like. Unfortunately, she said what I ever I decide would be fine. I have heard about Bogota Latin Bistro thru word of mouth. So I decided to go there even though I have never been there myself. At this time, I crossed my fingers and hoped that it's as good as I been told. Let me tell you, the food was fabulous, and my waitress Jean Marie was fantastic. She was very polite and always smiled, which it was great to see cause the place was busy.  I must really commend her cause to be honest I couldn't keep a smile on my face with such a high demand. The atmosphere was great and the music almost made me get out of my chair and dance. At the end of the night my date asked me how did you find this place? I told her thru a friend and he swears it's not only great food but the service is amazing.  Jean Marie made me feel very welcomed and for that, Excellent Job. I will be definitely will be returning and I will recommend this restaurant to all my friends and colleagues.
