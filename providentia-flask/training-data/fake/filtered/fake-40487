The food was nicely prepared but the service was HORRIBLE.. A red headed waitress that served us was named Mari. Mari was a terrible server that hardly ever came by to service the table. Her fake personality was transparent. I must add that she was very clever and started to finally pour us some water when the bill arrived.. Obviously trying to prove she was worthy of her tip that she.. added to the bill herself without permission. (Afraid that we wouldn't tip her because of her low caliber of service) I'm so disappointed to see a lack of professionalism. Whoever hired this waitress should give a second thought because one negative experience was enough for me not to ever go back. Tackling a hefty 20 percent tip was very unprofessional. And we only had 3 people. Simply Unbelievable. This was a review dated back from September 2010 that was never posted.
