BAD SERVICE! I ordered 2 arepas for takeout. I was one the only customer with a new order there. The hostess said "ten minutes". I figured this was acceptable and took a seat. Ten minutes go by and I'm wondering if they're making my food in the back. Suddenly, a man appears and starts making my 2 arepas. This takes about 2 minutes for him to finish and hand it to me. WHY MUST I WAIT TEN MINUTES FOR YOU TO START MAKING MY FOOD? 3 GUYS CHOPPING TOMATOES WHILE PAYING CUSTOMERS ARE WAITING IS NOT ACCEPTABLE. WILL NOT RETURN HERE.
