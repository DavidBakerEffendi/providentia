I went to Ward III for the first time last night to celebrate my birthday. I was very impressed with this place. The service was above-and-beyond fantastic. I had reserved a table for 15 people, and within 2 minutes of my asking the wait staff whether we could add on another table and chairs to accommodate all my guests, the staff brought over another table. Our wait staff was extremely attentive, the drinks were delicious, and the food was great (I'm craving more bacon-wrapped dates). The space itself is another positive--large enough to fit a lot of people without feeling too crowded.
