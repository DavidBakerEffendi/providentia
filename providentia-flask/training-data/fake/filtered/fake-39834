I love Halal food.  They are one of the best chicken rice out there. I dont really like the halal lamb, I prefer actual lamb kebabs.  Too bad noone makes those in carts.  The chicken is non greasy and can be bland to taste.  However, with the sauce it is really really good.  The rice is okay, could be better.  The portions are good for the price.  It smells really good and the pita bread tastes better than the rice!
