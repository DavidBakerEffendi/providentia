I love burgers. They're one of my favorite food's when prepared properly. My standards for a good burger can be a little unrealistic sometimes. But I will review this establishment truthfully as possible. Upon walking into this restaurant I was greeted by a cheery cashier who joyfully took my order, smile and all. I looked around and observed that the customer base seemed to enjoy glaring at me and the friend I was with. These stares continued for the entirety of my overall terrible experience. Mind you, there is nothing particularly interesting about the way my friend and I looked, just normal young people. My friend decided upon the "crunchified" Vegas Burger. I thought, "Eh, why not try the Philadelphia Burger?". I asked for it medium rare, my friend asked for medium. I sat in the tacky swivel stools and tried to ignore the eyes burning into the back of my skull. We waited for around 8 minutes, and then my companion graciously received his meal. Funny, I thought medium burgers took longer than medium rare to cook. Maybe I'm absolutely batshit crazy, but I don't think my burger should have taken 20 minutes longer than my friends to cook. But it did. I finally get my "Philadelphia Burger", and the first thing I think is, "This had better be a good fucking burger.". But it wasn't. It was bad. Not terrible, but definitely bad. I bite in expecting a medium rare, juicy, crispy on the outside, salty, cheesy burger. What I got was a WELL WELL done burger, completely gray, bland, and lame burger. I asked for Cheez Whiz because I love some Whiz with my meat. The cheese was stone cold, stodgy, and unappetizing. Please don't go to this location. Please.
