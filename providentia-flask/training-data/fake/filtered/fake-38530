Okay Food but Bad Service. I went there for lunch with couple of my girl friends for girls day out. The waitress was very rude since the beginning even when she was taking order. She was upset with everything we asked. In the end, she was very upset about the fact that we asked her to give the left overs. The food was okay but very bad service.
