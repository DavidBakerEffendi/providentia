Hi Debi, It's Anthony from Fascino.  I'm very sorry about your experience.  I'd love to take care of you and create a better Fascino dinner for you.  Let me address some of the issues.  A portion of your party did tasting menu and the rest ordered a la carte.  The waiter informed you about the long wait for the people not eating tasting since it is 5 courses and the regualr menu is 3 courses.  The Avg. time for a tasting menu does run about 2.5 to 3 hours.  We take our time at Fascino and if you do tasting I can't guaruntee that you won't sit that long.  However, I do recommend against trying just a couple people doing tasting.  The halibut should never be overdone and I you certainly deserve better.  The scallops do tend to be slightly undercooked and many people love them that way.  We even have another scallop dish that is very popular and completely raw.  If you ask to have them cooked a little more we will take care of that right away.  I'm also surprised the desserts were only adequate, my mother is the pastry chef and we have received nothing but rave reviews when it comes to desserts.  What desserts did you get and what was wrong with them?  Service is unacceptable and if you let me know what table and what night you came in I will certainly look into this issue.  I assure you our service is usually spot on and if you come back again I promise to prove that to you.  Finally, our gratuity line item for parties of 6 or more is a non-taxable item.  It does show up above the Sales Tax, however if you figure out what the correct sales tax for the bill should be you will notice that the gratuity was NOT taxed and never is.  No matter what, you had a unpleasant experience and I'd love to make that up to you.  Please call me at the restaurant and we can talk further.  973-233-0350 Thanks, Anthony
