Had the tasting menu at lunch. $55. Crazy deal. I love recession! Our waitress is so sweet and helpful. Service is professional and friendly. I don't remember what I had, but that's a good thing. I usually only remember if something was awful. I do remember Scott the assistant manager. So very helpful! Helped us with finding other gems to try in the hood. It's a must visit when you're in town. It'll make you forget that there is a recession.
