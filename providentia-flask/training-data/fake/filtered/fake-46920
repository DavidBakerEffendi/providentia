Party of ten on our annual Christmas outing. Very disappointing. Limited menu offerings. Entrees mediocre.....not even hot. Lamb overcooked. Service took forever. They have taken deconstruction to be an end in itself rather than an interesting way to present excellent food. Need to rethink some things and get back to great food.
