My last stay at Times Square, I ate at several overpriced tourist-traps.  So this time I went on Yelp determined to find something better in the area.  The reviews of this restaurant were great, and I found out that they are well deserved.  If you are staying near Times Square I would highly recommend this restaurant.  It is reasonably priced (for NYC), has excellent food, and was a few minute's walk from my hotel. My son ordered shrimp and the dish had huge, really fresh shrimp.  I had a very good pasta dish.  Definitely a good choice for this area of Manhattan.
