Loved it! Great laid-back, divey atmosphere (in the best way possible) and the food rocked! Two of us split 5 plates and we felt like we had plenty to eat without being stuffed. Particular favorites: beets (the miso-aioli was genius - i"d buy a bottle of it and I don't relaly use mayo), quinoa (definitely need to incorporate sipinach, tomato and goat cheese into mine at home) and the goat cheese crostini (which were so good we actually pondered getting another order). We also had the shrimp and "grits" (actually porridge) and the pork tacos special, which were both good , but not quite at the level of the other dishes. The bread was good and crusty, as well. Add in a bottle of middle of the road sauvignon blanc and we got out for $110 (not including tip), which I thought was exceptional for the quality of the food. I'd definitely come back and I'll recommend it to anyone looking for some small plates and good wines.
