I'm originally from Maryland, and since I moved here I have to say the quality of Chinese food is pretty terrible. However, I was craving something ethnic, and went here to yelp for some guidance. Jin's is a pretty small place, but it's well-kept and clean. The cashier lady was super nice and friendly. I ordered singapore noodles (it has shrimp, chicken, some veggies with very thin angel-hair type noodles. It has a curry taste to it). The portion was very generous, and it was very tasty! YUM!!! Definitely going to be my go-to for Chinese food from now on!! :)
