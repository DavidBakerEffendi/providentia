During our visit to NYC for about 50 days, we became regulars of Spicy village. The big tray chicken tasted so authentic and portion of it is definitely enough for two people! The owner is very friendly. Â You know it is a precious attitude when you are at Manhattan and tired of confronting stony faces of waitresses. We came back to Texas recently and we so miss this place.
