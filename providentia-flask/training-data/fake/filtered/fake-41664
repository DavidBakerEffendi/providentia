Our children love the large variety of yogurts offered at Orange Leaf and the decor is clean and cheery. We find the staff to be family friendly and there is always enough seating. The yogurts are pretty sweet, sometimes a bit too sweet, however many do still have a clean taste. We love the Orange Leaf spoons too-very fun shape. The experience is always memorable for our family, so we visit every time we're in Burlington.
