Great Customer Service and Food This weekend I went to Nolita's for lunch and I chose to get the Rigatoni Carbonara because my waitress told me it was her favorite. She was right!! The food was delicious!!!  My waitress, Milly, was so sweet and pleasant. She helped me make the best choice! I strongly recommend this restaurant! The bar area looks like fun too. I will be going back to Nolita's with my friends. If you are looking for great food, a place with a great atmosphere and very helpful wait staff, then head to Nolita's  You won't be disappointed. If you don't know what to order then just ask Milly.
