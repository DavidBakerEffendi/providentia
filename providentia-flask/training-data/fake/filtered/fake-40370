This place is quite a gem!  It's quaint, snug, has a good crowd and a polite staff. The drinks were unique (made with their own bitters) and tasty, and food was good.  It's a mix crowd 20-40's, intimately lit, slim walkway with seating at the bar and areas to rest drinks.   Overall a cool place and I'm sure we'll be back.
