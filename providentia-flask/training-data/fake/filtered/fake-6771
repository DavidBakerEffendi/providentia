Been here a couple of times in the past for lunch & drinks. Love the subtle tribute to the world's greatest sport (futbol). Stopped in for dinner and was pleasantly surprised. Baked tomato/cheese appetizer followed by succulent farm chicken entree made for a satisfied belly. Will definitely be back since it's just up the block.
