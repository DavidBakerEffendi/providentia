Best dining experience I've had in Fort Greene in quite a while. I love Fort Greene, but I always feel like the restaurant offerings are a bit underwhelming--No. 7 not withstanding. Nevertheless, I almost always dine out locally in support of the businesses that seem to be making their best effort.  Enter Walter's... What a breath of fresh air. The night my friend and I went it was totally packed and quite chilly outside. Everyone greeted us warmly--the restaurant owner was there and could not be a more humble and attentive host. We lingered by the bar as we waited for a  table--where I had the most delicious Tom Collins in my life! We opted to sit at the bar when space came up. The Bartenders were incredibly attentive through the whole dining experience. The food was AMAZING. We shared the brussel sprouts, roasted chicken and artichoke dip (and let me not forget to mention the deviled eggs we had as a pre-dinner nibble!). I am going back for more tonight as a matter a fact. SO GOOD. I have to admit. I was there for brunch and was not as floored though the service was just as warm & inviting. Maybe the brunch menu could be tweaked but I hope they don't touch the dinner menu for a looong time.
