I have never been to a restaurant anywhere in the world that had a ruder staff than the staff at Saxon + Parole.  They are completely unfriendly and totally lazy.   I arrived for happy hour and there was an open table that had not been cleared from the previous guests.  The hostess informed us that we would have to wait 20 minutes until the rest of the staff was out of a meeting in order for someone to clear the table, so we ended up having to remove the dirty cups and plates ourselves just so we could sit.  Once we finally got seated we had to order at the bar and it took over 20 minutes for our drinks to arrive even though the place was nearly empty. The food and drinks are good but the service is so terrible I would never go there again.
