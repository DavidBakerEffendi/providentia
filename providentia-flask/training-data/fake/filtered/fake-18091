My husband and I had a wonderful experience this past Sunday for our 1st Wedding Anniversary! We were originally drawn to this restaurant for the food items, i.e. sugar-free dessert options, wild-caught fish, and interesting food combinations. Every time we have dined there, we have never been disappointed. The staff are so friendly and attentive. As a result, we chose to have our anniversary party in the private room. When we contacted the owners to make the arrangements, they were so easygoing and accommodating. It truly was an amazing experience. All our guests agreed that the food was so delicious. I read in someone else's review that the menu is "pricey", but I disagree. The portions are very generous and I look forward to taking home the leftovers. When you consider how many meals you will get for the price not to mention the quality and how the food is responsibly prepared (check out their website), it's well worth it to me. I've paid equal or more for a meal at other places that was awful. I highly recommend this restaurant and am eagerly looking forward to our next visit.
