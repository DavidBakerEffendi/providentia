BEST CHICKEN AROUND - My friends, family and I call it "ghetto chicken" because it's so damn cheap but SO delicious. I have been eating this chicken since I'm a little kid and I'm pushing 30 now. It never fails as one of the best meals for your buck. The sauce they use as a marinade is something I have yet to taste a duplicate of. If you are in the Woodside/Sunnyside/Jackson Heights area, you have to head over to this place. Don't be fooled by the basics of the interior, their food is good and addicting!
