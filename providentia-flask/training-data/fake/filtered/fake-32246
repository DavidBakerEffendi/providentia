I enjoy going to the Russell because of the warm atmosphere, good food, and music.  If you're looking for a place to have a quiet business lunch - the Russell is  the place to go. You can also enjoy a vibrant happy hour with coworkers as well as a fun night with friends once the DJ arrives.The warm and inviting ambiance with a mature crowd is always a plus. If you've never tried the Jerk Chicken Sandwich or Jerk wings, you are in for a treat! My friends and I feel inclined to order this meal every time we visit because it tastes better each time. I definitely recommend the Rum Punch which is refreshing and has the right amount of Wray and Nephew Rum to make any sour day a sweet one. You will enjoy the Russell.
