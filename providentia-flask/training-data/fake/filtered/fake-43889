My boyfriend and I have been wanting to try Llama's Tooth for some time now. We went for dinner Friday night and had such a pleasant experience. It's a quaint and corky family owned and operated restaurant. The crab mac and cheese is amazing and so are their hand cut fries. I had the chicken gyro and my boyfriend had the K11...both were huge portions and delicious! Regarding previous reviews, the service was prompt and food was served in a timely manor. This place is not for the pretentious wanna be food critics. Not only do they have a lovely patio for outdoor dining but they have an extensive beer list. This will definitely be one of our regular hang out places! *Local Gem*
