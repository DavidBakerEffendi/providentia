The one star is for service, not food. The food was really good, however our waitress was rude and totally unprofessional. We went for my sister's birthday and we were really excited about trying Locanda Verde since we had heard so many great reviews. The waitress (short blonde hair, possibly Eastern European) Â recommended wine which we didn't care for and her response was "well, you obviously don't know about wine." The drapes were open and the sun was in our eyes so we asked the waitress if she can have the drapes closed just a few inches and she told us to put our sunglasses on. The food was really good but it wasn't enough for me to ever want to go back. In a city like NY where there are so many amazing restaurants with great service, I'm happy to go elsewhere.
