I heard so many things about this place! I was visiting New York on vacation and learned that this was right around the corner! I grabbed my friends and we were on our way... Only to get kicked out by the rude host (not saying rude because I didn't get to eat, but because he really was being a jerk) because we weren't dressed in business suits like every other customer I saw eating there and didn't look like big spenders. We were told that they were closed and they were full but immediately took the next group of people that walked in right after we walked out! I'm glad to see that I'm not the only one receiving the poor service there, I think its weird to see a restaurant turn down customers like that.
