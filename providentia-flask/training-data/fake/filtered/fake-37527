Terrible experience.  First the restaurant cancelled a reservation we made several weeks ago and couldn't give us another table that night.  We got one a different night.  Wish we hadn't. Three couples. We sat down at 8:15 and didn't get our main dishes until 10:15.  Server didnt seem to be too concerned.  Tried to make jokes.  The owner/host never came by but tried to be friendly on way out.  A huge disappointment.  Never again.  I would avoid this place  unless you have three hours to kill
