To Ramona N. -I'm not 100% sure, but if you were the woman who was writing this review on her IPAD on the way to her table (way to be obvious); you've got some nerve posting this before sitting down and eating Giotto's food. Honestly, I was there last night with my fianc√©, and we had to wait a bit as well for our reservation--not a big surprise considering that they are quite good. The restaurant is popular, and we half expected to wait a little while for our table. It's just how it is. It was our anniversary, (though we don't like fanfare) so I didn't tell anybody. The food, as per usual, was excellent. Our server was super sweet and attentive. And, not sure what you mean by "concierge" (this isn't a hotel), but if you mean the hostesses, you couldn't be more wrong. The hostess who was helping us (don't know her name, but she had a feather in her hair), every single time she came outside, she checked on us--and told us that they were doing their best to move things along and get us our table. Once we came inside, the other hostess seated us with a smile and apologized again for our wait. In short--just really professional and nice girls. I never write Yelp reviews--but in this case, I think it's necessary. Giotto's deserves a solid thumbs up. We were incredibly happy with dinner--all parts of it.
