I went to have lunch there on Sunday the 2nd of November 2014 with my friend Lance who lives in the neighborhood.  First people in the restaurant so service was good.  We shared a fried calamari dish.  I had papperdelle with wild boar sauce and Lance had osso bocco with risotto.  We had a nice bottle of red wine with the meal and finished it off with a dessert of tiramisu.  The food was good and the bill came to just over $90.00.  One hour later both of us were quite sick and throwing up.  Horrible case of food poisoning.  Went back to tell them two days later but the manager didn't seem to be very interested.  I will not be going back!!!!!!  Eat there at your own risk!
