This is the worst diner in the area, in my opinion. The booths look terrible, it's a travesty to sit in one of them. Not comfortable and just has a bad vibe. Coffee is absolutely horrendous, it tastes burnt and like just water with coffee flavoring. I was really hungry so I stayed even after all this and ordered scrambled eggs, bacon and some french toast. Really?! Not the flavors I was expecting. Everything was so bland and the french toast was so soggy. Not a good experience and not recommended.
