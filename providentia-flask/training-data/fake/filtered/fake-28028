We went to Amada for the first time by accident when we were looking for another restaurant, and it turned out to be a great find. I'll never forget the lamb meatballs that first night...  All the tapa ingredients are really top notch and the service, impeccable. They really cultivate a dark, warm atmosphere that's perfect for a romantic night.  The foie gras was out of this world, so try it even if you don't normally eat it.  BTW this is really not traditional Spanish cuisine, only in some vague way or only in name. The "pulpo a la gallega" is great but has nothing to do with the Spanish recipe of the same name.  The same for everything else except maybe the pimientos de padrón.  Enjoy it for what it is, in fact just forget that it's supposed to be Spanish food, which doesn't need to be improved by a gourmet chef, as good as he is.
