I am truly impressed.  From the decor to the service, it is impeccable.  The food and wine selection are unique, yet classic at the same time. It's the combination that is ingenious.  The owner, sommelier and the waiter are all invested in ensuring the experience that you will have at the restaurant.  As a foodie, it is unusual to visit an "up and coming" restaurant that is ever up to par.  But, Piora really sets the bar.  Love everything about the place.  AND.... you get one on one time with the owner of the restaurant that is genuinely interested in your feedback and attentive to all your needs. We love you Simon and your restaurant!
