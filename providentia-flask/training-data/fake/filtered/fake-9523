Walked in at 9 pm, 2 of us. Cute small place with cosy ambiance. Great wine list even if a bit over priced for some of the wines. Rosso di Montefalco priced like a Sagrantino. A bit too much. I have a good value for money bottle of Negroamaro. The bottle was a bit too warm for a young wine that it should be served at 14 C if not too tannic. Small menu, which is better than a long one. I would have had more pasta choices and not just 2. The restaurant claims to be Italian. Finocchiona and veal spiedini to start. Finocchiona is a fennel flavored salami, originally from Tuscany. It was definitely sliced too thin. For us italian is a bit frustrating to feel the bread over the charcuterie. Veal spiedini, excellent. I thought of my nonna style. Average the strozzapreti pasta. Duck with wild rice, artichokes and rhubarb. Perfectly cooked. I didn't like the pannacotta, it was more what we call Lattaiolo. The consistency was too creamy and felt like a yogurt. Good combination with pistacchio nuts and rhubarb sauce tough. Service was slow but I enjoy it like that so I was pleased. Bill, $ 109.00 excluded gratuity...
