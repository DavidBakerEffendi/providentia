Maybe I'm jaded - I worked as a short-order cook in my youth, my specialty was breakfast. I wanted to like Lebanon Diner more, but the service was extraordinarily slow for lunch, literally taking almost an hour to order and eat. I ordered biscuits and gravy with scrambled eggs. The taste was fine, but the portions were a bit small considering the price. I wonder if a full breakfast, omelet, hashbrowns, etc., during breakfast hours might be a more worthy test. I intend to try a lunchtime item in the future.
