We finally ordered delivery from this place after hearing from friends it was great. I would definitely rate it above other empanada places around the city. The great - Mozzarepa (sweet corn griddle cake with cheese) was buttery and wonderful. Yucca Frita Â was some of the best fried Yucca I've had. It was nice and crisp on the outside and soft in the middle, not hard and dusty like some. The banana and chocolate dessert empanada uses that classic banana chocolate combo everyone likes. The plain cheese corn flour empanada was great texturally and taste wise. The ham and cheese was simple, but nice and creamy with a little saltiness from the ham. The good - Guacamole was served with plantain chips. It was average to slightly above average. Points off for not serving with good tortilla chips, which I like better and nothing exciting about the guacamole you can get anywhere. The maduros were sweet and nice, but lacked that caramelized crispness on the outside I like. The sweet plantain and cheese dessert empanadas were nice and had a little tartness to it. The average/not that great - Chicken, pernil and cuban empanadas were all dry and needed the extra sauces badly. The pizza gets originality points, but wasn't good. Delivery was quick and reliable and prices were reasonable. All in all, for a neighborhood with lots and lots of average restaurants this was a standout. I give it an A-.
