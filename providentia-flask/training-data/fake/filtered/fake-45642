Okay so like so many others i too have eaten at the lemon grass thai restaurant in west hartford. The decor is dismal and cuisine lets be candid was completely crappy. I've noticed there was a New name on the business at this location. It's supposedly undder "new" management and renamed The Blue Elephant. I was skeptical to say the least very apprehensive about that claim of a New Owner and New restaurant. Then out of curiousity i went into the place for take out but was surprised by the updated decor that was definitely a upgrade from old lemon grass eye sore colors. I decided to stay for sit down lunch. I ordered vegetarian spring rolls which comprised of fresh veggies wrapped in soft rice paper. The accompanying sauce is not overly spicy hot just flavorful compliment to spring rolls. I was waiting a little longer for food to arrive but not too much time passed and the appetizer was yummmy especially in comparsion to previous predecessor lemon grass. I orderd a classic Â entree which was the Pad Thai dish. I was surprised it did not suck in fact it was a tasty delish meal. The owner introduced himself and seemed to be a cool dude and most of his employees are members of his own family. They all seem genuinely nice whenever greeting and serving me. Look i can babble on but the only way to prove me wrong or see if i am being candidly honest is check out the place yourself and then write a review.
