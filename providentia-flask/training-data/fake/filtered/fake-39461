I love this place. I would give it 5 stars if they had a better seating/ actually greeted you when you walked in the door. The food is pretty kick ass and they have dollar taco days! I usually split the Nachos de Kenzo with a few friends when we go- it more than stuffs all of us. It is a massive plate of nachos with chorizo, pork, beef, guacamole, pico de gallo, sour cream, cotija, cheddar, jalapenos, and more delicious nacho ingredients that I'm forgetting. For 12/13 ish dollars, and it will satiate four people. The atmosphere is dark and hipsterish. The wait staff and bartenders are generally friendly.
