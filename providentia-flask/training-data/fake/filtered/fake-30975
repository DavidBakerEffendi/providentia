Excellent Excellent Excellent!!!  There are a few places out there that deserve a 5 Star Rating.  This restaurant should be an ideal model for all other Mexican restaurant business ventures.  The food is excellent, service is accommodating, and the alcohol isn't watered down whatsoever.   My friends and I come to this place weekly.  That's how good this place is. The food is absolutely delicious, affordable, large portion, and fresh.  Every time I come here, you're automatically served fresh tortilla chips and salsa.  Tortilla chips are always warm, straight from the oven.  Salsa is spicy with some kick to it.  Waiters  will always replenish your basket of tortilla chips.  You can ask for other flavors.  The meals are generally served in large portions, so you'll get a bang for your buck.  They're always fresh, warm, and delicious as you'd expect for Mexican food.  I'd recommend the Chorizo Burrito, Chimichangas, Burrito, etc.  Expect food pricing rang from 8-14 dollars. Drinks are very good over there due to the amount of alcohol content in their drinks.  They don't mess around, and their drinks can mess you potentially.  I would definitely recommend the Mindblower if you have $18.50 to fork over.   It's well worth it.  I'd consider myself a middle-heavy weight drinker, and this drink can actually still mess you up.  Drinks are a bit fruity, but it's still delicious.  I recommend!!! The environment of this place plays very well into your dining experience.  The staff is very friendly, professional, and sociable.  You can tell by the staff that they have family values stemming from their culture and tradition.  They respect the customers and that's incredibly important.  PV as a family oriented feel fr the environment.     This place definitely deserves a thumbs up for value.  Go for it, you only live once.
