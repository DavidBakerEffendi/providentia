i have seen bad restaurants, Michael's is the worst of the worst, the first impression when i drove in the parking lot Michael (the owner) was parking car, as i walked in (the room is an L shape) i notice a band playing in one side of the room while the other side had not speakers and you were not able to hear the music (i am wondering if the owner noticed that) on the rectangular  table of 10 they had only one pitcher of water, and one pitcher of coke to serve half of the table, and a small plate of some short of antipasto good for two people (full of papers and very little of anything else) in front of my seat i had a photo copy of the menu cut by scissors. my other observations were: 1) sorry looking salad (it was cut the previous day and it was black) 2) Penne vodka. total submerged in a sauce very unappealing presentation 3) SERVICE NOT EXISTING, ONE PERSON IN ALMOST 8 TO 10 TABLES OF 10 4) the water had a strong odor of chlorine (NOT DRINKABLE) 5) MISSING SILVERWARE 6) first an second course on time ( walked in the room 1:00 PM) by 2:00 PM first and second course were served, by 3:30 PM the main course was not served (an hour and half later finally they started to serve the main course) 7) sorry looking presentation of the main course 8) after 15 minutes we completed our meal and they collected the plates, i was hopping to have a coffee after the meal, guess what, at 4:30 PM i asked my wife to leave she said that why dodnt we wait for the coffee, by that time my patient was gone and we left. by the time we left not coffee was served. CAN YOU IMAGINE THE EXPERIENCE   I HAD AFTER 3:30 HOURS OF TORTURE NOT COFFEE. THIS THE WORST EXPERIENCE I HAD, I HOPE THE OWNERS IS ABLE TO MAKE THE NECESSARY CHANGES OR I DONT THINK HE IS GOING TO LAST VERY LONG IN THE BUSINESS
