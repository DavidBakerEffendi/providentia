Ugh!  What a disappointment!  Dropped in to GT with friends for a drink in the bar and appetizers.   First time for all of us and we had really been looking forward to it.  The atmosphere was lovely but service was slow and the attitude was abrupt and condescending.  Our server made it very clear that she was displeased to have to deal with a table not ordering dinner.  But who wants a full meal at  4pm?  The wine and food we ordered were delicious but totally took a backseat to the unfriendly service.  Never again.
