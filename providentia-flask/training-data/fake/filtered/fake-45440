This was my first visit to Pure Fare and  I was not disappointed...at all!  It was a very tough decision to decide on what to order, however, I  ended up with a delicious and fresh, black bean hummus and veggie sandwich.  The dark chocolate brownie (made with sweet potatoes) was incredible!..  Like I said, there were alot of choices and I cant wait to get back and try another item or two.  On the way out, I grabbed a coffee which was great, too!  I have never heard of the brand (Blue Bottle??  from San Fran).  It was crowded, but, not too crowded.  You could tell all the food was fresh and healthy.  The place just had that kindof nice comfortable feeling to it.  Like a nice cashmere sweater : )
