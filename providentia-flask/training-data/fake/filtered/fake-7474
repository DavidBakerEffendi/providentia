This review was also deleted!  Looooveed this place!  The décor is really cool and reminded me of a family vacation in Austria when I was a teenager.  The wine list is really impressive, and we had this delicious red wine but I can't remember the name!  I even ordered the schnitzel but it was little overcooked so I give Edi 4 stars instead of 5.
