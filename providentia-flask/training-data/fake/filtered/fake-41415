5 STAR'S--We ate at Rao's on Thursday July 22nd and the restaurant far exceeded my expectations. The food is great; the BEST meatballs you will ever eat. Frankie Pellegrino is the most personable host and enchanting owner I have ever had the pleasure of dining with. The ambience is like being in your grandmothers kitchen during the holidays. Nick the Vest and Joe add to this most pleasurable dining experience.All I have to do now is see how I can get invited back; Frankie are you listening???? Ciao--Dr.B
