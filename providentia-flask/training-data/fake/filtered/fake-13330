A nice contemporary paring of traditional Korean cuisine with an added, unique southwestern spin. 3 tacos for $10 is a great deal, but there wasn't much room to sit and eat! Nevertheless, I found these little tacos to pack a punch. The back of the house was bustling with delivery prep, so next time I'll order in! Either way it's a quite an experience for the palette. Highly recommended.
