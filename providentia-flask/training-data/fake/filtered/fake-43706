As if this place is not busy as it is.  But, hey, they deserve the 5 stars.  I come here most often for brunch.  But have also come at other times of the day too.  The wait is very long on weekends from morning to afternoon with oodles of people spilling onto the nearby sidewalk.  The service is usually good.  The guy that keeps track of the table wait list is friendly and attentive.  Host, manager, part owner? Not sure who he is, but he has an amazing memory and always remembers you and your position in the line up to get a table.  The staff, for the most part, are upbeat, attentive and non pretentious.  The food is consistent and flavorful.  I like pretty much everything I have ordered here.  The only exceptions to that would be the ricotta appetizer, not bad but sort of bland.  Also the sage, egg breakfast sandwich was not remarkable.  The burger on the other hand is remarkable.  Delicious and I love it with the truffle fries.  Five Leave's truffle fries are like small slivers of greasy crack for me, and I almost didn't try them because I hate mushrooms!  I also really like the baked beans with eggs and toast a lot, but with that burger on the menu it makes it really hard for me to order anything else.  I always promise myself that next time I will try the pancakes because they look really good.  It's also nice to come here on cold winter nights to sit and drink wine with someone on the butt warming benches!
