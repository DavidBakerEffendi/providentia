I don't get it, why do people like this place, have they never had real chowder? A decent grilled piece of fish? Actual lobster bisque? High-end cafeteria food. Cream and butter do not make everything better. Anyone halfway competent COOK can prepare a lobster or make steamers. Yes the fish is fresh, but they ruin it with butter and ritz crackers. Scallops shouldn't be cooked till they are dry. Save your money.
