When the sheep are headed to Pepe's, Sally's, and Modern, be the smart one and veer off from the lines and head to Da Legna. This place will have pizza to satisfy those salivating for great New Haven pies, but it also has small plates for the customers that come along with pizza-goers who want something else. They also have a commendable micro-brew selection. This place won't have the lines that the others will, but you have to ask yourself the reason behind this phenomenon. Could it be that Da Legna is less established than the other three and that the masses are just following the herd? Da Legna is my number one pizza choice. Even if yours is Modern, you should remove yourself from the trough outside sometime and try out Da Legna one block away.
