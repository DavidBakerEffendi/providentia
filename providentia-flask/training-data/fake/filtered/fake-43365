Would not recommend this restaurant to any body. As a matter of fact I will discourage my family and friends from going there.  Wait time was awful and people coming in after us were seated before us. the table next to us was seated at there table a few minutes after us and they were leaving before we even got our meal.  Very bad service and poor quality of food. My dinner wasn't even hot .Attitude on greeters and servers were terrible.
