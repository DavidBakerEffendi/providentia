We order Goodfellas through Grubhub frequently.  The delivery is always made in a timely manner, the delivery people are courteous, and the food is good.  If they don't have something I ordered they call in a timely manner so that my order can be adjusted.  The food is pretty good- but not on par with Manhattan (but that's a hard bar to reach).  Great food for Bayonne.
