Couple of weeks ago friend from work recommended Cuba as a great date spot.  He was correct.  I recommend requesting to sit upstairs in the little semi private room with the white sheets draped throughout.  The atmosphere was intimate with just the right mix of light latin music in the background to compliment the candle light bouncing off the white decor. The server was friendly and attentive, and my date thoroughly enjoyed her flavored mojitos off the cocktail list.  The food was excellent, however, don't make the same mistake we did and try to do both tapas and dinner.  By the time the main course came we were both so full that we could only eat half of it.  The flank steak was amazing!  Will definitely go back.
