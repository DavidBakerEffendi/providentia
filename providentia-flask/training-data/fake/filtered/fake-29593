The pulled pork was great. Perhaps it was me, but I thought the chicken and mac n cheese could use less salt, so did the family, glad I don't have high blood pressure. Overall I'll be going there again or ordering in. *Update* I went there yesterday April 30th with a friend, ordered the pulled pork and a side of mac n cheese: Now is this some kind of cruel joke? Because I didn't notice the last time I ordered that sandwich, that it contained Cole slaw in the sandwich, talk about a crappy tasting sandwich & the mac n cheese was "just ok" my friend said vinegary, Â I've tasted much better from kraft. By the way ewww, By far the worst cole slaw I've ever had. Considering it's suppose to leave you wanting more, I would run and not look back. Was it because I am spanish, or that my friend and I were a little drunk but respectable? or was it that we didn't care for any pie? Don't think your attitude wasn't noticeable when I declined it the 1st time. Forgive me for not wanting to spend 30+ some odd dollars on a quick dinner, for my friend and I. Regardless of what it was, I'm seeing a pattern of blatant disregard. Perhaps I'll try your chicken again in the future, but I wouldn't hold my breath on it, there are just too many, great places to eat at, in williamsburg, let alone new york city.
