The bar tenders where fine here, but the bouncers where very bad they threw us on to the streeet when we left the bar, where it was raining and snowing, saying we could not stand next to the fire where it was dry and warm.The fire was even a safe one on the street it was a propane heater, no one was standing there they where all in the rain about 10 people. I will not go there for that I would rather eat at pigs eye pub.
