Went for Saturday brunch with 3 friends, around 20 minute wait. Cute decour, (middle room is kind of weird). They do offer outdoor seating. Coffee came in a cute pot, and they served amazing sourdough. We shared a Northern shrimp croquette as an appetizer, and had a chicken avocado club, which was standard. Cocotte was amazing, and so was the belgian waffle with strawberry. Came out to be around $15 a person, tip inc.
