This place is so amazing!  The food here is fantastic, I really mean it.  No matter what kind of food you love I guarantee you're going to find many things on this menu that will make your mouth water.  The atmosphere is also really something special.  It's not a huge corporate restaurant and that what makes the appeal so great.  It's a great place for friends to come and hang out or bring a first, second or third date. If you love food as much as I do, then this is the place to eat!
