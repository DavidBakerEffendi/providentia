Very comfy,relaxing, dimly-lit Â bar with tables in the back. Not sure how it's considered "wheelchair accesible" as the ladies room(very cool, btw!) is upstairs. The bar itself is kinda small so seats fill up fast. The food was good- yummy variety of burgers with a choice of fries or salad which was nice. The bartenders were very friendly- until a group of girls he(Neal?) knew came in and he ignored us. Other than that, great, personable service. Drink prices a bit high but that's expected in Old City. Would be a great place for a date too!
