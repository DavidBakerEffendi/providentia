Highly recommended! They have an indoor/ outdoor area, which is great for the summer. The service is always really good and the food is brought out fast. My absolute favorite meal to get is the burnt ends. They are so good they melt in your mouth. Pulled pork, sweet potatoes, and bacon baked beans are always favorites of mine. Another plus is this place is BYOB, so if you're on a budget, bring your own drinks and get the platter choice on the menu for around $30. This will allow you to choose the dishes and sides you love and share them with your friends/family. Love this place. Enjoy!
