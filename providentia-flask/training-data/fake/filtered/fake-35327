Mighty Quinn's  -- Mighty Bad.  I was completely looking forward to this and it could not have been more of a disappointment.  Got a brisket sandwich and a half chicken.   The brisket was so dry that I had to slather on the BBQ sauce all over the bread and meat to get it down.  I NEVER USE BBQ sauce.  Bread was tasteless.  Completely awful.  The half chicken was ordinary.  I could have cooked this at home better.  The skin was heavily spiced -- to spicy.  The server put something on it without asking if I wanted it brushed on.  The "side dishes" that they offer you are the smallest portion of cole slaw (creamy was ok, vinegar again has no taste) and pickled veggies.  Cucumbers were nice. When the staff person was cleaning the table next to me asked me how every thing was, I told him.  he apologized and asked if he could get me another portion of brisket.  I passed.  I had had enough.  I am sorry this was so bad.
