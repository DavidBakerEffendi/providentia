I had stopped here for a business meeting, and I was supposed to meet someone for just a beer, but hadn't had anything to eat. I ate the rustic root mash in a bowl with the Hu Joe and magical mushroom mix on top. IT WAS AMAZING! I also was a big fan of the organic IPA as well. Overall, I really support their food philosophy and do feel this will be a place I frequent often.
