As a frequent, and self-proclaimed, "cart-hopper" I was thrilled to find this new addition to the mundane line of carts on cedar street. The quaint design, quirky menu, and charming owner help make this breakfast and lunch experience the best there is. This conceptual slam-dunk of classic sandwich with a twist is both quaint and modern. Great food, great conversation with the very personable owner, great escape from the sameness infiltrating the streets. My favorite is the salmon salad sandwich, clearly fresh and not bogged down by gobs of mayonnaise. The turkey sandwich is a close second, and, since Thanksgiving is just around the corner, is just right in biding the gap between now and the coming holidays. I, too, love that credit cards are accepted and that i don't have to worry about cash. If you haven't already, take time out of your day and experience something new on cedar street. I promise you, you'll love it!!!
