Anybody who tried this place around the time they opened needs to go back!!  I can't attest to the decor because I get delivery.  But the portions have seen a vast improvement in the past few weeks.  They are using the same containers, but instead of being half full or less, they are packed.  I'm eating Philly Mac right now and having a lover affair with it. It's a new place and things are clearly in flux.  Don't write them off because of these reviews, many of them were written around the time of their opening.  Not that they're wrong per se, but things have definitely improved. I'm rooting for you Mac Attack!
