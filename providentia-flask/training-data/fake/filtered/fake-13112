Welcome to Louis' lunch, the place you can find one of the most disappointing burger me and my girlfriend have ever eaten....If I have to admit that the meat is ok (but not exceptionnal), it is found between two low price toasts and a slice of not even ripe tomatoe. And don't even ask for sauce... But you can ask for a tiny slice of unflavoured cheese for an extra dollar and you will go out of this creepy, dark and uncomfortable place more starving than when you entered but with 5$ less in your wallet. If the first burger of America was really cooked in this place (which might only be a commercial trick to attract customers...), it has definitely been improved in many other places!!! So please, don't get yourself dissapointed by this legend and try other places for good and sustaining burgers (Kelly's bar for example).
