Despite the wait to get in, food service is fast and delicious. We had blueberry pancakes and the buttermilk biscuit w scrambled egg, both outstanding! Staff were friendly and attentive, interior is small but not cramped, toilet paper is delightfully 2 ply. Get here early, we arrived at about 9am mid-week and there was already a short queue our wait estimate (10 min) wait was accurate, however when we left the wait was up to 40+ also note as the space is small the hungry must line up outside.
