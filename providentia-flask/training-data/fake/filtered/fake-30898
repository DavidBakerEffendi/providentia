Jimmies is by far the worst place on the water to go eat.  Brought a group of six on fathers day to enjoy a nice meal with my father.  The staff is not trained.  They know nothing about the food.  Whats in it. What they serve or how to serve it.  They spilled dressing all over my mothers white pants and only said sorry and to bring the pants back to them and they would have them cleaned.  Its a three hour drive back to them.  They have chicken on the menu.  It came out burnt and the manager took 5 dollars of the check because I ate my french fries.   They over charge you for food that you could get anywhere else.  They have a very poor management staff and they have zero customer service skills.  If your reading this take my word, do not waist your time or money going there.   The view is nice but that is it.  PS we all got sick after eating the food.
