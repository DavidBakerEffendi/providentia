Terrific food and service. I had heard good things about Siggy's Brooklyn and decided to try the new Manhatten location. Just off Houston on Elizabeth street. Nice location with a very pleasant decor. The food was great and good size portions.  My partner had the salmon burger and I had the steak sandwich. Both were excellent.  Lots of vegetarian items on the menu, but lots of options for all preferences.  Smoothies were delicious. Try one  Service was promt and waiter was very helpful in explaining some of the special dishes. All in all, very good food at a reasonable price, in a nice relaxed atmosphere.
