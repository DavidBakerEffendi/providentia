Pizza: Delicious. As like any good pizza should be, freshly made, cheesy, flavorful. Nothing extraordinary though. Service: The side that offers slices is good. Very casual, get-in-get-out type. But there's nowhere to sit during busy hours! The place is extremely tiny, too tight, only 5 people can fit inside, so you can't really eat in there. There's a bench outside for 2-3 people and a little, well, it's hard to describe, but it's supposed to be a table, but chest-high with no barstools around, so you'll have to eat your slice standing up. There's a restaurant for Artichoke Basille's right next door but their sit-in dining area is only for customers who are ordering boxes of pizza, not for slice orders. So you can't really go there... Maybe if it was raining and you begged? I don't know. Bottom line is, if we pass by it again, I'll stop by for a slice and eat my pizza on the go.
