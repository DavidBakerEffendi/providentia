I've been a regular at El Almacen since it opened a couple of years ago and after what felt like a long wait, I gotta say these guys did it right. The attention to detail throughout the interior makes you feel as if you're in a rustic Latin American home and the back yard is a tucked away garden steps from the L train. For the food, my standout dish is the Entra√±a hands down. Simply served on a giant wooden slab with green peppers and sea salt, it's normally cooked to perfection and melts in your mouth. I order this every other time I go here and haven't been disappointed yet. Not a huge fan of the Churrasco for the price but some other standouts include the hamachi, tilapia, the guacamole, and the tacos. Brunch is also incredible on a sunny afternoon in the backyard. Worth a special trip. Finally, what really rounds El Almacen out are the people who work there. The owners are great guys who busted their a$$es to open the place and took every effort to make it as charming as it is. The wait staff, hosts, and bartenders are always pleasant, attentive, and make you feel at home despite how jammed and crazy it can get on any given night. And be aware, it can get busy, so just relax, go with the flow, and eat well!
