This is a review of the truck only, which I love!  What a treat to be able to stop by on the way home, pick up a couple of delicious tacos with a yummy cooked leak garnish, for $3.00!  I am not kidding!  The tacos are not huge, but they are yummy, and the vegetables are fresh.  The service is fast and nice.  I love these guys.
