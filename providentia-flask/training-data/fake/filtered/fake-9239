I ordered crab sticks, shrimp and fries.  I also ordered a side of mac n cheese, which tasted like it was made from the box and froze for reselling.  It was disgusting literally I took 2 bites and threw it away.  The fries and crab sticks were soggy and lack taste.  The shrimp was not de-veined which is a disappointment.  I doubt I will return to this place, their service was friendly, but the food was TERRIBLE.
