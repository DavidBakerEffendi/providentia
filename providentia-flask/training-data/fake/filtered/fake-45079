Went here with the wife to try the thin crust Pizza.  Being a big Kinchley's fan, it was nice to see some parallels between Kinchley's and Reservior Tavern. First, the crust is great.  While I tend to like it thinner, it had a very nice crisp on the outside.  We got two small pies, a pepperoni and a Capri (Broccoli rabe, Tomatoes, Moz).  I really liked the Capri, but the pepperoni was a bit too salty for me. Overall, a decent pie, but not good enough to take best pie in NJ.
