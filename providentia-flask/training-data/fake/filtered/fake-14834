Thank you Pam and staff for making our wedding night simply amazing. Pam was on top of everything. We couldn't have done it without her! She took care of every detail that we would have probably forgot to take care of ourselves! We were even able to order our flowers and invitations right from The Gallery! Everyone was so impressed with how smooth the night went and we would just reply "It was Pam!' She just knows her stuff and knows how to host a wedding. The appetizers, buffet and drinks (and bar tenders!) were wonderful. We can't say enough good things about our experience at The Gallery. We HIGHLY recommend it. Thank you Pam and staff! You are all the best!! - Anthony & Kelly Wedding: 11/01/2014
