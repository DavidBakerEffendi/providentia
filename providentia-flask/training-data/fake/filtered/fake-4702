Beautiful restaurant, fantastic food, great service, romantic ambience. The reason for only 3 stars?  I went there with my husband for a nice quiet dinner.  There was over an hour wait for an outside table on the water so we opted for inside since it was late. The noise level was almost unbearable. Not only couldn't we hear each other but the waiter had to ask us at least three times to repeat our order. We didn't stay for dessert. Couldn't wait to get out of there. Too bad
