Philly people are picky about sandwiches.  But goodgoddamn, as someone who would name 'sandwich' as her favorite food, this is my after-death heaven.  I could only hope I've done enough in life to ascend here. Sure it's not cute, sure it's not exactly sanitary, but I will fight any person who denies that their brisket is juicy and savoury, that they don't delight vegetarians and omnivores alike, that their menu is inventive, traditional, and inspired all at once, and that their service is charming and accommodating.  (The last part, so key.)  Truly, fight me on that.  I'll take you.
