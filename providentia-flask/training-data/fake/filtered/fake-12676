Our party of four had the worst dining experience of our lives.  During the dinner, we complained to the manager and when the service didn't improve, we asked for our check without ordering an entree.  Later, we wrote to the general manager and I am not impressed with his reply.  His message is attached below for your convenience. I have not corrected grammar or punctuation. Reply from Lupa: Thank you for your email. I am terribly sorry to hear that you did not enjoy your experience at Lupa.  I am in the process of investigating the incident and assure you that we intend to make the type of experience you described an anomaly. We pride ourselves on expert service and customer care; if you decide to visit Lupa again, I can sincerely hope that you have an outstanding experience.  Thank you again for your feedback. We take these emails very seriously and we value all of our guests.  Should you decide to return, please introduce yourself to me. Again, my thanks. Mike
