I came in last Saturday night on my way home from work after a friend recommended this place for a beer snob like myself.  It was rather busy but I had no trouble getting a beer (mmm Lefthand Fade to Black) as I waited for a barstool to open up.  I sat down within a few minutes, glad to be unwinding from a long day in the kitchen.   The draft list was pretty well balanced (with the exception of a lot of dark beers, but hey it's winter) and I skimmed through the endless array of bottle options before I grew tired of reading and decided to zone out at the TV.  It was about 1:30 and the kitchen was closed, but I asked to view a food menu just to check it out (as a chef I'm always interested in these things).   Unfortunately as I pondered the draft possibilities for one last beer, a group of rather sloppy drunkbros and broettes came in and sat at the high-top tables right beside me.  One of the dudes from the group came up to the bar yelling/cursing at the bartender because they had been flagged (one chick fell several times upon entering).  The bartender told him to relax, that they had clearly had enough for the night but dude wasn't having it.  He decided to make a scene as his girlfriend (whom he was trying to order for) was falling off of her stool.  As they continued to argue with the bartender I grew irritated (and it appeared other guests in the bar did as well)  so I ordered some take-out, my tab and began to finish my beer.  Surprisingly this dude didn't get tossed (especially since drunk-bro was dropping F-bombs like Hiroshima at the staff. Drunk bros like this are the reason I moved from FOH to BOH. Godspeed barkeeps.   Anyway, so far so good Devil's Den.  Impressive beer list, blazin' fireplace and smooth Motown on the stereo.  We will meet again soon.
