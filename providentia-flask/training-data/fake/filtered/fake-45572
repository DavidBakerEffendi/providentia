It's like the movies, you need to be in the right frame of mind for what you are going to see. You don't watch "Spiderman" for acting, nor Hamlet for special effects. You go to Don Peppe for Â fantastic family size portions of simple Italian food. The place is out of Guys & Dolls, sometimes with the card game still going on. If you look for where the locals eat in Chinatown, this is where the Italians eat italian food. (Almost) everything starts with olive oil & huge whole cloves of garlic on a huge flame. My favorite dish bar none is the baked clams. I could eat them, one at a time like forever. Someone wrote they are oily. To me, that is for dipping bread. The clam sauce is always excellent. I also love the shrimp & mussel fra diavlo, always with good heat & rich tomato flavor. Other regular choices are the chicken parm & peppers w/onions. I have been coming here literally for 35 years, always looking forward to the meal before hand and building it up in my mind. The food has never disappointed me.
