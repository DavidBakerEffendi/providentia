I have never in my life have ever been treated with so much disrespect as this evening. I called masters and a man answered. I couldn't understand him in English or Spanish and asked if there was someone else there that I could speak with. He told me no that I have to deal with him. Finally, after going back and forth a nice woman got on the phone and took my order. About 20 min later the same man calls me and says he's in front of my house with the order. I open the door and no one is there. I call him and give him my address again. Ten minutes later he calls me and says he's in front of my house again. When I go downstairs n open the door, there's still no one there. I give my address to him again when I call and then he starts using the f word and calling me a motherfucker and a bitch. He actually left me two messages on my cell phone calling me all horrible names. Please do not order from them. I only ordered from them because my kids enjoyed the ribs. They have no gratitude or respect for the people who order from them and help keep their business going
