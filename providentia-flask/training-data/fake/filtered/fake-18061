ZERO STARS!!!!!!!!!! This place sucks so much. They put way to much sauce on their wings and it is way over priced. This place is not worth the money, the wraps suck, they give you two chicken tenders drenched in sauce when you order the tenders and I would highly recommend to NEVER SPEND YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY HERE.
