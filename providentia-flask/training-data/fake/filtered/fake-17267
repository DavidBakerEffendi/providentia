Came here again after the amazing sandwich last night.... and it was even better tonight.  Hats off TURKO My old review below !!Turko was a nice find, I stopped in last night and had the chicken shawarma sandwich, it was unbelievably good.  Cant wait to go back.   Thumbs up Management. 2 guys at the counter were great, the one actually grabbed me in from outside as I was looking in the window. Thank you !!!!
