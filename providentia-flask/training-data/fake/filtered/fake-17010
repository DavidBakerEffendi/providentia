I like the pizza.  This place has been here since I went to college.  I don't need to state the year I graduated but it was in the 1980's they must be doing something right if they are still around.  So they have a dumpy bar on one side and quick seating for pizza on the other.  You aren't going for ambiance and the prices are fair and of course they have a ton of outdoor seating.  I'm sure this place will be around for another thirty years.
