Bistro Les Amis is one of the best values for money that one can find for French restaurant!   It's small and charming ... reminds me very much of the small restaurants you find in Paris. The maitre d' / owner is just a lovely lovely man. Me and my husband been coming here for about 4 years and at least 2 or 3 times a months! The service there is always  excellent - very attentive.  Staffs are  always greets us with a smile.  Staff has not changed much, that says a lot about the way they run their business. Trust me myself is in restaurant business and I know hard is restaurant business ! The menu is also a good selection of traditional French fare.  My husband  eats pretty much same thing all the time there ! My absolute favorite starter is  foie gras.  Did I mention value for money?  The foie gras /MONK FISH was rather large, and for $16, it is a bargain compared to what you get at other places in the city.
