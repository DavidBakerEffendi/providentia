Although,it's far away from where I live, but I went to go on a late lunch double date and the food was great. This is a must visit. Huge space with varying multicolor rooms, great festive music and atmosphere. Every single appetizer I've had is just delicious. Our dishes were flavorful and nicely plated. I assure you no one offered me services other than food or drink. Decent prices....great service...never had to ask for anything.... so if you walk in, don't worry, you're safe...it really is Calle Ocho. I'll definitely be back many more times!
