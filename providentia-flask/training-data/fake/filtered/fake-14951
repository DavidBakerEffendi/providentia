I am always begging my friend to go to Mama Palma's. They always thank me later. PROS: 1. FOOD: I was initially skeptical about their famous polenta bread, but it is among the most delicious things I have ever put in my mouth.MMMMMMMM. Calzones and pizzas, except the one listed below, are delicious. 2. DRINKS: A respectable beer selection of their own and allow BYO wine. 2.  SERVICE: the service is fast and friendly. i expressed my undying love for the polenta bread to my waiter once, and have been getting free polenta bread since. we are usually seated quickly. 3. ATMOSPHERE: cozy, comfortable, casual. 4. PRICE:  reasonable, especially if in a large group and split a variety of small pizzas. CONS: 1. FOOD:  the insalata alla fresco was bland despite the laundry list of ingredients. i'd reconsider before ordering the pesto and black olive specialty pizza. there are many, many better options. 2. CONVENIENCE: cash only. no reservations, but not necessary. closed on mondays.
