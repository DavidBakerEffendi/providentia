I took my family to cuban pete on thursday 4/25 and i want to let you know that the manager on duty was the best, I waited for my party to arrive and was watching him react with the customers and he was great. Every person that came in he greeted with a smile and was helpful. He was very good to the help also. The service and food was very good . I give this place a thumbs up. You can thank the manager for making this a great experience.
