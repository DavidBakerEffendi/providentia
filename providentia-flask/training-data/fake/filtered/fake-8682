I almost never write reviews but I had to with this restaurant. The food is good, not great, just good. The service was very poor and disorganized. We had 2 waitresses who came to our table since neither one knew who was assigned to our table. Unfortunately for us we got stuck with the one who decided to pay little attention to our table. She was running around in such a hectic manner we were uncomfortable to stop her for anything. We actual tolerated the service since the food was good until the end of the meal while we were enjoying conversation with our friends from out of town when we were told our time limit for the table was up and had to leave. We were told that they don't let anyone sit for longer than 2 hours. That would be reasonable if we were not just served tea and coffee. If it didn't take 45 min to have the disorganized waitress take our order we may not have been there so long. If you don't mind being kicked out of the restaurant while enjoying your coffee and friends this may be a place for you. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.
