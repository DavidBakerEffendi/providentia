The pizza was great.  Almost as good as Sbarro's.  I'm all about the food. The service was horrendous.  Much worse than Sbarro's.  No smiling faces.  The pizza took an hour to arrive after we ordered.  The waiter rolled his eyes when we asked how long it would take.  That would never happen at Sbarro's. One star for the delicious pizza.  We had an artichoke pie and a meatball parm, which was delicious, by the way.  Otherwise, would be no stars at all.  Shame on you, waiter, for being so rude.  You bring shame to the pizza.
