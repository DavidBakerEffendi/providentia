I've been here several times lately and love it every single time. My fiancee and I even had our Rehearsal Dinner here and it was exceptional. Gene oversaw everything and made sure it was a seamless experience, very professional, friendly and the food was delicious. I generally get the lamb sausage pizza or the salmon and mascarpone (sounds weird but is amazing) but we had the 3 lasagnas and each one had its fans at the table, my favorite was the quattro cheese one. The servers are attentive but gave us space, and the prices are quite competitive with the area.
