I go tot this place whenever I'm craving sushi. Their sushi is fresh and decent-tasting. Its sushi is definitely cheaper than a lot of sushi places, but definitely still not cheap (approx. $6 for a 6-piece California or tuna roll all the way to $15 for a fancy, tastier roll). I swear they used to be cheaper when the first opened a couple years ago, so it is kind of disappointing. Their miso soup is delicious and their $9 bento box will stuff you full. Also, keep in mind that you have to clear your own table and get your own water from the cooler, so its not a super fancy place. Good for a craving, but it won't impress people.
