This is the most douchy restaurant I have ever been to in the world. I went there with a friend after a party. There were not that many people at the restaurant but the bouncer made us wait for like 20 minutes. we saw another group of ladies came before us and they had 9 people. The bouncer said they can't fit in 9 people. the ladies offer to split the group but the bouncer was still very mean and asked them to go away. going back to our story, after we got in the restaurant, the hostess had terrible attitude and made us wait again even though the tables are ready. to be honest, i was not impressed by their food. it's just another diner. terrible customer service....DO NOT go there!
