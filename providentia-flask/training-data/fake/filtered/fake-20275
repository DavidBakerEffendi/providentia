we knew about this place since summer but didnt have a chance to try it out. we had a 25% coupon and decided to give it a shot (take out) - big mistake! the bill was wrong, they forgot to use our discount. we ordered fish tandori $18, the order was small and they forgot to put some rice. it tasted ok, chicken dhansak (curry) $10 was so-so and rice was 2 days old; and the worse was 2 order of the naans - it was old and reheated for us in a microwave!! horrible! they gave us $10 off coupon for the next time - it;s in my garbage... never again i will use this place. as much as we like the Indian food, there are many other much better places.
