Great! Someone said they posted a review and now it's gone--there are two separate "Danny's" on Yelp so it is probably posted in the other listing. They are both the same place! One says Marazzos and the other says Parkway Ave Anyway, I don't normally like pizza but I ordered with my boyfriend and loved it! Thin pie and just the right amount of sauce. Good quality ingredients on my boyfriend's all-white pie. I hope they continue to get more business. We will be ordering more frequently to check out their weekly specials :)
