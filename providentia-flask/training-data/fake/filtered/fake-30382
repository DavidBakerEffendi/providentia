The Burger had no flavor, and was burnt. My wife asked for medium with no rare meat as she was pregnant but to me this should not mean overcooked burnt meat. Our salad never arrived and the fries tasted stale. Disappointing as the place looked good and we were excited to have a new Â local restaurant that could become a regular meeting place.
