I had worst experience at this restaurant. The food quality was bad , service poor and staff seemed least concerned about costumer. We started with appetizer which came quickly. We ordered soup, rice and lo main. Rice was served after the appetizer. We started eating hoping that others will follow. Â Lo main came after we had almost finished the rice. The soup never got served . I had to walk to manger for complaint and cancel the the order. The manager seemed not bothered about the the service quality. I walked out. Will never go again !
