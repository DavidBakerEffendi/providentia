This hole in the wall has been around forever and is not to be missed.  The aroma of the fries wafts out on the sidewalk and entices diners to come in for good reason.  The fries are hot, crusty and salty in ample portion.  Even though the place is too small to get comfortable, its more than OK because the fries are so good it doesn't take long to devour them! The only challenge is that sometimes the credit card machine isn't working and the E. Village crowd is full of folks who no longer use cash and have to dash to the nearest ATM.   HINT:  Be adventurous and try a new sauce each time.  You will be rewarded!
