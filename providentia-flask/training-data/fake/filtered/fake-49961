I have been coming to Rutt's Hutt for almost 50 years.  If I had to have "one last meal" - it would be here.  The hot dogs and onion rings are literally "to die for" (you can feel your arteries closing as you eat - everything is deep-fried) but all worth it!  Their mustard is home-made, as is the relish..  You can eat standing-up in one part, overlooking the parking lot and the sea-gulls at the trash cans, or in the dining room, which is dark-paneled and maybe remodeled once in all the years I've been going there - both options  have their own nostalgic draw.  I tried taking the dogs, fries and onion rings to go only one time - never again.  Because they're fried, once things cool off, they go from wonderful to terrible very quickly!  Eat it all there!
