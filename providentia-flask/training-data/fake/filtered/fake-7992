I will say the food is great. The pizza slices can be a lot less greasy and the crust can be a lot thinner. On the other hand, the boss can be very rude, not very welcoming always with a grump face on. Not only that but I've over heard him speaking to his employees in a not so respectful way. He talks down to them in a degrading manner. I, myself have witnessed his rude ways by having a conversation with the boss, Joe. He gives off such a nasty Ora in the restaurant. As well as coming off as an ignorant a**hole. Excuse my choice of words, but he really makes others feel uncomfortable acting as if he is better than them. Owning a buisness, as well as running it, should require a great and welcoming atmosphere whereas customers should want to come back again and again. Such a grumpy attitude is no way to run a successful buisness. As a loyal customer, I'd appriciate a welcoming atmosphere along with a positive and friendly attitude from AT LEAST the boss. Sorry sir, but it's very disturbing to give you buisness and get such negative vibes from a man who runs the place. I hope you learn to give respect to those who help make your restaurant successful.. And you will maybe get the respect from customers and employees. With a great attitude , a great workplace will follow.  Leave the nastiness and grumpiness at home, it is no way to gain a clientele. But only to lose one.     _ a concerned customer
