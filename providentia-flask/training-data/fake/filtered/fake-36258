We went to Isabella's for brunch. The wait was short and the service was fast and friendly. Like the rest of the reviewers definitely try the Eggs Benedict. I had their special for the day which was Crab Cake Benedict, and it was very enjoyable. The atmosphere here is wonderful. This is a great place to go to if you're with someone who is touring the city and/or visiting a museum (If you're visiting a museum on fifth avenue you can spend time walking through Central Park) Also, playing tourist that day, I did something that probably defied the laws of proper restaurant etiquette and poured some of the water into my water bottle. The waitress saw me and didn't say anything :) I wouldn't recommend starting any contumacious trends at this restaurant, but my excuse was that it was very hot.
