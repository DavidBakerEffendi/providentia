AMAZING! One of the best places for noodles that i ever ate at. I came with 4 other friends and we were all stuffed by the end of the night. It wasn't pricey but the wait was a little longer then we expected. Hands done me and my friends give 5 stars. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone.
