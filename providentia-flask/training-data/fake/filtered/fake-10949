Great pizza but way too variable.  Friday wait is great if you can get the attention of the one bartender.  Forget having a pie with MNF-you need a buzz saw to get through the crust.  When it is good it is some of the best but why do we need the "tude"???   I guess since the Kings Inn and that Greek place closed they have no competition and oh,yes  it shows.
