My one and only love. Much like my first wife, looks like a disaster from the outside but has so much to offer on the inside.  Since raising their prices as of the last year, it reminds me of my second wife who was all about money, but still had something I couldn't refuse.  The burger is crumb like, meaning it'll fall apart if you scarf it down too quick, but be gentle with the sandwich.  Unless you're ordering a second one and are willing to wait in line, then my friend you are a true devotee of these babies.  With a beer in one hand and the burger in the other, you have a combo meal fit for only the finest. Try coming here during the off hours to avoid the crowds.  Too many folks will result in higher costs and longer lines.
