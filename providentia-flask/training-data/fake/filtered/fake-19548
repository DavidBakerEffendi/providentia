My family recently held a repast luncheon at Angelo's on Main.  We had absolutely no complaints!  The food was excellent and the service was fantastic!!  I would highly recommend Angelo's on Main for any event.  My family will most certainly use Angelo's again.  I must add that my 98 year old mother-in-law who is very fussy and seldom likes any restaurant, was very pleased with the luncheon.
