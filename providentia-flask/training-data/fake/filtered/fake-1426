We stayed at the Nassau Inn over the weekend and had cocktails, dinner and breakfast at the Tap Room. It is always such a warm and welcoming place. The staff is superb, professional and friendly. The salmon was delicious, as well as the steak, and breakfast was yummy! Â  Our room was lovely, with the newly-renovated beautiful bathroom, and very quiet. The bed was especially comfortable. We always enjoy visiting Princeton for the arts and atmosphere, and find the Nassau Inn is a big part of that. We urge everyone to go there and decide for themselves rather than reading negative comments.
