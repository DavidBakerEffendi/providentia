Great little neighbourhood spot. Five leaves consistently delivers on both food and service. The truffle fries are delicious and so moreish. The staff are cool and very friendly. However, I do have a complaint and that is that the chairs are oh so uncomfortable. Perhaps this is intentional so that no one hangs about for too long as there is always someone in line for the table.
