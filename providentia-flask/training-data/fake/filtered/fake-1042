Ordered a chicken sandwich, by the time it got to my house which is 10 minutes away from eba's location the bread on the bottom of the sandwich was mush completely falling apart,it was luke warm,I had order an extra order of fries and they were nothing more than soggy grease filled garbage. On top of all that it cost me almost 20$ for a chicken sandwich and an extra order of fries. Then the drive had an attitude when I check the food asked him why it wasn't hot,his response was I dont make it i just deliver it.
