review for delivery: delivery time was estimated as 42 minutes (very precise), but ended up being a bit over an hour. poor. the chirashi was small for the price, as were the rolls. i thought we were missing a box, but no--one of the $10 specialty rolls was a small caliber roll with 6 pieces, and the other had 4. poor. to be fair, none of it was really bad, just not great. i would probably have given them another star, but even the miso soup was off--too sweet for my tastes.
