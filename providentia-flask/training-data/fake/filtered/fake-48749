The Inn itself is lovely w a quaint and pleasant decor but the food is generally disappointing.  I have been here for lunch & dinner.  Lunch is barely average w my last venture being a lemon chicken dish w overcooked chicken in a rather bland sauce.  The calamari was overwhelmed w the "leggy" pieces & unappetizing. Dinners have not been much better.  I expected more fr this restaurant.  The waitresses have been friendly and attentive.  I gave 3 stars because of the great service, not for the food.
