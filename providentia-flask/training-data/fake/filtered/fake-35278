Went to Nolita's a 2nd time with daughter and son-in-law after talking it up so much after our 1st dinner there (which was fantastic).  This visit we tried their chicken wing apps and a few of their specialty pizzas.  The wings were very meaty and crunchy. We ordered the chipotle and siracha sauces and were disappointed with the lack of heat.  The pizzas came out just as we were finishing the wings but were lukewarm.  We ordered the buffalo chicken and shrimp scampi pizza.  Again there was a lack of heat with the chicken and the shrimp scampi needed something to give it a bit more flavor.  The wait staff was good but only said they should work on their timing to get things out hot.  Maybe she could have offered us a little something complimentary instead of just saying they needed to work on timing.  I am returning with other friends I talked the restaurant up to and hopefully we won't be disappointed.  I will suggest we stick with the dinner choices though.
