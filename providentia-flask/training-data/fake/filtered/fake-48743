Sunday brunch, we had the private room upstairs today. We were ignored! It took 15 mins for someone to take our drink order and another 15 minutes to get the Drinks. No Â offer for coffee refills. The food arrived warm-cool and the waitress forget the cream cheese. By the time she brought it, the bagels were cold. Very disappointed!! Although the food was ok, the service sucked! We felt totally ignored!
