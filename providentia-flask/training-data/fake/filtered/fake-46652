Have always liked the food and waitresses here BUT I recently went with guests on a rainy night. The lady at the front door insisted we leave our unbrellas there. When it was time to leave two of the three were gone. I asked to speak to the manager and explained what happened. He suggested WE TAKE SOMEONE ELSE"S! When I said that wouldn't be right and that he might consider something else--like a drink on the house or a free appetizer the next time we came--he walked away.
