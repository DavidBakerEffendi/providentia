Just had my first experience at Pizza Brain.  The atmosphere is awesome and the pizza was even better.  I love how creative the pizza's are on the menu.  It reminds me of Otto's, which is a probably the best artisan pizza joint in Boston, except I think this is BETTER. Definitely going back, and pumped to have this place in the neighborhood!
