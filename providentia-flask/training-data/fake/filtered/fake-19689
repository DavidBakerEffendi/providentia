Dear Kindly Beautiful Peaches Server, I know that, like so many of your co-workers, it was your first week at your first restaurant gig, so I'll be gentle.  The owners of Peaches have spent a bundle building this joint.  They have seemingly done so without having ever taken the time, themselves, to enjoy the subtleties of one of the many other brunches available in greater Brooklyn.  And that it doesn't seem to have slowed their business is beside my point.  Now this will probably come off as a little fussy, I know.  But when I walked in the door, I was struck by ... well, it was more than the smell.  It was a lover's promise.  And a glance over at the plate in front of the fellow seated next to me confirmed what the aroma had suggested -- big ruddy curlicues of thick meaty bacon.  And then, Yes!  Platefuls appeared, flying arabesques around me.  Ahhh.  I can almost taste it now, with the wide pepper crusted edges, seared around the marbly fat.  The story of this brunch could really write itself.  However, Dear Server, the difference between the dry, reconstituted, turkey-derived wafers I received, and the salt-sheened, applewood smoked slabs I ordered, is the difference between the lightning bug and the lightning. I would have mentioned it at the time, had only the moment you so charmingly dropped it in passing under the nose of my vegetarian companion not been our last. I silently promised to write to you one day.  And now I have.
