The place was a great find.  Near work, dive like atmosphere, but nicer and the bartender was great.  Unfortunately, our blonde bartender (name unknown) was replaced with Marcus.  A group of friends and I were there for SIPS, a Wednesday Summer Philly special.  We ordered beers, food etc., and were having a great time watching the world cup when Marcus comments to the group, RIGHT NEXT TO ME, that "SIPS is a bullshit special,"  and that the first time customers (US), were keeping regulars from having bar spots, etc. etc.  He didn't understand this was a chance for new customers to try out the place and see if they liked it.  Well, initially I did, initially we all did, but now we and our group of friends, co-workers and associates will never recommend, nor return.  NIce job Marcus.
