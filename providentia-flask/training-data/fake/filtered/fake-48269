By far one of the best places in town. Really, need some time to get to your order, but when it comes, well... Heaven! I read about this place so many times, but never had the luck to go through the way and reach it. Finally i did, i was very happy about the food, the quantity, and the quality. In my opinion it's a must if you are around there, and also it's a must if you just visit NY. Don't Miss it!
