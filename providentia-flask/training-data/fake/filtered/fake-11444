I went here about a year ago and I'm pretty sure my body is still trying to digest the pork. Â  Starts off fine, if you can stand the uber-hip vibe and long wait at the bar. The beer was cheap. As in it makes no sense for Manhattan cheap. Ah, the next round was double the price. Wuh ? Turns out it was half price happy hour when I first arrived. No notice from the bartender that if we order in the next five minutes we can get the deal before the price goes up. Thanks. Probably I wasn't cool enough to receive the message. But the pork buns ordered while hunkering down for the long table wait were excellent. Note the word pork. It will come back to haunt me. Table in some room straight back then left and then left again. So what to eat. Pork the waiter suggests. Some soup with pork in it. And add in some extra belly fat while you're at it. OK. And so it goes. I think I heard a pig screaming in the kitchen at one point during my meal. Dessert. What ? No pork Ice Cream. Disappointing. I kept it all down which was a triumph. Order with some more discretion than I and you may have a fonder memory. Me, I may never eat pork again. And if I do it won't be here.
