The new tawa specials today were awesome! This is one of my favorite restaurants on oak tree road. Great food, ambiance and prices. The service is always pleasant too. I had family visiting from Bombay and they loved the buffet! I like it that they keep innovating and Â have new items on the menu ever so often. Loved the Murg Joojhe Kebab from their Awadhi Festival some time back. I wish they would put it on their regular menu.
