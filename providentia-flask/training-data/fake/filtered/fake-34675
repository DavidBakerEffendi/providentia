Don't believe the hype!!  After hearing some many good things about this spot, I finally checked out last week.  Went with the lady for a Saturday Brunch.  The place was jamming , a good sign. But most of the food was wickety, wickety wack.  I had some fried chicken tender salad.  Truly awful, the greens were over dressed, the chicken over cooked.  The only highlight was a decent tuna tartar.
