I had the pleasure of enjoying an excellent meal here while on vacation in New Jersey.  Too bad they don't have a second one in Denver.  The restaurant was fresh and clean, comfortable atmosphere with nice little original touches like the copper penny table tops and the stool on the wall. Like I base a Chinese restaurant on their hot and sour soup, so I base a restaurant on their house wine. The night started out great with a very nice house chardonnay.  I chose a beet salad to start and the salmon as my entree. Both dishes were pleasing to the eye and the stomach. No room for dessert, but they all looked very appetizing. If I lived here I would become a regular.
