Bring back the old menu please!!! I used to come in all the time and pick up a few sandwiches and some brava potatoes.  The sandwiches were never mind blowing or anything and the toppings are a bit skimpy, but I could deal with it for $1.  But with the new higher prices, I always feel disappointed.   No more dollar Wednesdays either!  awwww On the other hand, the workers here are great!   They are all so nice.
