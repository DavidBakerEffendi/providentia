Oootoya is my new favorite restaurant in NYC! Service was amazing! Yayoi was our server. She anticipated our every need and made great menu suggestions.  The entire staff was so kind and welcoming. The Basil Salad was absolutely delicious. It's an excellent light, yet satisfying option that comes with tender, juicy chicken.  I also was impressed that they serve sorbet from Laboratorio del Gelato. I love the decor - very clean and modern, yet warm and comfortable. The restrooms are spotless and scented with dried lavender. I will definitely be back soon!
