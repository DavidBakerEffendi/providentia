Came for dinner: the ambiance is great- dimly lit, chic but not formal. The food, on the other hand, is quite disappointing. I ordered the stir fry: the sauce was watery and sour, the vegetables weren't prepped properly (the snap peas weren't de-stringed), and overall was not an appealing dish. My friend ordered the burger. You'd think it'd be hard to go wrong with a burger, but as luck would have it, it's possible at Cafe Ghia. The bun was completely burnt, so we sent it back, without receiving so much as a comment or apology from the waitress. Not seasoned well, and underwhelming. Overall, the place has great potential, but didn't deliver. I can imagine the lunches/breakfasts are superior, but would be interested to come back and see.
