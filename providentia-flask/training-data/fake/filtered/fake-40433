Excellent!!!!!!! I really loved this place. Between the cheap prices and great food, I will be back for sure. The long wait to get in was so worth the wait. The music was nice and loud and the front bar was so cool. I would like to eat out back before it gets to cold to enjoy it. I forgot to mention the huge portions. :)
