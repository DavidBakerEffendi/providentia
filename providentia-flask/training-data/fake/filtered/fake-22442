Like something from a cooking show, brought to life. I always watch shows about chefs using the freshest ingredients in the most simple and effective manner, and yearn to have this in my life. Finally it happened, at Palo Santo. Â  The sliced avocado appetizer, combined with the freshly pressed tortillas are basic yet delicious and serve as a tribute to how much you can do with a few ingredients and how well the rest of your meal will go. Take your date there, make sure to get reservations, and prepare to be wowed.
