it's rare to go to a place where the entire staff is friendly, the service is good and the food is satisfying. Every time I eat at BNB I feel good when I leave...so many other places around town most load their plates with salt and butter...but I know bnb is a healthier type of cafe and they do their best to provide healthy options and cook good food! I am so glad black n brew is in my neighborhood!
