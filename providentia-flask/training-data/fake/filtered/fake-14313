Excellent from start to finish. They were spot on regarding how long it would take for a table and it was worth the 15 minutes. All of the appetizers (tapas) sounded better than the next, so it was a tough decision. I opted for the sardines. For my entree, I had the duck. I can't put into words how good it was. I finished my meal with some flan (unreal) and a cup of Cafe Beso, coffee with some Patron XO. This is a great place to go for appetizers and drinks, but don't be fooled, the entrees are awesome. I saw some Paella coming out of the kitchen.......that's what I'm having next time.
