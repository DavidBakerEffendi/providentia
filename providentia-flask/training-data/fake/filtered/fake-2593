Great date spot. I took a girl here for wine and appetizers and we were so happy. The wine selection is great and the food even better. the atmosphere is romantic but always rocking. we loved the meatballs and the eggplant the most but everything was delicious. the wine was great and the servers knew everything to help us pair the right wine with our food. i will definitely be back here soon and would recommend it for anyone.
