Boy oh boy, people love to complain. Don't judge this placed based on it's reviews, blame it on not enough people taking the time out to say how much fun they have here and how cheap it was. But know what you're getting into before you go. Leave the kids at home...and find your friends. This place is great to get drunk and people watch. The food is delicious and the people, hilarious. The bar is pretty decent, they have rouge dead guy :) and the service is entertaining. The bar is set up weird and I noticed my server get backed up due to the awkward set up of things, so I didn't blame her if it wasnt 5 star service.. It isn't 5 star in the first place! Every server I've had has been a true personality, they have fun all while getting the job done. Â They engage in conversation and aren't afraid of being themselves, which for me creates a comfortable atmosphere. Love it.
