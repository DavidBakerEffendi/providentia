Nolitas hosted our Christmas party this year. 28 people enjoyed a sit down plated meal which included a choice of appetizer,dinner entr√©e, and dessert from a special menu they put together. They did a great job getting everything out fresh hot and all together. The food and service were phenomenal, they were organized and were able to take care of everyone's needs from table service to beverages quickly and efficiently. Special thanks go to Happy for all his hard work in helping to make this a GREAT dinner party!!
