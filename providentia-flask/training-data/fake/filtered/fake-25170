We went to a birthday brunch for a friend and had a great experience. The food, like at all Bistro Petit establishments, is consistently excellent. I had the Boudin Blanc with Truffled Mashed Potatoes. It was very good, though a bit rich. To drink I had coffee and a mimosa. The coffee was high quality and the mimosa was well apportioned. For dessert the table shared a fruit tart, which was delicious. Everyone else in our group of 10 was eqully pleased. I found the service at this restaurant to be outsatnding. The waiters were knowledgeable, polite and helpful. The only issue was that the food delivery was rather slow, but this is typical of a large group. The decor is appeasing, modern and comfortable. One final plus is that we had a couple of toddlers at our table and the staff wass patient and accomodating (though this is not intended to be a child friendly place).
