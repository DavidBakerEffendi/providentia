Crescent Grill is definitely the place for fresh and delicious food!   My friend had his wedding brunch there for friends from out of town.   We were able to coordinate and made the reservation 4 months in advance.  They opened the restaurant early with a full staff just for us.  The food was fantastic and the service was outstanding. Since I was traveling back to the Washington DC metro area, I wanted to bring back some of the entrees (Crescent Burger, Roasted Long Island Duck Breast, and Grilled New York Strip Loin).  They prepared the food so I can travel with them.  When the food was re-heated, they were so delicious, and wish we had more.   I am looking forward to bring my family back for some amazing food during the holidays!
