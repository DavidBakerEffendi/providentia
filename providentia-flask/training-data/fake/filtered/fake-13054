Hot fries, bro! Â  Most tasty sauces in town and thats saying something coming from me the sauce king or rather the king of getting sauced..oooooooo snap! At any rate great fries. worth the waste not too price great drunk food or just plain food food. never thought i could eat fries for a meal but this place made all my dreams come true.. The fries are always hot not like at them fast food joints where you always have to re-order fries until they are the right temperature only to find out that they are the only edible thing in the place.... yeah these fries are legit... almost too legit to quit, hey, hey.
