Great time,  food and drinks at Blend on the Water.  The lobster dishes are definitely fresh shucked lobstermeat - amazing.  The service was especially good at the bar.  Priscilla was exceptionally great bartender, very attentive... and attractive ;) .  Breathtaking view of the Manhattan skyline - can't wait to go back!
