There are a few Halal carts on this block, and I got food from one thinking that that was the Halal Guys, and that food was actually better. There was more of it, and it was fresher although they both had that taste that the grill could have been cleaned better. The Halal Guy's plate was scant on food and was drowned in sauce and iceberg lettuce and wasn't that good, and gave me indigestion. There's nothing special about their food and their competitors have better food and have shorter lines.
