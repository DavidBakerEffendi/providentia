Ryebread is awesome. Their breakfast sandwiches are cooked to order and are always delicious. Their iced coffee is my favorite. My one gripe is actually having to go to the store and pick up your food. It's always incredibly crammed trying to order and waiting for your food. This hasn't stopped me yet from coming though. Calling ahead seems to help.
