I love the decor and ambience of Jones. Went on a Friday night close to closing, but still the food was great. I have of course the doubled eggs and chicken pot pie and my date had something else but all i could remember is his mac and cheese tasting so good that i wanted to steal it. We skipped dessert this time, but we will be back again to try the other favorites.
