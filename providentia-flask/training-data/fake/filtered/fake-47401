OMG, soooo good! I liked this place before they renovated, but I LOVE it now. The pizzas are all phenomenal. Especially the mushroom and the sausage and fennel. Also love all the appetizers and crostinis. Â The pasta w lamb ragu is the best! I came with a group of 10 and we ordered just about everything on the menu. I reccomend doing it that way, family style. There are two areas in the restaurant. Front bar is better for a date and back dining room is best for a group of 4 or more. The skylight and new decor is super cool. Dont let the semi-cheesy sign out front deter you. This place is legit! Food and service and ambience is all top notch and the price is right!
