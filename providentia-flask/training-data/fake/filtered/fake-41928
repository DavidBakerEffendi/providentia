This might have been one of the worst experiences i have ever had in the city. Went here Saturday night for dinner. We had a party of 5. Dinner took 2.5 hours. We only ordered Guacamole and tacos. They probably went slow so we would keep ordering $10+ margaritas, which are a total rip off.  When we asked the bar tender if there was anything he could do to compensate us for our patience, the manager came over and treated us like we had never been out to dinner before and didn't even apologize. Told us that it was the Industry standard to serve shitty food and make you wait hours to get it. I would not recommend this restaurant to one of my enemies, i am not that mean. DO NOT GO HERE!!!! THE WORST RESTAURANT IN THE CITY!!! THE FOOD WAS SUB PAR, THE SERVICE WAS SLOW AND THE EMPLOYEES RUDE!!! I RATHER EAT AT TACO BELL THAN AT THIS RESTAURANT!!  HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE!!! I FEEL BAD FOR ANYBODY THAT GOES HERE.
