My buddy and I ate here on 9/23/2010 between 7:00pm and 8:30pm. Both of us have been defecating something nasty today and our stomachs feel like they are in a knot. Did anyone else have this problem. This is a serious post by the way. Overall the food was okay but a little bland for "Southwest Cuisine" Atmosphere was nice. I definitely will not be going back though.
