Been coming here for years. I've tried pizza all over. I've looked up reviews online of the best pizzerias ALL OVER and I'll tell you.....Some have come close, but none have truly topped Ralph's AWESOME pie. For those who've never tried, their main pie is a thin crust pizza. The sauce is what truly puts the pie above all others. Sweet, full of ripe tomato flavor and perfectly seasoned. Spicy enough, but not overpowering. They don't overdo it with the cheese and let the focus remain the tomato sauce. If you're looking for cheesy pizza with barely and sauce and a very doughy crust, look elsewhere. Ralph's pie is the best. A++++++
