Coming from AZ I've got pretty high standards for Mexican food and this place didn't disappoint.  I got the chicken tacos.  They were spicy but not incendiary which is a nice touch.   While they were good, they weren't knock your socks off special.  With that said,  the made to order customized guacamole was out-freakin'-standing. I'd highly recommend the garlic, cilantro, fish combo.  We ended up getting 2 orders of this since it was so good.  Even a slight variation with truffle oil can change the taste drastically and for the better.  We need this in AZ now!  The service was great.  Our waitress was friendly and knowledgeable.  I'll warn you guys ahead of time,  this is some seriously pricey Mexican food.  With that said, you've got to come here for the guacamole and chips at least once.
