As someone who lived in Brooklyn Hts and frequented and loved the pizzeria when it was still known as "Patsy's", I was so looking forward to pizza of a similar quality at Patsy Grimaldi's new restaurant. Sadly, the pizza here is a pale shadow of the original. The crust wasn't nearly as chewy, nor was there anywhere as much char as I recall. The tomato sauce is still very fresh, though the garlic is stronger than desirable. The new place is more crowded and louder than the original, but service was friendly. The original pizza was ethereal, now it's merely good, and does not compare with pizza I have had in other cities (e.g. Mario Batali's Pizzeria Mozza in LA, 2 Amy's in DC). My experience bears out why Juliana's is not rated among the best NYC pizzerias. Â Will try somewhere else on my next visit.
