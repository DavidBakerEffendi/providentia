It really was a shame/disappointment. My friends gave such a great review about this place. I never had a chance to go, my birthday celebration was tonight.. An hour before we are to go, they called my friend and cancelled our reservation. I understand it's "Super Bowl Sunday", but poor manners, business, and etiquette. Luckily we found another Resturant. Working in hospitality, I missed many games, and holidays.. Now my "customers" will be advised never to go there. I'm not upset they wanted to watch a game, but notify days before you plan to close early. I am more upset by how my friend feels, then the fact we can not go. I wonder how many paying customers they will rush out tonight? Not cool. Or they may have taken a reservation for a "bigger party" and we got bumped. Guess if money is involved, forget feelings.
