Wow!! What an awesome meal I had last night. the oreccheitte with sauteed broccoli rabe was absolutely delicious and a very generous portion. We tried the wine on tap and it did not disappoint. Finished off the evening with the tiramisu which was excellent. I do wish it had more cake than whipped cream. The space is small with communal tables so I suggest going early in the week. Friendly staff and cozy setting. Can't wait to go back or order in!!
