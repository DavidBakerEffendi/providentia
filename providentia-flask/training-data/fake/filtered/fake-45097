Excellent food, excellent service and sooo worth the tasting menu option!  We celebrated our joint birthdays, Hubbie and me, and what a wonderfully mouth watering experience,  and please go very hungry as there are so many beautiful little inbetween dishes, our six course was more like 16 courses!  We loved it so much we are heading back for our anniversary celebration.
