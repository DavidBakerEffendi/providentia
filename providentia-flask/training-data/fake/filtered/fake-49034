After reading the reviews of this place, I decided to try it out tonight. I thought it was very good and tasted fresh. My only complaint is that I ordered the Shrimp Lo Mein and though it's delicious there was only like 6 small shrimps in a huge container of lo mein. I had to literally fish around the mountain of noodles to find the shrimp. It would be great if they treated it like their other dishes and gave good portions of the food. Also, the spring rolls tasted like grease and bread with very little filling. I would make those just as fresh as the rest of the food seemed to be. Besides that, the customer service was great when I went to pick it up and overall I enjoyed my meal!
