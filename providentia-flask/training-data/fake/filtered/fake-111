Did not like my cheese steak...everyone i know has raved about this place but i did not like it at all. Also not a fan of the "speak English" sign. I am sure no one goes to the window speaking a different language, maybe broke English but at least they are trying. We're not called the melting pot because our ancestors are all born and raised English speaking Americans......
