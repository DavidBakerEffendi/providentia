a group of my colleges from Hartford Insurance took me hear. Â I love trying buffet's, i ones went for a friday lunch buffet, they had lot of food items. looks like there cooking concept is of a cheap chines take out place. this place has one of the cheapest food quality i have ever seen. (was worried that i might get sick) sitting there i saw that some ppl who come there do not care of the quality but care only the quantity. my bad luck, i had to go with the same colleges for dinner again (couldn't say no, it was a team dinner & was free) the same cheap quality buffet food was served for dinner also. OMG never again even if its free.
