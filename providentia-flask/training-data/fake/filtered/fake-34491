The food was so abominable, we had to write this review at the restaurant. We ordered the calamari and an everything pizza. I've licked a bag of flour with more flavor the breading on the calamari. And for the pizza, after the first bite, it felt as if I had taken a 1 oz shot of grease. The crust was like the cardboard cerial box that fell into your milk: thin, mushy, and limp. Pepperoni has seen better days in my dog's chow. The only thing more depressing than the food were the two anchors attached to the corners of each waiters' mouth. How on this Earth does this restaurant have a wall of awards for their pizza?
