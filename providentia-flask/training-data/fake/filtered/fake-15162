I came up from South Jersey to this restaurant with the notion of trying exotic meats and I could not be any more disappointed.. The only exotic meat offered was chicken and beef. We ordered the lamb lollies for appetisers and it was made well. Unfortunately, when it came time for main course, it was not the best experience.  We placed our order for filet mignon and roast chicken. Not only did it take more than half hour for food to come out but we kept getting served tacos and sliders-thrice! We decided to cancel our dinner and pay for the appetiser and drinks. The chef was gracious enough to come out a few time to apologise as well as treat us with our meal on the house. Word to the wise-call and inquire to see if they have stock first before getting there. On a positive note, their ambience was quaint and homely.  Their staff would regularly come around to see if guests were doing well.
