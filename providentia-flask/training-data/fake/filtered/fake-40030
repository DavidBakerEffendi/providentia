I haven't been there since the mid 90s so it may have changed.  At the time, I thought it was terrible.  The staff was less than friendly and the pizza was almost inedible.   Back then, I worked at Silver Rod , now Duane Reade and there was NOTHING else there (Dunkin Donuts hadn't arrived yet) so I would sometimes go there in desperation.  NO inclination to go back. But then again, it was always crowded even then and I know Brooklynites today who think its the best there is --- so what do I know?
