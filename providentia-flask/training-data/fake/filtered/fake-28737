I usually go to this place once a week. Better then most Thai places I've been to but there are some better. The food is pre-made so there aren't a ton of options. The basil chicken, cashew nut chicken, pad thai are all things I love eating there. I eat the fish every once in a while and it is always great. Great prices too. Should def check it out.
