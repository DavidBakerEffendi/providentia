Did you grow up in Jackson heights, Colombia like me? do you remember how much you alwasy wished for an arepa sandwich? well now you can have one!  i lreally liked the food here adn the cold chocolate shake was awesome. the only reason hey got four stars was the coffee.  I love coffee...i mean, LOVE COFFEE.  and when my people charge 3.50 for a smal cafe con leche... i drop them star.  every spanish person alive knows that good coffee should be shared with the world adn not buy into the 3.50 a cup nonsense that starbucks has washed our brains with. (stepping off my soap box)... but overall a great place for brunch!
