The food was great and the place has a lively atmosphere. I was however, appalled to discover that after the first bottle of wine they charge $10 corkage per bottle!! What a rip off and it makes a mockery of being BYO, I am sure many people would think twice about going if the corkage fee swindle was stated clearly on their website or menu. I won't be going back on principle.
