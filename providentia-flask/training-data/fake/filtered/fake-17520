My friend and I went there for their Natsumatsuri festival and I must say we were impressed by the food and the service. The food portion was small but still decent for the price because even though it was not that big, it can still fill you up and the quality of the food is exceptional. They also have a wide variety of sake and they gladly assist you in choosing your preference. We ordered the Sanma Onigiri and Sake Oyako Don, and both were very tasty and filling. Service is fast and the wait staff is very courteous and accommodating. A japanese friend also recommended this restaurant, which was another reason why we went. This japanese place could be a little pricey but if you are going for quality and authenticity, Sakagura is highly recommended.
