Cannot say enough good things about this place. The food is absolutely delicious, from the pastries to the sandwiches to the homemade salads. Everything is very fresh and the ingredients are excellent. It is moderately priced for the area as well. Seating is a little bit of an issue but the staff is very friendly.
