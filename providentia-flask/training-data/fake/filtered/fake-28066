My husband and I love this place! We visit periodically when we are in the Philly area and have yet to order something we haven't loved. Our favorites include garlic shrimp, Cheese mixto, Spanish octopus and Mushroom flatbread to name a few. We keep trying other restaurants in Philly, but keep coming back here for the amazing food and sangria. This place is best for a small party as it can be loud and is inevitably packed. Make reservations!
