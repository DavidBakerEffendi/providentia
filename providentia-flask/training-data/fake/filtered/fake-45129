Meh. Ordered Chicken Cacciatore.. got mostly noodles and chicken.. no joke 4 SLICES of mushrooms. Very disappointing. And for over 8$, ridiculous. I based my order on what kind of sauce I would dip my bread into, and was greeted with 2 naked slices of pizza dough. Seriously? The wings were good and slices are good when I go in there. The service inside is weird. They don't greet or tell you where to go to order or pick up and there's just people standing around confused sometimes. I don't order a lot bc I'm poor, and this was disappointing to spend money on.
