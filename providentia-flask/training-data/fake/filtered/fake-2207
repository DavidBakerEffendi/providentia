Went there at 9am for their scheduled opening. We went in and there were no customers inside (about 6 were waiting outside)   We were told by the hostess there was an hour wait even though THE PLACE WAS EMPTY!!!  We asked why we couldn't have one of the many empty tables but the hostess simply said to come back in an hour. Guess the success of this place has gone to their heads and customer service no longer exists there. The other customers waiting outside were also upset.
