There's just something about this place that I think is soo cute. I just love the decor - its quaint. I came here once and ordered the artichoke dip (which burned my mouth really badly), the chicken entree and the apple crisp. My husband had the burger. The artichoke dip was really good, but it Â just shouldn't come out that hot. I probably would have given 5 stars if my mouth wasn't peeling for the next few days. The apple crisp was amazing, but the waitress didn't want to give me a second scoop of ice cream! I ran out.. how was I supposed to finish without another scoop? I asked one of the guys that cleans up the table to give me a scoop and he did.. Thank God.
