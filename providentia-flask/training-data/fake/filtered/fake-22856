I was a loyal Pho 75 patron, but this place blows them out of the water. The place is clean, the staff are very friendly, and the pho is out of this world. The meat is always lean and tender, and unlike many other pho joints the quality of the broth is always top notch. If you're new to Pho or an old hand, check out Pho Saigon, it won't disappoint.
