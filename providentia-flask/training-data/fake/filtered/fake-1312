Tender Lovin' Grill, more like Tender Lovin' Bowels! My first experience with this restaurant turned out to be a very regrettable one! I normally enjoy these small family owned restaurants for their hidden delights and friendly atmospheres, but boy i was not ready for this. I ordered the Teriyaki Salmon Platter, which at first glance looked like the dinner I was hoping for. However, judging by the time i spent on the toilet the next day you bet I'm more than regretting it! The meal itself was fairly average, the glaze tasted like something from a bottle of Kraft. However I'm less than worried about the meal after the day I spent home purging it from my body. This has to say something about the storage regulations of this restaurant, or maybe the kitchen is filled with out of work college graduates that don't realize the repercussions their poor working habits have on the business of the owner. The only thing that would make me come back is the funnel cake, which to my surprise was the highlight of my trip to Tender Lovin' Grill.
