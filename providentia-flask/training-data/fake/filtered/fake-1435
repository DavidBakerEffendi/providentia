I give this 1 star, not because the bagels aren't great....they are.  But, having been going there on a regular basis, I have NEVER received good service.  The people who work there go about whatever they are doing and ignore a customer waiting.  Even after saying what I want, the people who work there will stop and continue a conversation (unrelated to bagels) before going over and putting my bagels in a bag.  I am shocked that they give SUCH poor service, when all I want to do is go in, ask for a few bagels to be put in a bag, pay and leave.
