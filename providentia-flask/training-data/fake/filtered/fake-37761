I've passed this place 100 times thinking it was a sit down extension of the  pizza joint next door.  It's not. It should say "curry house" on the facade. Anyway, me and my girlfriend went and started with the cauliflower appetizer which tasted like crunchy chicken and was totally awesome. Then we each had a different curry with a different meat. The lamb was tender and tasty and the chicken was cooked perfectly. The curries were delicious. I won't tell which ones we got. We'll going back.
