I was visiting NJ for a couple weeks and had tried one indian restaurant that was really disappointing.  We stumbled upon this restaurant on a Friday night and were really impressed.  It was nice inside - even a little romantic. The service was attentive.  The food was really enjoyable.  We had the chicken tikka masala and vegetable coconut kurma.  I would absolutley reccomend this place for dinner.  This is the first time I've ever written a review but I was so happy to find this place that I wanted to give it credit.
