This place has a lot to learn when it comes to service. My girlfriend and her freinds went tonight for a freinds birthday. They brought cupcakes to celebrate and were told they were required to PAY $3 a cupcake to serve them to the table. UMMMMM excuse me, they brought them from home, the cupcakes costed less than $5 to make in the first place and with 7 of them that is over $20. They came and spent money at your establishment and you want to charge them to eat birthday cupcakes. Either your struggling for business or you have no idea how to service your customers. You should be embarrased.
