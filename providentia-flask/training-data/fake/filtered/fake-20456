LOve love love Jack's wife Freda, the food is divine, affordable, light Â and super tasty! the atmosphere is amazing, young, happening and laid back in the evening, great place for brunch with kids, great place to bring ppl who want to see what a real New York place feels like, love it, too bad im all the way uptown!!
