I like their pizza very much. It is not traditional pizza or any particular style. It is unique to posto but excellent, albeit pricey. My only complaint is that they say they deliver until 10PM, but I have been denied delivery before 10PM when the atomic synced clock shows 9:57. If you take deliveries until 10PM, make it until 10PM. Service please!
