Looked like a nice place so I stopped to order a cheese pie being from Brooklyn. Usually I go to san remos on main street.  Which is excellent btw.  But street fair made me drive elsewhere...  The pizza was ready in under ten minutes. Which sounds great. But it was way undercooked. To the point I had to bake it myself for 5 more minutes to make it edible. Noone was in the place.  Which I shrugged off but I should know a great pizzeria is always busy . Staff was nice. Place was nice.  Pizza was no good.  And defintlity not  Brooklyn pizza .  I'll stick with san temps
