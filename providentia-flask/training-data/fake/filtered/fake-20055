Offensive to say the least! For our first time here we called to check availablilty for a hibatchi table. After speaking to the hostess we were told plenty of seats are avaiable. Upon arrival two empty hibatchi tables to our left and we are told we cannot sit there they're not being used. Without a fuss we decide to sit at the bar, as we are about to sit at the beginning of the bar we are pushed to the end by the hostess. At this time we were kind of getting annoyed by her actions. Now the food part! The food was good bit couldn't have beenore rushed to eat n go. Apps, salad, soup came out practically at the same time! Then minutes later our entress came. Now this is where i get upset, the rest Is what it is and you deal with it but when your bill comes and you go over it's time to right? Not yet cuz when your credit slip comes and it's $20 more than your bill you ask questions. After several questions the hostess insists she is correct and tries to push us along n leave. Finally she gets the original and admits a mistake and then claims to void the first and charge the correct one. Time to go? Â not so fast! I decide to call my bank to be told I was billed $222.19 for a $102.19 tab! Finally after 25 miutsethey spoke to my bank and refunded the money. Oh n by the way no seats at the hibatchi table?!?! After our soup,salad and Apps came both table were half full by the time we left they were full! This place is a scam and very rushed and disrespectful
