While touring the city, my husband and I decided to stop by the Brooklyn Taco Co. Usually I feel apprehensive about ordering at a place I've never been to before because I am pretty particular about food. I ordered the Chilorio brisket taco and was pleasantly surprised. It was a generous sized meal and was very flavorful. I really enjoyed the sweetness of the pineapple salsa but use a fork if you don't want to get too messy. Â My husband had the Guaco Taco and he really enjoyed it. I had a taste of it and enjoyed that as well. I recommend checking this place out if you are ever in town.
