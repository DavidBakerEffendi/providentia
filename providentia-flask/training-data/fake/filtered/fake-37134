Unfortunately Merriam-Webster does not provide an antonym for "hospitality". So for lack of a better expression, let me start by saying: Flat Top is the epitome of whatever is the opposite of hospitality. Over the weekend, during the badly rainy hours, the hosts/waiters of this place would not let us sit and wait for the half hour by which time their kitchen would've opened. Don't misunderstand: the dining room was all set up, the waiters were there, we would have been fine just sitting there and drinking something (which is also extra cash, O smart ones, but you know better...), but no. Sadly, my wife once ate here something she liked, so I was asked to come back here on a handful of occasions. The waiters/waitresses are always rude. One example is not even letting me sit down waiting for 1 person. So party of 2. Tables open, once again I would've sat with a drink and the menu to wait, but no. You might think that all this treatment is worth it for the kitchen. But the food is nothing I cannot make at home, and at that it's far overpriced. Salads at $12? When I asked whether a salad with tuna came with fresh tuna, they told me it did, but guess what: it was your good old tuna salad from the corner deli. Tuna freshly out of a can. To top it all off, the last time I did manage toget food here, I was so tired of waiting that I turned on a stopwatch. Food came a full 40 minutes after sitting down. Very disappointed with this place and there is no chance that I'll ever go back.
