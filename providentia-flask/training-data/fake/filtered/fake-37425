Never in my life have I felt more welcomed to the comforting goodness that is this restaurant shower.  The shower head massaged my body as the wafts of deliciousness cooking in the kitchen creeped under the door into the steamy washroom.  Bathed in authentic and delicious italian aromas, I enjoyed everything from the plush towels to the 15 course meal.   I appreciated the time taken for a break/walk, where I was able to air dry what was left after toweling down and allow for some quality digestion.  The meal was good, there were many different delicacies and I was extremely satiated both inside my stomach as well as on my epidermis from the botanical lavage.   I hope that you all get to experience the pleasure that is a shower at 15 Fox, as there are not any establishments that I have ever patroned that served such an amazing array of foods and washrooms.   I did not on this visit get to use both the upstairs powder room and the downstairs powder room.  So please stay tuned for an additional review after my next visit.  The above review is for the meal and the downstairs shower/facility.
