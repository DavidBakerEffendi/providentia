Last night was my first time visiting Great Jones Cafe and I will NEVER go back. The food was ok; but what ruined the evening was the service. For 4 meals and a few drinks our bill was $108, not bad. My friends and I left $128 and headed to the corner to hail a cab. After standing at the corner for about 3 minutes or so our waitress (whose service was average) came chasing after us. She said that we had shorted her. She counted the cash in front of us and it was not that we shorted her it was that we did not tip her enough. How distasteful! I was furious and just wanted to tell her to go away but my friend gave her $20. Again, I will never go back to this restaurant. I would not recommend this place... unless you're into being hassled by your waitress for a larger tip. This neighborhood has so much more to offer- go somewhere else!
