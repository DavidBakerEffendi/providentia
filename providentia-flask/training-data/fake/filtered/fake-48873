I was very excited about Tequila's from the moment I walked in the door, mostly because walking in the door left me staring at a huge mural of skeletons. I felt like I was in a Dia de los Muertos parade...and I loved it! The restaurant unfolds itself into a series of rooms, making the dining experience seem more intimate. My friends and I didn't even realize how big the restaurant actually was until searching for the bathroom. I could continue to gush about the ambiance but it's time to get to the food. Our food arrived quickly but was surprisingly not hot. The pork was cooked in a banana leaf, which left the meat tender and the serving size was decent. The sides were lacking, since it only consisted of a small scoop of both beans and rice. The biggest disappointment was dessert. As a girl who often doesn't run into a sweet she doesn't like, I did not like the dessert. I was intrigued by the flan/chocolate cake combo but found both halves disappointing. The cake was dry and lacking in flavor. The flan seemed to be an odd texture (I mean, beyond flan's naturally odd texture). I can't remember the last time I did not finish my dessert. It's rare for a waiter to get anything back but an empty plate. I feel compelled to go back to Tequila's another time, if for no other reason than to get a drink (how did I go to a Mexican restaurant and not get a margarita?).
