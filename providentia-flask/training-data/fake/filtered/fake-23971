I had high hopes for Le Virtu after reading a wide array of positive reviews, but came away feeling that the experience is not worth the asking price. We arrived on time for an 8:30pm reservation on a Thursday, and were very pleased with the look of the restaurant; the lighting and artwork inside are nice, and the outdoor seating area looked very cozy.  The service, however, was quite slow.  After being seated, twenty minutes elapsed before a waiter arrived to take drink orders. I ordered the pork belly and a side of broccoli rabe, to get my vegetables in while remaining decadent.  My dining companion ordered the saffron pasta with mussels.  The pork belly was prepared adequately, but the beans beneath were bland and uninteresting.  The broccoli rabe was bitter and overcooked, with no hint of the lemon or parmesan with which it was to be prepared.  Although my date's saffron pasta was good, she commented that the mussels themselves were not; I've seen her order mussels many times, but this was the first time that I remember her leaving so many uneaten. We elected to skip dessert, but still were left in our seats for 20 minutes after the dessert menus were brought before we flagged down  a waiter to bring us the check. For the price we paid, I can't say that Le Virtu is worth the trip.  There are a multitude of other Italian restaurants downtown that I will try instead.
