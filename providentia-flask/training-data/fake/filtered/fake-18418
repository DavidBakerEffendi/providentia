great: perfect service, excellent food, drink (esp ginger beer mojito) and atmosphere, reasonable price (restaurant week - $102 for two). less great: menu impossible to read (dark spot upstairs), had to use cellphone as a light, they forgot to put crab in the crab salad (wtf???), but then brought out a healthy dishful when we pointed it out. way too noisy, couldn't talk. told them in advance of wheat dairy intolerance and they had limited or no alternate choices (no crackers or anything to substitute for the bread, though the bread was great). both deserts were dairy (but then they brought out a fruit plate). great bar downstairs, definitely go there for a drink if you're out and about elsewhere. we'll probably try the downstairs next time, less noisy, maybe less romantic, but very relaxed. again, perfect service and very knowledgable and charismatic waiter, very friendly staff overall.
