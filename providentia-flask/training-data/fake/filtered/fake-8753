OK I'll admit it: I originally wanted to go to Perilla because I'm a dorky Top Chef fangirl. But now that I've been I want to go back not because of my love for cheesy reality TV but for the food! Literally, everything that we had was delicious. Solid, unpretentious and well-cooked food.The highlight was the vanilla scented doughnuts. Seriously, if you go, get the doughnuts.
