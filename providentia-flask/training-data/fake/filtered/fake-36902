I was there with a large party and we were given family style side dishes. I had extensive conversations with the waiter about my gluten and dairy intolerances and was informed that I could not eat any of the sides. The restaurant made no efforts to accommodate my food restrictions, so my dinner consisted of a filet and an uninspired salad. It's been a long time since I have eaten at a restaurant that is not willing to accommodate dietary restrictions! At least the filet was excellent.
