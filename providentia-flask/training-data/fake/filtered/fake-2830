The manager is arrogant and very rude!  I've seen similar comments so our experience was not isolated. We were a party of six and we came on a Friday night.  As expected, place was packed.  At around 7:00 p.m., we were told we were next to be seated.  We were standing by the maitre' d's table when the manager came by and ordered us to move somewhere else.  We told him that we were just waiting to be led to our table.  He said everybody has to wait for an hour.  But we said we had already waited and were told they were just cleaning our table.  He insisted that we are going to wait and anybody who can't wait can't eat there.  With that, he said "Good-bye".  I confronted him by the patio door and asked him to explain his actions and he just simply ignored me and walked away. Obviously he doesn't care if customers leave.  We can't put up with this rudeness.  There are other restaurants. We ended up eating at a Thai restaurant across the street.  A group of about ten also walked in from Cuban Pete's.  They had a similarly foul-tasting experience from the manager. Food at Cuban Pete's maybe good but it would be difficult to taste its flavor when you already have a foul taste in your mouth after dealing with the manager.
