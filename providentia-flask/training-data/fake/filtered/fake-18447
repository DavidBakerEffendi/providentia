I grew up on the Main Line, and this is by far my favorite restaurant in the Philadelphia area! I can never say enough good things about the food, the service, or the drinks. Service is always fast, attentive (but not overly attentive), glasses are never left empty or running close to low for water, and the food is always cooked to perfection! Their classic mojitos are strong and the best mojitos I've ever had! Ceviche will live in your dreams and the duck with creamed yuca is perfectly cooked and seasoned.
