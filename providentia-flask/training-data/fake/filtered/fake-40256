Dom DeMarco is the Jerry Garcia of pizza. People who see pizza as nothing more than a cheap and quick indulgence will leave scratching their heads. People who appreciate food made with love and patience will find an experience bordering on the spiritual. In fact I think it's best for your first visit to go with someone who's been there before - a guide, if you will.
