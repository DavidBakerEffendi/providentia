I've been a customer of this restaurant for years - at their old location and this new one.  Years ago it was amazing, and now it's only gotten better :)  Everything is great - the pizza, sandwiches, and full Italian meals.  I've honestly never had anything that wasn't absolutely delicious.  And, the atmosphere in this new restaurant is top-notch, beautiful and is just a great place to be.  Also, recently my family had a large event in their dining room and the service and food were AMAZING.  The staff was kind and courteous to everyone and always on top of everything - no one had to wait for drinks or food, etc...  And finished meals/plates were removed promptly.  Everything from the atmosphere, to the food to the service was literally perfect and my family and I appreciated everything they did for us that day.  Also, both the owners (it's a nice family-owned business) and the staff are all great people and I've never had a bad encounter in all of my time being a customer with this restaurant.  I would recommend Giulietta & Romeo to anyone who loves good quality, authentic Italian food.  PS - for our family gathering, nearly everyone in the party of 50 had told me I picked an amazing place and everyone was impressed with the atmosphere, food and service.  Again, it's just a great overall place.  :)
