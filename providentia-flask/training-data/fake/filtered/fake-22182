We have been her twice and look forward to going back! The portions are more than generous for the price. Great value! The food is consistently good too. We had pasta dishes and chicken dishes and left with doggie bags and full bellies. The Penne Vodka is really good! We loved the Eggplant Rollatini too. The menu changed since owners changed in the last year and has had a very positive outcome! We are looking forward to having dinner here again soon!
