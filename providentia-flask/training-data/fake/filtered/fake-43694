This is actually as good as it gets. The wait is killer... the fact that everyone keeps waiting several years down the road is a statement in itself. I've been coming to Five Leaves for about 4 years. The food is 100% every time. I must have had about 80 brunches and a few dozen dinners here and I've never had a miss, NEVER in nearly one hundred meals. And the staff is amazingly professional, hip and beautiful but still extremely friendly. The ricotta pancakes can't be passed up (order for the table to share on top of your meals) and the yogurt is shockingly large with the best assortment of fruit I've had anywhere. Their eggs are amazing so big brekkie if you're hungry or the sage panini for light days... and always get a side of avocado, so fresh and perfectly ripe - I'm from Cali so I know. They make it all look so easy, I always leave wanting to come right back :)
