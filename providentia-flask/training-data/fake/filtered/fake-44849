I just had to post a glowing review about Roger and his Gold Standard Cafe for catering services they provided for my school's Staff Appreciation Luncheon! The spread they prepared for our 80 teachers/staff (of beverages; garden/spinach, pasta, tuna, cole slaw and potato salads; meat & veggie deli trays; cookies/pastries...you name it!) was plentiful and DELISH! Â Seconds were had by many and a fun time was had by all! For great food, top-notch and timely service--dine-in or catered--you MUST give The Gold Standard Cafe a try!
