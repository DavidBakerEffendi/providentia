I stopped in for a drink..bartender was really nice ..had the Rojo Fizz ..a great pomegranate, campari, spumanti mix, good enough for me to order another two..and decided to have a couple appetizers. I ordered the baked goat cheese dip with calamata olive ..very good.. i also orderd the chimichangas which were delicious as well.   While the food was a little slow coming out of the kitchen, it was worth the wait. I thought the ingredients and the flavors were fresh and light. I am looking forward to going back to try other dishes. overall the staff was really nice and i liked the vibe.   I understand its only been open a couple of days, but once this place finds it rhythm and settles in a bit, i think the neighborhood could have itself a new lil mexican gem.
