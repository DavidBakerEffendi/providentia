I wish there was a negative star, as that's exactly what I would use. I had muscles and tuna over linguine. The meal itself looked great, however, that's as far as the positive aspects for this meal can go. The muscles were like eating pencil erasers, as in they were like RUBBER. The tuna was completely raw.  Don't get me wrong, there's a time and a place for sushi, but this wasn't it! I think that the muscles must have been reheated; I was breaking out into hot and cold sweats within 30 minutes of eating the meal; I even had to pull over on the way home in order to throw up - lovely.  I've been throwing up constantly since the meal. All in all, I wouldn't eat here again if you paid me. Horrible experience.
