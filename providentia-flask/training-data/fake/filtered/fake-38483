I love this place! The food was totally delicious -- and the point is that it is healthy AND full of rich flavors, so not every dish is going to please everyone. Â  The lunch portions were generous and the staff was super-friendly. I thought the design was gorgeous -- clean and sleek, yet very warm and welcoming -- and it felt like a place where you could easily hang out. It was immaculately clean -- I noticed the A health code rating in the window, which they were quite proud of since I learned they had just gotten that on their first try (which is apparently quite rare in the restaurant world). The staff was super-friendly and yet relaxed. In fact the vibe was so nice that my quite drop-in/grab something moment shifted when I realized I could go upstairs and do a little business and stay for long. An excellent new place -- and even if there are some early kinks I didn't experience -- right out of the gate, they are TERRIFIC!
