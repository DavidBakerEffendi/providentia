Probably one of the worst BBQ meals I've ever had. Or rather tried, because I did not finish it. On the recommendation of the bartender ordered to go Texas style beef rib plate ($30). Should have looked in the bag. Instead of tender ribs, I was greeted by one big bone of tough and burned meat. The mashed potatoes were loaded with pepper that killed any kind of taste (or covered the bad taste). The sweet mashed potatoes were full of indigestible strings. I don't think I'll even try the banana pudding. Was excited to have some BBQ, but instead will be calling my credit card company to get my money back. Really disappointing!
