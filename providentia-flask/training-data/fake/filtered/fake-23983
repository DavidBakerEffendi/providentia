A party of 6 for dinner on Friday evening. We went because of the great reviews. Nice decor and parking was not bad for a s philly location. We are all Italian , four from the Abruzzi region and three  people in our party are fantastic Italian cooks. For apps,we ordered the cheese plate, rice balls and breaded olives. The rice balls were just ok. I have had better home made with more rice stuffing, the olives  were ok. DO NOT order the cheese plate. you will be wasting your cash .The cost is $27.00 and we all laughed when the plate arrived. There were 6-8 one inch squares of different cheese. each square was no thicker than an eighth of an inch. Three different ttypes of honey, three honey pecans and three pieces of bread. Now we realize that this is not the main portion of our dinner but these cheese selections were so TINY that if one person ate them all with the bread , pecans and the honey,they would not be in any way full. The chicken baked under a brick is wonderful. The porchetta was very good . the rib eye was good, the monk fish was not good .Way too much going on with this dish and the fish was a bit chewy.The chocolate ravioli stuffed with rabbit was just ok , the same with the lasagna. The server was not attentive at all. we had to ask repeatedly for olive oil for our bread. He never asked if anyone needed black pepper or cheese for the pasta dishes, which we had to ask for and at that time the restauart was not at all busy. For dessert we ordered chocolate almond cake , chocolate mousse and a Pizza dessert . The almond cake was good. the mousse was a cold, stiff block of of hard chocolate ( left in the fridge too long or it was old) and the pizza had too many things going on with it. bottom line, just an ok meal for a hyped restaurant. Not  aplace that I would return .
