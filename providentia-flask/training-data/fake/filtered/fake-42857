Top of the Park is a jewel in the rough! Exquisite pizza, delicious pasta, generous portions, and excellent service, all in a comfortable, homey atmosphere. My daughter and I stop off for a quick meal at least once a week, before her swim practice. The food gives her tremendous energy and it is quite delicious. The staff are thoughtful, friendly, and very accomodating. If you're looking for good food, and fair prices, this is the restaurant for you. Our favorites include the Margherita Pizza and the Penne Pasta w/Vodka Sauce.
