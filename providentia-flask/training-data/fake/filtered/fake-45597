First time visitors over the weekend. The atmosphere was relaxed and fun. We sat outside around 7pm and the tables were large and comfortable. They have a free bbq promotion from memorial day until labor day, we did not choose that option, but will definitely return to try it. We ordered a pitcher of sangria for the table which was delicious. My husband ordered the prime dip sandwhich, which was large and came with french fries and I ordered the house made ravioli and a salad. The food and service were all great. we will definitely return!
