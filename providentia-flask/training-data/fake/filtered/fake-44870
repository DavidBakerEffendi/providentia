There are a great wine bars in Hell's Kitchen - I gotta say, this isn't is my favorite.  Casellula beats everything else.  It's actually top of my list, but their capacity is highly limited, especially on Friday/Saturday nights. Ardesia is THE option. it's actually a block away from Casellula. Their wine, cheese and food option aren't as much as Casellula's, but definitely somewhat impressive. crostini, banh mi, toast, skewers are my favorite. And don't forget to eat their s'mores!  A great way to finish the meal with digestive.
