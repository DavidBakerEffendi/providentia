I made plans with a group of  females friends to meet for a BYOB dinner. Three of us arrived at 7:05 pm. We put our names down for a group of 8 and went to the back room to wait.  Upon learning that our friends were running an hour late we asked to be seated at a table for three or four ( one friend was very close).   Long story short, the  owner/ host was inconsiderate,  inflexible  and accused us of trying to work the system to tie up his tables until the larger group came.  We were flabbergasted by his rudeness, , yelling at his staff, and unwillingness to seat us in a different group (4 top vs. group of 8). He was unfriendly, yelled and screamed at us and was completely uncalled for. I can honestly say it was completely uncalled for behavior, like a lunatic. We were asking to change our party size  - politely - and he basically went cuckoo on us. He proceeded to call the police and no less than 5 Montclair police showed up in 3 police cars as he reported the incident as a fight. In all honestly, in my 25 years dining out since working full-time ( i am 46 yrs old) I have never met a more inflexible, hot-headed un-service - oriented  restaurateur. I would strongly advise against patronizing this restaurant. It's worth noting that while myself and my two forty-something suburban Moms waited outside for our friends, two other groups were also asked told ave the restaurant for changing their plans.  I have never been asked to leave a restaurant tonight .
