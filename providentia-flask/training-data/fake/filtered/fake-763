I Love this place. I've been to Italy (Firenze, Lucca, Pisa, etc.) This pizza is close to the likes of those place mentioned. It is better than Deans pizza in tribeca and comes very close to Grimaldi as far as having taste buds goes for pizza. The marghuerita pizza is fresh, love the basil topping. I do not like the orangina soda, especially the lemonade flavor. It is too sour/tangy for me. The decor is very casual, mismatched rustic furniture. Good for kids, to enjoy very good pizza that is fresh.
