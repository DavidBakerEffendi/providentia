Been going to Reading Terminal Market since the time when there was still a working train terminal overhead. Nowhere else do you encounter the fabulous atmosphere, great smells, and busy merchants that make up this market that is a true Philly institution. Among my favorites - "Down Home Diner" "DiNic's Pork" and "Salumeria." Flowers, ice cream, spices, goods and meats, old books, cookies to die for, breads that really ARE the staff of life. It's all there. Go! Already!
