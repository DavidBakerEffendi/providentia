Great atmosphere (cozy and modern), delicious food!   I had an amazing dinner here with my husband last night.  Had the Prime Rib with homemade mashed potatoes and a glass of merlot.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it!  Will probably be back there tonight for more!  If you're in the area or just stopping by near town, this place is a must try, you'll add it to your list of frequented restaurants.
