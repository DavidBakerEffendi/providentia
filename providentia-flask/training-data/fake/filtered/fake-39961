Do not come here!!! They charge for extra salsa and hot sauce. Also, I ordered flan and it was burnt, I then told the waitress about it, and she did absolutely nothing. She claimed it was the kitchen's fault. But, the food was decent, but overpriced. The only thing bad about the food was that the shrimp was way over cooked
