I nearly cried with joy when I first went here. Memories of Singapore came full on. Â Singapore Laksa (alas minus the cockles) is the real deal. Tears of joy! Char Kway Teow mnnnnn...... I have absolutely no other reason to go to Elmhurst but this place. And for it, I am willing to sit many many minutes on the subway to get a chance to eat here.
