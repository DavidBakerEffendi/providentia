Carbone's Kitchen was good.  Service was good, food was good.  My issue - which some may feel is no big deal, but the suggested tip at the bottom of the receipt was overstated.  Our bill was $226 - 20 % tip would be $45.  The suggestion tip printed on the receipt for 20% was 55.70 which is actually a 25% tip.  I brought it to managements attention - they didn't seem to care.  BUYER BEWARE !!! is all I can say and don't believe the suggested tip at the bottom of the receipt.
