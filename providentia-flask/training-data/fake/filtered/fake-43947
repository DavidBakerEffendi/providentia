We've been going to Fond since it first opened around the corner from our house and haven't been disappointed once. They keep a small menu, which allows the chefs to maintain a consistent high quality and focus on executing everything to perfection. Make sure you save room for dessert though, they are AMAZING! I would say it's the best BYO in Philly, hands down. And, Jayson Werth cameos as a server there too.
