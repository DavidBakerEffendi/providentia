It may be authentic but Ive never been to Pakistan so i wouldn't know. Where Ive been is to other local restaurants of the same variety and this place is terrible. GREASY tasteless yes tasteless food not at all what i expected after hearing about it. I will admit Ive had the food once and will MAYBE try it again but probably not knowing the quality of other restaurants locally.
