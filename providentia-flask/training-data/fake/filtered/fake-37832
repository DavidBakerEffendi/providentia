Was so anxious for this place to open- I have not been to the one in Princeton in quite a few years, although I always enjoyed it immensely. This one looks entirely different from the Nassau St one- this has copper tabletops, more sleek and modern. I ordered an omelet and a half stack of multigrain pancakes- they were amazing. so tasty and so HUGE. The omelet was delicious- not at all greasy like sometimes omelets in restaurants are. My dining mate had vegetarian chilli and she said it was very good- and like all the food at PJ's seems to be fresh and from scratch. no mixes here. The menu is quite varied, many salads as well. The food is fresh and delish- and the service was helpful and courteous. I am so happy to have a great place like this in town- not having to cross route 1 or go to route 130. The place was not Â fullbut probably a little more than half full.. when we went (lunchtime on a weekday). I thought it was great.
