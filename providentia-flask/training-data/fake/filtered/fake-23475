In the last couple of months, I have ordered a very simple house salad with grilled chicken to go. The first time, they gave me straight oil for dressing (perhaps didn't stir the container) and the second time, No chicken even though I paid for it. By the time I got back to my office and noticed it, it was too late to go back. I called and was told I would receive a full refund and they would mail me a coupon for a free item. I only received a refund on the charge of the chicken and I never received any coupon. Lui Lui's used to be my favorite restaurant. Will probably think twice about ever ordering take out again.
