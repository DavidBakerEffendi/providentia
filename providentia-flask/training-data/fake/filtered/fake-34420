it smells like tires in this restaurant, someone has to say it, what a shame, too especially for someone who has a sensitive nose and loves Mexican food, although my girlfriend even noticed it and she doesn't have a sensitive nose.... salsa bar, big portions (for $16.95) I had the chile relleno special with an beef enchilada, the mole souse I thought was too sweet, girlfriend said it tasted like bbq sauce....hmmm. service was good, friendly and fast, Saturday night 7PM was packed with a line and we still got served super fast. were in and out in 40 minutes (we were in a bit of a rush) I would go back and try the seafood Mexican fare, girlfriend had to ask for sour cream three times but she got it. service was good though, and friendly, i look forward to going again....and getting take out. did i say that it smells like tires in there?
