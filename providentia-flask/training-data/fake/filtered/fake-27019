We had a birthday dinner here for one of my girlfriends and it was simply amazing. It was great service, atmosphere and most importantly the FOOD! The layout of the resistant was open and airy with tall ceilings that castes a elegance on the main dining area. The seats were very comfy and posh. Servers were tentative and got us what ever we needed including descriptions of all the wine they carry. FOOD:  Since this was a celebration we had a little something of everything. We started off with a variety of Raw Oyster, which were absolutely as sweet as can be. They were so fresh and it was so tasty paired with the well thought out sauces that accompanied them. Following that was and order of the Mussels which were in a light coconut  sauce that brought out the freshness of the mussels. The Calamari was crispy and displayed nicely. We also had the Lamb which was cooked to perfection just the way we liked it. There was plenty to share among the 4 of us. The Beet Salad was my favorite. The beets were sliced thinly and placed delicately on the rims of a salad bowl with a center salad sprinkled in a light home made dressing. The combination blended so well it was like heaven. The Shrimp with Garlic noodles were tasty and not over baring. Last bu not least we had the Best dessert! I would highly recommend the Chocolate Brownie, so rich and melts in your mouth. The Lemon rice pudding was served in a crispy mini spring roll shell, it was tangy and sweet. I'd def come again and again! I would say it is one of the best placed for an intimate dinner or a group of people out to celebrate a birthday. This restaurant was years in the making and it shows in how thoughtfully prepared all the food was.
