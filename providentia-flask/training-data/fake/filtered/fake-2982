I been to Cuban Pete's once before and i enjoyed the experience. I went there with my parents and they liked it too other than the 2 hour wait(maybe and hour and a half) we did go on a Saturday night last summer. The place was sooo packed couldn't walk, almost like being in a popular night club. The music was a bit loud but i think it suited the atmosphere. I loved the colors and interiors but i did see other patrons being seated right away after speaking with the owner, maybe they are preferred customers. I feel everyone should be treated equally and what Pete's has to work on is it's customer service. I'm researching on how successful a Cuban place with a lounge would be in either Westfield or Millburn NJ. What do you guys think? What would this new place need to have in order to be successful and would you guys travel to find a great atmosphere? Please feel free to comment.
