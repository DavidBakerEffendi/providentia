i've been to kafe neo for breakfast, lunch, a lite dinner and desserts!!!  i have enjoyed all of the food,especially the seafood bisque.  service is attentive and informative.  the music is great on friday nites, sometimes a bit loud for the size of the place but a nice touch.  i've recommended it to friends and family and they are all hooked, i get there probably once a week at least if i can.... a welcome addition... i live in wayne and we have nothing like that in town!!!
