Unbelievably my husband and I were served uncooked rice and when we complained, the waitress simply said that they were having issues with their stove and did not offer any way of solving the issue; she went about her business and when it was time to pay, didn't even took the meal off the bill!! The restaurant and staff have to class! ughh! Never again!
