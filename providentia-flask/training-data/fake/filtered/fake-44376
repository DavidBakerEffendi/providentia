We dined here while on a business trip ( we're from Chicago) and loved this place. They have old school waiters, great Italian food, a repectable wine list, and terrific ambience. We wanted Jersey Italian and Il Castello delivered. Compared to Chicago or NYC, the prices are very reasonable. Kudos to Alex at the Renaissance Woodbridge for steering us here.
