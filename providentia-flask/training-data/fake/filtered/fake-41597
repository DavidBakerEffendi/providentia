My review has nothing to do with the food or drink, but instead with the overall experience. I ate here with my family to celebrate my sister's graduation. When the waiter brought me my glass of wine, he spilled the entire glass all over me, drenching my brand new sweater and staining my shirt and jeans. One kind waitress took the sweater to the bathroom to treat with soda water, but the stain is still awful if not hopeless (it might not be a big deal if tomorrow wasn't Sunday, meaning all dry cleaners will be closed). The waiter appologized but didn't seem sincere, the guy who drenched me didn't say a thing, way too many members of the staff came out to stare, and the manager was incredibly blas√© about the whole thing. "If you take it to get cleaned, we can pay reimurse that." When we asked if they could do anything else for us (it was, after all, $200 jeans, a $60 shirt, and an $80 sweater), he comped wine for two of the four of us (and we only stayed for a single round). The entire experience was handled poorly--I was shocked for how nice the restaurant appeared to be.
