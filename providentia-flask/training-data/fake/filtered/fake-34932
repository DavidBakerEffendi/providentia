Freeman's is a lower east side treasure.  No one just stumbles in as you need a treasure map to find it.  My favorites are the artichoke dip, the spinach salad and the trout.  Let me say that again, "trout" --get the trout, it is the show at Freemans.  The bartenders there pride  themselves on their mixology acumen.  So, if you like to eat at the bar--which I do-- it's a great spot.  Pick the back bar over the front bar-much more cozy.
