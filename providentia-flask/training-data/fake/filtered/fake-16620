FOOD QUALITY: GREAT SERVICE: SHODDY PRICE: FAIR ATMOSPHERE/CLEANLINESS: Small place, very clean, but felt a bit too close to other tables/groups at times Walked in for dinner a few nights ago and they were able to seat us immediately-- the place was fairly packed but keep in mind that it's a pretty small place. The selection was good (Thai and standard Japanese menu) and most of the fish was fresh. The sushi here is excellent and very reasonably priced. My biggest issue with Vic's was the service from our waitress. She cursed several times while serving us and just generally seemed to be acting way too casual-- as if she was joining us at the table ha. It took 40+ MINUTES TO GET WATER TO THE TABLE. The first time I asked her for water, we already had appetizers at the table and her response was that "we're out of cups." It took at least another ~15 minutes, seeing another table get water, and reminding her again before we got water. When we were looking at the sushi menu she bluntly told us that the kitchen was "slammed" at the moment and sushi would take a while-- this didn't make much sense to me because, by this time, there were only a couple of tables dining in an already tiny restaurant. There were a couple of other small faults in the service but these were the main things I thought worth mentioning. All in all, a place worth trying out in my opinion.
