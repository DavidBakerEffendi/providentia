Having grown up on Long Island, I was psyced to hear that the legendary inspired cuisine of Mama Thereesa's was making it to NYC! Who knew comfort Italian food could be so hip?  The food is really good and the place has a great vibe.  Their exposed red brick has a great old world feel and yet the bar, music and decor has it going on. I highly recommend Galli for either a casual fun night out or even to bring the familia.
