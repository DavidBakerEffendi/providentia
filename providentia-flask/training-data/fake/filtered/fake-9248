Visited here a few weeks ago and was beyond satisfied when I left. The menu selection is concise and has just enough variety which shows the chef truly knows what he's doing. Too much variety tends to mean more problems. Sandwiches all came out perfect. Fries were delectable and the service was phenomenal. I'd highly recommend this place for anyone looking for a great bite to eat. A bit on the higher end but very worth it.
