I went to dinner last monday and I had the best experiencie in this restaurant. Nancy was my server  the best server ever italian girl so delicate, polite everithing was perfect. Been coming here for awhile. The food is pretty much always great, and the portions are huge. Reasonably priced as well. The chicken/veal  Milanese are my two favorite dishes. The chicken marsala is interesting as well. I really enjoyed my dinner.
