The Chippery is awesome, love the food and the service is excellent. It is nice to go somewhere and have such a welcoming staff who ask about your day with fast service. I was so down yesterday and they made my day. Yesterday was Tuesday and I had all you can eat Â shrimp and calamari with your choice of dessert, one coleslaw, and a can soda for a great cheap price. The shrimp and calamari are to die for, so absolutely delicious. I have made the Chippery my new home spot to go to. The food taste as good as Arthurs if anybody remembers how good their food was.
