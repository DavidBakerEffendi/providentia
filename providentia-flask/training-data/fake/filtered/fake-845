I generally do not do reviews for yelp as they are unverified.  I like the review I give for United Airlines program (Mileage Plus Dining) as I ONLY get an invite to review if I used my charge card at an associated restaurant.  I find it odd that the reviews that are verified for Centro are very good yet yelp has many poor ones. A negative at Centro- It can be noisy in the main dining room, the bar area is lively and what you would want from a bar. The food overall is very good for a local restaurant who is appealing to many tastes.  The bacon wrapped shrimp appetizer is one of my favorite dishes and the flourless chocolate cake is to die for.  The salads are beautifully prepared and presented. The service can be "fine" or exceptional depending on the waiter/waitress you get and their level of training/tenure.   Its a Great place for a drink, their happy hour is quite reasonable for the upscale Town Center area of Robbinsville.   Don't go by my review and certainly discredit the poor reviews and just go what do you have to lose....?  Try it if you have not, go back if its been a while.  What are you wasting one of the thousands and thousands of meals you will have in this life time. Best, JSC
