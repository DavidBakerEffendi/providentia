Just had dinner based on reviews here.  My experience was far from 5 stars.  Service was horribly slow.  I am usually in and out of a restaurant in about an hour.  It took the 3 of us 2 full hours with lots of waiting around for order, desert order, and the check.  Food was nothing special at all for all 3 meals (though desert was good).  Big portions, fairly cheap, nice inside atmosphere.  Outside it is a total ghetto.  Lot was full even the the restaurant wasn't and I had to park a few blocks away on a shady street.  Other people next to us were loud and offensive (redneck types).  I will not be returning.
