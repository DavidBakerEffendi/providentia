First time here and we will be back again! this place just opened up and has a great Mexican/Central American menu. Their tacos are fabulous! they have a Tres Leches dessert that is wonderful! they make their own sangria in either red or white and it's very tasty. it's just down the street from the Sun National Bank Arena and there is plenty of parking across the street. it has a full bar and you can dine in or out. they have some great events planned for October ... i can hardly wait!
