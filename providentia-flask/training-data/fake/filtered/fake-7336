I like the French food. As Swiss I am used to French cuisine, but this was definitely high quality and worth wating 30 minutes. Recommended to anyone who likes French atmosphere. Btw.: To discover the real diamonds of a city I always use the mobile app "FriendsTip" - you can do and get recommendations from your friends
