A good place to grab a quick bite. Service was overly friendly, and the food was about middle of the line in terms of the shawarma and falafel I have had. It also is very small, so if you go during peak dinner hours, you may be out of luck for seats. But I would definitely recommend going here if you're in the area and need some middle eastern cuisine.
