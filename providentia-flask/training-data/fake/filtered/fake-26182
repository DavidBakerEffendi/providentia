Seems as if since they have opened and continually expand, the place is on the road to death. Was there today as I thought last trip was a fluke, could not get  my order right, help tripping over one another, the Bar upstairs has the noise of the Port Authority at rush hour. Needless to say, nice place but no service, management.... how long do you think this is gonna last? I am (was ) an old time customer who doubts I will return again.. very poor!  Not to mention i wound up getting my money back tonight, as they could not produce my chicken sandwich for some reason.  While I know Eric is a managing partner in this place,  he needs to be there once in a while to oversee the demise of this place.... at this pace, it won't be there long!
