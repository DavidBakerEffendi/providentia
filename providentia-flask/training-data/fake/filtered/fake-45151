I love Lo Monaco's pizza! My wife and I usually order a "large vegetarian pizza, no olives - with sausage." That always gets a chuckle, but that's what we like. We always get that when neither of us feels like cooking. We haven't eaten in the restaurant yet, but will. So you know where I'm coming from, my other favorite is John's Pizzeria in Greenwich Village - but that's a little far now that I've moved to Branford. There's a place in Brooklyn, not far from the river, that's also very very good - can't remember the name.
