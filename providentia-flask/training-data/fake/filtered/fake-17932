I have my best friend to thank for showing me this beautiful restaurant. I have been a fan of Ethiopian food ever since my job assignment in Ethiopia 4 yrs ago. Mesob is well decorated, clean and authentic (though a little less spicy Â than the way they make it in Ethiopia....the hot & spicy in Ethiopia will have your tongue on fire!) But all the mild dishes are exactly the same. We had some veggies and a lamb dish...absolutely delicious! Our waitress Shewwiye was very friendly, funny...and delighted the birthday party on the next table. This is by far the best Ethiopian restaurant I have been to in NY-NJ-DC area.
