I'm an italian grad student in Princeton and when i heard about the opening of an italian place here i was really happy. I tried and the food and the service were great. Everyone is kind. I eat at D'angelo every week taking people from my department or joining some other italian students. I absolutely advice everyone to go and try real italian food. Dario
