Great restaurant to have a party. Had a wedding rehearsal party with 22 people and it was a great experince. The food was excellent. The waitress was exceptional and made our evening an enjoyable experience for our new relatives. The food was delicious, served timely and hot. Consiglio's has a great menu of good old fashion Italian dishes! I would recommend Consiglio's to any large group. you can be assured they are there to make your experience memorable.
