A "hole-in-the wall" "diamond in the rough" My boyfriend and I were passing through and what a pleasant surprise! We saw the reviews and couldn't pass up the breakfast burrito WHICH WAS AMAZING! All elements involved were great, crispy bacon, chunks of juicy ham, perfectly cooked/ seasoned eggs, even the potatoes were awesome (REAL) and perfectly seasoned. To top it all off the verde sauce was THE BEST I have ever had. I assume the man cooking was the owner, he came out to put the house made hot sauce on the table and to ask how everything was. Very friendly and courteous, the waiter too! If it weren't for the time crunch getting back home, we would have hit it going back through Hartford. (Only 8 minutes off the highway). I am still dreaming about that verde sauce!!!!!
