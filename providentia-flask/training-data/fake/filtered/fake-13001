I went to this restaurant last Saturday based on the reviews that my friend saw on Yelp.  Well, I can easily say that this is the WORST food I have ever eaten at a restaurant.  I have no idea what those other reviewers ate but my food was awful.  I didn't order the pasta as I wanted to have fish that night but apparently about 90% of the menu is pasta dishes which I thought strange and they only had one fish special, which was the tilapia.  When the waiter described it, it sounded ok.  My friend ordered the spinach ravioli.  How can you really mess that up, right?  So, literally 5 minutes after we ordered, both of our entrees arrived.  I was really suspicious because it doesn't take 5 minutes to cook fish.  They must have re-heated it or something.  Besides that, it looked as though they just slopped the food on the plate.  It was a mess.  I attempted to eat the dish anyway and everything was super bland.  The "roasted potatoes" that the waiter described were over boiled with no flavor.  The entire dish was tasteless.  The sauce on my friend's ravioli was awful.  I definitely will not be back here.
