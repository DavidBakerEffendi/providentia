Bianca delicioso!  There are so many Italian restaurants in New York it would be impossible to try them all.  A collegue of mine recommended I try Bianca the next time I visited and boy was it exactly how he said it would be.  Great atmosphere, cozy and warm feeling.  The service is just exquisite.  The menu has plenty of choices and the portions are pretty generous.  Great food flare.  Can't wait to go back with my wife!
