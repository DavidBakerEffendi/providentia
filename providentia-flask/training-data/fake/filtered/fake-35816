There are overwhelming positive reviews on this site, but I was disappointed. To clarify: the food was good. But the service is what ruined my experience. The waitress seemed very kind and helpful at first, but when we asked about the dishes she would say she didn't know and tell us to read the menu. Ok, understandable. But then we found out for every person who didn't order their own entree, we would get charged an extra $4. Â Seriously? We have a family of four and were planning on splitting a sampler dish designed for 2, but got charged $8 extra. We ordered some appetizers which never came. We asked the waitress what happened to them and she said we never ordered them. She argued with us and she spoke to us as if we were stupid when we are all sure we ordered them. Not going back. If the waitress stopped working there, then I would consider it, but even then, probably not.
