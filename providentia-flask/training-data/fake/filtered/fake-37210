Just moved in to the neighborhood and decided to try out the restaurant our first night at our new place.  Wow!  Excellent.  Amazing team service and the food was delicious.  I believe I had the best Hawaiian ribeye steak to date!  While I believe this restaurant use to be affiliated with the Houston's chain, I have eaten at many around the country (Florida specifically), this Hillstone was definitely one of the best.  I am so happy to live only blocks from this culinary delight which also encompasses such  spectacular service.  I will be back!
