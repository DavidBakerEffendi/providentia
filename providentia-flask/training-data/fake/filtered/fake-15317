Decor:  simple, yet elegant; fits nicely in the neighborhood Food:  interesting and good, but lacks spark Service:  needs a lot of improvement; I sat at the bar and still had to fight to get attention of waitress even though only 3 other tables were filled at the time.  For example, I was served my soup without a spoon and when I asked for one, the waitress first went to two other tables and only then returned and brought me a spoon.  Weird. I'll try again in a couple months to see if it's improved.  I really want it to be successful because the neighborhood needs it and they appear to have their heart in the right place.
