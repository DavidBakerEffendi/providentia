Louis' Lunch seriously has the best burger in town, if not the state. They're simply amazing! I had the opportunity to shoot a feature news story about them while in college. I went behind the scenes to see how they prepare everything -- it was fascinating! I can guaruntee that you will not find a fresher burger anywhere; the meat comes in every morning, which is grinded in an old-school meat grinder. It's then hand-rolled into perfectly sized meatballs, which are later turned into patties. And once they're cooked, they are d-e-l-i-c-i-o-u-s! I have to admit, I was very skeptical about the "no ketchup" on my burger, but the meat is so good that you don't even need it or miss it. They're prepared on toast as opposed to a big, bulky roll so you can savor the taste of the burger, since they put so much effort into it. And then of course there are the pies -- they're amazing! All home-made! Oh and I can't forget to mention the ice box cake. I'm not sure what's in it, but it's heaven! I could keep on raving about this place, but you need to check it out for yourself. It's truly amazing and worth every penny!
