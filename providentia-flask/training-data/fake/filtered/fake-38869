While I too experienced some of the annoyances posted here, there's no getting around the fact that I had a plate of pasta at Pascolo as good as any I've had anywhere, and I'm fairly well traveled. The dish, for the record, was the housemade pappardelle (SUGO DI AGNELLO lamb ragu, basil, mint 21.95) and it couldn't have been better. The pasta was silky but toothsome, and held the very tasty sauce perfectly. There were other pasta dishes at the table that my business associates were very happy with, but it wasn't a plate passing crowd, so I look forward to returning for some less formal dining. The Â appetizers were competent but unremarkable (bruschetta, calamari, carpaccio, Caesar salad). The gelato sundaes were quite good too, but for me, this was a memorable 5-star pasta with 3.5 stars for everything else.
