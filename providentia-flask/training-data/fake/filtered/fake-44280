The former reviews, unfortunately, under-exaggerate the power of Lee's Deli's tasty creations. The chicken-cheese steaks are to die for... I repeat: to die for. I cannot adequately depict my experience with Lee's Deli's chicken cheese steak with adjectives. I think 'WOOHOO!' comes close though =) While it may not have the publicity Pat's, Jim's, or Geno's, Lee's Deli impressively appeals to true Philly cheese steak connoisseurs. Those who have experienced the Lee's Deli chicken cheese steaks can nod their heads to my accolades. Whether you are from out of town or a b&r (born and raised) Philadelphian, Lee's Deli has got something--spectacular--to offer. However, one very important perk of Lee's Deli is being heavily ignored by all. Yes; the breakfast platters are phenomenal, the homemade burger is one-of-a-kind, and the chicken cheese steaks stun me every time. But let me say this: Lee's Deli's carrot cake is a real knock-your-socks-off treat! This unique recipe has been commended by several newspapers of Philadelphia as well as the Main Line (suburbs). Lee's Deli's carrot cakes redefine the entire genre of carrot-cake, and flawlessly complement your breakfast, burger, and steak! It honestly does not matter if you dislike carrot cakes, like carrot cakes, detest carrot cakes, or love carrot cakes. Â Lee's Deli's WILL convert you to become a carrot cake maniac (It converted me, at least =P). The carrot cakes are UNIVERSAL! Lee's Deli is SECOND TO NONE.
