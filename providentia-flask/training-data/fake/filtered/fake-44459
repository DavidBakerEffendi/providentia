Save your receipt when you go to this restaurant! I went for a nice dinner with my Fiance and left a $10 tip and when I checked my account 2 days later there was a $20 tip instead. I am a manager at my own restaurant and I know that servers manually put in the tips to the computer. I tip based on experience and this gentleman deserved the 15% tip I gave him not the 25% tip he gave himself. The owner refunded my money but never questioned who the server was so obviously no one was even talked to about this issue!
