Had dinner last night at Carbones in Hartford. While the food was very good the service was awful Darlene greeted us and took our order but never returned the rest of the evening. Food was delivered to the table but no one checked to see if we needed more drinks or if we were happy with our meal. With all the staff running around we thought it was odd no one was taking care of the little things that make great service.
