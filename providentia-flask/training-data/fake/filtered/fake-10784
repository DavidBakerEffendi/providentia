I went to this place 3 times to be fair, the first time. It was not so bad. I order the lunch special. I was a little disappointing that it all came out, at the same time. So my food eventually got cold. I ordered the Wonton soup, vegetables with chicken and white rice. I did not realized that they do Wontons with shrimp and fish, no where in the menu did it say that, so I assumed having had, had wonton soup in different place and always been pleased it was going to be the same. No. I was wrong. It had an odd flavor, I did not care for. I did not eat it. The Vegetable chicken was good but it was cold, so I didn't care to eat it anymore. The second time I went I got the vegetable spring rolls. They where good. The sweet and sour sauce was delicious. However, the third time I went. I wanted to recreate my second experience only this time, they kept trying to give me the duck sauce. Now, I know some people think its the same thing, and that is fine. However, my taste buds will beg to differ. I didn't want the orange translucent sauce, I wanted the red-orange sauce. I had to go back stairs twice, and twice I kept getting the wrong sauce. Sigh. I gave up at the end and just had the plain egg rolls. Only reason I ever ate this many times in this place, was because I was staying at the Hotel and the convenience. I wouldn't have allowed so many tries had it been at another place. If I'm ever back in Philadelphia and want Chinese food, this will never be the place to go.
