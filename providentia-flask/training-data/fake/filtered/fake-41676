Only restaurant I've ever seen where gratuity is included for parties of over 3, and the service shows it! Waitress was rude and disrespectful. Gave us attitude the whole dinner, and why not? We were a party of four. Her tip was accounted for. The food is decent, but not good enough to overcome horrible service.
