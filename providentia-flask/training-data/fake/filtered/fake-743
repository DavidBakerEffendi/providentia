My review is biased because I didn't try the food but I did have plenty of time to stand in line and watch everyone eat their meals. I left after waiting in line for breakfast for 15 minutes...This was after standing in line outside for 15 minutes. We squeezed our way into the door to find another line to wait in. After 10 minutes inside watching people leisurely eat - I realized I just could not subject myself to this type of dining experience. I would never feel comfortable eating my breakfast with hungry people standing over me next to my table wishing I would hurry up. The decor further realized the nightmare that was this place. It looks like someone broke into the back room at TJ Max after Xmas and looted everything that was going to be thrown away to finish the macabre haphazard 'interior design' at Tom's. Just because it's ugly doesn't make it 'cute', it makes it 'ugly'. This is what it must feel like to be a chicken at a chicken farm. Except this place seemed a little more inhumane. I'll wait 30 minutes in line for a multimillion dollar rollercoaster experience at a theme park - not for over priced eggs-bendict that is being eyed by a line of twenty drooling hungry people. Who in the hell can stand this place?
