Positives: Fantastic pizza made in a true wood burning stove, fresh ingredients, super-delicious and salt-balanced cheese, laid-back vibe, great music, communal tables, old-school pizza place that reminds me of New Park in Howard Beach and others out on the island. Negative: Spaced out waitress with way-too-blonde-hair and thick rimmed black glasses practically ignored us, didn't tell us about the specials, nor did she ask us if we wanted to hear them, and then proceeded to give the specials to the couple next to us. Aside from this, she took about 15 minutes to bring me a bottled soda because she was too busy flirting with the two dudes at the end of the bar. Another waitress noticed that we were being ignored and asked us if we needed anything, cleared our dishes, and brought us our check without us having to ask (she also noticed that we sat for about 15 minutes and tried to get blondie's attention.) Overall, the pizza was good. Our service was the worst--even in all of Wburg and Bushwick where it matters if you're a regular...
