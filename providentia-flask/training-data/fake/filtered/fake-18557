Such a great experience.  We sat in the tavern this time and I really enjoyed it much better than the previous time when we ate in the back.  The beet salad delicious and the Red Snapper with squid was outstanding!  Next time I'll eat at the bar .  The service was perfect.  Never had a need or a want.
