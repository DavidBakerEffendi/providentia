My Mom and I recently went back to Jones.  I had not been there in a few months.  The range of food choices is excellent.  Everything they make is delicious- especially the tomato soup and grilled cheese combo.  A unique feature of Jones is that you can make your own salad.  They have a little serving list and you can select what you like in a salad.  The ambiance is great; you feel like you are in a warm, cozy environment with every visit.  This restaurant specializes in comfort food and they deliver on that premise.
