A jewel on the upper west side! The menu offers an incredible amount of diversity for a Mediterranean restaurant. From vegetarian friendly dishes to decadent seafood pasta and a sensational filet mignon -- there is really something for everyone. Great staff as well! Our waiter, Jake, was very attentive and refreshingly familiar with every item on both the food and wine menu. He suggested the most wonderful French Syrah with my entree. Also, the bartender introduced us to a sensational white wine - I highly recommend the Gruner Veltiner. Overall - great restaurant, would highly recommend.
