STAY AWAY PLEASE! I lived at the close apartments so went there quiet a bit as it was in walking distance. it wasnt the best sushi ive ever had (Masa 8 by the way) but it definitely wasnt the worst. Until one nite my roommate and I took take out back to the house and as she raised a piece of roll up to her mouth something fell off and landed in her cup of soy sauce. We dumped out the cup and it was a real, live, moving, writhing around, tape worm. My roommate and I both went straight to separate bathrooms and started throwing up while my boyfriend bagged up everything and brought it to the outside dumpster thinking it would be best for us not to come out of the bathroom and see it. Once we had calmed down about an hour later I called and they said I would need to bring in the garbage bag and show them the worm in order for any kind of refund. There was no Im sorry or concern at all. Worse yet after talking to people about the incident I talked to a girl who went to my high school and had the SAME THING HAPPEN at that place. It is dirty and disgusting I would never step foot in there again unless it was to give them hell. Please do yourself a favor and do not go here for sushi!
