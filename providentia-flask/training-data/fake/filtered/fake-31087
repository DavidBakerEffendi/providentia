Incredible coffee options (though I drink mine black) with a million vegan milks, creams, etc. etc. etc.  And even though it's just a coffee shop to a lot of people, food is also excellent.  Awesome food, coffee, atmosphere, art and music.  I can walk into Grindcore at any time of the day and know at least three people- it's a rad place to be if you want to grab something quick and hang with a couple of friends. I also love the library in the back- GREAT book selection to check out.
