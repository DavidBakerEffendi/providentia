We're half way local and finally went to Mac's.  My wife and I make it a habit to visit different establishments, so we have a pretty broad range of experience.  Well, we went to Mac's and were a little disappointed with the quantity of the menu, then made our selections. Bigger doesn't necessarily mean better. Oh my god....  The food was fabulous! We started with the buffalo  shrimp, which was non fried and absolutely refreshing! I had the burger, which was the best I have ever had, and my wife had the hot dog with turkey chili.  WHAT A GREAT DISH!  When this masterpiece arrived, we weren't sure how to tackle it.  It was so huge and so good.   Enough about that.  YES, I recommend Mac's.  Great experience and greater food.
