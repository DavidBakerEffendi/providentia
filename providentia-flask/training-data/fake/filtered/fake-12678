Was there on Sunday, 10.7. Â Snotty and rude hostess. Two of them at station. I asked a question to be seated at another table, I said I was unhappy where I was, they said- no one is holding you here, if unhappy just leave........ Food was good. Expensive. For 2- $100.00. NOISY and Noisy. Crowded......... Would I go back------NOPE.........
