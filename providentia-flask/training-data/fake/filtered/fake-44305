We dine here frequently. The restaurant uses fresh, local ingredients in French-inspired recipes that change with the seasons. The ambiance and service are superb. We particularly enjoy eating on the deck in the non-winter months. (It is also the perfect place to sit during the Quechee Balloon Festival--Father's Day Weekend.) The service is always first-rate. Adam, mentioned in other reviews, is always gracious and welcoming. His wife, Alex, is the chef who designs the delectable menu. During the winter, I love the Osso Buco, but my husband always gets the salmon, which is terrific as well. We both adore the olive tapenade that they serve with the bread. The only drawback to the Parker House is the cost. It is not easy on the wallet. However, the price is in keeping with the food quality and service, particularly in this tourist area.
