Our server Carlos was great. Really engaged with us, made recommendations on both drinks and food. They have some good craft beers on tap: I ordered a Brooklyn blast while my girlfriend ordered an allagash white I built my own burger; half pound on a brioche roll with American cheese, a sunny side up egg, and the usual fixins. Medium rare. The burger was cooked to perfection and every bite melted in my mouth. My girlfriend turned her ahi tuna burger into a salad (super cool idea) and she loved it. Â And her side was this ridiculously awesome grilled veggie skewer. The only star taken off... Overall value. When burger joints stop charging $15 a burger I'll give great food and great service the full 5 stars. But when my pocket burns at the end of the meal, me as I prob won't be back too soon because $70 for two people is a lot.
