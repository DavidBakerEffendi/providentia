If anyone has been in this resturant a year or two years ago, you will notice a huge change in the renovation of the restaurant with a newly added bar and a beautiful shrine. This place distinguishes itself as a Tibet/Bhutan/Nepal middle eastern feel, thus the name himalayan yak restaurant, with beautiful chalice like cups for water. The food is delicious, the service is great, and the presentation of the food is more extravagant then one can expect. As far as my favorite dish goes, it is still the chicken tika masala and the pork chili. It is a must try. To save some money and leave even a higher tip. The restaurant also offers Groupon deals for you bargain hunters.
