So, you walk in to Risotteria and the waitress puts a glass of AMAZING gluten free breadsticks on your table. The breadsticks are light and airy, a little bit salty but not overpoweringly. They are the best gluten free breadsticks ever! We went on a Saturday afternoon and there was no wait. It was a little bit cramped but not too much. The menu is so clear as to what is gluten free, vegetarian and dairy free. I did not have to ask the waitress a ton of questions about the ingredients because next to every gluten-free thing it said "g". The waitresses and waiters were very helpful and answered all my questions without looking at all frustrated or annoyed. They even make their own gluten-free Gorgonzola cheese, which was really nice to know. The food came quickly and was amazing. The risotto was cooked perfectly, not too hard, not too soft. The lemon and pine nut risotto was very good, the lemon was flavorful but not overpowering. . Even though it was not a lot of food it was very filling. The desserts are also very good, you would not believe that Â the eclairs are gluten free. The peanut-butter fudge cupcake was also very good, again you would not believe it was gluten free. Overall it was an amazing restaurant and a definite come-again. My only complaint was that the mozzarella cheese in the cheese plate was not very flavorful but everything else was so good that nobody minded.
