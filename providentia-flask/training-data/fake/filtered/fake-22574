I've visited a few times over the last month and unfortunately it wasn't the same experience as my first dinner here. The most recent meal was by far the worst and my last try with this place. I had a friend in town so I took her here for dinner. It didn't start out well when the server explained they were out of at least 4 or 5 items on the menu...and it's a small menu. So we ordered a few things to share. The calamari was horrid...chewy and poorly done. Both our pasta entrees were under seasoned, over cooked and flavorless. If you are going to charge $16 for a simple tomato pasta, it better be perfect and this wasn't even close. Â A big disappointment, since I really want to love this place! The ambiance is perfect and the place is stunning, the staff is friendly but I'm sorry I will be spending my money elsewhere from now on.
