We called at 630 to see if any tables were available, and they were very accommodating. We were able to get a table for five at 715. We enjoyed our meal so much! The pasta dishes were delicious. The mussels in spicy red sauce were especially good. The desserts wee great, as well. we all commented on how good the chocolate gelati tasted. We will go back to Roberto's very soon!
