The choice of beers is impressive. The pizza was not something I would go out of my way for when there are many other great choices for pizza. One of the meals was brought raw and they comped the meal. It was not edible so that would be expected. The manager came over to speak to us and really had nothing to say. One of the owners came over and did nothing. He apologize in a rather less than sincere manner. Overall completely unimpressed and will never eat there again. I certainly will never recommend the establishment to anyone.
