This restaurant seriously provided me the absolutely worst service I have ever experienced in my life.  Unfortunately, I am unable to comment on whether or not the food was good since we were so rushed and were only allotted 25 minutes for a Saturday night dinner - I barely tasted my meal.  As soon as we were seated, the wait staff and hostess continually asked my date and me every 1-2 minutes if we "made our selections for dinner yet" from an elaborate of a menu that has nearly 50 pastas dishes listed on it in various combinations.  Once our food arrived the staff constantly hovered over us and again berated with questions every 3-5 minutes about whether or not we "were done" with our meals.  They started cleaning the restaurant and putting all the chairs up on the tables while we awaited our food to arrive from the kitchen and while a few other couples finished their meals.  They even insisted on taking our dessert order before I had even tasted the pasta I ordered.  I have never experienced such a rushed, unwelcoming, and frankly offensive service by restaurant staff ever!  I felt they should never have seated us in the first place if they were unable to accommodate us in a professional and courteous manner.  (We arrived just after 10pm and were literally kicked out by 10:30!)  When I called this to the attention of the hostess she said," Well, there are plenty of other restaurants in the city!"  Trust me, I will NEVER return to Il Corallo again - it was the worst dining experience ever!!!   Don't Go!
