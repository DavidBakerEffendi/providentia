If you like hair, eat here. I was very excited about eating at Lam Zhaou Handmade Noodle. I love hole in the wall, small, family owned [kinda dirty] restaurants. Lam Zhou looked like the perfect place! No english signs on the outside, unassuming/unpretentious decor, 3 dollar dumplings! However, to my dismay, this all led to one of the worst dining experiences of my life. Â We ordered the fried dumplings, which came on a very nice metal platter. those were good, especially with the wide selection of chili sauces on the table. then came the sweet rice dumplings. Despite having never tried them, we knew the general idea and were expecting fluffy rice dumplings with sweet black curd inside. What we got was what looked like the inside of a used condom from coney island. The taste, popcorn water with grit, didn't help. The grand finale, the seafood soup, showed promise. MSG laden broth (yum) fresh baby bok choy, and noodles with just the right amount of chew. But then we noticed the plastic. Packaging from whatever base used in the broth was littered throughout the soup, I was pulling it out in terrifying quantities. The icing on the cake was the ten inch hair that made its way onto my chopstick. Needless to say, I showed this to the owners and they merely shook their head. Can't imagine it was the first time. GO ANYWHERE ELSE. ANYWHERE.
