This place overall is a great place to stop by. It's cute, it's not that big of a place. Has the best burgers in the world. Although it takes a bit of time sometimes for the food to come out, the service is great and it's definitely worth the wait. I would recommend the Korean BBQ Burger and the Lobster Dog. Their foods are pretty interesting and it's a place to take your significant other out for adult drinks and a good fulfilling snack.
