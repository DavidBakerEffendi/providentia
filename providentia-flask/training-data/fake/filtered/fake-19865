The line of the evening: "I just burped my chicken po boy and it was still just as delicious!"  My husband and I took my father-n-law, who lived in New Orleans, to try Sugarfreak. He was skeptical, especially when my husband chose the crawfish etouffee.  You could just tell he didn't think there was anyway crawfish in Queens would compare to the authentic dish from New Orleans.  Lets just say the skeptic let out a very vocal "Mmmmmm" when he took his first bite.   My husband also ordered the charbroiled oysters and thought they were absolutely delicious.  I tried the pork boudin balls and thought they were pretty good.  We came back three nights later for dinner with my brother/sis-n-law and ordered the oysters, beef n bits, crawfish boudin balls, jumbalya, crawfish etouffee, and chicken po boy.  There wasn't any food left over. The drink menu is great.  They offer New Orleans beer.  Right now they're carrying Abita 'Restoration' beer from Louisiana, which my husband really liked. We also tried the cajun martini, pimm's cup, the pumpkin spice martini, and the blackberry margarita (across the two dinners!) and they were all delicious. Especially the blackberry margarita.
