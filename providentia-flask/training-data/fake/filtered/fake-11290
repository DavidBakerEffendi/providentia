Oh, the stupidity of the average New Yorker desperately trying to be cool (sucks I wasted money here once but had to try it). What an over-rated waste of retail space. It's just a fucking french fries place, guys! Get a meal or learn to cook! I have a ton of condoments at home I can just dip french fries from anywhere in. "Like OMG, they just have french fries?! I'm like 27 and having only french fries for dinner at 2am! Erm soo hip and coOl!"
