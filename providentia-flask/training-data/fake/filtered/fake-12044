Fantastic restaurant! I had the Gnocchi, my date had the veal piccata, both were fantastic, the Gnocchi are just about the best I have ever had. Even though the weather turned and we were moved inside where they were accomidating a huge birthday party, they still kept the service friendly and attentive!!
