I would suggest to the proprietor of Juventino that he either relocate the establishment to Manhattan or open after 11:30 AM on weekends to make it clear he is not interested in having families with young children at the restaurant. No matter how many times the word 'heirloom' appears on the menu, being rude to parents of young children is not a sustainable business practice.
