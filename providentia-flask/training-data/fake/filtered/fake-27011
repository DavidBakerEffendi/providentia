Best Shawarma in Philly!!!!!! I was first introduced to chicken shawarma in Boston and i loved it. A year ago i went to Israel and ordered chicken shawarma in a shop next to the wailing wall. Not as good as Boston. I asked my Jewish friends here in Philly where i might find shawarma, and was told that Hummus was the best! Guess what folks, it is the best!!! Not only there shawarma, but everything else that i've tried at Hummus is fantastic as well. If you go, you must also try their salmon ceasar salad. Salmon was moist and perfectly cooked. Favorite middle eastern in Philly.
