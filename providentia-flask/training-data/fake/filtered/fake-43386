If you DON"T drink beer (sorry, I just don't) and just want lunch, this place is wildly over-priced and ridiculously over-lauded.  And, just an ancillary rant:  The first time I went there it was in the morning...and it was closed.  had to walk all the way back to the office hungry & pissed.  If your big food draw is, like, "Try our Eggs Benedict" (there's is something akin this)...would it kill you to be open for breakfast?!?!  Or is that just not cool?
