It looks pretty nice in there and the food is okay. It really looks better than it tastes, for the most part. My only major gripe really is that I always seem to end up paying more than what I think, from reading the menu I should be...also , bring in a groupon/yelp deal and then check out how weird it gets all of a sudden, like you blasphemed or something-seriously , the mood shifts, and then I think they just charge you whatever anyways, Why is that such a complex operation, redeeming a yelp deal?
