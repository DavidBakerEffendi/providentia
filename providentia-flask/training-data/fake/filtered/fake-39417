Food was very good, but we ordered too much.  We ordered most of the menu, so here goes. -lamb gyros app (so good we added a second order).  Note that there are only 3 mini gyros so order more than one order if you have more than 3 people. -octopus app -- delicious (the chickpeas with it are amazing). -kalamari - delicious (I didnt like as much as others, but I'm not into fried food) -spreads app -- very good hummus and taziki (sp?).  But the whipped feta really did it for me.  It would have been nice with more pita and more veggies (as we had extra spreads at the end and it would have been uncuth for me to just eat it with a spoon -- as tempted as I was) -cheese plate -- skip it.  The cheeses were delicious, but not really worth it.  And I wasn't sure what to do with half the stuff on the platter.  We ended up not really eating that platter. Entrees: GET THE BURGER.  It's the best thing in the entrees. Rabbit was delicious, but I was too full by the time it came out (my own fault). Lamb was severly undercooked -- we ordered it medium rare and it came out RAW. If we weren't all already stuffed, I would have sent it back.  The pilaf and pistachio paste were both good though. Overall:  If you get an entree, get the burger (do not get the lamb).  But better yet, just order lots of apps (not the cheese plate).  And skip the wine (neither red was very good).
