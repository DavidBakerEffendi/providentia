my wife and i had to wait 45 minutes from when we ordered to getting served--there were 2 other tables occupied at the time---during this time the restaurant manager was courting a female patron at the counter--our server did his best to speed up the kitchen--out of frustration our waiter indicated to us that the kitchen is very inconsistent with preparation of the food and with timeliness--both of which we experienced--my wife's clams and mussels were very salty and my shrimp were overcooked-----we will NOT return to this restaurant
