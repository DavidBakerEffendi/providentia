We went here for dinner as it was recommended to us by our friends. As we sat down the table next to us was complaining to the waiter that the food was too hot and spicy. But we thought we r Indians and we are used to this. We ordered Mutton Roghan Josh, Chilli Chicken. And both were EXTREMELY spicy and hot to an extent we started sweating. There wasnt any flavour, but just Red chilly powder and hot pepper. We then overheard another customer complaining to the staff that the food was spicy. So in a span of an hour they had 3 customers complaining of their spice level. I certainly will NEVER recommend this place to anybody. And never will I go back, a shame in the name of indian food.
