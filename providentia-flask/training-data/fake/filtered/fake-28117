Happened upon this cozy place happily while strolling the East Village in search of a nice brunch spot. Loved the sparkle of the chandeliers, decorative tin ceiling and the warm wood and brick textures. We slipped into a bench booth against the wall overlooking the elegant bar. Sedate, local, but happening. We spied dishes had by other guests...the white bean dip with spiced pita chips looked spectacular. We started with the Shitake mushroom tart with black truffel oil...amazing! Followed by the sauteed shrimp over grits (I love buttery grits!) with a side of chicken fennel sausage, and "The Francisco" a combination of scrambled eggs, squash, sundried tomatoes and basil with a side of sausage or bacon. UNBELIEVABLE flavors! Topped with cold refreshing wine goblets of Mimosas. We were so elated by our discovery, we called a couple of friends to join us on the spot. Service, food, and atmosphere ....Wonderful.
