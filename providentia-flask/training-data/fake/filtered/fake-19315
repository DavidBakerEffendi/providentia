Just tried to go to Aita for brunch (3:30 pm on a Saturday).  There was no one waiting, and they had an empty table of four composed of two smaller tables of two.  The waitress wouldn't seat us at a table of four, wouldn't pull them apart (which could have been done very easily without disrupting the flow of the restaurant) and strangely wouldn't tell us how long the wait was.  We left feeling confused and very unwelcome.
