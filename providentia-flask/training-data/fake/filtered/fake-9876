I was surprised when I saw so many positive reviews here. I love trying different food. I frequent many vegan and Middle eastern restaurants. The food at Vegetarian Mama was disappointing to me. The falafel was mushy and greasy. The hummus was bland and we also tried to eggplant that was also mushy and greasy. i thought the whole point of healthy food was to also prepare it in a healthy way too. I was very disappointed that the food was so greasy and bland.
