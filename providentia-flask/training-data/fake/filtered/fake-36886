This place has since changed it's name to "Sushilaco". We stumbled upon this gem while on our way back to PA. The food was nicely presented. The flavor was outstanding. The ingredients were really fresh. We sat at the sushi bar and watched our lunch prepared. The work area was very clean as well as the refrigerator cases that hold the fish. The staff courteous & professional. We also received 2 pieces of salmon at the end of our meal. It was like cool butter, awesome! The place is a little on the small side but we'll be back & we'll stand if we have to. Did I mention it was soooo fresh!!
