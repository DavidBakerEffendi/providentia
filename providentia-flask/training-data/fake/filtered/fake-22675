We had three course meal for a family of 8 at the fixed price of $35 per person. No problem with the service and the food was fine. The third course was dessert which consisted of a couple of pieces of cake per person. NO COFFEE!  Would it really cut into their profits to throw in a cup of coffee a part  of the third course? It was the sore point of the evening.
