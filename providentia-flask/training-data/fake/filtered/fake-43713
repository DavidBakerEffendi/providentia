I'm thrilled to live just a few doors down from Paulie Gee's. Everything was spot-on a few nights ago. It was, by far, the best Neapolitan pizza I've ever had. Paulie Gee himself came by and explained the origin of the special pizza we ordered--very personal and a lovely, welcoming gesture. The arugula salad was also quite tasty and the van Leeuwen ice cream was a perfect finale to the meal. I'm eagerly awaiting the arrival of wine to pair with the food. All in all, a wonderful culinary experience in a cozy neighborhood space.
