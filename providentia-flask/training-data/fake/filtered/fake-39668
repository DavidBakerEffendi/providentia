I have a background in small businesses so i might be bias.  Comparing this chinese restaurant to the others around town I really favor east.  Although they are a bit price you pay for what you get, and that's quality.  they have a very diverse menu from thai, to americanized chinese food to authentic cantonese chinese food and even japanese food.  although the japanese food is limited i believe they are expanding.  the place isn't that big, but they staff are quite nice.   I would definitely recommend to try this place if you are in the town and looking to try something new, and if it isn't your kind of place the first time you go, then don't go again, but i would suggest you let the manager know if you are not satisfied they are really nice in a way that they will give you a discount or something.  also if you become really good friends with the staff they give you free food sometimes.
