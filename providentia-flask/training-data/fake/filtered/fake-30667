I recently tried out their new location and it is honestly the most gorgeous restaurant in town.  It's no longer a diner, it is now a restaurant with a very modern classy flare, which is obvious the moment you walk in. Last night, I started with a glass of Pinot Grigio paired with the shrimp scampi over linguini and it was delicious, the shrimp were huge, seasoned to perfection and very fresh.   I then finished it off with their homemade icebox cake which is literally to die for!  I haven't had a meal this delicious in a very long time.   I highly recommend trying their new location as the atmosphere is wonderful and the food is consistently delicious, always fresh and made with the highest quality of food.   Simply delicious and a must try!!!!
