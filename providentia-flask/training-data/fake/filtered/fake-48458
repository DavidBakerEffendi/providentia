Nice gooey cheese & grease dripping down at the end of the roll.  What else is better.  My fav is having it with pepper.  I wrapped the end with napkins to avoid a trip to the cleaner.  I would give this place a 5-star if it's in a warmer climate.  No indoor seating in Winter is a little harsh. A quick comment regarding Pat's vs Gino's vs Jim's vs Tony Luke's: Gino's - a bit dry, and can use more meat Jim's - In super heavy tourist area and finding a place to pull over the car is impossible.  Parking?  Forget about it! Tony Luke's - Not bad, but a bit over dressed.  If you the kind that order "garbage pie" when eating Pizza, then you should be happy
