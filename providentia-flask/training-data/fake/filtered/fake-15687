We happened to walk in today, not knowing that this was a new place or that they had JUST opened for business. LOVED IT!  Service was attentive, friendly, and prompt. The margaritas with freshly-squeezed lime juice were great, and the food was delicious and flavorful.  Good value for the money, on top of that.  Also -- and this is just a personal preference -- the menu is nice and tight, as opposed to sprawling.  They've got a good set of starters, a nice selection of tacos, tasty drinks, and desserts (though we didn't try these....next time).
