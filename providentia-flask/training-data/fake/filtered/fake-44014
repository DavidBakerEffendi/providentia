Based on reviews here we decided to give a visit to Caracas Arepa Bar. Can't say we were disappointed, but at the same time I don't really get the amazing reviews on here. The food was alright, but nothing more than that. Arepas are small, but filling, but I couldn't help to think it's a dish you can easily and cheaply make yourself at home. Hibiscus Ice Tea is disgusting. Maybe I just don't like Hibiscus. Whatever that is. The service was good, no complaints there.
