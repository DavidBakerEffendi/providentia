Walter Foods...amazing. I took my mother to this quaint spot when she was in town.  The service was completely on point.  Our server was personable and attentive... he even thought my mom was my sister, so I know she'd give this place 5 stars for that alone.  Uniforms have an old school vintage feel, as does the entire restaurant. The waiter was also knowledgeable about the wine list and offered a suggestion that was perfect. Food was great (the salmon was tasty & steak was a nice cut, cooked just right), but I'd skip the dessert. Ambiance was welcoming. Candle-lit tables... cozy-vibe. Pricing reasonable for offerings and portion sizes. Would totally recommend this place to anyone.
