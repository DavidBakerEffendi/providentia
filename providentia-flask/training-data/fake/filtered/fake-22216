I've been coming to this place for years after stumbling on it during  a lunch break. I've been here for the calm hours of lunch, chatty hours of dinner, and the bar scene after with live music. It's so comfortable and the decor is really nice. I usually get the chicken pot pie ( flaky crust & soda bread are the die for Mmm) or the fish and chips (delicious) Decent beer - the food has always been good and the service was polite and friendly. Honestly,  I'm usually so wrapped up in the conversations at my table I'm not really looking for a super enigmatic server. I really love this place and have zero complaints!
