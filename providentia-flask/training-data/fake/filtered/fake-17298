Honestly, I just had the best steak sandwich that i have ever had !!! unbelievable .... Being in the restaurant business and having run Uncle Jacks steakhouse, I think I might know what I am talking about. 4th time at this place, always friendly bartenders, and now I can say an exceptional cuisine far from pub food. Glad to have Alfies in my neighborhood..............
