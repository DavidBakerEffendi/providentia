I have been to Trumpets many, many times. Whatever we eat there is good. The music is always wonderful. I've heard exceptional singers: Marlene Ver Planck, Kate Baker,Hunter Hayes and Nicolas Bearde in an intimate setting, close to the stage.  The staff is very friendly and always tries to please. The staff is warm, friendly and accommodating. I recommend it to all of my friends and continue to come back.  The owners and staff make you feel like family. Prices are very reasonable. Expect to pay a cover charge for live music. It is well worth it!
