If you feel like wasting time and money, I would highly recommend going to this poor excuse of a restaurant. If I could give this restaurant negative stars, I would. We have been to the McGillicuddy's On The Green a few times since we live in the complex the restaurant is located in. The first time we went in, we left and said that we would never go back. We both ordered burgers, they took an extremely long time and were disgustingly overcooked. Service wasn't that great either. We went back a second time, as we had heard that the food and service were a lot better from a co-worker. Well, it was a little better. We ordered burgers again, and they came out cooked much better. The service was a little better also. Our last and final time chance for McGillicuddy's On The Green was just a disaster. We went in and were seated. Our server appeared approximately 10 minutes later, took our drink orders, brought our drinks over and walked away. We closed our menus hoping that he would take a hint and come take our food orders. No such luck. 30 minutes later we decided that it was time to leave. It was very nice of a few of the employees to thank us on our way out, although I'm not sure what exactly we were being thanked for. I hope that our server had fun talking to all of his friends on his phone and I also hope that his team won their game, since the tv was more entertaining then serving his customers. Thanks for walking by us a couple times to play on the computer too. If you're looking for somewhere better to eat and drink, try the Bowling Alley in Colchester. It has the same frozen food that you'll find at McGillicuddy's, but the service and atmosphere is a lot better.
