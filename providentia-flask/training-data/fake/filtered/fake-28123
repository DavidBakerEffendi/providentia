Went there based on good recommendations. The staff acted like they were doing me a favor letting me dine there. My wife and I ordered chicken dishes and the chicken had a sour taste on both dishes. The owner acted like I was to blame. He refunded the price of the entree but not the (one) egg role I had eaten, I had to pay $2.00. Stay away.
