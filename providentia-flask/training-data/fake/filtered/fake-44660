Nice neighborhood cafe. Very cozy and airy. Excellent place to come and do homework. Amazing food, though I would eat in rather than take out. They do not provide the side salads and such when you order the sandwiches to go. Coffee is average, but the service is always excellent, even though it can be a bit slow.
