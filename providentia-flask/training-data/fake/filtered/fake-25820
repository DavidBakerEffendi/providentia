I went to this place few weeks ago just didnt have the chance to post a review. This is the very first time I've been to very Greek restaurant and this is what i have to say: the food was very fresh and amazing. We had some greek salad with feta and octopus and greek fries. Also, we had few drinks there and it was also very tasteful Â .The place inside looks very nice.I absolutely love the idea of having kitchen before by eyes as food gets prepared .The service was great, great food, great experience. I will 100% go back!!!!!I
