We called the folks at Jersey Diner to accommodate a group of 15-20 after a funeral at a nearby cemetery. Contacted them the day before and didn't even leave my name but when we arrived, a room had been set aside for us and the staff very graciously accommodated our group. The food was all good. No one had any complaints so I don't understand these negatives comments. Our dishes ranged from soups (a very good lentil soup) to sandwiches and wraps, fries, etc. All well prepared and tasty. We stayed for quite a while and were given all the time we needed to hang out. Â I will add, too, that we actually arrived in the area early and had breakfast there. Omelettes and coffee were good!
