Arrived around 1pm and were advised that there would be a 1/2 hour wait. After waiting 45 minutes we were advised, despite many open tables, that the kitchen was really backed up and we would have to wait "maybe" another 15 or 20 minutes. We left at that point feeling that they were not able to competently estimate a time when they might be able to serve us. Whatever the quality of the food or ambience the management of this restaurant leaves much to be desired.
