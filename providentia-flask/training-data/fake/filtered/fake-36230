Pizza was good but I have no idea what the rave is about. Born and raised in NYC and haven't been to Grimaldi's until recently. I was not impressed by my experience to the place. With lines out the door, I'm assuming they make money there. Please invest in some new seats on the inside. Different color fake leather seats that are ripped and patched over. The Pandora isn't even the subscription Pandora. You guys can pay $4.95 a month for commercial free music. If you want good pizza, there are hundreds of places to go to in Brooklyn. Grimaldi's is good for a one time try just to say you went to the 'World' famous place, but nothing special beyond that. Try Di Fara as well.
