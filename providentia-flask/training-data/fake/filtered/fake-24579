Wow this place has been here since late 1800's.  I give this one a 3.5.  The pizza is quite tasty....but our crust came out quite burnt.  The clam pizza was tasty....but the clams were very very chewy.  Of course you can't beat the traditional tomato, mozzarella, and basil.   I still love the vodka sauce pizza I had on Lafayette... forgot what this place  was called.
