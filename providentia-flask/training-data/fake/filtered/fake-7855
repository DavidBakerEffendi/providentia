We had an excellent dinner at Sweetwaters!  The service was among the best in Burlington. Our waitress was friendly, knowledgeable and appropriately attentive.  My meal was delicious.  The Tomato Caper Salmon had just the right crisp on top and was tender and moist inside.  The tomato caper relish was the perfect touch with this generous cut of fish.  I appreciated the waitress accommodating all of our dietary requests, including mine for extra vegetables.  Without question, the location is probably one of the best on Church Street.  There are very few restaurants in Burlington that I think are worth dining in.  Sweetwaters is one of the few and I will definitely return and recommend it to others.  THANK YOU!
