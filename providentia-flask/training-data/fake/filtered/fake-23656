GREAT SERVICE, GREAT FOOD, GREAT Â DRINKS, GREAT ATMOSPHERE!!!!!. My fiance and I went in last minute on a tuesday night and we had the best experience. It all starts with the great drinks at the bar while waiting for our table. We got seated actually very close to the people next to us and ended up just joining tables for an impromptu double date! The food was great, we got the chicken chez moi which is awesome and the steak tartare was perfectly seasonned. Go and let the fanciful cocktails delight you into an evening of fun and fulfillment!
