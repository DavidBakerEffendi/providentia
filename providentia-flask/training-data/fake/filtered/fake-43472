Paisanos! Paisanos! Paisanos! I don't know what else to say about this place, but that I love it. I eat here all the time and I have not had one bad experience. My favorite is the Penne Amatriciana, but there are so many great dishes. The staff is great and perfect for a family party or just a date.
