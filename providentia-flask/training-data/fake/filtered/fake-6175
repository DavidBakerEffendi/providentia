I almost hate to write this as I'm afraid it will  make it more difficult to get a table! This is, by far, the BEST Italian restaurant in Philadelphia. The first time I went there, several years ago, they had a dish on the menu called Shrimp Trentino, and I fell in love with it. the next time i went back, it was off the menu. I tried other dishes in the following visits and loved all of them. But, I finally asked them if they would make me Shrimp Trentino,  and they did. Now I can order it any time I go,although I am always happy with anything I order. Their bolognase sauce is amazing and we always order some to take home with us. Being able to bring our own wine just makes it perfect. There is not much on the menu we have not tried and we have never been disappointed. Just to complete the picture, the service is wonderful... everyone is so warm and friendly....you feel like part of the family. I cannot recommend this place highly enough. Six stars, at least!
