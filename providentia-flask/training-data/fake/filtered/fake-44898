Finally the real deal in true Italian food and ambiance. Just like a trendy trattoria in Trastevere in Rome...Emporio brings joy to your sight and stomach. Friendly service and a menu that changes often, sign that they obviously use the freshest ingredients. I think I ate there 5 times before I actually tried something from the regular menu because I couldn't give up on trying Â the specials, which make me salivate by the time I finish reading them. From the appetizers, I highly recommend the chicken liver pate, if you can handle it... it gently melts in your mouth as you are surprised by the crunchiness of the crushed hazelnuts and the tickling of the fleur de sel. All of their pasta dishes are to dream for, and try anything that has "guanciale" as an ingredient. They use the real kind, not the imitation, easy to find "smoked bacon". Trust me, you can't fool me on this one. I usually stress the fact I like my pasta "al dente", I wouldn't dare to do so at Emporio, they never fail. Once you get to know the staff, they remember you and you feel welcome and special every time you go back. I recommended this restaurant to everyone I know and always got great feedback. I'm an UES chick but Emporio is well worth the $20 cab ride (cheaper than a flight back to my hometown ROMA!)
