Bah to most of the nay sayers, I was from Bayonne many years ago, and never had the good fortune to eat there, but now, when I only go down to visit 'family' it's my favorite haunt.  Longhorns, better?  Please, try the sauerbraten, w/the awesome potato pancakes! This to me is the best in the world, and I've been AROUND the world.
