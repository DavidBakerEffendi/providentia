This was our first meal at Trattoria Dell'Arte and we were very pleased with the food and the service. The staff was very attentive to our needs and were very helpful. The pizza was excellent. I had the lobster risotto fra diavolo and it was fabulous. Everyone in our group was pleased with the experience and I highly recommend this restaurant for a good italien meal in the city.
