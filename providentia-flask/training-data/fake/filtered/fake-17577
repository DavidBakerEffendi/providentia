Service was excellent! Food: our group got the Benedict Jane/Johnny. No one raved about their dish. It was pretty OK, but none of us would pay that price just to taste the dish again. I also ordered their famous vanilla bean french toast. Maybe my expectation was so high after reading all the reviews, but it's just not something to write home about. It was creamy/custardy...but again not worth paying $16. Maybe for a special occasion, it'd be worth it going on Sunday for the complimentary drink.
