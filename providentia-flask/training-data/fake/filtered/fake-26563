The food was all excellent. For beginners they offer a meat and vegetarian sampler, which I would highly recommend for anyone who has not had Ethiopian food before. Service is the only iffy part, we had a few different waiters throughout the night, water could have been colder and replenished a bit more frequently, but overall a great experience!
