My boyfriend and I came here on the Saturday of Labor Day and what a pleasant surprise. We ordered the Arugula salad that started off the dinner right as it had fennel and pickled red onions with truffle oil. This was followed by the soft shell crab dish, tagliatelle with lamb ragu and 3 side dishes: pan fried corn, broccoli rabe and assorted mushrooms. Everything was cooked to perfection. The chef actually came over to our table as well as the manager to make sure we were being taken care of and very happy, which we were. There are just so many elements to this restaurant that stand out. The decor is interesting and cozy, the food was amazing and the staff extremely attentive. Something one typically doesn't expect in the fashion district. I was really impressed!
