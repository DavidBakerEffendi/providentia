Awful! Dont bother ...unless you enjoy being insulted by the owner and  some of the worst service in the City. We were rushed through our dinner (entree super salty) Plates were being cleared whilst others were eating. The final insult was the owner (he reminded us all of that fact) taking the water from the table whilst we were finishing the overpriced wine as our two hour table time limited has expired. Many ways to handle this most delicate of situations, they were not even close to hitting the mark.   I was hit by at least three stray handbags. Classless, young crowd. The place itself will remain popular by those that believe this is a "speak-easy" and its mysterious backdoor but those who really understand what makes a good restaurant will not return. My worst dining experience to date.
