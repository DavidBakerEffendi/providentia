My fiancé and I took our granddaughter to breakfast because of the great reviews I heard in the past.  The food was lousy! The coffee was lukewarm and the service was worse than the food.  The prices are very expensive for the terrible food served.  The dishes were dirty and the servers act like they don't know what's going on.  The seating is too close - if feels like you are sitting on top of each other - very loud!  I try my best to patronize black owned businesses but when they are not up to par I keep it moving.  I asked a few friends of mine if they had eaten at the Café and they advised that they did and the food was lousy and the prices were expensive.  I could have gotten much more food, better service for less money at IHOP.  Please take all of these constructive criticisms and try to improve on the quality of food and servers.  Thanks, Charmane
