I think some of the review is fake. I am from Sapporo, Japan and I am studing at Princeton University.  My father is a fisherman in Japan, I know fresh fish very well.  This Sushi Palace have bad fish.  If you eat too much bad fish, you will get sick.  When my order arrival my table, I told the girl this fish not fresh, please give me fresh fish.  The girl no give me fresh and make me pay for not fresh fish I did not eat. This place is not very clean, I see some crumb on chair and on floor. Not recommand from a Japanese Lady.
