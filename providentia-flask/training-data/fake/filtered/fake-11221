Went here with a friend a while ago & sometimes still go when I'm looking for a delicious, cheap, and quick meal. Usually get the pork or shrimp dumplings and I'm never disappointed. The physical space is pretty small with only a few able to eat inside at one time and I've never had problems with the service here. Great meal!
