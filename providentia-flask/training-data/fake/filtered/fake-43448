HOSTESS RUDE:  made reservations on Monday for last nights dinner. I requested to sit in the courtyard and the gentleman with the thick accent told me no problem as long as it wasn't raining. Took my name for 3 people.  Arrived 10 minutes early for 7:30 reservation. Was told it would be a while. Well everyone that came in after me got seated. I was then told my the young Blonde girl there that they could not accommodate my party of 3 either inside or out.  I was quite angry. Would not recommend this  place to anyone.. You don't treat people this way. BOOOOO
