Nobody has really captured how great this place is... yes it is spendy- but I don't go everyday.  that being said- delicious pancakes, real, thick bacon, fresh squeezed oj, real maple syrup, huge portions (if you're into that kind of thing) - yummy fresh sausage- who cares about service- yes it's always a teenager but at least they are trying.  Number 1 in my book.
