We came to Rosa Blanca celebrating our seven year anniversary and we were so happy with our choice to come here. When you first walk into Rosa Blanca, the atmosphere is that of a cute, Cuban diner. The diner bar seats turn to a bar section as you walk in, and then you enter the booth and table seating section - this is where we dined. It is a really cute restaurant. It is nice without feeling stuffy and decorated enough to make you know you're in a Cuban restaurant while restrained enough to not feel like you're dining in Disney World. Our server, Andalyn, was awesome. She was sweet, funny, had great recommendations (the Ah Fuego cocktail - yum!), and always made sure we had what we needed. The food (and we love and know Cuban food well) was delicious! The bread at the beginning was divine, our entrees (ropa vieja and vaca frita) were amazing, and the cocktails were out of this world. My vaca frita was so tender and I loved the pickled onions on top; my husband declared his ropa vieja was the best he's ever had. We also tried the pineapple guac and pineapple dessert, which were very good, but I'd trade them for something else next time. The only thing we had that was below average were the tostones - they were definitely too salty (and I like salt) and overcooked (very crunchy) to the point where they reminded me of a McDonald's hashbrown. But just steer clear of those and you are going to have a meal to remember for a long time. We would definitely recommend this place and are already talking about bringing family here when they come to visit. Thanks for an awesome night, Rosa Blanca!
