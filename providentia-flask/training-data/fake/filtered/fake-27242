Went in for an earlier dinner at 630 and loved the date-night romantic feel. Gnocchi were absolutely amazing. The wait staff was so attentive and accommodating!!! We heard all about the amazing gnocchi and couldn't decide between the flavor combinations, so the lovely staff made all the combinations of tomato, Gorgonzola, spinach and potato gnocchi/sauce combinations possible. We couldn't pick between desserts so they let us have a sampler plate of all of them for the price of 2 desserts for 2 people. Not once were our water glasses empty or plates on the table waiting for the staff to help us. Espresso as well as being able to date your wine cork and add it to their collection for memories when we return was worth the trip alone. So many good things to say about it - you have to go.
