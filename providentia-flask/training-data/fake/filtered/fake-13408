C&M has all the pretense of being a high-end enterprise but without any of the actual talent. Too much attention is placed on elaborate presentation with too little attention placed on ingredients or taste. The last few meals here have been terrible (and over-priced). The staff are largely, and seemingly intentionally, lethargic. Overall C&M is not very good diner food wrapped in an expensive bow.
