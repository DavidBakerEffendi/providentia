I dont need to write too many words as the 5 stars are worth of thousand words for this place. Completely revolutionary idea of serving people of Philadelphia city. The owner is great guy and helps us find the right choice of Dosa. The Sambar is just authentic and I love the way they offer different chutneys. The addition of chicken items is definitely a plus point now.
