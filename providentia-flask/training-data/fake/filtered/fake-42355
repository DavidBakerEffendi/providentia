Easily the best deal in Manhattan.  Don't blink or you might miss it - its very small and the signage is pretty bad.  But the food is excellent.  My wife is from Beijing and is totally addicted to pork and leek dumplings.  These completely passed her scrutiny.  They aren't as good as her parents homemade ones, but I don't have to wait for 3 hours for these. The beef on sesame bun is also good, highly recommend.  I'm not sure how they even make money with the prices they charge.
