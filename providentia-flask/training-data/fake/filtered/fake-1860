Truth be told, there isn't a huge difference between the quality of food here, and say, the quality of food you might experience at Applebee's. But what makes this spot more appealing than a casual dining chain is the novelty of its Thai menu, the accessible hipster vibe, and an East Village destination. Service is knowledgable, fast and friendly, and the restaurant's community of patrons seems dominated by a set of unassuming, 20-something, middle-class diners eager to spend their paychecks on a dinner at sit-down restaurant. All the entrees seemed a bit disappointing, from the chicken pad thai to the sweat potato lamb dish topped with nan. They were of average quality, and seemed to lack the care of a talented chef. Maybe it was just line cooks, and the sous or executive chef were on vacation. Our dessert, Â a goat cheese and coconut cheesecake, was a bummer too. It seemed more like whip cream in a cup than the description our server gave us. Ngam is best for small plates and the cheaper cocktails (as low as $8), but not worth the splurge if you're planning a full multi-course dinner.
