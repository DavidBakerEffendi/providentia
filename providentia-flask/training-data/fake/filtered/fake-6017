I've lived in Montclair for a while now. this restaurant has the best Turkish food around. It's a great place for parties, family dinner, and a great place to meet friends for lunch. The luch specials are fantastic, they give an enormous amount of food for just $10. My favorite dishes are the stuffed cabbage, spinach stew, and chicken kebab, not to mention their soups are phenomenal and the staff is very kind and friendly. I always recommend this place to everyone :)
