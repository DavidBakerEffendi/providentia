The MEATBALLS are worth the 4 hour drive from my town. No joke. After reading all the folks reviews here, nothing really surprises me as far as Italian Restaurants go. The best one in my town of Richmond VA has a ton of quirks, but the food is worth it. So who cares if a place isn't that fancy, or has paper menus? So what? This place is as authentic as it gets. Old school, and great food. When I first walked through the Italian Market, myself and two other ladies were searching for a good restaurant. This 85 yr old man gave us the tour of the block, and recommended two places...this one for a meal, and this other one for sandwiches. We opted for sandwiches and went on our way. The next day was the Italian Festival, and my family and I decided to try this for lunch. They sat us very quickly ( we had 10 in our party), and our waitress, was awesome (can't remember her name). All of us had different items, from the Mussels in a Red Sauce and White Sauce, the Villa Salad, Sausage and Peppers, Meatball Sub, to the Eggplant Parm that I got. I stole some of my mom's meatballs, and they were SO DELICIOUS! Wish I had ordered them, but my dish was just as tasty. I'll definately be back for the meatballs. The owners and family were all very nice. They were selling beer outside for the Festival, and treated us to some ice cold Peroni's! Make sure you bring cash though! Plastic doesn't work here. :-)
