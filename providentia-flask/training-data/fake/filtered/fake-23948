the foood is absolutely great, i have been coming here once a month with my family and trying different stuff from the menu and everything i have ordered so far is out of this world especially the mix veg. kabab roll and veg. biryani. the host are very nice and plesent to us and he always makes us laugh and feel welcome like if we are at home . 100% great service and i will recomend this restaurant to anyone who is looking for great vegetarian food
