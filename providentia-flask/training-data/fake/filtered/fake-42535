We were so excited to have our sons rehearsal dinner for 33 people here! Unfortunately,it did not go well. We arrived on a cold March night and were told that the propane that heats the bow deck had not been delivered that week so there was no heat. We spent the evening in our coats. It was not until after my husband and son said they were going to Home Depot for propane did they bring in more heaters. my son got one heater to work. We had preordered for the group and the roasted pig  was supposed to be plentiful according to Christine the sales manager. It fed maybe 17. When I went for dinner the salad bowls were empty and I had to ask for more lettuce.  The meat  was gone and I was told there was no more. After a long debate I was told they would bring something else out which they did. Shredded pork? About 30 minutes later.... At thiis point it had been last call. Our Pastor had been given a piece of skin and was told there was no more meat We brought a cake which was thrown on a table  the coffee was served from the bar and when you asked for cream .. you were handed a container of Heavy cream. Embarrassing yes but the worst part is that after a discussion with the manger who stated he would. call me back.... I have received no response  after 3 more phone calls DO Not trust these people!  There was no excuse for not having heat, not refilling a salad bowl, inadequate amounts of food and the worst customer service I have ever experienced.
