My family & I have dined at Miele's many times over the years, but this past weekend was the first time we had them cater our event and it was FABULOUS.  What a great place for our party.  Carol, Steve, and their Staff were beyond accomodating and very friendly.  The food was terrific and they had just the right variety & amount for our group.  We had the restaurant to ourselves and it was just perfect for our party of 26.  We would definately recommend this venue if you're looking to host a special occasion, you won't be disappointed!
