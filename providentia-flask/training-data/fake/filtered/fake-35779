with all the filipinos in the area, it's about time i have a place to go to get good home style filipino food that reminds me of my dad's cooking.  the place is clean, the people are friendly, and the food is fresh.  i especially like the pinakbet and the adobo, and the bbq is awesome.  she was able to provide me with a tray of pancit in record time and it was a hit at the party.  looking forward to my next visit :)
