The only reason anyone should ever wait for a table at this place is for the Pancakes! AMAZING! My friend and I started out with the Egg Benedict with salmon and the Spanish Omelet, we also had tea. The problem with both of these dishes was that they came out cold. Even our tea was barely luke warm. WTH? The Egg Benedict would have been a whole lot better had it been hot, the spanish omelet was more like baked eggs than an omelet and neither one of us liked it. The Pancakes with the berries made up for it though, absolutely amazing! I would never go to this place again if not for those pancakes. YUM. 5 Stars for the Pancakes, less than 3 for everything else!
