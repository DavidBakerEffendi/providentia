We chose Glasserie for our annual Christmas dinner with friends and are so sad we did. Our experience was a disappointment from start to finish. The room was unwelcoming and poorly lit, the folding chairs were horribly uncomfortable, and the choice of music intrusive and blaring. The service was substandard in every way. Our server--a tall, intimidating woman with a French accent and a sour attitude--rolled her eyes when we asked for assistance ordering, then quickly disappeared. She couldn't explain the concept of the menu. Our drinks alone took 20 minutes to arrive, and when we inquired about our appetizers after waiting 40 minutes, our server snapped, "I don't know where they are, I'm not in the kitchen, am I?" When the food finally did show up, nearly every dish was overly seasoned. The Lamb & bulghur croquettes were overcooked and tough. The fried cauliflower was too salty. The grilled potatoes with Spanish cheese was the universal favorite, though we were so hungry at that point we could have eaten the flatware. Getting refills on our drinks was next to impossible and came with a price: a pissy look and a finger in the air that translated to "You'll get your drinks when I'm good and ready." I'm so sorry to say that we won't be returning...and we are in the neighborhood! We had such high hopes.
