fantastic, we stopped in for a late lunch.,after touring the grounds.   service was great by a waiter named JOE  if he was busy with something else another waiter would jump in they where all great . my wife had the burger cooked just the way she liked it. she said the cheese could of been 10 seconds early .  she would of gave it 5+ stars. oh they kept filling her ice tea .  i had the muslels they where great .  wine by the glass  was a good choice.  there bread very good . nice touch with the salt sprinkled on top of it. the place was a nice touch after touring the grounds. i will be back its  a hour drive for me but worth it .  we where there on sept 16. this is not a french resturant . but a AMERICAN resturant . with a  french flavour  fine taste
