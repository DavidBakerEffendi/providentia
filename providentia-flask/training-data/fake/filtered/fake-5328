OMG.  I must say that I eat here at least twice a week.  The food is superb and super-affordable.  They have 6 beers on tab, and a bottle list twice as long.  The staff will do anything for you, and there is always an owner around looking to say hi. If you have even the slightest inkling of coming here for dinner, stop reading this review and get your ass over there.  And make sure you have the pretzel.
