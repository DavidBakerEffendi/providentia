It is amazing to me how little effort tourists put into finding a decent cheese steak. The ONLY reason to go to Pats or Geno's is if it is 2 AM and you want to eat rubber and liquid cheese which is made out of vinyl and then look really stupid and rave about this thiing they call a sandwich. Everytime I read one of these reviews I get embarrased for the city. Ask a long timer how to get to John's roast pork or Chinks or D'Allesandro's and when you get there, whatever you do, do NOT ask for whiz!!
