Spanish Pavilion, Â Harrison, NJ Spanish Restaurants, Catering Services, Restaurants Review Date: 11/06/2011 This was the worst experience i have had in a long time eating out. The food was over priced. The atmosphere was depressing and the decor was cheap looking. My son ordered chicken in garlic sauce and we could not make out what type of poultry it actually was. Our waiter was indifferent and uninterested. I do not recommend this restaurant and plan on never eating there again.
