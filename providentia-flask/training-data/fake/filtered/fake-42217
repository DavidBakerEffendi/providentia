I am not an adventurous eater but I saw a picture of the short ribs with strawberries and had to come! I went on a double date and hit the jack pot with this place! The ribs were delicious as well as the pork sliders....if you go, you HAVE to get the pork sliders...they are unlawful how good they are...and no matter how full you get...always make room for coffee ice cream and bacon donuts...*having my homer simpson moment*... Anyway I didn't know what half the stuff on the menu was and I'm not an adventurous eater but I love good food and the waiter/waitress will help you understand the family style small dishes you'll order...the place is on the small side so its ideal to come in groups of 2 or 4 and while eating a few familiar things, this chef reinvents some oldies but goodies and makes you explore new foods outside of your comfort zone and not regret it. P.S. Make a reservation! You may not get in without one.
