If you like to be treated like a piece of trash by the bartender because you asked for a Miller Lite beer instead of one of the WAY overpriced beers, that I've never heard of, this place is for you.  Why do these places charge so much money for a tiny bit of food and overpriced drinks?  What makes these places think they're so high class?
