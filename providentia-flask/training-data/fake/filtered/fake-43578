My fiancee and I had dinner here on a weekend trip to Philadelphia. Everything we ordered was amazingly good, well prepared and fresh. The service was excellent. We did not drink here so can not comment on the drinks. But the atmosphere was a perfectly romantic and intimate. The room was well decorated. The staff and server friendly. The server knew the menu and made great recommendations. I will be back and this will be one of our regular restaurants on our visits to Philly.
