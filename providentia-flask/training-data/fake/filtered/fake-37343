Amazing meal! I had the Croque Vert and it was unforgettable.  The very light sweetness of the French Toast complemented the savory vegetables and the sauce was perfect and flavorful and not too heavy. This breakfast was one of the best things about our trip. The saddest part is that I am from Wisconsin and so can't eat there all the time!  Then again, maybe living far away keeps me from going broke and getting very fat...
