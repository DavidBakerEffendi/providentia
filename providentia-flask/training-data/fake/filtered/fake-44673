New venue for Thursday, Friday and Saturday nights. Check it out! LaVa transforms from friendly laid back hang out cafe to a you-won't-recognize night softened mix of intelligence and romance. Stop in to review menu--made 3 picky eater/spenders happy all way around. Apps alone measure up fresh and delightful (one we think best in city). BYOB. We vote YES to this venture and like it better than standard bar/restaurants so each to own. Hope more see the light so we keep them around.
