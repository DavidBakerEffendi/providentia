If you like Prime Rib and you want a big slice of it this is the restaurant to go to!  Friday and Saturday nights are when they serve it and if you really want to make it special, ask for it Cajun Style.  OMG!!!!  DELICIOUS!!!!  Also their breakfast buffets on Saturday and Sunday mornings cannot be beat!  Great price and lots and lots of breakfast foods to choose from...all hot and fresh!
