Absolutely a great place for coffee in University City! The staff is friendly, the drinks are great, and the atmosphere is cozy. Â Sometimes there are no tables available, but I can't fault them for being busy. If I had to make one recommendation, STAY OPEN LATER!!! University City needs a late night coffee option!
