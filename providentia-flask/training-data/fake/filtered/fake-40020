My husband and I moved from New York to South Carolina. We are home on vacation and read all the wonderful reviews for Di Fara Pizza. Since we have been deprived of REAL pizza in S.C., we decided that it would be worth the wait and price. After standing around for 40 minutes, we received our basil laced slices - just as the review had promised. We walked back to the car, picked up the slices and bit into burned crap. The crust was completely black. All we could taste was that nasty burned flavor. What a major disappointment. There was barely any cheese or sauce on it. It should have been thrown out instead of served. Â I too, looked around to see if we were being punked. The ketchup flavored, imitation cheese pizza in South Carolina is a thousand times better. Do yourself a favor and skip it. It's not worth the wait.
