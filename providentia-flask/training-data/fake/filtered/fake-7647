I went to this restaurant on Tuesday with my cousin, and it was amazing! We ordered the 'thai iced tea' which was yummy (must have), and had some wonderful thai dishes which were bursting with flavour. It is a little crowded, but its certainly worth the visit, and we didn't have to wait to get a table. The restaurant has a gothic/chic decor, and we had no idea there was so much more room at the back! Service was courteous and prompt, and I would definitely go back there again!
