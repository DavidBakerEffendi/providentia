The worst service I've ever had the first time, where after I promised my self to never go again. ...Then months later A friend persuaded me to go with him again since he never had the experience, and it was just the same. Rude, Stuck up employees, having to go to the bar for water refills.. This place looks fancy inside and certainly has a look of it's own kind, but looks can be deceiving.
