All I wanted was a decaf cappuccino and the guy how no idea how to make it he lectured me that "cows milk is for baby cows not for humans"  what a bunch of BS the typical cow produces milk twice a day in volumes far to excess of a baby calf.  God intended the milk for mankind or he wouldn't have each cow produce so much! Does this guy get it that this is Vermont home of the best organic milk in the US? Really, please get a life they think they are promoting a healthier lifestyle but serve Soy which is now tied to several health problems not to mention sugar and salt. Just give me my cappuccino and forget the sermons!
