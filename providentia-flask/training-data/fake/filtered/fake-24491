The soup dumplings are the star of the show, but if you come on a night when Joe's Shanghai is so busy that the dumplings are not cooked properly, the place loses its main attraction. The supporting cast needs to perform better. Reviewers have commented on the service, which we also found lacking. It wasn't always bad, but the waiters and hostesses seemed more hurried, and come off as uninterested in the customer's experience. My wife and I visit Joe's three to four times a year. We tolerate the wait and the dining in close proximity to other patrons, because we really enjoy the crab and pork dumplings. We had dinner at Joe's last night and the first round of dumplings seemed over-steamed, with little or no juicy soup inside.And another thing, don't take my money, including a service charge then forget to bring me my change, as if this was a tip on top your service charge. Come on Joe, you can do better than this!
