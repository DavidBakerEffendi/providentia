This place is really where to go for sushi in midtown.  I have been wanting to go for a long time, and the wait was pretty much worth it. . ..even though I was skeptical.   The atmosphere is a little less than desirable since it was mostly an afterwork crowd and men in suits. . .But I wasnt there to take in the scenery.  Food was great!
