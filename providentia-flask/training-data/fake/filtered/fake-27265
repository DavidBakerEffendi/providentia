We read on Yelp that this restaurant was a diamond in the rough. But it was really more part of the rough than we expected. The atmosphere was nice, good lighting and a really nice bar were the highlights. The service was also good: the waitress was undoubtedly French and attentive. But the food was disappointing. Two of us ordered the risotto, and we found it somewhat bland, something which we could easily make at home. The other person ordered the Coq Au Vin, and found it salty. Considering our high expectations, we were definitely disappointed with the food. Maybe we ordered the wrong dishes, but if a restaurant is really good, then so too should all of their dishes be good.
