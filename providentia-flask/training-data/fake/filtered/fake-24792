My husband and I were looking for a good, but inexpensive Italian place when we were in Noho.  I looked on Yelp and Bianca seemed to fit the bill.  It is small and cozy, and a bit loud, but has amazing food.  We both got the lasagna and it was the best lasagna I have ever had.  My husband also thought so.  It was perfect portion sizing and the price can't be beat for the taste - our dinner cost only $26.  Remember to bring cash though!
