I dont like phony atmospheres. My friend said it's Epcot but it's not. Disney would not have approved the distressed windows or the very new made to look old torn poster designed to look Â hapahazzardly placed in the encasement while being shelled by the Germans in WW2. The lighting made me uncompfortable. The designer should have borrowed from Thomas Kincaid. At least he can create pretty paintings of bistros. The food was just ok. But this is Philadelphia and most Philadelphians have'nt been to Paris or Pastis so we will eat our cake.
