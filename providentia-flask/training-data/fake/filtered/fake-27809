I made a yelp account just to write this review. Got a Sicilian and grandma slice both were extremely bland. Had 3 different people ask me and my coworker if we were staying or going we both said staying a few times. His came to go. They have these little 4 oz scoops if ice cream which they charged me 4.50 for one. This place is a joke. Don't waste your time. The whole staff has an attitude on top of it.
