I fell in love with the food and service at Marketa's the first time I had it. When people want a good sandwich, I always tell them about Marketa's. They are very generous with the portions and the meat & bread is always fresh. Brian and Hernan also offer excellent customer service. THANKS LA MARKETA'S COOKIE O'BRYAN
