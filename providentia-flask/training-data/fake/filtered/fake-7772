This is my favorite Indian restaurant in Connecticut. Their Saag Paneer always blows my mind! It's rich and creamy spinach is stuffed with the perfect amount of cheese cubes. The classic Chicken Tikka Masala was of course delicious. Their selection is fantastic across the board. The service is topnotch. Out of all the times that I have dined here, there was never a time that I wasn't satisfied with the food and service here. The d√©cor here is simple but that really doesn't matter as they will certainly wow you with their food. Lastly, their prices cant be beat for the quality of this restaurant!
