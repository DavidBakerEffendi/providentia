Was totally disappointed that the Tritone was replaced, had no idea until a friend suggested we go to The Cambridge for dinner. The service was standard and we watched a bunch of people come in and out before we even go our food. The food was standard, nothing special. My friend got a salad that was 95% lettuce - boring. Place is cute - i'm not impressed.
