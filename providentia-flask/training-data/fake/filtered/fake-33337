I was looking forward to eating here due to the reviews.  Unfortunately, my experience was bad. The food wasn't good and despite the inexpensive prices, feel as if I paid way too much. The grits were bland, but I'm from the south so maybe my expectations were too high.  My side order of bacon was placed in someone elses order of grits and they left out some of the order.  Whiile I'm not a fan of the IHOP, I wish I'd gone there instead.
