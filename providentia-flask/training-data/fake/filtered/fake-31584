Ok, went BACK to Blend and... Had another good 'ol time. For after work, just want some drinks and good food; very good. Alexis (again) was attentive (as usual) and fun (as usual). This time, spoke with both managers, Carlos and ... I forgot his name (eep). Very gracious and courteous. If you work or live nearby, go around 6 during the week. Not too loud and everyone was on point. :)
