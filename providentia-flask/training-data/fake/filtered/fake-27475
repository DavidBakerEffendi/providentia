Have been here quite a few times. Except for a couple of outliers (subpar experiences), the place has been consistently good. Regular slices are pretty good, but not too special. The Squares are a delight. More saucy than cheesy, the crust is a bit on the soft side (take that over burnt any day). Whatever the formula, it is working.
