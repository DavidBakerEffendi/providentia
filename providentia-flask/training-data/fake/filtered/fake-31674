Amazing food!  The gnocchi lasagna was really tasty - I'll definitely be getting that again.  I also tried a quattro formaggi flatbread which was delicious. The owner Matt took some time to explain the menu and its offerings.  Very nice guy, and from what I've tasted so far he's got a hit on his hands. I can't wait to try some of the build-your-own pasta combinations. Highly recommended!
