My experience at Nikko was terrible. We went on a sat night asking for a hibachi table for 2 we were told 15 mins. 1 hr later we were still not seated and there were groups of 4 and 5 waiting for longer. They should be ashamed of themselves for their customer service. They weren't even apologetic for the wait. We ended up leaving because it was 9 at night and didn't want to wait any longer. I will never go back again. One of the worst dining experiences I've ever had.
