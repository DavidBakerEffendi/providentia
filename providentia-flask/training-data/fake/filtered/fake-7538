What can I say about FAT BUDDAH!!! I Swing by here every chance I get.  The food, the drinks, the staff.  ALL AMAZING...   Wings, Fries, calamari, dumplings,  All these yelp reviews are right  about weekends at Fat Buddha - this place is great for everyone.  Singles, couples, dates.  It is big enough so you don't see the same 25 people all night, however small enough to not lose anyone in the crowd.   There are seats around the bar, a few tables to sit and chat, converse or what you purpose you need fulfilled,  including a small area in the back by the DJ if you feel in the mood to dance.  Most of the music was old pop, hip hop or top 40.  It's one of those places where DJ would be playing songs that people could dance to and then suddenly it would change to an old song everyone would be singing along to and also you can just let the DJ know what you want and they will slap it right on!!!!! NO EGOS anywhere in this place... Carlos, I will be back soon!! have my drinks ready.........
