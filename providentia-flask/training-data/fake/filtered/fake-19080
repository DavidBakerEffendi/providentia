So, after my 3 star review, I got contacted by Le Barricou. They were assuring me of their never ending attempts to obtain the highest quality in food and service and asking me to describe in detail what was disappointing for me for last 4 times I had been there. I mentioned how the beet salad was described to be served with arugula, which I deemed to be amazingly complimentary to beets, arrived with bland mix of greens, and how the mushroom omelette was, bland, at its best and uncooked on the inside and how I had to chew on a bacon filled apple,gruyere omelette before I had to spit it out even though I had requested to omit bacon since I was vegetarian. So, upon answering all their questions and giving them some time to fix things here and there, Â I decided to give them another chance and went there for brunch last weekend. We ordered the mushroom omelette and goat cheese spinach croissant followed by bread pudding. I was happy to see that I was allowed to substitute french fries for home fires as I was ensured I could in their reply to my first review. The mushroom omelette was still uncooked-ish on the inside, but this time I was happy to acknowledge the melted cheese. The croissant was delicious with no flaw. The bread pudding was not at its best. And the service was immaculate. I have to praise Le Barricou's commitment to make the customer happy. That's why I am reinstating my review and raising their star value from 3 to 5.
