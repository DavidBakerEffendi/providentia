This is hands down the best Indian food in New Haven, and one of the top 5 restaurants in the city (that is saying a lot for a city renowned for its restaurant scene).  It is a hidden gem and I wish more people knew about it!  Their food is fantastic and always fresh.  I highly recommend the Chicken Biryani and garlic naan.  Delivery is also super fast.
