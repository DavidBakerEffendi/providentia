January 1, 2015 Dining out doesn't get any better than this!  Last night we celebrated the New Year here with three other couples. I wondered if Skara would be as outstanding on a busy New Years Eve, as it had been on our previous visits.   What an amazing experience!  The food is  so outstanding.  Everyone at our table loved what they ordered.  We started with appetizers ( including a sampler of pita and spreads.) the main dishes included lamb chops, salmon, moussaka , shrimp and rice, Finally an assortment of luscious desserts that we all said we were too full too eat, and yet managed to finish every last bit. John (Yonni),the owner, treats everyone as if they are guests in his home.  He is so proud of Skara, and well he should be. The food is as beautiful to look at, as it is delicious.  The Chef, the wait staff are to be admired.  Andrea, Daniela do a great job and are always attentive, warm and enthusiastic.   Skara is BYOB.  Bring your best bottle of wine--the food deserves no less!
