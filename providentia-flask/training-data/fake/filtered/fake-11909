My family favorite for more than a decade, It started when Tony's was located on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. If you have a larger group this place is ideal, there is a private room downstairs for special occasions. if you prefer an intimate stting head up to the3rd Ave location The staff are sincere attentive and a few are even very talented. The food Â Italian Cuisine is above and beyond any other Italian resturant the Tony's Veal Chop and the Tiramisu is ordered every time I go there (the Tiramisu should win an award).
