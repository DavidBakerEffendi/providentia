Great Place! The staff was friendly, especially the bartenders! They're fun to talk to when sitting at the bar. The food, I tried the cream pasta. It was so good, my friend ordered one for himself! (because I didn't want to share it!) The dumpling was a delight. Right texture and the portions are good for bar munchies. great bar food over all. Must try!
