Really bad experience. I went with a group of four and when we ordered mac and cheese, they said they ran out.  One of us ordered a grilled cheese on wheat and they said they were out of wheat bread!  They need to better stock their items. I ordered a salad and asked to make a substitution.  They said they could and then came back a five minutes later and told me (didn't ask) that they were charging me $3.50 extra, so the $10 salad was now $13.50 and it was not very big. Their grilled cheese sandwiches start at $8, for one kind of cheese and bread.  All extra toppings are $1-$2 each.  Not worth it. Plus the waitress had an attitude.
