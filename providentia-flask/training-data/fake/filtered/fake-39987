I live close to Casa Piquin and I go often. I have been meaning to give it a good review for some time now. The food could not be more reasonably priced for what you get. It is one of the few the Mexican places in the area, but the food is still better than Mexicali Rose by a long shot. It is BYOB - which is great, and the staff is very nice. I will say that they are a bit slow at times with service - but with everything so rushed these days at least it gives you time to enjoy your food. I've had birthdays here, brought family and I plan on doing take-out for a party I'm having. I gave it five stars because the value and quality for the price are excellent. I read some of the bad reviews and they seem like one off bad experiences that could happen anyplace. The location is hard - down the steps, and they aren't gimicky like Cuban Petes which could account for it looking empty sometimes - but again, good food, cheap prices, byob. Can't really go wrong.
