The food here is amazing and the beer selection is vast! The bar seems to be full of regulars, all of which were so friendly. Nothing like Manhattan at all. Kind of reminds me of The Victory Cafe in Toronto where I live with a food quality of the Gabardine! Only advice is save room for dessert. If it's anything like the maple soaked, homemade cornbread, with homeade ice cream and candied bacon concoction that we had, you will be glad you saved room!!! The music was perfect for the atmosphere too. I plan to go back every time I am in Brooklyn!
