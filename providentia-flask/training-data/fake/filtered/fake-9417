Thai decorations with a huge chandelier in a glass case in the middle of the room. The restaurant is noisy, so not the easiest to hear across the table, but good for smaller conversations. Nothing too negative or positive to say about it. I love the decor of the place; it is very eye catching and elegant. I would go back when it is less crowded and try new dishes in an attempt to find something as good as the coconut calamari. Service is fine. Nothing too negative or positive to say about it.
