This place is absolutely awesome. A buddy brought a bunch of us here and it was a tight fit but so worth it. If your craving real Mexican food this is the place to go. The tacos are fantastic and the guacamole is awesome. In fact the Guacamole is so good, we often fight over who gets to lick the bowl. Yes its that good! You have to visit and when you do you'll be back again. O and get an order of Tres Leches!
