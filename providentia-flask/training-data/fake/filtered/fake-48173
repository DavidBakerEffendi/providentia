Scottish and Hipster cultures don't share a lot in common - other than their mutual appreciation of well-crafted drinks and taxidermy-adorned walls.  Highlands (appropriately) has plenty of both. As restaurant cocktail menus go, Highlands's deserves NYC top 10 consideration.  High marks for the Dram Dirk and the Robert Burns.  The food menu is too short at 5 choices, but well executed and creative (e.g. vegetarian shepherd's pie).
