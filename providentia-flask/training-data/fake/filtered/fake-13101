Having been brought up on the best hot dogs at a famous Lowell hot dog joint - I can say the Hench dog is in excellent company.  The steamed dog is superior to a grilled dog, paws down!!!.  Steamed bun, outrageous choice of toppings, and a nice array of beverages + kickin' sunny day.  Great stopover with the fam.  I'm lovin' it. The owner provides great service and conversation  another  reason to keep 'em coming back!!!  What a character!   And we love his sign .
