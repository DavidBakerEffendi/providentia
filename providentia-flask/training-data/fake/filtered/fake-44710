I don't know about the food - I didn't make it that far. I made reservations for 8:30 on a Wednesday - we arrived 5  minutes early but we were not seated until after 9pm.  While we waited we were treated rudely by the a guy who appeared to be management, I swear he almost knocked me down at one point.   When we were finally seated, and no mention of a free glass of wine or anything to make the 45 minute wait (after having a reservation!!!) more bearable, we though 'oh this place is cute and people seem to like the food it will be fine.   When the host came back with menus I brought out my restaurant.com restaurant certificate.  He exclaimed, WE DO NOT ACCEPT THOSE! WE HAVE NOT ACCEPTED THOSE IN 3 MONTHS! I told him I just bought the gift certificate yesterday.  He again said in a 'how dare poor people sit down at this restaurant' sort of way WE WILL NOT ACCEPT THIS!  Then he marched away.   My friend and I stared at each other, can this be real?  After waiting so long and being treated so rudely?  So we got up and marched out, while the host gave a half hearted apology.  It was a $25 gift certificate - we would have spent much more than that at the restaurant.  They lost business and I am telling everyone I know not to go there.
