Love this place. I had almost everything on the menu and wasn't disappointed. The vibe is cool, the prices are great, the staff is very friendly. The pickled peppered wings are amazing! Â I wish they served brunch every day. Other then that I highly recommend this place if your looking for a chill spot and some good eats.
