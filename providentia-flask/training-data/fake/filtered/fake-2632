Stopped in here (across from FIT) after a long day of touring the city and was very pleased with our last minute choice!  It is like a bit more upscale  Japanese Panera or Chipotle with a cool Asian vibe and excellent flavors in their food.  We had 2 rolls (Spider and Lava), which were both very yummy, and a beef dish over brown rice that was awesome with lots of vegetables cooked perfectly!  Topped it off with some miso soup and some Sake, and it was a great meal at a very reasonable price for NYC!  And despite what some of the other reviewers said about the service, we found it to be excellent -- friendly young man taking our order and helping us get the food when it was ready, and nice, casual atmosphere.  I would definitely go back if I'm in the area again!
