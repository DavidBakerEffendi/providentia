The food was delicious. I ordered the lightly fried whiting with the sauteed spinach/garlic and macaroni and cheese. I was dispappointed that early Sunday afternoon they had no candied yams. The other diappointment is the service is poor. The servers don't have a pleasant face and don't greet the customers as they come in. The servers take a long time to take your order, even after the menus are down and placed to the side( which indicates that the customer is ready). The server also brought me the wrong check. It was significantly less than what I owed. I am not sure how that mistake could occur.
