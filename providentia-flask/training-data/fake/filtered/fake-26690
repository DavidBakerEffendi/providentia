Just like everyone else on here my main focus is how fresh the food is. I love how the flavors really pop and are so distinctive. I particularly enjoy being able to find the perfect level of spice for myself based on the options provided. Great atmosphere and easy to walk to from anywhere in downtown New Haven. I would recommend Pitazikki to anyone.
