There is always a long line no matter what time you come. Sometimes they do not open for lunch. Now they have 3 carts, they are a chain so just go on the shortest line with the yellow umbrella. Combo over rice is my favorite with extra white sauce. They always give you a large portion so you can share it among 2 people.
