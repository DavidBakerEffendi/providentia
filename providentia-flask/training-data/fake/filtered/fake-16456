Jackson Hole is absolutely the BEST restaurant there is in Queens for BURGERS. Omann, i can't get enough of they're big juicy monstrous Cheeseburgerss. Its All I Order When I Go Eat There. i alwayss want to go over there when im seriously starving and want something filling; wheneverr i walk out of there, im so stuffed and always satisfied. ITS AN AMAZING RESTUARANT, it has such a great staff, wonderful and comfortable seats and tables. i find everything very UNIQUE inside. never have had any problems at JACKSONhole :) i would recommend to anybodyyy ! i hopeee they dont ever run out of business; i love it ! :D P.S. - if you look closely, my main default picture is taken inside JCKSNHOLE ; )
