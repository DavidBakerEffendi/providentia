I can honestly say the food here is great. The waitresses and managers/owners are always friendly and accommodating. One suggestion I can make is never to judge food that is picked up and driven home and then consumed after 5-10 minutes. Nothing ever tastes the same after it is wrapped up, that's the truth. As far as you others who claim the food came out cold, maybe you shouldn't be taking photos of it for 10 minutes and then eating it.  Food should be consumed right away.  And IF the food came out wrong or did not taste right, I am sure they would have accommodated you in some way. People make mistakes and they have the right to fix them when brought to their attention.  The place has been there for over 30 years, and that says a lot. I would suggest you visit if you never have before. You won't be disappointed.
