My girlfriend and I decided to grab a bite to eat before a show across the street at Union Transfer since she had a few Groupons to use. We were seated and then it took 15 minutes for a glass of water to be poured. Then, after a 25 minute wait at the table we couldn't even track down the server for a beer. After 30 minutes with no drinks or food we left for fear of missing the show. Instead, we walked to Prohibition Taproom and it was great.
