The two stars are atmosphere and friendly staff. I'll admit, this place is adorable looking, but the service was bad, the food is mediocre at best, and everything is overpriced. First, the service: I was here with a friend, and we ordered off the breakfast menu. We ordered mostly a la carte....but only 4 or 5 items. So there really wasn't any excuse for first bringing us incorrect food, eventually bringing us sort-of correct food, and then still never bringing my friend's child's toast or my coffee. The food: I got the avocado toast for $4.50. It's one piece of thin grocery store wheat bread topped with mayo and avocado spread. Tasty, yes,  avocado always is...but I wouldn't serve this bread to guests in my own home, let alone charge for it in a restaurant. My friend had toast, eggs and ham. The toast  again was one slice of anemic wheat bread. The soft boiled eggs here are beautiful - but it's a little weird to only serve eggs in one way. I expect food to be better in a restaurant than what I can assemble in my kitchen in 5 minutes. The price: We didn't get the sandwiches - but $9 seems a bit much. The breakfast prices would be fine if the quality was higher. Only in Brooklyn could this place survive, because people are paying for atmosphere alone.
