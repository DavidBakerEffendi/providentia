Waited 20 minutes for a table, then sat down with a rhubarb bellini, yummy, at a cafe table. Overwhelmed by the crowd, and being bumped into by an over zealous buskid, but the blue crab crostino changed our mood to satisfaction. Â We shared grandma's ravioli, which was hearty, and I wondered if we would have room for the wonderful rare Hangar steak with crushed potatoes and the prawns, which satisfied more than I could imagine. Together,we put our heads together, to be separated by someone eager to refill our water, and discovered the chocolate torta with the buttermilk gelato, that cooled us as there seemed to be a problem with the ac. I think this is a good place for lunch, but a week night might find a less harried aura.
