I found Gramercy Tavern a bit underwhelming and overrated. People seem to love it but I found it not to be my style.  I think I would give I 3.5 stars. I ordered the warm lobster salad, which was quite good, as my appetizer.  I ordered the Sea Bass as my main course and chocolate bread pudding for dessert.  While everything tasted good, I didn't find anything memorable.  I probably will go back eventually, but it didn't draw me in.
