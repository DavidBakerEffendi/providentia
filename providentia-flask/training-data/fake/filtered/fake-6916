My friends and I get a pizza from Brother's every Friday night. The owners always seem to be working and are very friendly to us and the rest of the customers. The place gets pretty busy on the weekends, but the staff doesn't ever seem overwhelmed. The food is always pretty quick. I'm a big fan of the pizza, but their hot subs are also delicious. I've had almost every kind, and I highly recommend them. I've yet to have anything bad from Brother's. I don't dine in there much, but it seems like a decent place to do so. The waitresses seem alright, and the place always looks clean and welcoming. Brother's is awesome. Go get some grub.
