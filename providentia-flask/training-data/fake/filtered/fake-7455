Best restaurant experience of my life. The service was a cut above other elite NYC restaurants, and each course was beautifully presented and perfectly prepared. The wine pairing was also well-executed. A most-welcome surprise was the opportunity to tour the kitchen at the end of the meal, receive a small tutorial in molecular gastronomy, Â Afterward we were seated at a small table in a private area of the restaurant where we received a complimentary bottle of cognac and various smaller desserts. Worth every penny. And am very excited to go again.
