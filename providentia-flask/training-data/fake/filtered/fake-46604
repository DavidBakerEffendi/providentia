My husband and I are regulars at Manjares.  We've tried everything on the breakfast menu but the oatmeal, and can recommend it all.  The brioche French toast is a particular favourite, but the pancakes are also light, fluffy and delicious, and the breakfast burritos are incredibly tasty (though healthy; they have more beans and vegetables and fewer eggs than you might expect).   All of the soups on their lunch menu are delicious, and the smoked salmon sandwich is the platonic ideal of smoked salmon sandwiches. One small caveat: food is made to order, and service is often quite slow.  If you're in a rush, I recommend ordering one of their scrumptious pastries and a cup of coffee to go, rather than waiting for table service.
