A friend told me about this place and I had some doubts because it has been a while since I had good authentic cuisine... When my fiance and I went there for dinner we were so extremely pleased that we even made it a destination for my mothers birthday! Great food and fun atmosphere. If you like your sangria strong, be sure you bring a bottle of wine to add to it. Theirs was good but not strong at all.
