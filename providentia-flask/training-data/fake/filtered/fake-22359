This Thai fusion food served in a cheeky red curtained diner  (the  real kind of diner,...) is my new favorite joint. OMG The tum yum soup is to die for... the heat, the flavors the sweet and sour and all the spices grown right there, behind the diner. This place is so for real! The staff is wicked nice and never make you feel like they are doing you a favor by serving you. I went in for the American breakfast and it was very good...just slow service in the morning as they were trying to serve a huge group but worth the wait for breakfast too.
