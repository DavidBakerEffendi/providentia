What else can you say if you want Italian food AND a place to entertain your kids?  I LOVE going here because the food is awesome (first thing you get is this HUGE ball of garlic bread with gooey mozzarella cheese stuffed inside!!) AND my littlest kids get to watch their Pizza chef make pizza and to four little kids, nothing can be more fun!  We had excellent an excellent house wine that apparently is made by the same people that own the restaurant and because it just looked so good, I decided on a flat bread with just sauce, fresh basil and slabs of fresh mozzarella cheese.  My husband had the lobster ravioli that he found to be excellent with real pieces of lobster meat in it (you don't usually get that!) and the whole dinner experience was made finer because the kids were so busy with Chef Henry that my husband and I actually ate dinner quietly together.  I would definitely and HAVE recommended this restaurant and others in the Calandra chain.
