Food, ambiance, service are all excellent. The menu is difficult to navigate without the help of your waiter and the dishes tend to be very small and leave you wanting more, so you order more. When you get the bill while your tastebuds will be happy, your stomach will not likely be full and your wallet will be alot lighter. But it is one of the citys best restaurants and well worth it.
