I love Yakitori Totto. I have been there more than five times within the past year or so, and they get it right every single time. I am sure that it is not the same people that are cooking the food, because you can see who is doing the grilling, at least, but their food is consistent and never disappoint. However, what is not consistent and what does disappoint is their service, hence four stars instead of five. I work in the vicinity and have been there for lunch three times in the past, but the service is not very good. They are not really rude or anything and at least perform their job, but they are not very pleasant or warn and never crack a smile. Ever. On the other hand, all the rest of the times I have been there which were for dinner, the service was excellent. I guess that they hire mediocre to worse people for lunch and better to best people for dinner.
