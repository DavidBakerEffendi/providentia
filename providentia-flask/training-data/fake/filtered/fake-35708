I'm just going to say it bluntly, if you don't love the gyro's here, you're a dumbass. Best. Gyro. Ever. My wife and I stopped here for a lunch on our way through NJ and couldn't believe how awesome it was. I now make it a point to stop here when I come past on the NJ turnpike the gyros are that good. I can't say enough good things about this place.
