The food here is great so it's a shame the chef can't cook the food and serve it too. Wait staff gaggles around the hostess stand which makes you crazy when trying to get a drink, place an order or get your check. We had the same experience about six months ago and we chalked it up to a bad night...now we know it's the norm. It's a good thing there are plenty of restaurants in the area with both good food and excellent service. We will go elsewhere from now on.
