We went here for my cousins birthday and Â waited for more than an hour just so he can sit 9 people in our table. The manager was rude and screaming at us for correcting him. He then kicked us out for screaming at him for sitting the people who made no reservations and waited less than an hour!! We asked to speak to the supervisor and he stated he wasn't around. I guess customer is never right anymore.
