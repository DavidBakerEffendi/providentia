No question the quality and selection is awesome.  However the service is terrible.  There is one lone cashier in the back who not only rings up sales but also handles the bakery,phone orders and everything else service related. The front register is never used and with no sign to go to the rear one people wait hoping someone shows up to check them out. I on occasion gotten so frustrated waiting to pay for my stuff that I have walked out after abandoning my items on a shelf.  I dread going there because although the products are fabulous it is difficult to pay . Looks like so much help but people stand around aimlessly while customers are ignored.
