I was very disappointed with my recent Blue Cat experience on 12/22/2012.  My fiancee and I have always had a good experience and thoroughly enjoyed our dinners in the past.  We both ordered the filet mignon I ordered rare and he ordered medium rare.  They both came out beyond raw.  When we went to nicely send them back to be cooked more the waitress was the furthest from pleasant about it.  When the steaks came back they were cooked perfectly however they had absolutely no taste whatsoever.  Needless to say we were not happy and won't be going back.
