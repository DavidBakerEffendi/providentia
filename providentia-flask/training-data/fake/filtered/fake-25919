Drinks: an extensive collection of draft and bottled beers. All the beers have honest descriptions and alcohol %'s, and are priced reasonably. It also provides an excellent selection of bourbon and scotch. By comparison, the wine selection is relatively thin. Food: I've been here twice and the food is delicious. The great thing about the menu is the atypical selection. I recommend the chickpea fries and anything from the sandwich section. Atmosphere: The fireplace, medium-dark woods, mustard paint, exposed beams, and excellent lighting combine for a cozy atmosphere. Service: Friendly and courteous, though when our party was there on 12/22 the tall waiter with the rectangular framed glasses was a bad server. Despite saying things like "Merry Christmas" and being very polite, he was determined to maintain his Grinch attitude, and he "hustled" like a turtle on quaaludes. This seemed anomalous, though.
