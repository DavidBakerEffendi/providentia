I don't know what is more disappointing, the sub-par food at Geno's or the fact that the Food Network and Travel Channel keep airing the "rivalry" between Geno's and Pat's. Too bad I noticed the signage after ordering my food, otherwise I would have walked away.  Call me fussy, but I really don't like to be yelled at while ordering my food, and having food shoved in my hand.  Sorry, I didn't brush up on my Geno's "lingo" and I said my order all wrong...I should be publicly flogged for that transgression. Keep your politics to yourself, and just be polite to your customers.  Funny, how something so fundamental is missing at this tourist trap! If you are really looking for a good sandwich try SOS (Subs on South), plus they will "happily take your order in any language."
