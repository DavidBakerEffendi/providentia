Best lunch place in Downtown Newark, great atmosphere, friendly staff, always inviting and not to mention the food is great.. Try the Bison, The salmon salad or Burgers, the shakes are great too!! Great price per portion as well!! Get there if you havnt been!! I hope to see Better Bites franchise as I am going to be working outside of newark in a few weeks and wil miss my favorite lunch spot!! Definatley the next Chipotle of the "Healthy" Â fast food industry without question. Muscle maker grill and Energy Kitchen should visit better bites and take notes!! Cheers thanks VJ and Gabe!!
