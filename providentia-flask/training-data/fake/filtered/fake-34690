The first time I came to Sanford's, it was with someone I'd met through craigslist 4 years earlier who had messaged me on OkCupid without realizing we'd met before. I was willing to look past that because he lived in Astoria and, being relatively new to the area, I found that to be a highly attractive quality. But then he didn't want to partake in the excellent "2 drinks with your brunch entree for $16" deal and I realized he was crazy. Like, he-probably-doesn't-even-like-ketchup crazy. Still, the food was good, though I can't remember what I had that first time. I do remember the menu had tons of options for all preferences. The second time, I took advantage of the alcohol and also ate the most delicious non-traditional burger I've ever had: the Gouda-stuffed duck burger. "A duck burger? Is that even allowed?" you may be wondering. I'm here to tell you: I have no idea. But if it's illegal, call me a criminal. Or don't, because that's cheesy--but so is this burger. And it's worth every calorie (which luckily the number of which it contains Sanford's isn't required to display on the menu). It's also worth missing the story your friend across from you is telling because you cannot possibly focus on anything else while this perfectly textured ground duck meat is entering your mouth and exploding with ooey gooey cheese. The burger comes with chips instead of fries, which is a disappointment because there's nothing to use ketchup on. That's right--this duck burger is so moist that it doesn't require ketchup. (I still used a little because I'm loyal like that, but most diners won't need it.) That's the highest compliment a burger can get. Oh, and Sanford's is open 24 hours, so in case you ever end up in the area with a craigslist or OkCupid date you actually like, you can stop in here and impress him/her with your knowledge that duck is amazing in every single form, but especially when oozing with Gouda.
