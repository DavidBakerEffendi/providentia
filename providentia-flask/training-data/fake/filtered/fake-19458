Overall, everything about Tops was excellent.  My only issue is that lines can be long.  If you decide to go on a Friday or weekend, I would recommend going during the off peak hours to beat the lines, which can be an hour long.   The food was great.  My friend ordered a penne pasta in white wine sauce with chicken and sausage.  The pasta had a flavorful, but not overwhelming sauce which was just right, and the chicken was tender and moist, which contrasts with the often chewy and dry chicken pastas found at most restaurants.  It also came with a loaf of tender bread and a soup of your choice.   I ordered a Cajun burger and requested that it was cooked rare.  Unlike most restaurants, Tops will actually serve a burger rare or medium rare, which was a pleasant surprise for me since most restaurants that I have ordered from only cook burgers to medium.  The burger had a juicy 10oz patty, and the lettuce and tomatoes that came with it were fresh.  The fries were good, but its pretty hard to do fries wrong.   We ordered a platter of nachos for an appetizer, and they were the best nachos that I have ever had.  The cheesecake that we ordered for dessert was excellent, featuring a creamy, airy texture and a cake like bottom.  Even though I expected a thick texture and a graham cracker base, I found that the style served at Tops was different, but still very good.   The pricing and service was also also excellent.  Even on a busy Friday night, our food was delivered quickly.  The nachos arrived within 5 minutes of placing our orders, and the entrees arrived right after we finished the nachos.  While the prices at Tops are slightly higher than what you would normally pay for at another diner, the fact that the portion sizes are generous and that the quality of the food there is superb justifies the higher price.
