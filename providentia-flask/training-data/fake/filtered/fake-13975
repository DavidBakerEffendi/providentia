We love coming here! Great place to stop in just for a few drinks at the bar, or for some amazing modern- Mexican food. The margaritas here are fantastic. Â Many flavors to choose from but we always stick to the original. Their sea bass and mahi mahi tacos are outstanding. Love the atmosphere- kind of cheesy but very vibrant and fun! Make sure to sneak into the photo booth
