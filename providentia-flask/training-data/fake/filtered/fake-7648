Dishes are delicious here. Try the famous burger. Even the chips are just perfectly fried and seasoned. Love their brunch menu also. The tables are pretty small and it's always so crowded and cramped, but if you are lucky to see there are not many people waiting, don't hesitate to jump in the line to get a table. Pretty worth a try.
