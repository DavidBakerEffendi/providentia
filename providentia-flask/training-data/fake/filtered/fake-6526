This place was fantastic! I went here for dinner. The food was great--authentic Italian (I'm 100% Italian, so I would know). Fresh, homemade pastas, really good fish, and I highly recommend the pannacotta! The service was great too; everyone was very attentive and friendly. Cozy, cute place. I'll definitely be going back soon!
