I am a native of Rahway and try my hardest to support the local businesses, my husband and I went there for the first time about a week ago. The atmosphere was warm and comfortable however my husband and I sat there for almost 10 minutes without being served. The prices for the shots and cocktails was very reasonable and tasty. I felt uncomfortable because it was hardly easy to talk over the other loudly singing patrons. I would not suggest here for a intimate date night but if you want a night on the town (well Rahway) then I'd say go for it!
