I am so happy I had a groupon for this place, but so mad I paid for the groupon. I don't know where to start. First, we asked for outdoor seating. They put us up on the top of the ship...fine! The problem was that there was nothing at all to keep the bugs away. It was so gross. They were flying all around our food, I got bit a couple of times from mosquitos and I spent a quarter of the time swatting them away. Next, we ordered an appetizer. After waiting 20 minutes, the waiter (who was kind of rude) came out and told me that they didn't have that anymore and brought us half the appetizer. He did take it off the bill. The problem was that the meat wasn't cooked well. It was still bleeding. Yuck. Next, we waited about 20 more minutes for our main meal, and when it came it was gross. My crab cake was actually good. I got the small plate crab cake. However, my dinner date got scallops that were undercooked. Even the lemonade was bad, in these tacky plastic cups and our waiter never even came over and asked if we wanted a refill. Oh, I forgot...the thai beef lettuce wraps were so dry and gross. We waited forever for those too, which meant the meat had some gross film over it from sitting in the kitchen waiting to come out. I am all together disgusted with this place. I will never be back. EVER.
