This is truly authentic pizza at it's best. I don't expect anything less then first class from a Vetri establishment, since I have been to all five branches of the Vetri tree. Visited Pizzaria Vetri the other night with some colleagues after work. Can't say much for their drink/beverage selection, as we BYO'd with our own flights of wine for corkage at $15 per bottle. However, the quality of their food menu is absolutely outstanding! The table of four shared Renato, Calzone, Tonno, Â Salsiccia, and a shrimp scampi that was offered on special. I personally have to rated this place as having the best pizza dough around the greater Philadelphia area. Needless to say... these guys know dough! Definitely will be returning at least once a week!
