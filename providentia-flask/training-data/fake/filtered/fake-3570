I read a lot of raving reviews about this restaurant, so I was anxious to give it a try. First came the popovers.  Nothing to write home about. One had mozzarella and the other was a hush puppy dish.  Not a good idea to share the snacks.  Then,  I ordered 2 of the "snacks" for starters (so our group of 4 could share them).  They are barely enough for one person.  The main dishes we ordered;  fried chicken, pasta and a burger.  Everyone seemed to enjoy this part of the mean.  My thought on their signature dish - fried chicken;  fresh, hot, ample but .. not nearly as exciting as the reviews made it out to be.  The service was fine.  The noise level was way too loud.  Would I go back?  Probably not.  Would the other 3 in my party?  Probably.
