Came here on whim with a colleague for a "quick" business lunch (we left 4 hours later!).  What we got was a true gem of an establishment in Queens.  The menu boasted some of the finest italian haute cuisine with a staff that made the entire experience as inviting as dinner at grandma's.  I had the Chilean Seabass and my colleague had the Ostrich filets....appetizers were Razor Clams and Carpaccio.  AMAZING FOOD + EQUISITE SERVICE = TOTAL WINNER.
