Ok so my review for this place is a few weeks late but this place is amazing. The waiter was very patient and helpful while we were ordering. It was Happy Hour but we did not have to sit at the bar for the $5 dollar deals which is awesome. Food was splendid. I would definitely recommend Cuba to anyone.
