I went to Wedge & Fig for lunch on a weekday and was greeted by extremely friendly staff members. I had trouble choosing what to order on the menu, because so many items looked amazing. The sandwich that I decided on was delicious (although a bit pricy). But Wedge & Fig is a great lunch spot that I would highly recommend!
