I think that Pat's obviously trumps Geno's. The sandwich is done extremely fast, but doesn't taste like fast food. And my advice is to get the cheesesteak with provolone over the cheese whiz. Plus it is fantastic after you've spent the night out at a bar. Definitely some of the best midnight snack food.
