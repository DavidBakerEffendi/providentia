I just want to add to an earlier review: I love the food at this place, but the attitude needs a bit of an adjustment.  If you have a table come in 20 min before closing, tell them you can't seat them, not that you can seat them but that they have to leave in 20 min.  And when we order food to go instead of taking you up on the 20 min deal, don't ask us to wait outside when the place is empty and we just paid money for your food.  Food is great, but the staff needs to learn to be polite to customers.
