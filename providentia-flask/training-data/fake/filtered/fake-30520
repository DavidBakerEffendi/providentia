The food here is excellent.  Everything is prepared fresh and made to order so you have to expect a little extra time for preparation.  There are many unique sandwiches and other menu items that are all thoughtfully created. I try to grab lunch here a few times a week and I highly recommend stopping in and trying one of the weekly burger specials.  They do not disappoint.
