The food here is AMAZING!!! I just have to say that their dry ribs are to die for!! The best part about this place is that their meats come from 100% grass fed animals.  The worst part, they have no liquor! Boo! LOL  But really, try this place and try their Burnt Ends!! They were delicious as well and sell out really quickly.  The cool thing is that they don't have a refrigerator beyond the refrigerator display for their meats out front which means they don't freeze anything--ALL FRESH! Can't wait to go back when I'm in Astoria again! TRY IT!
