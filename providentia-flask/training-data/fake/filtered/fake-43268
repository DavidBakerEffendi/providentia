My boyfriend and I stumbled upon Cheeky when I was waiting for a bus, and I think we must have had good karma because this place blessed us. I don't think any better biscuits can be found anywhere in New York (or possibly anywhere, period). The service was fantastic - so friendly and quick. I would come all the way down from Harlem just for the egg and muenster biscuit I had this morning, no question. AND THE BEIGNETS. Probably gonna dream about them, to be honest. Appreciated the NOLA vibes being from a half southern fam. We can't wait to come back to try a po boy--or anything else on the menu, really.
