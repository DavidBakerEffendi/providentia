Best falafel I've had in Philly yet - crispy and more importantly light on the inside. I've had falafel at a few other spots and they always end up far too dense inside, not so here, with the falafel (at least at lunch time) being freshly made constantly. White pita was also soft and fresh, tomatoes were bright red and delicious. A great falafel sandwich.
