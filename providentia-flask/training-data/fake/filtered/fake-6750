Very not impressed.... The food was good don't get me wrong, you can really tell that the cooks (not the chef) care about what they are doing.. I only say that because the entire time that i was there enjoying my dinner the chef was walking around and making me feel uncomfortable about eating because i felt as though he was watching me the entire time and not doing his job which i thought was to be in the back of the house making our dinners not being the manager up front. I have no complaints about the food, it was great, the drinks were super, the wait service was alright although i did get a lot of water spilled on my table. one thing that i noticed which i can not knock them for is that it was a little noisy which i realize this is NYC and it was in the middle of a rush, not the romantic setting we were hoping for :/ i Â just wish i would have been able to enjoy the meal without feeling uncomfortable... this was about 3 weeks ago so maybe ill try it again a few months from now until then ill enjoy the other restuarants near by. i put spendy for price because with drinks it came out to over $90 for a two person dinner....
