The only Indian place I go to in the area! You can get homestyle indian food without paying high prices. Do not let the prices fool you - these guys offer the best quality food in the area. Their Malai Kofta and Chich tikka masala are a must try. Its a small place with minimalistic decor. Customer service is very friendly. Highly recommended.
