Hello, what planet have I been on. This place is great!!!  I tried for the first time yesterday by accident and now I cant believe I havent been here yet.   Me and my man agreed as he is from Mexico and I am from the South that this place has the best Rancheros around, BY FAR.   We also ate Cannoli French Toast. Thats right folks cannoli filling on your french toast, now what?  Let's see stand in line at other popular brunch spots or walk in and get a table in minutes, (cause the place is freakin huge) and eat some seriously good grub. I had Vietnamese coffee and he had a orange Italian soda, where else is that happening at?  This is just the start of a great relationship for me.  You people need to get on board, but take it slow because it seems like this is a secret foodie spot as everyone seemed to know the staff, a little weird now that I think about it....  All the food that was breezing by me looked good and smelled yummy.  Cash only, but they have an ATM inside.
