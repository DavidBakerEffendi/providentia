Great food!  So nice to have some more upscale dining in Verona.  We had the mushroom app which was fantastic. The short rib melted in your mouth and the hamburger was one of the more tasty I have had in a while.  The restaurant and staff were even super accommodating for our three year old, although I would note we ate early and beat the rush. So glad to have this new addition near by!
