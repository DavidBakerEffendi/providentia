My partner and I were in the textiles section of Macy's in Manhattan the other day and boy did we find the ultimate eatery on the very same floor----Stella 34 Trattoria!  The beautiful array of foods to choose from was mouth-watering.  We chose warmed sandwiches with tuna and had a side of caponata that was absolutely delightful! We sat in very comfortable section that was meant for "quick and easy" dining. We seated ourselves and the food was brought over to us.  There is an elegant full table-service section as well.  The room is lit, not only with beautiful fixtures, but also with massive windows that allow natural light to further enhance the already very pleasant experience. The personnel, from the young lady that was greeting everyone, to the funny and extremely pleasant counter ladies and right on up until the floor staff's "goodbyes and thank yous", were genuine and we knew it!   We want everyone to know about Stella 34....Go and enjoy.  We're going back this week!
