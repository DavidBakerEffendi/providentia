I feel sooo lucky that such a service exists. Since I'm moving, between laundry back up and time, Got Laundry saved the day! I had the pleasure of meeting Ray, what a nice and professional guy. I actually ENJOY the the fact of having done business and supported a family business instead of Big Box business. It just proves there are still caring businesses and people around. I'm just sorry I'll only be a 1 time customer since I'm moving out of state. Got Laundry? sets the bar high for other businesses to follow. Thank you sooooooo much Ray/family. Money can always be replaced some how, but time is something you'll never get back. Got Laundry? has saved that precious time. I would recommend this business over and over.
