DONT DARE to EAT HERE! I was just here 2 hours ago and had never been disrespected so terribly at any restaurant as I did to night. Â After paying our bill, Dominic the owner began to setup 2 tables next to us as if getting ready for a large party. We soon realized that there was a party of 8 standing behind us waiting to take our seats. When asked why we were being rushed he literally told us "that's just how it is". My friend happened to mention that her husband was a state officer and Dominic started SCREAMING that he was calling the cops because he felt threatened. He kept yelling "DONT THREATEN ME, YOU DONT KNOW WHO I AM" As we're walking out I let him know that I would deter any friend or family member from going there and I would make sure to give him a bad review and he replied "you're better off not coming here and I've already got bad reviews so thank you". This guy has no respect for his customers nor his business. PS I work for a newspaper Dominic. DOMINIC I HOPE YOU READ THIS. If you want mediocre food with disrespectful service - this is the place to be.
