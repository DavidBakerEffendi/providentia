I am so disappointed! Everyone in my office has been raving about this place for its sandwiches, and in particular the bread. I took a chance and ordered pizza for our next staff meeting, and was very please. The Chicken Primavera pizza is a new office favorite. However, I made the HUGE MISTAKE of ordering the chili dog and hot dog for my own personal lunch. I usually LOVE Nathan's hot dogs, so I don't understand why they were SO SALTY!!! I had to throw it away! From now on I will stick with the safe bets that people recommend.
