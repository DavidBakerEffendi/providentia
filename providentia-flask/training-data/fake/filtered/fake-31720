I stumbled on this place while walking around the area looking for a casual place to eat, a place where I could comfortably sit alone and have a meal. This place was perfect! The bartender Diane was very friendly, helped me select a great glass of wine, Â fun to chat with. The food was fantastic - a total surprise. The place looks more like a local watering hole than a place you'd expect to great food. I ordered the burger which was no regular burger. The shrimp and grits were highly recommend and looked fanstastic (saw someone else order them). And they play great music which added to the overall positive experience.
