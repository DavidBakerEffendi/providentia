Bella's Â cafe is outrageous, I have had to wait on the weekends but it is well worth it. I give out gift certificates often to my clients just to let them try it, knowing thay will go back...once is definitely not enough. What I notice also is how the attention to detail it is from service, food, and most of all cleanliness ..from watching all these restaurant shows Bella 's gets an A..big fat one....try it ...no other
