This is one of the best restaurants in the area; the food is very authentic, carefully prepared and beautifully presented. We don't believe the allegations against the owner and expect him to be cleared of them soon. He's a very nice guy; his wife is the chef. Hamden will be even bleaker if it goes out of business.
