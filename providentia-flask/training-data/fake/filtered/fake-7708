I ate at Zavino's yesterday and it was superb. I had a very satisfying bowl of buttnernut squash soup and then their 4 cheese pizza, which was excellent. Great dough, cooked right, excellent cheese. the service was top-notch and it is a wonderful space. They also have a great wine selection. I had a lovely cocktail and then a sample of a home-made orange honey soda, which was just wonderful. Â  As a NYC food snob, this place was better than 95% of the pizza joints in NYC, I was very impressed.
