I was fed up with eating New York pizza, but my friend was visiting, amd she desperately wanted to eat some pizza! So, she, her friend, and I stopped by here. I ended up eating more pizza than either of them because I am a fatty. Â There's something so lovely about pizza made with time, and care at a sit down restaurant that only makes pizza. It's fresh. I don't know if I thought it was so amazing that I have to return, but it was a nice time with friends.
