Two words... GARLIC NAAN! I have day dreams about the yum-yum deliciousness that is their Garlic Naan. I have also really enjoyed the Tandoori Chicken and the vegetable curry too. I'm always greeted and treated like a family friend when I arrive. The good food and sincerity keeps bringing me back. However, the dodgy air conditioning makes me not linger.
