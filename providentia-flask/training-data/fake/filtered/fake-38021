Cheers to an aesthetically pleasing bar on the Upper West. Going downtown is such a hassle and this is right in our backyard. The rosemary lemonade was delicious. And it comes served in a jar. Yes, very hipster, but nothing off-putting. Music was lacking but they are really nice about being accommodating with it, i.e. putting on something better at request. Plus Jacob himself seems like a cool guy. Great place for drinks with a few friends. Try a pickle!
