OMG i just had dinner at this place with my best friends. the seasoning on the food is amazing. and our server Jacob was on point.  he was very attentive and made my experience be very friendly. the manager Kevin was so friendly and attentive and made me feel like home.  he took care of me and my friends and made us feel so comfortable and welcomed. i will deff be back with all my friends and recommend this place. deff one of the best places is downtown manhattan.
