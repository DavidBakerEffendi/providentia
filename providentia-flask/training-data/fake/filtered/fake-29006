It's been a long time since we have eaten here, but it won;t be a long time again.  It was such a delightful lunch.  The servers were very attentive, the food was excellent and the atmosphere very european.  I had the paella valencia and my better half had the veal medallions with  mushrooms.  Need I say more.  It was so.....delicious.
