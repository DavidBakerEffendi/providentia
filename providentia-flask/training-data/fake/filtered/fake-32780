If u come to Philly don't miss this place. This is where the locals go while the tourists get ripped off at the rough joints. Good ingredients, cooked to perfection by surly locals interested in getting you in and out fast. You will not regret it. Seating in Market is tough, but you will always find something. The old guy is chatty, the younger kid not so much, but that's the confidence of youth for you don't worry about it. Tip: if you don't like cheese too much, skip the provolone - its strong stuff.
