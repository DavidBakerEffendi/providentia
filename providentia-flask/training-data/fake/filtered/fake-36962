When you come to New York, the first thing you do is try the pizza, so I've been told. I didn't want to walk into the wrong place, so I took Scott's Pizza tour. It was well worth it. He was an excellent tour guide and showed me the best pizza places in the city. As a new person to the area, I also enjoyed the detailed history accounts of pizza restaurants in New York. Of all the places we visited, I recommend Lombardi's in Nolita. There you'll find plenty more nice people and experience an original mouthwatering taste of pizza.
