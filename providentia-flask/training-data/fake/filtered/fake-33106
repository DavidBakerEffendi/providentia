Non inventive menu. The Cobb Salad's chicken was over cooked as well as the bacon. No other veggies in salad besides lettuce. Potato and Leek soup lacked salt and proper seasoning plus the texture was off. Service was poor. Could hear severs conversations right by the bar and visibly were texting. Took them 5 minutes to greet me. The music was good though. Regardless, this place is bad, equally on par with their lackluster sister restaurant in the East Village.
