Listen, if you work in the area, there is no other option than Uncle Gussy's for lunch.  Its better and more affordable than anything in the area.  They've got a great variety - chicken and lamb platters, gyros, cheese steaks, burgers, kebobs, sausage and peppers and salads.  Its also the friendliest service in the area - an area full of get em' in, get em' fed, get em' out places.  These guys LOVE their customers.  For lunch, my favorite is a chicken and lamb platter with white (yes, homemade white sauce!) and hot sauce - although if you're looking for a treat, get a platter and ask for the works.
