Choosing a restaurant in Chinatown can be overwhelming and I initially tried this place on a whim b/c of the neon train sign and I've been a loyal customer ever since.  The vegetable noodle soup is wonderful!  A huge portion of veggies and noodles in broth served with big bunches of Thai basil, lime wedges, and sliced jalapeños, mmm!  They also serve a wide variety of bubble teas and smoothie drinks (try the avocado milkshake!).  This place is always full but I've never had to wait for a table.  The service is quick and the prices are right.  Not much in the way of decor but the food makes up for that.  Great place!
