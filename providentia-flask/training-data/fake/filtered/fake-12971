Just so so....its all about the hang out and not about the passion for food.   I love what they  have done with the place but to  taste authentic italian in north jersey i think you have to  go to savinis.....too generic....the  antipasta....was just thrown together with  the makeshift order you would see in shoprite.....i would have loved to  see the  veal saltumbuca seared instead of sauteed and held......the broccoli rabe was very good.  nobody came to my table to check on anything except for  the  server...she was very sweet but  didn't have enought knowledge of the product. I was born and raised italian....i would  suggest savinis over this place.... mike
