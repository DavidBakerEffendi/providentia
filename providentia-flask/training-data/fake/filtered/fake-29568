If over rated, over priced under cooked chicken is what you like than this is the place for you. Food poisoning for $13 a box is a steal... not! I wish my boyfriend I had gone to KFC or Popeye's instead, where we could had 10x better tasting chicken and had feed four more people and had money to spare. Instead of Â going here so my stomach as well as my bathroom won't hate me so much and it's only getting worst. I hope my baby does get sick as well she ate some chicken too.
