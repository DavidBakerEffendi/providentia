You wouldn't necessarily know it by walking by the restaurant, but this place has unbelievable Ethiopian food.  I have been to some of the top Ethiopian restaurants in New York, and this place is just as good, if not better.  The Doro Tibs is amazing.  I get it every time, and sometimes will share multiple orders of it.  They also have great non-Ethiopian food as well, and can satisfy your cravings for breakfast, lunch, or dinner.  The grilled cheese sandwich for lunch may be the best one I have ever had in my life.  The staff is friendly and inviting.  The Ethiopian coffee is great, and the perfect pick-me-up any time of day.
