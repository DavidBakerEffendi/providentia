Pros: - food is great and reasonably priced. Chicken pio is tasty and not dry at all. The ceviche is perfect. My husband ordered the seafood on wheat and he loved it as well. He said the squid, shellfish, shrimp and scallops are cooked perfectly. The avocado salad is fresh. - Wait staff is friendly and professional (I think his name is Abel). I didn't have to ask for water...the guy was there all the time checking what i need without being overbearing. Cons: - Seems like the receptionist is clueless about the hospitality business. My husband and I went there at 5:30 on Saturday and I know that they are busy on weekends....but at 5:30, the place was empty. She wanted to sit us on a table for two but since my husband and I tend to order 3 or 4 entrees so we can take leftovers home, we requested a four-tops. She gave us four-tops but told us that we need to get out of there before 7:00 PM. We left at 6:45 and the place is still empty. If the place was full, it would have been okay for us to sit wherever they want to sit us...but it was empty and I don't think our request was unreasonable. I thought it was rude of her to do that. We wanted to stay for dessert because I heard they have great pianono, but we decided to leave because the receptionist said we "have to get out of there before 7PM."
