This place is really great for the price - very attentive wait staff, a small but excellent menu, and a very impressive beer list (with ratings!). I went with my family for an early Sunday dinner and we got the fondue to share (to die for, literally), as well as separate meals (the beet salad and crab mac and cheese were notably excellent, and I have not had fries that fresh and tasty in a very long time). A plus is that there is plenty of street parking in front as well as on the side street - no issues there. I would recommend this place to anyone - everything we had was delicious, very reasonably priced, and definitely worth trying again.
