First time to Cafeteria and I could not have been more impressed. Spontaneously dropped by late Sunday evening to catch up with a good friend. Great greeting at the host stand followed by a wonderful seating on the cafe. Sarah S. (hopefully with the h) was a pleasure and great at taking care of us. Her cocktail recommendations were top notch and her service, impeccable. The only disappointment was that the caf√© closes at 11. We could have stayed here all night long, the inside was just a little too loud for a lax Sunday evening. All things considered, however, fantastic job and we will certainly return.
