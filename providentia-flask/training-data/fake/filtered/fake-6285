This place is great! - the bread is so fresh and perfectly toasted and the veggies on the sandwiches are crisp and refreshing.  However, if you're in a rush, don't stop in because it isn't the quickest place.  That being said, I can definitely tell my sandwiches are made with care and executed perfectly! The Grilled Chopped Chicken is my favorite- the chicken is marinated in a sweet sauce but then you can pick your level of spiciness that you want added!
