Cuban Pete's I was once a customer but never again! On my wife's birthday we went to celebrate at Cuban Pete's and of course since they don't take reservation it was about a two hour wait. This wasn't the problem as we understood it does get busy. After waiting for an hour and a half and seeing other parties be seated before us we asked the owner a simple question "why no reservations?" The owner turned and in an arrogant tone said "We don't need to take reservations look around, we are always busy!". With that we all simply decided we would never spend a dime there ever again. Pros : Honestly the food is good, I would say three and a half stars. Cons: they rush you out the door, Long waits, the customer service has slipped, the hostess do become arrogant at times and have attitude issues with customers. Very loud atmosphere so plan one screaming over each other.
