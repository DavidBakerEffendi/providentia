I will not go here again! I went to the take-out counter to get some orzo salad and it was in a very small bowl and did not look fresh. I asked when it was made and after having looked it up, the server told me that it had been made a week ago so they should "probably have thrown it out already." A salad with fresh spinach and feta cheese a week old and that expensive to boot? No thank you. I settled for a loaf of french bread that did not seem too fresh either, but I bought it anyway. When I got home, after having given some to my kids, I noticed that there was actually green and white mold on it - really? Once before, Â I have gotten pretty stale desserts there as well - it's disappointing when you splurge for a fancy dessert to go and then it tastes like it's been sitting in the refrigerator for weeks. Perhaps the food would be good if it weren't stale and moldy, but shame on them for serving food that old!
