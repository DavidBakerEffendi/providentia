I almost knocked a star off for their small space too, but then I was all like, "it's not their fault really, and the food's too good." My experience here was far too brief, but revelatory nonetheless. The Corn we'd had prepared in that fashion before, having lived in Dallas, but Cafe Habana does the best I've ever had. Like everyone says, it's fire-roasted, brushed with a mayo/butter mixture, dusted with homemade chili powder then rolled in tangy Cotija (read: co tee hah) cheese, not Parm. Finally, squeeze a slice of lime over top and get to work. Be sure to bring toothpicks. Get a Corn first. Then, I had the sweet plantain omelet with a wonderfully verdant salsa verde, which, somewhat non-traditionally, was literally loaded with cilantro. The server even obliged my plea for the cook to toss some sauteed serrano chiles into my omelet, despite her being incredibly busy and probably not in the mood for special requests. It was simple and delicious, just right for a light lunch before walking the streets. We could've stayed all day to drink Tecate and have Corns; it's our kind of place, and it'll be your kind if you enjoy the tastes of summer, mexican beer, corn stuff, lime, chiles... Ah well, next time it's nothing but the Corn and beer for us. Expect a wait, it's true. But, it's located on a perfect corner to stand and people watch until your name is called. Cafe Habana - do it.
