I honestly don't know how this restaurant gets such rave reviews.  Me and my girls took a taxi from the Bronx to Brooklyn to try this restaurant after reading all of the glowing reviews on Yelp.  This atmosphere is fantastic and the waiters are courteous and helpful. The bathrooms are clean. But IMO the food is just all right.  Reading the reviews my mouth watered and I couldn't wait to try the pecan encrusted pork chops with sweet potatoes and collards.  Pork chops were just o.k. - thin and kind of dry.  Sweet potatoes were good but then again it's hard to mess up a sweet potato. Collards were good.  My sister had a salmon burger with fries. Fries were excellent; salmon burger was just o.k. My other sister had baked or steamed salmon.  She said it was dry.  Someone else said the macaroni was definitely on point. I had some kind of shrimp spring roll as an appetizer that DID NOT have any shrimp in it!!! The drinks were weak - too much ice, not enough liquor. The first few sips were o.k. and then it was like drinking koolaid.  Not only that, it took about 45 minutes for our food to come.  Maybe I should have had the chicken and waffles that everyone raves about instead
