I noticed Yelp took down a lot of reviews related to the Google Glass controversey. I've eaten here, loved it, but also want to weigh in. Does that mean Yelp will delete my review too? This place is one of a kind. Smoked salmon is absolutely heavenly, and the chef does things with spaghetti squash that are unspeakable. A friend of mine had a taco here that was served in a pigs ear as a shell! For the price, it cannot be beat. As far as the Glass thing goes, dining is experiential. If Glass takes away from others experience, then banning it shouldn't be a problem. I'm sick of smokers, Glassholes, and other non-minorities getting up in arms about behaviors that affect others.
