I love this place.  The all you can eat is a great deal ($20).  Unlike other places, where they make you feel like a criminal for getting all you can eat, here they treat you like a paying customer.  No stupid restrictions, stale food or long waits.   The sushi quality is good.  It's not exceptional or anything, but it's quite good.  The all you can eat selection is good as well.  You don't get everything on the menu, but you get a good selection of soup, appetizer, tempura and udon, most/all of the sushi and normal rolls, and a good number of special rolls.
