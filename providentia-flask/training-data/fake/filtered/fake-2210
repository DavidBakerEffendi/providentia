Curiously this review is not based on the quality of the food - rather, the quality of our experience.  The reason for this is -- we didn't get to eat:  After schlepping downtown in sweltering heat, arriving BEFORE the 10:00am opening to find a line of about 20 people already waiting ... patiently ... outside.  After 20 minutes of waiting and the line not moving at all, a dopey-person saunters over slowly, not really caring about much of anything, especially the patient people standing in line - and not really communicating what's going on.  She takes our name.  And only when we ask her why we're not being seated - does she tell us that all along we've been standing in line simply to put our name on a list.  And THAT list has an over an hour wait.  Huh?  "Oh - even celebrities have to stand in line" she blandly replied when we expressed surprise that our wait in line was a precursor to ... not buttery biscuits, but -- another wait.  Who cares about celebrities.  I wanted breakfast.  Who cares how great their blueberry pancakes are.  I'm not waiting in any line (or two!)  for 2 hours.
