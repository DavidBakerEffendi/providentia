3 stars because while the food is good (4 stars), the demeanor of the staff really brings the place down (2 stars). Someone else previously described them as being indifferent. Each time I've gone, the staff acts as if they've got better things to do than to give good, pleasant service. I keep going because a friend loves the place and the food--and probably the lackadaisical hipsters who work there. The decor I can get down with, the no-computer policy I love, and having fresh eggs for sale is awesome. I also don't mind busing my own stuff. But Management, please, please, please, do something about the staff. Maybe they need to get off the Stumptown and get on something else.
