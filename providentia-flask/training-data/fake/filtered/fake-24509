I don't get all the hype.  It's okay food.  I do not like that they add the 15% tip to the bill.My friend and I went on a Sunday at noon and there was no line. The soup dumplings tasted like other places to me.  The Szechuan beef tendon noodle soup was good.  I liked how soft the noodles were.  The Singapore chow mai fun was yummy and had lots of fun.  I liked how fluffy the eggs were.   I think sharing the table with an annoying couple took away from my experience.  The couple was annoying and the guy had to ask his wife every time he if he was allowed to eat something.  They wouldn't stop asking us what we ordered and how do we eat our soup dumplings.
