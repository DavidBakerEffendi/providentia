Oh how i miss living in walking distance of the Farm.  fantastic food with friendly and professional service.  They keep the menu pretty small with changing specials.  Pretty much every experience that i've had there, be it weekday lunch or saturday night dessert has been excellent.  Yum!   They know how to make margaritas as well!
