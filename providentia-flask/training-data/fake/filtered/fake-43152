I've been there 2 times. the place is a dirt hole run by clueless woman. They had one decent kid there I believed named mike. He was very helpful and probably the only one with a brain...but I recently went there today to find out he no longer works there. The food is decent just not 5 star. The owner really needs to work on the place. I defiantly won't be recommending it .
