The Curries are fantastic.Especially  Gongura chicken and Gongura Goat are really tasty yummy.... yummy.... at this curry-point. They have 2 types of biriyanis. I like the regular one.I am  not fan of Dum Biriyiani. But next time i try dum. I definitely recommend this Curry-Point for  yummy....yummy....currys, Biriyani is Good.
