Have been numerous times, good food. This time horrible, rude service. Came on a slow night, many empty tables. Would not let us sit until all parties arrived, then moved us when another friend should up. Didn't ask us to move, told us too. Added 20% to bill for a party of 5, only spent one hour in the place. Will not go back.
