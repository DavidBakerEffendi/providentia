Waited almost 2 hours to get into the store on a Monday night.The server did not let us decide on the meals she asked if we were ready to order within a minute of us being seated.The dish mega ramen was way way too salty.not my kind of ramen. Dont understand the hype of the store. Owners service seems to very subjective.Most importantly NO CARDS accepted !!!!!! I mean seriously???? This is simply dodgey. Noy impressed. Will not go back ever.
