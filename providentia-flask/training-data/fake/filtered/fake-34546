I've been here twice and have no intention on ever coming back. The first time I frequented this establishment was a Friday night with a group of friend. It was perfect. The food was great, the drink were awesome and the service was phenomenal. We had a waitress named Ashley with a ready smile who was eager to please. She even recommended better beer options than the ones we chose, which was great. She was very attentive and we all agreed we would be back for her service. Not to mention you don't see to many hot black chicks in Irish pubs, which she was. We left very pleased with our overall experience. On to the negative, we came back about 3 weeks later for lunch expecting the same service. Not even close. The waitress was very rude, on her cell phone most of the time and gave us attitude at every turn. She seemed annoyed because we didnt order alcohol and when we asked what the specials were, she rudely thrust a paper in my face. She all but threw our food at us and then ignored us until it was time to pay. At this point, I was literally praying that Ashley would walk through the the door. Thought our first experience was great and the food is indeed delicious, the deplorable service given by the second waitress made it a stone fact that we will not be coming back. Good food and price is good, but great service goes a long way. One good waitress shouldn't be your only good waitress.
