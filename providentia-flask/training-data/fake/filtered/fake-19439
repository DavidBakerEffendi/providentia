My husband and I stopped in last week.  I am a hot dog lover, and I was soooo disappointed.  I ordered a regular dog - I asked for onions, I was told "we don't have onions". I asked her you don't have onions? today or never?  haha, I could not believe she said "never"!!  wow.  OK, well my order came out a regular hot dog on a big torpedo roll.  All Bread..UGH!!   They only offer ketchup that is out on the side counter. They don't even offer relish, cheese or chile.  My husband ordered the kielbasa, which looked better than mine..more filled out in roll.  Anyway, I will never go back again - sorry.  For $12.00 and some change, not worth it.
