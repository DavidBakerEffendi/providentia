Tonight's dinner at Joe's Shanghai was the worst meal I can recall ever having in a NYC restaurant.  I've eaten there a few times since moving to NY in 1995.  I've never been impressed, but their following has brought me back over the years to give it a second, third, etc try.  Sure enough, on this rainy Wednesday night, there was a line outside for tables, so whatever it has going for it hasn't eased up.  But it sure isn't the food?   No fresh or zingy flavors, just glop covering limp, aging vegetables, phlegmy sauce covering mealy sea food, and a pork dish that tasted like it came out of a tin can years past it's expiration date.  I can honestly say I've had better Chinese food in coach on Cathay Pacific.  And I suspect I would have had a better meal dumpster dodging on Pell Street tonight.  I am sooo disappointed!
