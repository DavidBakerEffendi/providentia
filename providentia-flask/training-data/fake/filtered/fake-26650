I'm giving Stone Park - or as my wife and I call it Stone P - five stars on the basis on its brunch alone.  I think its the best brunch in Park Slope and maybe in brownstone Brooklyn.  Everything is really good.  I have been to brunch here about 30 times over the years, including many times after New Years Eve.   I have never had a bad experience here.  The wait can be long...but you need to know how to game the no reservations situation - i.e., go right when it opens or go right before brunch closes.  The Bartendress Megan is wonderful.  I love the guy who is the host.  He looks a little like Jack Nicholson.  Super competent.  Knows how to manage a room really well.  I have spoken to the chef a few times.  He really cares about his food.  You can tell that this place is superior by the consistently good or superb ratings.  Out of almost 200 reviews only five people had really terrible experiences, while 75% rate it 4 stars or better.  Thats a pretty damn good approval rating....  I feel privileged I can walk there.
