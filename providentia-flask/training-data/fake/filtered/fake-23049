The food here was amazing.  The service not so much. First the burrata is to die for.  The artichoke antipasti --yum. And the pizza... Take me away!  We thought our sever was not attentive and we are very low-maintenance.  At the end of our meal we found crumpled paper at the bottom of our bottle of San Pellegrino, gross, right? The server basically shrugged and said sorry.  The manager did make it right and I would eat here again in a second because the food is awesome.
