This has been one of the most refreshing dining experiences I have had in a great while.  I went on a Friday night with no reservation, and though it seemed packed we  only waited about 20 minutes for a table. While we waited we got a drink from the bartender, who was clearly slammed but still managed to take the time to find me a wine I would love.  I am not a vegetarian but I found the all vegetarian menu to be interesting and enticing. I had the sweet potato enchilada and my fiancé had one of the specials, a Moroccan chick pea stew served in a squash bowl with mashed potatoes. Both were incredible!!!! The food was a great combination of unique, distinct, flavorful, comforting, and delicious. I would have ordered either of the dishes over a meat based dish at any other restaurant.  Ambiance is simple and soothing, nice lighting and I love the exposed brick walls.  Also the owner baked all of the deserts options and they sounded phenomenal. I wanted to taste so much of the menu that I was left without room for a desert tasting... Revolution kitchen is clearly an owner operated establishment (something we sometimes lack in the  Burlington area), with friendly staff, wonderful customer service (even under stress) and fabulous food. I highly recommend this place and can't wait to go back.
