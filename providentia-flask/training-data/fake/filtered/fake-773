This is the most pleasant place to eat in the neighborhood. I love the earthy inside and the big picture window that makes up the front wall (opened up in nice weather, closed when it's sweltering or cold out) and the garden out back is really nice, a perfect oasis. I've only had lunch food, but it's a great place to sit and chat or have a meeting over lunch. They have a nice selection of tasty sandwiches, two soups of the day, and offer nice soup/salad/sandwich combos. The sandwiches come with a small salad anyway, so getting soup and sandwich gets you all three. Their gingerade is really spicy and delicious. Everyone I've interacted with here is really nice, and the atmosphere is so pleasant that I want to go all the time.
