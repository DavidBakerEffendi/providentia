By far the best tapas/wine bar in the area, maybe the best out side of New York. I say the best considering price service and quality of food.  We have been through the entire menu and have not had a bad dish yet.  The only time we were disappointed was during resturant week but that was mostly due to high demand and a fixed menu.  If you are looking for a nice meal with good wine at a reasonable price Ibiza is a great choice!
