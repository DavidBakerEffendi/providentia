Forget about what you think you know about tacos.  There's no crunchy taco shell, greasy ground beef, shredded lettuce, cheese or taco sauce to be seen on this truck.  When you order a taco at Tacqueria Autentica, you get your choice of high quality steak, pork, or free range chicken seasoned and cooked to perfection, loaded into a fresh, hand rolled soft corn tortilla, and served with freshly made pico de gallo or lime puree.  Everything is fresh, high quality, well prepared and delicious, and it's all made to order.  The logo on the truck says "simple, fresh, real", which really says it all.  The focus on quality and consistency is clear, and has led to a very loyal following at the truck's downtown Newark location.  My personal favorite menu item is the steak taco--the pork is also outstanding and the chicken is very tasty as well.  I also strongly suggest the tortas. Outstanding.
