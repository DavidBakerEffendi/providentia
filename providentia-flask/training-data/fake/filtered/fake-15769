I went here for the first time on 12/7/14.  I had a veggie omelet which was absolutely delicious!  I had a side of fresh bread and parmesan truffle fries which were also super satisfying.  They only offer 1 vegetarian option per brunch/lunch/dinner though but all those creative meat options were making me question myself.
