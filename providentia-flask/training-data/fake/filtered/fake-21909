There was a long line, but after tasting the food I can see why. We saw DiNic's on Man vs Food and thought, hey we're here why not try it. The pulled pork sandwich was fantastic and the service was so quick we waited in line for less than 5 minutes. I would definitely recommend DiNic's to anyone who travels to Philly.
