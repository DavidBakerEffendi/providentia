I had an absolutely wonderful experience at Spuntino. The atmosphere of the restaurant is rustic and cozy! We went with a group of friends which is usually a bit of a hassle for the wait staff but we had plenty of attentive waiters/waitresses bringing plate after plate and drink after drink! The wine list is huge so there is something for everyone and a sommelier to boot if you feel overwhelmed! Now... onto the food RISSOTTO BALLS. I am a vegetarian so I cannot very well comment on the meat dishes but again rissotto balls and the goat cheese and carmelized onion bruschetta were my favorites! I cannot wait to return!
