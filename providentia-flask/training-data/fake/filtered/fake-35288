We have been to Nolita several times since it opened and have always been impressed. The decor is warm and sophisticated and the wait staff is always friendly, quick, and eager to share the specials. My go-to is the chicken parm which is always huge and super crispy. My ONLY complaint is that the spaghetti it comes with is rinsed and can sometimes pool on my plate but I have absolutely no doubt I could ask for it sticky and they would accommodate (if only i could remember). I have had the pear and champagne drink a few times and it continues to impress. Â My husband gets the spaghetti and meatballs and stuffs himself silly. For dessert I have only had the cheesecake but, again, it was great. We will continue to scratch our italian itch here and will definitely try our luck with delivery!
