Montclair's best restaurant by far... From the relaxing ambiance and decor to the friendly wait staff and patrons, Uncle Momo brought back faith to the Montclair dining scene. My wife and I enjoyed an awesome, fresh salad and the main course was to die for. The ingredients, presentation and most importantly, the flavors were awesome. I can't say enough about this restaurant Looking forward to return ASAP.
