Mr. Dino's is a decades long fixture in Montclair, attracting high-schoolers at lunch time, mother's with kids during the afternoon and families for dinner.  The staff feel like family - friendly and extremely courteous.  The pizzas are perfect - crusty, sauce is mellow, and the cheese is the perfect combination of flavorful and melt-y.  You'll love it, like we do!
