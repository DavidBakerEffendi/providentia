Had a wonderful brunch Memorial Day sitting outside with my wife - glass of RIesling, and then a graciously offered of glass of a Framingham white, gratis.  Had barbecue brisket benedict with hash browns - delicious and very generous serving. Excellent service, food and atmosphere.  How can you go wrong there?
