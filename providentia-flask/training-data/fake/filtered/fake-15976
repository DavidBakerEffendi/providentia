I've been to the CT many times...back before it was renovated and under previous management, and a few times since renovation and under new management. I've never been blown away...met expectations at best and pricey.  Their wings used to be the bomb, but no more. On my last visit I ordered a Roasted Beet Salad for $12.00.  When the plate arrived, there were little piles...and I mean little, of chopped up spinach, beets, chevre cheese and walnuts.  the presentation was weak and bare.   Although tasty, for $12.00 I would have expected a meal sized salad.  This was a few mouthfuls at best.  It was as if they ran out of everything and tried to pull off a fast one as if I wouldn't notice the puny portion. Dissapointed is an understatement...I won't be back
