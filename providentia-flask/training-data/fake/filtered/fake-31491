I went to this restaurant with 5 other people this past Saturday.  When we arrived the hostess took my cell phone number and said the wait would be an hour.  We waited an hour and I went back to the hostess to see how much longer and she responded rudely with "its only been 8 minutes past an hour." So my party and I waited some more.  We had multiple drinks, were so hungry that we ordered appetizers from the bar and ate them in our laps while waiting.  When the wait reached two hours we went back to the hostess and her response was "oh you weren't seated yet?"  This was laughable considering the fact that she had my cell number and I did not receive one call that the table was ready. At this point we decided two hours was way to long to wait and the fact that we STILL didn't have a table was absolutely ridiculous, so we left. What made the situation worse was the fact that the hostess did not seem to care if we were seated or not.  Unfortunately our first time was so bad that we have no interest in going back.
