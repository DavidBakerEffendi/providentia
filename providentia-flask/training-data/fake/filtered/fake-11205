This was mass confusion. We ordered the Roast Lamb Paninni for $15.00 and sat at one of only three tables set aside for rotiisserie customers only.  No beverages to be found. It took about 15 minutes to find a bar and get a non-alcoholic drink. My friend went for coffee and the counter staff was very rude. We hadn't finished when some frantic woman stood over us and said "I'm not asking you to leave, but can you tell me when you are leaving?"   She kept pacing back and forth until we finally got up. It is too big, not enough seating, and the signage and directionals are poor.  Not interested in going back. New York is too full of great food, you just move on to something better.
