Well, it was my 52nd birthday on Sunay, and I wanted to try something different! A few friends called and offered to take me to dinner, so I choose this restaurant! And am I ever so happy I did! The food was as good as it gets! I had the Beef Drunken Noodles, extra, extra spicy and a bowl of spicy pork leg soup...excellent flavors all around! I will, without a doubt return there more often as there menu is quite extensive; not to mention the fact that with my drunken noodles I was giving a choice of meats, sliced or chopped!! I think its fair to say that I could have drunken noodles, for example, at least 6 ways; and that's not including the intensity of spice which our lovely waitress asked me to clarify as 2 extra! Its a beautiful, off Roosevelt Ave. restaurant, lovely service, extensive menu...all "as good as it gets!"
