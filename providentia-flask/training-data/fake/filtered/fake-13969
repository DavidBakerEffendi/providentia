Went there for dinner (made a reservation for two). Started off with the Stuffed Meatballs (even though it only comes with 2 meatballs, they're big enough) and in my opinion, it's pretty worth it! Wanted to try the pork rines everyone was raving about but was told they took it off the menu :( (oh well!) We also got the Grilled Mediterranean Octopus dish and it was delicious!! - along with the Beastia pizza (for any meat lovers out there). Was too full to try their desserts which sounded awesome but will definitely be back soon to try their Salted Caramel Budino! --The only negative thing I have to say about this place is that some of the tables are way too close to each other, I mean, yeah, it is a small restaurant but they are inches away from each other and gives you barely any privacy (you can hear everyones conversations). We were sat at a table and there was another table for two that was  just inches away from our table and it was really tight. I guess for next time I can put in a special request for a table that's a bit isolated and not 3 inches from another table.   Overall, this is a great place to try if you want Mediterranean food.
