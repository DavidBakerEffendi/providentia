When it comes to Italian food I try to stay out of New Jersey and stay local in my area. But a couple of nights ago I found myself over the bridge and hungry. So I check the reviews of the local restaurants and decided to give Mulberry Street a chance. Upon entering I found myself greeted by not only the staff but the owner too had personally introduced himself. He was a friendly gentleman that seemed genuinely passionate and extremely knowledgeable about his line of work. This demeanor also carried over to the staff, when I asked the waitress for a recommendation of what to order. She advised that I maybe try one of the house specials with a recommended wine pairing. That was probably the best advice I had heard all day. I had the most delicious Osso Bucco that was complimented perfectly by a fabulous Tuscan wine. The best dining experience I've had In Jersey. If your in the area I must recommend Mulberry Street, you wont be disappointed.
