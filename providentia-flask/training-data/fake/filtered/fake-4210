Service 5 Food 4 Ambience 4 Two of us came in for the first time last night. Loved the clean, modern decor. But hard walls and ceiling Â amplifies the noise in the small room - pretty jangly. A nicely varied menu. We shared 2 apps, a salad, a main. Flavoring all very nice but no heat at all, unfortunately typical of HK Thai places. Service was prompt and cheerful. Had wine at happy hour prices. All and all a pleasant experience. Will give it another try because we want them to succeed here in the neighborhood.
