There is parking - and I can never get free parking in Montclair, if I can get parking at all. My 23-yr old son loves it - I love it - and my 9-yr old loves it. The atmosphere is warm, and it doesn't hurt that I can get a glass of wine there too. We go there at least a few times a week. Usually my daughter gets a burger but I love their specials. The tuna I had recently was phenomenal but I also like the steak...so if you want to have a relaxed, stress-free great meal and be able to park your car, this is perfect. It's about Â a minute from Montclair.
