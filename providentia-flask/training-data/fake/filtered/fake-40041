Took me 4 trips to this place to finally be able to get a slice. First time: closed Second time: closed because of extreme weather(with what he charges  for his pizza, you would think the place would have an A/C 3rd time: closed because they ran out of dough(never heard anything so ridiculous before) 4th time: woohoooo! Finally I got a slice, and the moment I took the first bite I couldn't help but laugh and think about that famous PT Barnum quote. The pizza was garbage. Burnt, well, actually, more like charred, tasteless and just not worth even a penny. Do yourself a favor, and go to John's on  Bleeker, or any decent pizzeria in Brooklyn(every neighborhood has at least half a dozen of them) and stay away from this shithole.
