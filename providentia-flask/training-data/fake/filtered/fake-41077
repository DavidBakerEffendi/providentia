I figured while I was in the land of Yelp yelping for place in NYC I had to mention this one. My esthetician said her sis took her here, and when I looked it up on Yelp it had good enough reviews to try it out. It may be tiny as all sh*t and the lines are hella long, but the pizza is drool over, orgasmically, good. Now being born and raised in Los Angeles, maybe I don't hold pizza to a high standard, but what the hell is wrong with all you yelpers saying this place is 3 stars? DO YOU EAT PIZZA? Geez. All NY pizza is good to me, but this place is worth the wait in line during a snow storm. Â It also is nice that is is right by the rice pudding place. Mmmm I want the stuff now! Gooey. Crusty. Mmmm...
