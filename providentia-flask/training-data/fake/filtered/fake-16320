Great ambiance!  Place was hopping & we were seated in the 'hall' which has no ambiance..our wishes to be seated in the main bar were granted once a 4 top became available. I'm not the meat & potato or gravy type so for me, the menu was limited. I chose the sausage & cheese stew...served Luke warm.  Was reheated in the kitchen at my request.  Waitress knocked over my beer, about 3/4 empty & never offered to replace or refill. Burped all night & will never return.
