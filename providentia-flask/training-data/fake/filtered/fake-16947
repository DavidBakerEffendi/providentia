We found this purely by accident, because they had such cute blue tables outside. It was too cold to eat outside so we went in and had a fabulous Sunday brunch. We arrived about 10a and just beat the crowd. But the service was fantastic at squeezing everyone in and very upbeat. The food was fantastic - small menu, very French influence. I had the simple granola/yougurt/fruit bowl but it was fantastic. My friend had the baked eggs and loved it. Great coffee too (and I'm a Seattle snob about that).
