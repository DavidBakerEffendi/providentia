Been a long time customer more than 20 years, drive here on my way to visit family in Western Mass., my mother is from Bavaria and she's been going there forever too. This past week we stopped in and picked up several items and we were greatly disappointed everything was very very very salty, did I mention it was too salty. Levakasse and bratwurst and some assorted luncheon meats. Salt is NOT a substitute for spices and flavoring.
