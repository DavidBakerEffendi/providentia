Been hearing about this place for some time - finally made the reservation (which I recommend) on Open Table; Food NYC worthy - although, well played choosing a location in Bloomfield, NJ where there is no competition. Very trendy restaurant with amazing food. If the food was terrible, I'd still give this restaurant 5 stars for the service. Even the bus boy knew the menu enough to answer my questions. Staff was friendly and knew the menu well. We started with the mushroom tempura - highly recommend. The dipping sauce was incredible. Mushroom risotto was delicious. We went with the pot pies - they're huge but deflate once you stick a fork in them - the inside isn't heavy like a typical pot pie although by the end you feel like you ate something thick and hearty (in the best way possible). Squirrel nuts were a fun little treat. Ended with a bailey's dessert shot - amazing. I'll be here again.
