Although I have no complaints about the food, I was there about a week ago and the waitress spilled some kind of sauce all over my sweater, coat and hair. Â She apologized a few times and also sent the manager over. The manager had the nerve to offer to reimburse me for my dry cleaning as if it costs $100. For the manager to have come to my table and only offer that he should of stayed whereever he was and saved his speech. I never returned so they can reimburse the dry cleaning costs.
