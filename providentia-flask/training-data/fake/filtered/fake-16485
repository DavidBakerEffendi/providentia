I am really disappointed with my order today. I called looking to see which would be faster: if I picked up or had it delivered, the lady on the phone said they were not busy and 35 minutes.. 1 hour later I called only to be told that it had not left yet. When it finally arrived 15 minutes later one of the pizzas was wrong.
