Overcrowded, overpriced and overrated.  The food was good.  I understand it is tapas, but 15 for beef stew and it literally had 3 small pieces of beef.  The prosecco was very good and I love the design of the menu and wine list. Our waiter was great too.  I know that Martha Stewart loves this place, but I don't get it.
