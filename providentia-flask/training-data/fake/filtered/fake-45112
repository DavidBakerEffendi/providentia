I wish I could show you a picture of what was delivered to my house earlier today. It was so bad I posted it to their Facebook page. I made this account on yelp just to alert everyone to how absolutely terrible this establishment is. I ordered delivery today at 540. At 715 (approximately 30 minutes according to them) I received a cold pizza and a box full of their 'appetizer sampler' which was thrown together all in one box, missing all the sauces and looked like an absolute disgrace. I'm disgusted that they charged $40 for this and they should be embarrassed to serve such low pitiful quality food.
