Dear Tuckerbox, quit playing games with my heart! The petite young lady with dark hair and glasses, god bless her, probably shouldn't be working in a customer service job...The coffee here is among the best in the UV and the food is decent but WAY over priced. For $4.75 you should be able to get a grilled cheese and a soup...come on! For that price you can go to the CO-OP and get a loaf of bread and some cheese. I want to give you more stars but between the customer service being inconsistent and the prices, I guess I'll just take my coffee to go.
