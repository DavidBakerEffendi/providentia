I would not recommend this restaurant. We had a deal that I bought offline. Â We tried to use it for lunch, but the owner rejected it because he said it was suppose to be for dinner only. However, it did not specify lunch or dinner. In addition, he claimed that dine-in only was equivalent to dinner only. RIDICULOUS! Also, we both ordered panini's and they were far from impressive. If you are going to use panini in the name of your restaurant, it should be awesome. It was fair, at best. The waitress was friendly, although the service overall was not great (drink refills were sparse, the chef put cheese on my sandwich even after the waitress specified I'm allergic). We will never return to this restaurant.
