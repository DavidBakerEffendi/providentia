Thomas M. Philadelphia, PA 9/13/2009 I  do not know why people give this place a bad review.  Stop ordering all the wierd things that none really knows how they should taste.  Cream chip beef. AMAZING best ever.  go there and order it and eat it and come here and write a review.  Yeah, there are occasional mistakes made, when they are swamped with customers and there is now room to stand let alone sit, so stop making the servers life difficult, order whats on the menu, eat it fast and get out of my way.  Oh yeah and stop ordering the peanut butter pie, its always out when i get there.
