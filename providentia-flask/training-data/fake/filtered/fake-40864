Okay in case no one knows it is the first pizza in America and its still amzing. I am torn between grimaldis and here but as it turns out the patzy learned how to make pizza from the original lombardi. Both legendary pizza places so it makes it hard to Â choose. But I hate the fact that there is no dessert but we are here for pizza not dessert, so keep making great pizza. Even though little Italy is not as big anymore and it changed all around you, dont change a thing or maybe just add desert. Well on second thought just go down to the legendary ferara pastry shop down the block.
