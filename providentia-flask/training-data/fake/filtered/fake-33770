BEST TEX MEX FOOD IN JERSEY I dont understand why so many people are giving this place 1 star! This place has the best tex mex food i have ever, the waitstaff are all friendly and knowledgeable.  There is a reason why its always at least an hour wait....BECAUSE THE FOOD IS INCREDIBLE. Food comes out hot and fast.  Obviously the food is incredible, why else would people wait upwards of two hours to get a table!
