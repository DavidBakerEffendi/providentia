I have only ever ordered for delivery to Port Richmond and have been very happy with almost every order. Â There are very few Indian restaurants in Philly, and even fewer in the northeast corner so I was thrilled to have them deliver. I usually order a little extra for a leftover meal the next day. If you have not tried Indian before and you try delivery or takeout they place little labels on each of the containers. I don't need that but can see how helpful it is to anyone trying something for the 1st time. The Biryani is quite good and, to me, very spicy. My standard is the chicken tikka masala and palak paneer. Both very tasty. Murg Malai Kabob was a very pleasant surprise and is now my new favorite. Delivery guys are all very nice and always deliver within the estimated time they state when the order is placed.
