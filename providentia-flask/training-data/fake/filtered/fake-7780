Great atmosphere if you can afford $9.50 for a 3 sip house margarita.  No extras and if you're not a 20 something don't sit at the bar, you'll be treated like an alien (from another planet that is).  For a real margarita go next door to the cuban restaurant and get a real lime juice margarita 3 times the size for 50 cents more.
