I really liked this spot for drinks and small bites. The guacamole is wonderful and I cannot say enough about it! The margaritas are the perfect complement to the food as well. It has a great atmosphere but has a tendency to get crowded quickly. I've had better authentic Mexican from smaller local shops but this one is really good for as big as it is. Definitely check it out!
