What a great place! My wife & I had a great meal here on Friday night.  I will be dreaming about the wild mushroom risotto and the lamb with lentils until next time.   The service was attentive but not overbearing ~ the food was elegant, but not fussy ~ portions were great ~ price was right ~ and they had a live musician who added to the really cool surroundings. There was a great mix of people ~ some older ~ some hanging at the bar/counter and having drinks while watching the chefs.  It is a BYO but nowadays ~ that's more the norm in NJ ~ and personally I like that it keeps you bill down a bit. They apparantely do cooking classes, which we are going to plan with a group of our friends for a holiday get together.   Definite thumbs up!!
