Absolutely the best under $10 meal with meat you can get anywhere in NYC, hands down!!! Make sure you go to the one on West corner of 53rd & 6th Ave. For $6 (plus $1 if you want a water/soda) you can get a full meal, actually enough for 2 people. I have yet to down the Rice and Lamb/Chicken platter in one sitting (... though I'm sure it can be done). Yes there is a line (20-40 min pretty much all of the time from Noon to 5am), but it'stotally worth the wait...If you're new to the street vendors in NYC or you just want a filling super-late nite food treat This is THE Place to go! Plus it's Halal (similar concept as Kosher). I recommend the 1/2 Lamb & 1/2 chicken platter over rice with some pieces of pita bread & lettuce salad! Load-up on the white sauce, be very careful with the volcanic red hot sauce though, especially if spicy is not your thing. Grab & go for a picnic to go in Central Park!!! WARNING: Can be addictive & habit forming...Used to going here weekly in the summers, after a late nite out, turned into a lunch fix too.
