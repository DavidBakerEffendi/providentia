We have been going to the Reo for over 20 years, and this was the first time we walked out! Our food arrived cold, and not prepared the way we requested it; which could be excused given how busy they were. What CANNOT be excused is that we waited 10 minutes for our food to be returned after it was heated in a microwave. When I told our waiter all they did was put it in the microwave, he denied it! Apparently the new thing is to bring people "fresh" plates of food with ketchup on them. I don't know if the Reo is under new management or if the people normally there just took some time off...but we won't be back for a long while to find out. Very disappointing!
