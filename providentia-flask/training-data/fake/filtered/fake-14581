Lovely place but I have to admit the burger patties tasted like it came right from the freezer. I don't typically like really thick burgers and I'm a huge fan of bacon cheeseburgers & if you want one of those just go to Wendy's because plan b's doesn't have the right flavor. I tried it twice then the next time I went I tried their pasta with sausage it's great when you eat it there. My boyfriend enjoys their turkey burger
