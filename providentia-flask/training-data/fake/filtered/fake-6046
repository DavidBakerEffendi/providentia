The food here is amazing and full of bursting flavor in every bite. The nachos were so filling I didn't even touch my entree. I had to take it home! The best thing to do here is try new things that you never have before. It's a nice inexpensive place. The restaurant is a bit small & they do not accepted credit cards, but there is an ATM. Over all the place is awesome.
