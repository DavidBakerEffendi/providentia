I am a big fan of Italian food and usually eat out at Italian restaurants. I have yet to find a better Italian restaurant than Mikes, anywhere. Ive been coming to this restaurant for over 10 years and I have never had a bad experience. The food is delicious and they have the best penne vodka. The buschetta is yummy, shrimp cocktail, calamari, chicken marsala, NY strip steak, etc. ITs all delicious. They have a pretty extensive menu with lots of options, especially compared to other Italian restaurants in northern NJ. Its not expensive at all and you normally dont need a reservation, unless the entire place is booked for a party. Mike is always very friendly and accommodating and a gentleman. I once called last minute on Mother's Day and MIke was able to seat me and my family. We've had numerous birthdays and other events here and its always been great. Everyone I bring or refer to Mikes always enjoys the food. If you like great food at a very reasonable price in a nice setting with great service, then Mikes is your place.
