The Best German restaurant I have ever been to. German cuisine is very different, but here it is AMAZING!!! The Bierstube Duck is magnificent!!!! It melts in your mouth and mixes extremely well with the spices. They have a very extensive beer selection, wine list, and mixed drinks. Their drinks are really good too. They are not stingy when it comes to the liquor in the drinks. Sauvignon Blanc is a great wine to try out. This is definitely somewhere I'm going to bring my friends after work.
