That was great experience ! I and my wife went there for dinner at weekend , there were so many customers in there ,Fortunately we 've got reserved before we came . The service was super! and food was great!! Â we took shell steak and pasta via nice lady 's recommendation,. The whole weekend been kind of enjoy because of that dinner
