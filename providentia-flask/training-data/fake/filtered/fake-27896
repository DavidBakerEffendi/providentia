I didn't realize that there were so many food critics in NYC. To say that this pizza is anything but great compared to the average everyday slice is just ridiculous. To compare price is also just plain stupid, the ingredients in the pizza I had were just the ultimate in taste and freshness, the ricotta in my calzone was so creamy and obviously fresh. Is there better pizza, well there are people who swear Dominoes is the bomb so I guess there is better pizza. I seen some complete moron had something to say about no meat on Fri during lent and also something to say about the girls that work there. I think he has much bigger issues than the pizza. BOTTOM LINE, IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A GREAT PIZZA AND CALZONE THAT YOU CAN'T GET AT A REGULAR PIZZERIA, THIS IS IT!!!!. If you are worried about the wait time and the price, I guess you have never been to a rest in Manhattan or the best places in Brooklyn either.
