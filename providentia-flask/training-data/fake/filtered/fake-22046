A group of us came in for Happy Hour for the 2nd time, after having a good experience the previous time. FOOD: 4/5 - I ordered the Margarita Pizza off the Happy Hour menu and the Braised Meatballs off the regular menu. Both were very good. DRINKS: 3/5 - Ordered the Strawberry Belini for the second time. It didn't taste the same when I had it the first time. I think they changed the ingredients? Never the less, its a $5 drink . SERVICE: 5/5 - Our waiter Josh was absolutely hilarious, he served us last time. Very personal and very attentive, made sure we were all happy. ATMOSPHERE: 5/5 - Beautiful decor, love the light up sign on top of the bar. Can get quite noisy around dinner time, then dies down after. Â  OVERALL EXPERIENCE: 4/5: Good, but with high expectations in the future. Hopefully service stays consistent along with the food and drinks. They set the bar high.
