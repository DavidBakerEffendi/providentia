Second time it happened!!! Very very annoying!!! I went to pick up some sliders since most other places were closed at 10pm in the hood. A spacey blonde haired girl took my order for 4 sliders, 2 fries and a pecan pie. I asked:" Please make sure you give me enough BBQ sauce" After I had placed he order, the fry-cook asked me if I wanted the Pecan Pie heated up...I said sure, expecting the pie to be heated up in an oven. He informed me it would take 1 minute in the Mic!!!! I'm not a baker, but sugar and micro-waves don't really jive with each other. Thankful of the info, I declined the offer! While the cook and the girl packed up my order I reminded her about the sauce which was followed by an annoyed look! Came home, opened the bag, no sauce, saltless soggy fries (use paper so fries can breath, not plastic lined boxes) and over-cooked burgers (cooking basics, meat keeps on cooking when warm and enclosed). I called and asked to speak to the blonde girl that took my order. I told her she forgot to put the sauce in the bag, told me come pick it up. Told her I'm home, Asked me if I was just calling to complain, told her yes after which I received the Abu line:"Thank you come again" and hung up! Pretty funny line as long as you're not stuck with shitty food! It would help if there was a manager and not have it run like a highschool cafeteria!!!
