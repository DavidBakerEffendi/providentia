i LOVED this place. the atmosphere was great, people were very friendly, very relaxed , and most importantly the food was awesome!!! u can tell the menu was carefully thought out by a culinary expert. creme anglaise french toast, and eggs benedict. two types of potatoes! so clean and Â just an awesome all around experience. I will be going back!!!
