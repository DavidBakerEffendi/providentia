We went there last Sunday and really enjoyed the food and the service. We had nine people (5 adults and 4 preteens). We ordered the $128 menu. Had 4 cold dishes,  six hot dishes and soup. All were well made authentic Shanghai style food. We especially liked the cold roast beef and sweet sour whole fish.  Good value and good food.
