I have gluten intolerance so you would think I'd be a fan. I don't think I'll ever go back to Risotteria.  I visited on August 18th during the lunch hour.  I begged my friend to come with me (he eats gluten) and I was overjoyed when he agreed.  It's so rare that I eat pizza!  We'd both visited the restaurant last year.  I loved it then.  He didn't think it was great.  This time our waitress was truly a snob.  She gave me still water when I asked for sparkling, made it clear she did not appreciate our menu choices, and ignored us for most of our meal.  Overall, bad vibes from the whole experience.  Honestly, I make better pizza.  Theirs was too starchy- the dough was so chewy it stuck to my teeth. Why drag your gluten-eating friends here and deal with attitude and lack luster GF cooking?  Make it at home!  And do something else with your 50$.
