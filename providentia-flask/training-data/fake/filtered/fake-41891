Went here for the first time on a recommendation. It was really good! We had made a reservation, which was nice because we sat right down. The food came out in a timely fashion and was FABULOUS! The veal parm was out of this world. The waiter told us everything they had that was not on the menu (i.e. shrimp parm, penne a la vodka, pesto). The drinks were good too. The bolognese was the best my friend said he ever had (and he was born in Italy). The cannoli was also amazing. Everything was so fresh! Would definitely go back here! The prices aren't too expensive. Loved it!
