I would give this restaurant 5 stars if I could only rate the service. My girlfriend and I are new to the area and told Buddakan was a must. We decided to go on a Saturday night a few weeks ago. With most nights out, we usually sit at the bar for a few drinks and then head to our table. As we settled into the bar, we were warmly greeted by the bartender Michelle. She told us about the menu and asked when our reservation was. Even though we didn't have a reservation we were told the wait would be about 30 minutes. She offered to serve us at the bar with a full menu. My girlfriend had the zengrea which was great. I had the strength. After 30 minutes we inquired about our table with another bartender and she called the hostess. She was unable to confirm our seating time but encouraged us to grab an appetizer at the bar. So we decided to have a couple of appetizers. They came out quickly and were tasty. The bartenders were so nice and accommodating about our wait we decided to eat at the bar. We had a really fun time eating at the bar I'm glad we decided to stay. The food was prompt but sometimes disappointing. I didn't like the cashew chicken (I should've taken the suggestion of the sea bass). We were disappointed by the cocktail of the month and the fact we couldn't read/see anything because it was so dark. Other than that, I would give the service an A+.
