Here is one of the best restaurant in NYC because the hospitality of staff is sooooooo good than I expected. Thanks to her, I can't forget having a dinner this special day .The day I went to Jacob's pickles is first time America, first time New york city. I would like Â to call at this restaurant again if I have an opportunity to go to America!
