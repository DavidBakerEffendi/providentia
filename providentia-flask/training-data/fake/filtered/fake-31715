I agree with the other posts. This place is really awful. The night waitress was really rude, ruined the whole meal so can't even say anything good about the food. The waitress needs a lesson on health codes or a visit with the healh department. she took dirty glasses from one table by inserting her hand into the glasses then proceeded to the next table to fill water glasses. She was training another waitress so I hope she does not use the same unhealthy practices. Not a good experience.
