From a party of 8 on a Saturday evening. Â Nice ambiance and layout; seating not cramped. Sangria (Red) nicely blended. Awesome apps: We ordered the warmed chips and guacamole and mussels in white wine/bay leaf/chile broth. As for the main entrees, Steak Frites was pretty good. Their hangar steak was nicely cooked in medium-pink. Love the herbed fries as it reminded me of the fries served at Brasserie Jo (upscale but awesome food; one of my faves) in Boston, MA. I also tried a piece of their fish-of-the-day special (a mild texture like a fillet of sole; can't recall name of fish)... Very good; Chef knows how to grill/cook fish. Dessert-wise... Like their Tiramisu, but love the custard flan and chocolate souffle. Would definitely revisit again.
