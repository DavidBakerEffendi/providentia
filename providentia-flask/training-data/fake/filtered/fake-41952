I have been looking for a good Mexican restaurant in the city and didn't find any luck until I came across Xochitl.  The menu is full of delicious entrees, but my favorite part of the menu was the build-your-own guacamole; it is by far the best guacamole I have ever tasted!  The service was very kind also, they always made sure there was a drink on our table and that we were satisfied with the meal.  Xochitl is now one of my favorite restaurants in Philly.  The tequila bar is fantastic; there are so many great cocktails on the drink menu my friends and I love to try.  My girlfriends and I are definitely taking advantage of Xochitl during restaurant week this week and next!  If you are looking for a good tequila cocktail or a delicious Mexican meal, I highly suggest you come to Xochitl -- for the great service, drinks, and food!
