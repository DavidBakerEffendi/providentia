Everything we had was delicious! Went as as group so had plenty to taste. Tried kangaroo for the first time - not bad! The scallops and foie gras were also good. My favorite dish on the menu by far is Turkish Eggs, which is two poached eggs on Greek yogurt with kirmizi biber butter. Omg, drooling right now just thinking about it. My counterparty has always ordered (of the 3 times i have been) Tea-smoked salmon, which is spinach and poached eggs on toasted sourdough with yuzu hollandaise. Also very delicious. I love coming here and we always leave full and happy.
