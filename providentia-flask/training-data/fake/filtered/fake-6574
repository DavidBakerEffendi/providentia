Had dinner here this past weekend and had to mention their great service.  The staff was very friendly and someone was constantly by our table asking if we needed anything or refilling our drinks.  I had the roasted beat salad, very good, and the veg. tagliatelli which was super fresh and light.  The dining room however gets VERY loud and it's hard to even think sometimes, never mind carry on a conversation.  I love their outdoor seating during the summer months and am looking forward to that for the peace and quiet.  During the summer they usually have a trout with lentils dish which I highly recommend!
