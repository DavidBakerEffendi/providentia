Perhaps the best thing I can say about Rho is the decor is a vast improvement over the former Katmandu. The food? Not so much. We were seated and waited several minutes before our server approached us to take a drink order. We then waited another long while before she came back to take our food order. The lunch menu is rather limited and I chose a burger - medium rare. I noted that sweet potato fries were offered with a lunch special and when I asked if I could sub them in place of regular fries I was told no. My medium rare burger came and when I cut into it it was medium to medium-well. *sigh* I sent it back asking for it be redone. The second burger arrived - medium to medium-well again. I was hungry and my companion was making headway on his meal, so I reluctantly ate the overdone burger. I never thought I'd miss Katmandu - but I do miss their menu, especially the chicken sandwich with boursin and the 'island fries'. Italian restaurants (as this is supposed to be) are a dime a dozen in Jersey, did we really need another? I had a giggle over their monitors above the bar advertising bottle service. Really? This is Trenton, New Jersey. Get over yourself - you're a mediocre Italian restaurant with a nightclub in the evenings. Pretentious much? I left less than impressed. I doubt I'll bother to come back.
