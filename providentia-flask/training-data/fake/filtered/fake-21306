I've been to a number of Latin restaurants before and have never really been so amazed at their quesadillas.. Bogota's chicken quesadilla is by far the best.. It has a slight sweetness in every bite.. I'm not really pleased with the arepas.. The service was excellent, from the host to the server and people who takes the plates..
