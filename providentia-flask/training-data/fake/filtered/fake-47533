Highly overrated, which as expected for any place that supposedly has 'the best pizza in New York.' It's not even New York style pizza at all. It's pretentious, super thin, designer pizza that's tailored to snobby food critics. It's fine, but I'd take a $2 slice from a random corner pizza place in Manhattan over it any day. Also, the line is ridiculous, it's cash only (guess they didn't hear it's 2010?), and they only sell whole pizzas.
