My favorite restaurant! Always a go to when my friends and I can't decide where to eat. You can't go wrong. Muscles and shrimp are a must, the sauces are amazing. The tortilla, papas bravas, and croquetas are also incredible. The service is great and they bring you plate after plate of fresh baked bread.
