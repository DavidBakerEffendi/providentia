I was very excited to try the Firefox after hearing so many great things from friends and co workers. So a few sundays ago my husband surprised me and took us for dinner. I'm absolutely horrified at my experience. We were seated in a server named Wendy's section. As she approached our table the first thing we noticed was that her eyes were blood shot and her speech was slurred. Also she smelled very strongly of alcohol. We asked to speak with a manager right away. She told us she would go get said manager. After waiting 25 mins we got up to leave. On the way out my husband and I noticed her at the bar drinking wine! Then watched her stumble away to the next unfortunate table. The firebox should be ashamed to call themselves a five star restaurant with such trash as a serving staff.
