Great place, had lamb instead of my usual....chicken and garlic sauce.  Amazing! Service was really good, but we went on a slow night.  P.s. The lamb was done with cumin and hot peppers, the waiter said it was closer to traditional food....so worth it.  12.00 was the price for the dinner entree, very fair for the quality, too!
