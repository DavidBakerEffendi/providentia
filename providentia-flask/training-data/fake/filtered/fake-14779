Went in Friday night for the second time and was very happy to see how much was improved since my first visit.  I went the first time only because I drove by earlier and saw the name change and figured id come back to check it out.  Apparently that night was a "soft opening" but nothing was soft about it because it was mobbed and anyone come in. It seemed chaotic but that was expected.  Friday night was very buys but our service was great and the food was amazing.  I had ribs and they were huge and my girlfriend got a salmon dish and loved it.  glad to see its doing well.  Especially after reading some of the reviews posted before mine by morons.  One idiot said they charge for ice in drinks and he has no idea what he is talking about. . a "rocks" charge is because it goes in a rocks glass and has more liquor than a plain shot.  Also, anyone who complains about an experience at a soft opening should just not go out to eat at all.  Ill be going back
