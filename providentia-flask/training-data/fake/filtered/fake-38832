And now they're open on Monday! (8 to 6) Â The espresso drinks may be expensive (they've crossed the $4 latte threshold) but the whole experience notably terrific and very true to the neighborhood. Delicious granola, toast "soldiers," an addictive mushroom soup... a lot of locals with laptops but the staff doesn't seem to mind. So glad to have it here!
