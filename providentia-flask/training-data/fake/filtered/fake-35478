I have been to Brickyard multiple times and there is a reason I keep going back: Great beer selection and pretty decent food. It may be hard to get a table Saturday and Sundays during football season, but we have rarely had trouble getting a table when desired.  The most recent visit was early on a Friday night and the front bar area was packed, so we were seated in the dining area.  Service was friendly and prompt, they were able to accommodate our stroller (and infant) no problem (although the few stairs to the back were tricky with the stroller). They have a rotating section of drafts (about 6 or 7) that change monthly and usually offers something new for people who get tired of the same microbrews on tap in every bar in NYC. The burger was good, not great, but certainly decent enough to go back again.  The truffle fries are my favorite part of the meal, and I always make a point to order them whether for brunch, lunch or dinner.  Without the truffle fries, I would probably give 3.5 stars, but definitely a good 4-star place.
