Expensive for brunch but moderate pricing for lunch. I had their bacon turkey lunch sandwich which was so-so. The ingredients were good quality but the meat was ice cold and the bread was piping hot. Their shoestring fries were very good. The atmosphere of the cafe was very laid back and hipster. Good place!
