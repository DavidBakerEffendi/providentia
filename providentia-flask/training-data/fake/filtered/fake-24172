If this were the 5th grade and the day before Valentine's Day, I would be making the biggest, most elaborate, and glitteriest homemade card for Paesanos to express my undying affection. Most of the sandwiches are huge (though delicious and the flavors well balanced) but my favorite, the Gustaio is the perfect size: on flatbread instead of a roll, the most succulent lamb sausage, blue cheese, roasted fennel, and cherry mostardo! It's heaven. And the potatoes are roasted in pork drippings. (Bad news for vegetarians) There could be nothing better.
