Do not make any large orders from this restaurant. They are extremely unprofessional. We ordered a $200 lunch order for a business meeting, it was not until I called 15 minutes after the order was supposed to be delivered that their rude employee told me they decided not to fill the order. Their food may be good, but they'll never be able to handle anything more than "falafel cart" style traffic. DO NOT RELY ON FOR CATERING OR LARGE ORDERS!!!!!
