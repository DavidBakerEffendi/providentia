Soooo good. Definitely some of the best friend chicken I've had. And that Mac and cheese, ugh, I drool thinking of it. The staff is extremely polite and a pleasant. I've never had to wait more than 5 minutes to get a seat. I love the decor and the vibe. And I always laugh when I use the bathroom because I know how it used to look when the venue was Max Fish haha.
