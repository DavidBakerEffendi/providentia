This has got to be the best pizza the city has to offer. AND they have an incredible menu with greek, italian, and local food as well.  The Chef Bobby Saritsoglou is amazing. Everything he makes is absolutely delicious.  His staff and the owners are pleasant, courteous, and skilled at what they do. The menu pricing is really very reasonable for what you get.  If you're local to the area- go back again and again. If you're visiting, it's worth the trip.
