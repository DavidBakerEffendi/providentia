We brunched here today.  The cocktail we ordered was out of this world - even had a spicy kick to it. Their mixologist is a true artist.    Our food was very, very, very salty.  It was borderline oversalted - but aside from that, the rest of the spice blend/flavor profile was dead on and the food was cooked perfectly.  Loved the arepas.  I'd go back again and just ask them to go easy on the sodium.
