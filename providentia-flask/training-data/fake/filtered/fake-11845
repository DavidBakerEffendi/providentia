Have eaten here every time I visit New York and keep coming back for more. Menu changes regularly and EVERYTHING is delicious! Always creative combinations of the freshest food. I usually end up getting some combination of sandwich, soup and salad which are unlike any I have eaten before. Agree with previous reviewer to try and arrive before noon when the line explodes. Grab a table outside and watch the people go by....
