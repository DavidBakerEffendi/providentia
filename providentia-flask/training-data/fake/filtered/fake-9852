Went here for brunch.  The Bloody Mary was superb, very peppery, how I like it.  I got the pancakes and they were light and fluffy, and came with a salted caramel sauce that was more like just plain caramel sauce, but still delicious.  The burrata appetizer was great! (It's one of my favorite things so when I saw it on the menu I couldn't resist) The pesto sauce it came with delicious also.  I recommend calling ahead and making a reservation.
