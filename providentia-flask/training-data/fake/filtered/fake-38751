If you don't eat pig, this is not the place for you.  I don't eat pig, but there were a few options to choose from.  However, I was jealous of my friend's meals that looked utterly delicious! Prices were comparable to other BYOB's.  The quail was tender and delicious.  The one down-side is that they were small and not filling.  The waiter mentioned that I should also order a pasta dish, but I didn't want to buy two entrees.   I've noticed sitting outside usually means slower service, and it was no exception at Melograno.  Our waiter was not only over worked, he was stressed and taking out his frustrations on us which took a while to adjust too.
