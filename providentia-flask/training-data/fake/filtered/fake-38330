While they have good pizza, this is Montclair. Everybody has good pizza, and there are several other brick ovens around. I go here because it's literally around the corner from my house, but never again. Why? Because I just got hung up on. Tonight is the second night that I have tried to get pizza from them--an entire half hour before they close--and their grill had already been shut down for the night. My boyfriend went to get it, so when he called to tell me this, I called Ah'Pizz. I asked the person that answered what their hours were, and he reported exactly what Yelp reports and what is stated outside their establishment door: 10 pm (Sunday night). I said, "No, what are your actual hours? My boyfriend just came in at 9:30 and the grill was already turned off." He said that, well, they close at 10 but they stop serving at 9:30. I replied that they should tell people this and have it clearly stated on their door. This is the second time this has happened to me. He had the nerve to laugh, say "yeah, okay," and hang up. (I should also mention that the time was now 9:40. When I asked about their hours, he just said that they close at 10. I had plenty of time to run out and get a pizza based on that information, and he decided to not even tell me that the grill was already shut down for the night.) Clearly they don't care much about their customers. There are much better establishments to spend my hard-earned money at, thank you very much.
