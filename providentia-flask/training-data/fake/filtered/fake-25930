The menu used to be awesome, and then it sucked, and now it's awesome again. The duck fries will change your life! Oh, and half priced drafts for happy hour. HALF PRICE! And really good beer! Plus, they put some thought into their draft list...we just visited during Belgian Beer week and the Cuvee Brut on draft was so yummy and a little dangerous. I might be biased as this is one of my neighborhood haunts, but everyone that has been with us loved it, and so should you. Go in the winter and sit by the fireplace - it's super cozy.
