This is the best place to eat in Chinatown, albeit it is not fancy in the least.  Order anything salt-baked - I like the tofu - or if you like soups/stews, try a hot pot, which comes to your table still sizzling.  I like the Buddha's hotpot, which is full of mushrooms, bamboo shoots, and the like.  Large portion sizes, too!
