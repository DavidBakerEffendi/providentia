This is the best Chinese take out/delivery place in the area. Their food is always so fresh and so flavorful! They have a great lunch special and you get a lot of food for a great price. My favorites include General Tso's Chicken, Beef w/Broccoli and Chicken w/Broccoli, and my all time favorite is Chicken with Cahews. Its diced chicken with chinese vegetables over fried rice.....DE-LISH! Highly Recommend this place!!!! Excellent Food at a Great Price.
