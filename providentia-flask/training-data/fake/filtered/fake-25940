Devil's Den is my new favorite spot!  It is a great mix of funky cool people and regular dudes who like sports, expensive bear and jokes.  There are lots of different types of places to sit, so the atmosphere is whatever you are in the mood for, really.  There are even big doors and windows that they open, which makes for indoor/outdoor seating.  It is friendly and fun with a fantastic chef!  He kills it!  The menu changes every so often, so it never gets boring, and his vegetarian option is getting better by the month.  Some of Chef Allan's dishes are so awesome you could cry!  We try and eat there at least once a week, and we can usually get out of there for under $50 for two if we don't drink to much.   And I've looked in the kitchen...   clean!!!!  All-in-all I'm a Devil's Denner.
