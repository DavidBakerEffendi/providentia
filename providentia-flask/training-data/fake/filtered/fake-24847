Toro Loco is actually larger than I thought inside.  There is a separate bar room and the dining room.  We tried the Paella--it's large enough to share for 2 people.  It was quite tasty with ample shrimp, scallops, clams, mussel and 1 lobster tail.  There are outdoor tables along the side of the restaurant for dinner/drinks. Wait staff efficient and nice. There are parking lots behind the restaurant It's a nice area to walk around after dinner.  There happened to be a live band playing outdoors down the block for free.
