Their margarita pizza is awesome, as is the sicilian. Somehow, their namesake is not. The artichoke pizza is like an artichoke dip, or cream soup, poured on pizza dough. Yuck. Stop by to grab a slice during the day- but beware of primetime hours, these guys do not move fast. I still can't figure out why they bother yelling the orders outloud if the pizza guy doesn't actually put it in the oven then. I wouldn't say they are the most efficient. But i don't think they care either.
