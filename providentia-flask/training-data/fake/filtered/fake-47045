My brother and I went there on a Wednesday evening about 5:30 and were seated immediately. The restaurant is cozy and tastefully decorated. The service was excellent. They have a great beer selection. If you like thin crust pizza with fresh ingredients, this is a great place to go. It was excellent. The pasta dishes are equally as good. The only minor issue is that the back room is too hot due to the proximity to the kitchen. They need to do something with the air conditioning to address this. I would not sit in the back room in the summer again.
