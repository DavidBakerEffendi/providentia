I'm from Texas, and we usually drive everywhere. I'm not sure if this is far for city standards, but I walked from SOHO to Cafe Habana just based on a recommendation from a friend and Yelp reviews. It was absolutely worth it! The sit down section of the restaurant was full at 3PM on a weekday. I ended up going to the takeout section. The takeout section had small tables, so I opted to eat there. Â I ordered fried plantains and corn. The corn was so good that I forgot to clear my braces of any corn before attempting to talk to 2 Asian girls (I was trying to ask them for directions). I'm not sure if the girls were laughing at the corn stuck in my braces or because they didn't know English. The plantains were good too! The corn definitely beats the Mexican corn-in-a-cup that you find at corn-in-a-cup stands at Texas gas stations.
