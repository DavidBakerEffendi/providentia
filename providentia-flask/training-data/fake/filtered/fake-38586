Just had the most amazing breakfast and exceptional service from Emily. The potato pancakes were to die for, and the coconut peanut scram was right on key. Not only is the food a great taste of Vermont, but the staff is so friendly and the environment is so warm and comforting. This is definitely at the top of my recommendation list, whether you're with your family, or by yourself.
