Went in for brunch with a friend and they told us we had to wait at the bar for 10 minutes. Sure, why not? Then 10 minutes became 20 and still no table. About half an hour later they sat us in a corner next to the waitstaff station. Not a great start. The food was ok, nothing special. The usual NY brunch standard. Nice bloody maries though, with the option to make your own. All and all, I don't think I'll be back.
