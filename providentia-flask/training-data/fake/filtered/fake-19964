I received a gift card to use at any of the Starr restaurants, and after asking around, I decided on Buddakan. Everyone raved about the food, atmosphere, and especially the service. I invited a few friends and made a girls night out of it. The food was wonderful. We had chicken and ginger dumplings, lobster fried rice, sweet and crispy shrimp, shrimp lo mein, and the barbecue pork. Portions were good for sharing, although I'm glad I didn't arrive starving. Service started out great, but as the restaurant got more crowded, we saw our waiter less and less frequently. After a long wait, he finally gave us our dessert menus. They all looked great, but it was a beautiful night, so we decided to get ice cream elsewhere and walk around. We were ready for the bill, but we didn't see our server for almost a full half hour after he gave us dessert menus. We noticed that he was attentive to other tables around us, and we wondered if he prioritized other tables over us once it got busy because we're young (22/23). I've experienced this before while out with friends, where I can see others getting better and faster service for no apparent reason, and it always makes me wonder. Overall, the meal was delicious, but service started to go south. I can't say for sure that it was because of our age, but regardless, there was no excuse for our waiter to ignore us for a half hour. I would go back for the food.
