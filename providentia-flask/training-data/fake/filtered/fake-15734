Absolute best pho I have ever had. I love pho soup and have eaten in many times at many places. I make sure to stop here every time I'm in the city. Small place in the hood, I'm usually the only white guy in here (which is a good sign the food is amazing) but they don't make me feel uncomfortable. Absolutely amazing beef and chicken pho! I quiet literally drive here and have a bowl of pho every single time I'm in the city, It's just that amazing!
