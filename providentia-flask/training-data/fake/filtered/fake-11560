The Bethwood in my opinion is one of the best venues out there! Great spacious rooms (plenty of options), friendly staff, great follow up and the way things went the day of the wedding! Our Maitre'D - Jason, was great starting from working with us on getting everything ready and being extremely helpful during the wedding day. So carefully organized throughout the evening, timeline was followed precisely. This review can go on forever about how great that place is...it truly is amazing and my husband and I would definitely recommend it to anyone! Thank you so much The Bethwood and Jason specifically!
