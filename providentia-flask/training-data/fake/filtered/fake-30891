Hubby and I thoroughly enjoyed the Easter Sunday buffet.  Unlike other bigger and much more expensive buffets, all selections were seasoned and prepared with the utmost care and love.  The service, such a hard thing to get these days, was superb.  We will make a tradition for Easter Sunday every year, and we'll be back for more.  Especially notable were the vodka penne, the chicken francaise, and the CANOLLI were out of this world!  Mille grazie!  I'm so thrilled you are only a short walk from my massage therapy office on North Fullerton.
