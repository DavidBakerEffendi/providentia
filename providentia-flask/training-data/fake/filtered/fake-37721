This review is based on my experiences ordering take-out from SuzyQue's. This was the third time my wife and I got take-out here, and sadly it will be the last. To start, their online menu clearly states that cornbread is included with all entrees. The first time we got take-out they did not give us any cornbread at all. The second time I made a comment about it when I ordered, and they made sure to give us some. This third time I brought our food home expecting cornbread, only to find a single, tiny cornbread muffin, dry and smaller than a cupcake. Just ONE muffin, and we had ordered two entrees. Is this a joke? That would be forgivable if the entrees themselves were amazing. But this time, everything was just disappointing. Baby back ribs were charred and tough, and the pork sausage was also dry. All in all the food was a huge let down. After three tries I've come to the conclusion that SuzyQue's does not care much about quality or consistancy in their offerings, and so we will be looking elsewhere next time we are in the mood for BBQ.
