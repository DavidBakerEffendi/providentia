The atmosphere was incredible. I don't think you could pick a better date night restaurant on 2nd Ave. Service was polite and we were sat down quickly thanks to a reservation on Open Table. Food was superb and their wine list impressed the girlfriend so I was happy. The entire night has this delicious rustic italian feel to it and if you're lucky enough to sit in the wine cellar, it feels like you have been teleported there for a night.
