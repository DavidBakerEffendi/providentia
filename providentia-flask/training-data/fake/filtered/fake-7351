Upon hearing such great publicity for a small, Brooklyn pizza joint, I was giddy with excitement to try Di Fara's pizza. Unfortunately, what was supposed to be the highlight of my NY pizza experience ended up being a disaster. Thankfully, we got to Di Fara when there wasn't much of a line. Dom was there, making the pies, but our $28 classic (cheese) pizza came out very burnt. Â The burnt crust overpowered the rest of the flavors, making it difficult to even eat the pizza. If there was any of Dom's buffala mozzarella on the pizza, we sure couldn't see or taste it, which was also a disappointment. The only distinction Di Fara's earned was the freshly-cut basil, a good way to enhance the flavor of the pizza. Sadly, I must say that I will not be returning to Di Fara's -- There are plenty of better pizza joints in New York City.
