This place is definitely not worth it. The pizza is average and the service is horrible. Â We walked up to the restaurant and encountered a huge line. You know how when you go to a club and they make people wait outside to make it look 'cool'? Yah, that's exactly what the vibe was. We finally got a table but it took forever for them to take our order. Then it took nearly an hour for our pizza to arrive. No apologies. They should probably mention that there is only 1 oven and it will take about an hour to get your pizza. They responded to our complaints only with justification for their horrible service and said they would do something about the bill. They didn't do anything. The manager came around and asked, 'how is everything?' and when we gave him an earful, he walked away. Seriously, not worth it. Don't waste your time.
