Skip the Brunch.....this may have been one of the worst Breakfast experience we've ever had.  Ordered Eggs and Biscuits.  The sunny side up eggs were burnt on the sides and the bottom.  Had them re-done, but they didn't keep the sausage and biscuits warm and then the eggs were runny.  Service is not at all attentive.  Examples: no cream for coffee (weak to begin with), only milk and then they had to be reminded to bring it twice.  Asked for water twice, never got it.  No salt or pepper on table.  No ketchup for homefries.  No butter on toast (just dry wheat toast). $3 glass of OJ wasn't ever full.  I like their pizza, but if you can't handle breakfast, you shouldn't do it.
