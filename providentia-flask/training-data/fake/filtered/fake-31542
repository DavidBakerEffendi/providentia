My sister and my cousins surprised me for my birthday. We had an amazing time and our waitress Felicia was terrific. Beautiful personality. Great charisma. Always attentive. We have been to a lot of restaurants and a waitress has never made us feel so comfortable like she did. We loved Â her! Food was delicious and defiantly worth it. Everyone was just so friendly. I enjoyed my birthday. Go and enjoy. You will not regret it.
