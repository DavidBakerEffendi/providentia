This place is by far our go to place for latin american food. The caipirinhas are out of this world as is the patacon con todo, which is a fried plantain topped with slow roasted pork, shredded chicken, cheese and comes with a side of chimichurri sauce. Not everything is good, hence the 4 and not 5. Service can be a little slow. The waitress we had didn't like to refill our cokes because we had no alcohol one time. The chicken empanada and chicken tamale were misses for me, but there is this pork entree called the Pernil that is a must try with this cilantro couscous type thing. Anyways, you are sure to find something good here if you remember to stick to what you like. Mmmm..I am craving this right now after an underwhelming early dinner tonight.
