I cannot wait to go back here.  I went for lunch and there is a huge selection of interesting small plates.  Its a small restaurant and we did not have a very spacious table but the food made up for it.  The salad I tried was a grilled romaine salad with a mix of vegetables and anchovies and it was one of the best salads Ive had.  We also had a bone marrow small plate that comes with grilled bread which was very good as well.
