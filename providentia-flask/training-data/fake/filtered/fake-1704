I'll try and keep this brief.The food is absolutely delicious and of a quality that is top tier. The service is excellent and the owner, Anthony, a remarkably pleasant, gracious, and kind man. In addition to the excellent food ... the gluten free options are amazing.It is not a quiet restaurant. The noise bounces around in there like a night club.
