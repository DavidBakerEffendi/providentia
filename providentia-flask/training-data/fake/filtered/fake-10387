this place is great for takeout food, the prices are reasonable compared to some of the other food places on oak tree road, the samosa filling is always fresh and they use clean oil. great to have all the different stalls with different types of food. my fave. is the chaat delight stall and the punjabi food stall, they have enough parking, but it fills up FAST on weekends. never park in the handicapped parking spot if you dont have a sticker, you WILL get a ticket because the police hides and watches and then gives you a ticket. be patient and find a safe spot to park. the service is ok. the food is good. cleanliness is ok. good for a quick snack or lunch to go.
