Went to Percy street bbq last night for my bachelor dinner, Â with a party of 9. Called ahead and made reservations and we were seated immediately. To sum it all up, it was incredible. Great service from our waitress, drinks came out quick. We got the deviled eggs, mac n cheese, pork belly, brisket fries, cornbread and oysters & grits for the appetizers. Everything was incredible, especially the brisket fries which will forever ruin fries for me because nothing will ever taste as good as these. Main course we did the lockhart for the whole table. Which consisted of brisket, ribs, chicken and all of the sides. My personal favorite was the baked beans with burnt ends, and the german potato salad, both outstanding. Meat was spot on also, perfect bark, nice smokey flavor, juicy meat. Absolutely incredible. Ended the night with a slice of pecan pie which was also amazing, and a yards root beer that they have on tap. I will be coming here again without a doubt in the near future.
