I was a little worried given the number of bad reviews, but i figured since they had just opened I'd give them a chance. I'm so glad I did. I got the special which was Buffalo Mac&Cheese. It was excellent, and I felt it was a good portion. Â My son had the Lobster Mac. Also very good. My daughter got the kids meal which was about half the size of the regular portion. If I was ordering from home, I think I'd just order one regular entree for the kids to split. The only complaint was my girlfriend's gluten free entree. The sauce was excellent, but the gluten free pasta they use wasn't great. However, she's excited to go back and try the gluten free grilled cheese. We'll definitely eat here again.
