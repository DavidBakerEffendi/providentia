The place is very small. Its more of a takeout or delivery type of restaurant rather than a sit-down with friends or family. Everyone was very nice and helpful. The food was just okay tho. My friend's steak was huge! but it had alot of fat! The rice was good but nothing special. My chicken sandwich wasn't very good. The bread was fresh but the chicken was hard/firm and did not taste good. The french fries were the best part of the meal. I do not recommend.
