Delicious, beautiful atmosphere, friendly staff! My husband had the mixed grilled platter, the chicken was soo moist as well as the ribs and other meats.  The homemade bbq sauce is perfectly sweet & tangy.  They also have thick homemade chips!  The rice and beans side was seasoned very good, though the amount was not as much as some other places, actually it was probably true to the portion size of carbs we should be eating.   We ate in, and noticed they do a lot of take out orders, which is always a great sign for freshness!
