We went in response to all the positive reviews, but I didn't really get it. My main problem was that after my husband and I each ordered a different drink, the server made us both the same thing- something neither of us ordered. Maybe the house special? I guess he thought he knew best, but we have very different tastes than each other and we both think we would have liked the drinks we actually ordered better. I usually really love suggestions, but I thought he was particularly pushy.
