After one special visit, I am a fan.  And I'd like to say, "Kanella, thank you." I took my fiancee out for her birthday to Kanella, followed by a viewing of the show, 'An Ideal Husband', playing at the Walnut St. Theater - a bit of work to keep up with early, but it ends a fair bit stronger... Anyway, I made reservations for 2 at Kanella via online, adding to the comment section, 'Special birthday dinner - a flower in a simple vase would be much appreciated, but not necessary'.  I was thrilled when we walked in, received most likely the best table in the house, tucked away more privately than most by the window; and there on the table, a small vase container with a few stems of some flower.  No other table had such touches.  I was impressed, and that's not easy to do for me - or is it? It's things like that, the small, fine touches that makes a place stand out to me.  Whether it's the food, the waitstaff, or the atmosphere, when an establishment takes those, sometimes simple but often overlooked steps, it helps an experience glow. Kanella glows. We read a number of satisfied food reviews before going - being avid local food lovers, we were excited to hear about their story and shared enjoyment of good food.  We had fresh housemade duck sausage, with sides I don't even recall now (I should've written this much sooner, but, alas, better late than never)... That meal, was stupendous.. The few other things we tried, also very pleasing.  I would say the least impressive dish was some sort of sample plate of humus, olive, cheese, etc.. Beside all of the other dishes, it seemed unfit. Service was excellent and just right - our waiter who's name I sadly can also not recall, was gracious and helpful.  And the atmosphere, is simple, colorful and cozy.   Do yourself a favor - make reservations, and the earlier, the better - as especially if it's a weekend, they will fill up quickly.  Otherwise, enjoy!   We will hopefully be returning again soon. Sincerely, D.Dougherty
