One word...AMAZING!!!! Any other word used to describe Brooklyn Belly are unjust. I've had several items off their menu and with each purchase I fall more and more in love. When you visit the restaurant, you are greeted with a welcoming smile and great service. One of their newest addition to their beverage menu, is a freshly squeezed limeade served in a mason jar. The plan was to load a picture along with this review, however as I started to drink this beverage, I just could not stop. Some may feel as though I may be over exaggerating but I have yet to say I've been unsatisfied with their service. List of items I've had: Fried Shrimp Conch fritters Cracked Conch BBQ Chicken Jerk Chicken Grilled Veggies Fried Mac & Cheese Limeade Bk belly I wish you all the best and may you continue to prosper!!!
