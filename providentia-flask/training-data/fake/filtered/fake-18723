Totally a splurge but anytime you have to have a WONDERFUL meal--go. I have been here a few times in different seasons but always have done the tasting menu with the wine pairing and cheese plate. The service is not only incredible but their knowledge of food, wine and cheese will blow you away. There is a reason this is rated one of the top 10 in the world to eat! AMAZING!
