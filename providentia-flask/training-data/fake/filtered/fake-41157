Halal guys finally have a shop. This location is great as there is never a long line like the other location. I'm a big fan of the lamb and rice. Chicken is decent. Please also take note that this can be addictive but can be unhealthy. The rice and meat is really greasy plus adding the white sauce on top can really pack on some high calories.
