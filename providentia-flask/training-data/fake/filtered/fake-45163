I went to Black Oven with my workers once I found out it was opened. We all ordered many varieties of food that they provided. We were all very satisfied and amazed at how good it tasted. All of the kinds of foods were very fresh and were made perfectly. Seeing how much we ordered, we were so shocked on how fair the price was. Once we finished and left the restaurant, I came home right away and told my wife about this place. I now go to the Black Oven with my family very often. My whole family loves this place and the workers were so friendly. The service was great. They were so polite to my family and kids and they are the best place to have dinner or any meal.This is definitely my top favorite place to go for a nice, full meal. I highly recommend going to Black Oven. You won't be let down. :)
