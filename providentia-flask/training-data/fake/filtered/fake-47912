I  was  just  driving and saw the place ,  so I stopped in to catch a bite to eat .  I ordered  a chicken sandwich , it was amazing  , bacon , cheese and  grilled onions. This was the best sandwich I ever had,  I am going to a regular  for now on.  I took a few slices of pizza to go and  they were also very good.
