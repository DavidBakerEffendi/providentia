My son and I were visiting Yale and stopped by since we love Middle Eastern food. We ordered the BLT ($9) and the chicken ($8) platters. In a platter, you get a dish with shaved meat (Shawarma) and your choice of items from a "side dish" bar. I don't think there's a limit to the number of sides you can have added to your meat, because I kept pointing at items and the server kept scooping things onto my platter. The side dishes range from three different types of humus, taboule, roasted eggplant, baba ghanoush, etc. Their website actually lists 24 side items. The platters ended up being sizable portions with leftovers. But the best thing was that the flavors are really incredible. The seasoning on the meat was robust and flavorful...in fact, it was hands down the BEST shawarma I've ever tasted, and we've eaten it at lots of places across the US. I wish there was one back in Arizona, where I live. Sababa would be the first place I'd go to eat if we are ever back in New Haven.
