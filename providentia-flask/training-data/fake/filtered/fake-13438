this place used to be good...staff was a bit more chic and edgy...seems they just want to get everyone out and close early...used to be a cozy neighborhood spot for a nightcap...whats with the ghetto music? has management changed? then again, the whole area has changed (gentrified) so i guess this place has too...there are other cafes' nearby that are similar and accomodating...
