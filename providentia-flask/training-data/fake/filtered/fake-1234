We just walked by and decided to go in cold without reading any reviews. Arrived early on a Tuesday so didn't need reservations. By the time we left the place was packed.  We had the chicken lemon soup, lamb shank, spinach and rice pilaf , Greek Alfa beer and yogurt Napoleon. Will be going back because everything tasted great, fresh and delicious.  Proud we discovered such a great restaurant on our own. The wait staff was terrific too.
