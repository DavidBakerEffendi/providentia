Fantastic restaurant!!! Great ambiance (especially in the summer, there's sidewalk seating), friendly and informative waiters, and most importantly, DELICIOUS food!! I'm Turkish, so I know what I'm talking about. Everything, from the many appetizers, to the main courses, to the unique desserts, and the full bar with Turkish wines was fantastic!! No wonder the place is ALWAYS crowded!
