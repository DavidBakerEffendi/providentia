If it were possible to give a 0 star rating, please believe me I would. Walked into the cafe aware of the high reviews, expecting a fairly clean restaurant with reasonable customer service. None of the above were apparent in this so called cafe. As soon as I walked in the door I was greeted to the sight of uncleared filthy dining tables along with a waitress/chef speaking to a customer with a horrendously arrogant tone. We politely asked to have the table for four people cleared so we could sit, to which she replied; "YEAH WELL IM GOING TO CLEAN IT ALRIGHT". I was unimpressed to say the least and we walked out immediately after. If customer service is your thing, or rather; basic courtesy, I suggest you don't make the trip to this appalling cafe/restaurant.
