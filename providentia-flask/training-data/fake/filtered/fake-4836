Had a large group there for a dinner last night (45 people) and they were very accommodating.  The food was delicious!  We did a buffet and the choices were varied and plentiful!  The manager, Julio, was attentive and kept checking in to make sure everyone was happy.  The staff was great - it's not easy to take care of 45 people who all want the same thing at the same time!  Great job!
