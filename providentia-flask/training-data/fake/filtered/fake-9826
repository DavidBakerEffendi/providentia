I really like this place but fear that they are victims of their own success... as neighborhood fans we can no longer go whenever we want as it's soooo busy. That said, the food is amazing and the service is great. They've dealt with my dairy allergy in the nicest way possible and we've had mostly exceptional meals there. The best by far though is the roast chicken... wow. And the desserts are to die for too.
