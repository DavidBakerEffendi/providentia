I am a big fan of this place and go pretty much every week. It has the best Korean food in the University City area. After living in Korea a year I'm always in need of a Kimchi fix and while Koreana isn't high class Korean food/dining, its food is good and is similar to the corner shops I used to go to in Seoul. So the quality/price is excellent and I highly recommend it. Also has decent boba tea if you're into that. One favorite dish is Dwaen-Jan-Chigae, fantastic hot soup for a cold day.
