I've been a loyal customer to the Schuyler Diner long before it was closed down. I was glad to see it back up and running from it's Â former glory. The one thing I have to point out right away is that the new diner looks nothing like a diner. More like a fine restaurant with it's wonderful decor and great wood layout giving the place a warmth and feeling of comfort. To help with aesthetic appeal they have this huge fish tank coupled along with a fireplace, that worked wonders coming in from the cold night. Now the food, when I first went there, wasn't up to par but that's any place that just opens. I have been going back the past couple months an it shows they have certainly gotten their act together. I went with a few friends recently and they loved it. The burgers hands down will give any local business a run for their money. The sweet potato fries coupled with the homemade special sauce rocked. The the waitress we got to speak to was a sweetheart and service was just as good as the food. My folks have gone and share my enthusiasm as well. I definitely plan on making the Schuyler one of my regular stops.
