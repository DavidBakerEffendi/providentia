I had been craving Brazilian food so I checked out what people had to say... I found BarBossa and fell in love! The atmosphere was great. It's supersmall and has lots of cute details everywhere you look. You can actually walk past the kitchen when you walk to the bathroom so you can see all the yumminess being created. Definitely plan to be here for a while because if you eat Brazilian food you must enjoy it to its fullest! My friend and I ordered Calabreza Sausage as an appetizer, Shrimp and Avocado Tomato Curry and Feijoada (extra yum!!!) along with caipirhinas (strong and whoaaaa!). The food was delicious and was everything I had hoped for. The portions were just right and I definitely recommend this lovely little restaurant!
