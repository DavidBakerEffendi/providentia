Been there yesterday with wife and 2 kids. In short: Average food and expensive. They used to make very good Hakka noodles earlier but even that has become average now. We ordered Indo-chinese standard Hot and Sour Soup and it was terrible - it had no flavor whatsoever. The other soup, Vegetable Dumpling, was average. The Fusion Bhel was the only good appetizer.  My biggest complaint with this place is that every entree dish (at least in the  veg section) has exactly the same sauce with some minor variation although they give various names to it. They could as well have just a couple of items! Avoidable and there are far better places to eat. The staff is very friendly but service is slow.
