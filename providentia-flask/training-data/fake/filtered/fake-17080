THIS PLACE IS MIND BLOWING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! There are two thing I completely love in this world and it's spicy food and ramen noodles! Their pork buns are too die for ! Best service I have ever received !!! Super friendly staff, they all greet you loudly the min you walk in. But make sure to either go early or close to closing anything in between that is considered " happy hour" turns into a two hour wait (boo!)
