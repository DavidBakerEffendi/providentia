Second time visiting grimaldis as a tourist in NYC. First time old location next door was the best. Better pizza, much much better service. Second time new location not so good. Pizza still good, not great but service terrible and slow and drinks warm dirty plates x 2. Staff not rude bit barely present. Very stuffy sitting upstairs and extreme noise. Terrible music. Couldn't wait to get out of there. But pizza I have to say on a scale of 1-5 is still a 3-4. It's the rest of the stuff that brings the rating down. I don't mind cocky NY attitude in a waiter or maitre d but not when I can't find a server and were begging for our drinks and wine after waiting 45 minutes outside in line in the August heat. I think we will find pizzza a little closer to our hotel in manhattan next year and give grimaldis a break.
