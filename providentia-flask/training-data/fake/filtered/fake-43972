I went to Mac's with a friend of mine on a Wednesday. We were very excited to go for Quizzo. The Quizzo itself was good, the girl had good enough questions. The people in the bar were an entirely different story. From the bartenders, to the waiters to the patrons, everyone seemed to be rude and oblivious. Our waiter was too busy shaking hands and hugging women to pay attention to giving us water. Silly us for thinking he was working that night. We did not feel welcome there at all. All the employees there need a serious attitude adjustment, given the mediocrity of their service and food. Beyond that, the food was uninteresting for the most part, with the exception of the dipping sauces. The honey mustard was disgusting, but otherwise, the rest were new to me. Like Honey-Horseraddish. That was really unique tasting. (Our waiter had no idea what it was though, when I asked. He really should have known what he's serving.) Oh, and by the way, they water down the beer. Hoegaarden should not be that neon and piss looking. Seriously guys. All in all, I have no intention of ever going back. Not even for the Quizzo.
