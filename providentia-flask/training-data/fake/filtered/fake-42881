Imagine if some Manhattan restaurant owner bought Wreck Room, made all the drinks better; yet, more expensive, replaced the staff with a bunch of barbie doll bartenders who are easy on the eyes but freakishly friendly AND COMPLETELY WRONG FOR THE NEIGHBORHOOD. Also imagine that this new owner renovated the place to look like it should belong in Upper West Side Manhattan and stripped of its authentic character.... That's exactly what happened to the former "Life Cafe," now called "983 Bushwick's Living Room." The name itself pisses me off, because this is the exact opposite of what "Bushwick's living room" would look like! I went in the other night, and first of all was creeped out by the overly bubbly waitress. What the hell happened to the waitresses that would greet us like humans and say "What's up?" Instead, I got some robot to greet us. The food was pretty good, but what the hell happened to the Meatloaf? or the Southern Fried Chicken? I had the chicken tenders as a starter and was told that instead of having the home-made "Brutal sauce" my only option was to get chicken tossed in Frank's hot sauce (something I can make at home!) The home-made blue cheese sauce that I'd die for, has also been re-created into a less tastier version. The beer and shot special for $5 is no longer an option! WHAT THE HELL!?!? Can all locals please BOYCOTT this restaurant! The name, the atmosphere, the robot waitresses,  the god awful decor, and the creepy agro-manager that interrupts the waitress while speaking to me because she made a mistake on another table NEEDS TO BE VIOLENTLY PUSHED OUT OF OUR NEIGHBORHOOD! Call me old fashioned, but I want to be served by cool chicks with tattoos and colored hair... I want waitresses that HAVE PERSONALITY,  I want to be able to talk to my waitress WITHOUT FEAR OF BEING YELLED AT BY A MANAGER!!!!
