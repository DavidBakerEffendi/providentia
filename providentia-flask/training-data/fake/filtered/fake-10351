I had an awful experience here today. I ordered the avocado sandwich and lentil soup both of which were listed as vegetarian on the menu only to find BACON in my soup after I started eating. I'm a life long vegetarian for religious reasons and while it may not be a big deal to the staff, it was very disturbing to me especially since the waitress said a cook had messed up a batch of soup that morning. Why wouldn't she have told me that information BEFORE I ordered?! I like German style beers with food but I will definitely be finding a different place to get them after this.
