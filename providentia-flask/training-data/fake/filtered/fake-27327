I've been here a few times for lunch and they make one of the best burgers in the city. The meat was cooked precisely to order and the bun (often overlooked) was excellent. They have a great selection of beers and cocktails and a very personable and friendly staff--the bartender even shook our hands and introduced himself as we sat at the bar. I highly recommend Park Avenue Tavern!
