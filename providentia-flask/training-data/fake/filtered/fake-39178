I never "yelped" Â before, if that is the correct term to use. But I was completely blown away with the decor and the atmosphere. The restaurant is completely beautiful ! With it's amazing high ceilings. The food was okay, a little mediocre for such a beautiful restaurant, I honestly was expecting better quality in food... But our server Jamie was completely amazing, very tentative and very quick to accommodate us. The music in the restaurant was extremely loud.... And there was so many people when we walked in it was almost impossible to walk thru the crowd. Besides this, I'll be back to grab a beer some time.
