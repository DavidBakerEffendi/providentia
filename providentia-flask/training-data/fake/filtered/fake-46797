Great local pub, consistent enjoyable food.  Service isn't particularly fast, but it's at least friendly.  Best to go here during the day because it's very low key.  Gets a bit busier at night.  Dartboard and pool table in the back room.  Lots of great food options that are a step above typical pub food.
