The place is cute and the location was convenient for an impromptu dinner last Tuesday night. I had high hopes for homey Italian food that left me feeling full, but healthy, after a quick work out. The appetizer, wine and vegetable sides were good, as was my companion's eggplant parm. I ended up ordering a greasy plate of chicken parm layered with prosciutto and eggplant, one of the special chicken dishes with unrecognizable names, based on a recommendation of the waitress. That night, the rumbling of my stomach made me wonder if I had developed lactose intolerance. I'm sure this place is completely acceptable Italian food, but order carefully.
