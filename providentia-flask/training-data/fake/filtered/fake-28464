A great capper to a wonderful weekend in New York City! We went here for brunch and thoroughly enjoyed the food and the atmosphere. Since we were quite hungry, my wife started with a capuccino while I had a cafe au lait and we shared a Pain au Chocolat. It was good we had our starter since it took a while for the main meal to get served. My wife had the Brioche French Toast with fresh fruit and I had the Cocotte. Apparently the French Toast took a while to finish since it had to bake. It came out perfectly - not too sweet and had just the right "crunchiness". I had not had anything like the Cocotte before and am glad I tried it! The walls had TinTin posters and had just the right ambiance for a lazy Sunday morning. BTW, do not judge them by the quality of their Web site!
