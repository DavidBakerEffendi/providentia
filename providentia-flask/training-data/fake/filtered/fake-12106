Best restaurant not only in Williamsburg but in the whole world.  I am lucky enough to live down the street, if I could afford it I would eat there every day.  Over the past 2 years I have eaten there on average once a week and I have never had anything that wasn't amazing!  Dinner is awesome  but nothing beats the country breakfast and a large bloody mary on a sleepy Sunday afternoon!!!  Also amazing are their other restaurants Romans and Marlow and Sons.  Another win is Marlow and Daughters...when we BBQ we buy all of of the ingredients there..ground beef, cheese and buns and we have Diner burgers at home!
