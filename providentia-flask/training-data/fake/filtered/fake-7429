Sixteen years and still "often imitated, never equaled" .     Its not surprise why this 16 yr old restaurant is still booked solid but the wait is worth it.   The bread reminds me of Poilane in Paris.    The oysters are super fresh with a brine so perfect you don't want to waste a drop.   The made to order Bloody Mary is the best in NY.  I love this place so much I went for dinner and breakfast the next morning last weekend.       Yes, it's noisy but that is the raison d'être.
