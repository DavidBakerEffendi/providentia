This restaurant is renovated recently, and the atmosphere is great! I tried many other places, but this place is much better than any sushi place. Above all, service is really satisfying. I went to this place for the first time, and they gave me all kinds of 'on the house' food, like noodle and vegetable pancake. Interesting thing is those foods are on the menu! Great Food, Service, and atmosphere!
