This is my fave restaurant in NYC! Every time I'm in town I make it a point to go here and it's always an amazing dining experience... a cut above the other farm-to-table places. I always start with a signature cocktail - interesting mixes of flavors without going crazy. Splurge for the bread if you're not anti-gluten... it's worth it! The ceasar salad with brussel sprouts and the brussel sprouts with Â bacon tie for my favorite sides/ starters. The meat is always top notch - I've now tried almost everything and can't pick a favorite, it's like kids. Just go - eat, drink and enjoy!
