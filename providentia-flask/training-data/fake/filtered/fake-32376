Went to Mr. Adams this past Saturday night around 7 o'clock.  Parking was great and when we walked in we were met by a huge fire pit surrounded by cooking meet as well as another class window that showed the different cuts of meat ! How cool.  We also noticed the bar had a large amount of TVs tp watch a game and some of the tables have taps built into the tables !  We sat in the dining area for a regular meal where we ordered a pitcher of sangria, had the rodizio and salad bar.  The sangria was one of the best I've ever had.  The salad bar is enormous and is a meal in itself ! All kinds of portuguese cold cuts, cheeses, salad and pasta salads.  Then the rodizio began with prime cuts of juicy and beautifully seasoned meats.  We eventually had to turn them away because we were too full (im a big guy).  We saw deserts coming out that looked incredible.  Our waiter was a really good server who was very attentive and they all were dressed very professionally.  Overall our expierience was phenominal and I can't wait to go back to hang out at the sports bar and catch a game.
