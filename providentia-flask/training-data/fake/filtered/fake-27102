Good sushi, if basic. Nice size to the rolls, though sashimi is a little small. They have quail egg here, which is a big plus to me, since many places do not carry it. Spicy rolls are a standout; they are not too spicy but give you a nice heat with a goo layering of flavors. Their few Korean dishes are very good, especially bibimbap and jap chae (which they were kind enough to make fresh for me when they ran out). I also enjoyed the chicken bulgogi -- again, nice heat, not lip-searingly hot, with great flavor. I do like the decor, which is fresh and simple, with a touch of elegance. The service at Hon is exemplary; the staff is well-trained, very friendly and always happy to help or suggest things you might want to try. They make Hon worth visiting!
