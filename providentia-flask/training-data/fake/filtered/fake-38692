the smith is consistently good, and they turnover fast, which means i am not waiting a long time to get a table during a weekend brunch .. the vanilla bean french toast is def the way to go, especially when you split this sweet dish with something savory ...... also, a Â fun, hip scene .. i also enjoy eating at their bar, which is long, spacious .. highly recommend this place !
