I've been going to the Crockadeli since before I can remember, and its never failed me. When I'm home, I eat breakfast/lunch there at least twice a week. It's also a mandatory stop before any concert, tailgate, or beach trip. The sandwiches are top quality (boars head meats and cheeses), and the variety is unmatched. Aside from the classic Italian and Turkey club sandwiches, I'm fond of the Vinnie Special (breaded chicken, bacon, american cheese, lettuce, tomato, and honey-mustard) and "the Usual" (ham, cheddar, and spicy mustard). Of course, you don't have to order off the menu... In classic deli style, they'll make you whatever you want. Crockadeli is a true neighborhood sub shop. The people that work there are friendly, and know pretty much everyone on a first-name basis. The owner Manny even contributed to a fund-raising project I was working on. I don't need to recommend Crockadeli to Cranbury/East Windsor folks or I'd be preaching to the choir. But if you're on your way to the shore, or just passing through on 130, definitely stop by.
