This Place finally has brought something great to the city of newark. Not upscale not trendy but just beautiful modern establishment. Fire pit cooking meats, meat case selection, sports bar with personal taps, and not to mention the beautiful women that work there. Went in for a drink and an App, they had a great selection of beers on draft. Had the rodizio sampler which was beautiful. I need to stop this review to go back for more! Place really just stood out there for me . Will be headed back
