pros: - best chicken i have ever had (very spicy, tender, incredible soft and full of flavor) - sorrel, must try it. sweet, sour and interesting taste. it is also a rescue from all that spice. - cosy, tiny sitting area, very different - the waiter does not bother you every 5 minutes and asking "is everything alright?" cons: - very long waiting times: they only have 2 pans to cook. I waited 1 hour and my other 2 friends waited 1.5 hour. Evert 2 people should order the same so that they can be cooked together in the same pan! - no AC in sitting area (since the food so spicy you sweat a lot while you eat) - very small sitting area, don't go there with a group of more then 4 people. - no credit card
