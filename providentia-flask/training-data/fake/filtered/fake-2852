Well, mixed impression... Walked in, not sure if to seta and wait for the waiter, order by the counter, etc.. Staff was busy... Chose a table, and waited for a while. Realized that no one is coming, went to order. They accept cash only. No cappucino, regular coffee only. Order breakfast sandwich, sloppy presentation, roll not toasted Â (in the description mentioned as toasted).. Overall OK. Had to go back to get a fork, the waitress forgot to bring it to my table together with the order. Very modest decor, on the cheaper side. Dusty artificial flowers in a small vase, a long dark hair among the napkins placed in a bucket... I guess for Bayonne this place is ok, but they should take an example from other successful businesses that cater to busy morning crowd. Small things do make a difference. Attention to your customer instead of having a conversation among the staff members, checking up on the people in the other room, coffee refill might be offered... Overall there is a potential, and other portions also seem good - but there is also a lot of room for improvement. Giving the place 3 stars, only because it is better compared to other Bayonne breakfast spots. In the city this place would have been between 1 and 2 stars.
