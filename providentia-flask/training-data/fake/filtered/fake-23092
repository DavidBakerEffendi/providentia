I wasn't going to post a review because it would be the same as all the other reviews here and would be obsolete but I feel like I had to describe my experience. It's cold,  I'm hungry, stumbling around NYC after a tiresome day,  Halal guys has always been there to save me, Always,  there are very few food carts like it, it's food is as consistent and water flowing off a waterfall and it's taste can rival a nice warm melted chocolate bar. That's it, that's all I can say........  Oh and btw get the Mix platter
