Worst service in a decade! Sunday the 8th, waitress took our order then did not even bring coffee for 10 minutes. Food wasn't brought for 30 minutes. and she didn't even stop by to refill the drinks. When the food finally arrived it was wrong (wheat toast not white and Cheddar cheese not swiss) on mismatched plates, which must mean they weren't washing the dishes in the dishwasher (health?) Finally when deciding on a tip, the waitress delivered the leftovers, which flipped out of her hand an somersaulted in mid-air and landed on the table with a crash. No tip, and I usually tip 20% or more, especially at the holidays. This is not an exaggeration.
