I am definitely a "regular" at Anthony Franco's. I love the family friendly environment, great service, and THE FOOD! The food is what it really comes down to, and in my opinion it is fresh, delicious, and plentiful. I never plan on finishing my entire dinner in one sitting, because they give you so much! I highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys the above :)
