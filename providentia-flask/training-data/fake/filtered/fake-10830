They need to wear hair nets because my bf found hair in his food and wait staff refused to discount it but gave him a free drink. The food was very good best seafood i ever had in life but i was pissed off how wait staff handled that situation yesterday when i went which made my experience bad. Im thinking of contacting dept of health because of how it was handled, left bad taste in my mouth literally.
