I have been going to Rogue for years.  However, I recently discovered Sunday afternoons and it is fantastic! The staff is phenomenal, espeically Sam behind the bar. She made my entire group of friends feel welcome and she makes an AWESOME margarita.  I have always enjoyed Rogue for the ecletcic mix of food.  However, it is even more fun to see the diverse group of patrons.  We sat next to a wonderful couple from Jersey who love to come into the city on Sundays to shop and eat, an elderly couple who told us about their new grandchild while we sold them on the Rogue burger (not a hard sell), and a younger couple on a first date.  I recently read a review for Rogue that said, "Rogue has more or less turned into a gay bar"....hard to believe that someone would even write that in 2009...oh well, maybe they would be more comfortable eating in the confines of their own home where they control who they eat next to. Anyway... Rogue is truly one of my favorite places in the city...the food, the staff, and the clientel is always the perfect mix!  Kudos to the Rogue team. Run don't walk to Sunday afternoons at Rogue...order a margarita from Sam!!
