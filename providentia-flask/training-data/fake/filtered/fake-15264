I ate here with a friend, so we split the appetizers and desserts to taste a variety of foods on the menu. The crab rangoon was so delicious and I decided to get the green salad because I love lime dressing. However, don't expect anything special or extra condiments. It looks like they literally threw the salad from the bag on a bowl and put a little dressing. I ate the traditional Pad Thai, which was good. My friend had the omelette and tuna, which she liked very much. The desserts were the best out of the whole meal. We had the strawberry or raspberry panna cotta and I highly recommend the Crème brûlée it was great. The ambience seems more for romantic couples. The restaurant is tiny and very dark. The service was what made the experience great. They are very attentive. Overall, great food, but nothing memorable.
