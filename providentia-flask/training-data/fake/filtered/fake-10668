My husband and I are totally addicted to this place. We shlep all the way from Soho on our days off together. We love the food, the staff, the music, the casual atmosphere, the prices, and the free coffee refills. Love the free coffee refills. Thanks so much for that. I will say that I think the desserts taste better when they reach room temperature, rather than chilled from the display case. Just writing this makes me crave a Monte Cristo. See you soon, Champs...
