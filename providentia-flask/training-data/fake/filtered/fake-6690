It saddens me to see such wonderful space located on the perfect corner diminished by mediocre food and poor service. The patatas bravas are delicious and should be consumed immediately and often. The dips are delicious also, especially the feta and green pea.  Well done. The falafel "crusted" Artichoke hearts are really poor - really missing - soggy and relatively brown....i simply don't get it - they're frankly terrible. The rest - ho hum.... Entrees are limited - Whole Branzino and steak are ok, but standards - they should be good.  But the pork chop missed badly. Poor char with sloppy mash and soaky cabbage - which seemed so out of place - and then arrested by the garlic tzatziki.  Save that for the lamb! (which, ironically, is not on the menu - but should be). The worst part, however, is the service.  It's slow, and cumbersome, and ditzy.  That's almost ok except our waitress double charged us once for some drinks and apps.  Two apps were sent back as mistakes and then delivered again - corrected.  Later, when she brought the bill, after it was charged, we called her out on it after noticing after the fact... she replied, "yes, i know, sorry, i just ran it through anyway." No explanation. When pressed she agreed to "try to fix it" but ended up charging us for the whole meal again.  Had to call Visa ... Unapologetic - amazing....
