I went to Opa with a friend for drinks and light food. Having spent time in Greece, I was looking forward to my favorite dishes done one better by a trendy restaurant. The food was very good, but I am surprised that other reviewers thought it was good value. I found it slightly overpriced for being just very good standard Greek dishes. There wasn't much innovation in any of them. The cocktails were good as well, but on the small side for the price. They didn't come close to filling the martini glasses in which they were served. I hope Â Opa institutes a happy hour sometime soon, which would make me come back. I have no serious complaints about the food or drinks, just that both felt a bit chintzy for what we paid. Also, by the time we left ca. 7:30, the music and conversation level were so high that we could barely hear each other talk. This might be an acoustic problem, but I think the music was just turned up too loud. It felt like a European disco, but not in a good way! If you're looking for conversation with friends, I'd try to go on the very early end of the evening.
