Sitar is a fantastic, authentic restaurant in the sort of business district on New Haven not 10 blocks from the Green. Waiters are friendly, food is outstanding and a to-go Chicken Curry can easily be split between 2 people! Try everything on the menu, including specialty drinks, desserts - take friends and family to the buffet! Too bad their landlords are the worst people in New Haven, but hey, Sitar seems to make it work.
