When I first heard about Fin I was incredibly excited. I'm a huge seafood fan, and the one thing missing in the area was a good seafood restaurant. Not anymore! Fin delivers big time. The dishes I've had there have been executed perfectly, and the simple preparation really lets the quality of the seafood speak for itself. The raw bar is excellent, and I can honestly say the wood-grilled swordfish was the best piece of swordfish I've eaten in my life. The menu is big enough to offer options to even the pickiest of eaters, yet not too big as to be overwhelming or off-putting. Fin has fast become one of my favorite restaurants in Montclair, if not my favorite, and is a standard by which all new restaurants in the area should be measured. Fresh seafood, prepared simply, executed perfectly. Who could ask for more?
