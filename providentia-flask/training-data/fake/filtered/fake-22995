The worst restaurants I ever had food. Could be the time I went into the restaurent. Chef was not available during peak hours of saturday around 8 PM. our family was a gunny pig. It took 60 minutes to get me a upma for my kid. Â It was already made one and they just microwaved and gave. I was shocked to see upma coming after 45 minutes. THen I asked the attendant for my rest of the order. Then started rushing on the food only after I forced them. And food was horrible. The Veg biryani I ordered was nothing but boiled basmati rice garam masala added along with bunch of frozen mixed veggies, with horrible presentation!! Then I cancelled my rest of the order for Pesarattu. And later they came back and told one of the orders they can't make because of one of the chef's was away also there were lot of take away orders. They could have told me in the beginning itself that there going to be lot of delay I was totally pissed off. And the final bill amout was included the cancelled orders also. I has to adjust the bill to pay the final amount and walked away with lot of disappointment. And my first and last experience was not good. So I would not suggest this restaurant. Thanks for reading all through. I don't have less than a star.
