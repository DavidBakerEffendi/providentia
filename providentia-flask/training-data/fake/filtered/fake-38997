Great food, great prices!   Located between 5th and 6th avenues (closer to 6th) on 13th street, Da Andrea is a stand out in food and price, especially considering the number of Italian restaurants around the city. I love the fresh focaccia that is brought to the table shortly upon seating. Specials truly leverage what's fresh for the day - if it's available I highly recommend the (chicken or pork) ravioli. If not, I almost always go for the pappardelle with sausage ragu. Then again, don't think you can go wrong with any of the picks as nearly all the pastas are homemade.  I usually bring my meal to a sweet close with the tiramisu - the best in the city.   Truly delicious food at great prices.
