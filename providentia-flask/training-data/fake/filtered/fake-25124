This was one of the most frustrating evenings....what was supposed to be a surprise birthday dinner turned into a night of waiting for a table for which we had made a reservation.  When we asked the hosts about the status of our table, we were met with explanations that contradicted wach other.  In all cases, the hosts made us feel as though we were wrong for expecting to be seated.  We ended up waiting an hour before we gave up and left.  My advice: skip the frustration and make a reservation somewhere else.
