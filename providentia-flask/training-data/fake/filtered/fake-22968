Very cool lower east side place! Best martinis I've ever had: they don't just serve the usual sweet cocktails; I love most of their recipes, very creative, especially the spicy ones! The Fleur du Mal is my favorite. Great prices especially during happy hour! It gets really packed after work, then it gets better after 10pm. Food is pretty good too.
