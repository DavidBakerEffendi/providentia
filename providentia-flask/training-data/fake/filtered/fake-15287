My colleagues were talking about this Thai restaurant they had visited. I got curious after hearing their experience. So, I tried it a couple of days ago. When I entered the restaurant, I was amazed how elegant it looked like. The interiors and decors were sleek; my type of place to eat. I had the best shrimp broth, Creamy Tom Yam Goong and Flat-Iron Steak with a uniquely tasty sauce. I had a great time at Pinto and made me like Thai food more. Pinto is a such great find that will always be in my list. Next time, I will try their lunch meals.
