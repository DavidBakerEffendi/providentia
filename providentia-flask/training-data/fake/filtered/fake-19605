Usually I am not motivated to write posts but as I am dependent on Yelp to find new spots and my restaurant experience was superb I decided to help out the public in their restaurant selection. I recommend Jack and Nellie's for Brunch! My friend and I came for brunch. We arrived at 11am on Saturday - when it opened. Several parties were before us waiting as well! We requested and got the seat near the window. As we were catching up, I was blown away by J & N's interior! It's beautiful = neat and nicely decorated. There are tables across the bar on the side and tables toward the front near and next to the windows. In middle of the ceiling, there's a skylight with a crosshatched piece that let down a light ray of light for a wonderful lighting effect. Within 2 hrs, the patrons filled up the place. Overall - it's a lively place, and has an elegant feel to it. A pleasant surprise indeed. Our waitress was Charlotte. She was super nice and answered my questions. We both ordered eggs benedict, since she confirmed it is the most the popular dish. Our food arrived according to how we wanted it. I requested the bacon be replaced with candied bacon. The eggs benedict was divine! I ate the potatoes, english muffins, salad, and eggs and left nothing extra on my plate.  I ordered the bowl of fruit - which had very nicely picked fruits. I did find out  I'm not much of mimosa drinker, though. My friend on the other hand was downing them! Haha. I will be coming here again and suggesting it to all my friends. *edited for grammar and syntax*
