As a tourist, I was just walking in for a bite to eat but definitely got more than I can chew! This place needs to open up in Miami for sure!!!! The food is just a breathe of fresh air! I've been to nyc plenty times, had many different Spanish plates but blend On the water blew me away! The sea bass, the red snapper and even what would be the basic churrasco was tasteful beyond words! And Felicia is so cute and cheerful I just wanna pack her in my luggage! PLEASE OPEN A LOCATION DOWN SOUTH! THIS PLACE IS EXACTLY WHAT US FLORIDIANS ARE SCREAMING FOR ! Thanks in advance...
