Avoid this disasterous tourist trap !!   What a shame, a once-great restaurant has been diluted to below-mediocre.  Think "Olive Garden" at 5X the price, and noisier.   The maitre'd is the rudest in Manhattan (and that's saying something), but at least the food is second-rate.  What a shame. Don't embarrass yourself by taking someone to this disaster. john
