This place is a NYC Japanese highlight. Decor, service and presentation are exceptional. The food is delicious and there are so many elements to it that the dish is exciting and an adventure in itself. Â I had the Hokke which was a soft, perfectly grilled piece of Mackerel. Washed down with some very tasty sake.
