We went here last night for the first time as my son heard it was good.  The place was charming.  We had the arugula salad with goat cheese, margarita pizza, base pizza which is the old fashioned  gooey cheese pizza and a custom pie with fresh vegetables without cheese.  Everything was fresh and delicious.  Being a Friday night they were busy yet our waitress took our order almost immediately  and we did not have to wait long for our food. It is a BYOB restaurant, but  across the street is a liquor store if you want a bottle of wine.
