Their Soup dumplings are expensive and way overrated. They carry that zagat review as if they are the end all be all of Chinatown. It's fine by me. Tourists seem to LOVE this restaurant and I avoid is at all costs. Tourists have little experience with soup dumplings and likely chinese food that doesn't come in the fast food form and thus don't know any better. Like I said, very over rated for their price but I'm fine with it as long as tourists don't clog up the other restaurants!
