My wife and I went here after discovering that 12PM on a Saturday is too late to make a Saturday night dinner reservation. Since we really enjoyed Amada, we decided this would be the perfect opportunity to try Jose Garces' latest restaurant. We loved the concept of having a PLCB store right in the restaurant. With twenty minutes to spare before our table was available, we actually had something to do while waiting - we chose a good bottle of Rioja and sampled a couple truffle olive oils in the store. The food: We had the artichoke antipasti and the steak frites. Artichokes were tender - very delicious and lemony, without being overpowering. The steak frites was the perfect size for two people and the grilled asparagus and maitake mushrooms on the side were delicious. Dessert was Marjolaine for me and coconut tarte for her. We both greatly enjoyed our desserts. The atmosphere was casual - a pleasant place to eat dinner. Value was pretty good - food was delicious considering the price we paid for dinner for two.
