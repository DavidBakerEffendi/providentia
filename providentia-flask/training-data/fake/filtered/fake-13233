Located in the pleasant town of Montclair, NJ, Raymond's is a modern restaurant which offers breakfast, lunch, and dinner. It offers a wide variety of food that would please any customer. Â  We arrived around 7:30 pm on a crowded Saturday night. Both the inside and outside tables were filled and there was a small wait to be seated. Inside, there were many tables neatly aligned in accordance to the room, and many people were bustling about. The walls were painted nicely, and had decorations on them. Due to a recent mouth surgery, I was unable to eat solids, and was only able to have ice cream and soup at dinner. However, the tomato-basil soup i had was prepared quite well. It tasted splendid. In addition to that, I also had water and sprite with my meal. The service was great. It was not too fast, yet not too slow. Adequate time was given in-between courses, from the appetizer to main meal, and the water was refilled quickly. The service was prompt and nice. I would recommend it.
