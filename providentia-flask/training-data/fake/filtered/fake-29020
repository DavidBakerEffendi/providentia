Love the food.Chicken tenders are fresh...the pork burrito is very good...the chicken sandwich is always good....The chili is fantastic...my wife enjoys the salad...however the potatoes to go just don't quite cut it....soggy as can be.....However, the people are extremely nice....and reasonably priced for fresh take out food!!!
