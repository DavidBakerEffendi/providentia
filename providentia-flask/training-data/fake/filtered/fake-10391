If you want great indian food, this is the place to go. Not only is the quality great, but unlike the other comments on here i'd have to say that the staff is nice. The food court has a variety of different types of Indian cuisines. To top it off, the side restaurant inside desi galaxy "Rim Zim" sells great drinks. I'd prefer Desi Galaxy over Bombay Spice anyday. Thank god it's only closed temporary and they have a second location.
