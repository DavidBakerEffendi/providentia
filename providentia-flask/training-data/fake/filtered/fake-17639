I came for dinner last week and I was amazed with the food. I've been here a few years ago and the food was okay, so I stopped coming. But my friend insisted that we tried it again for dinner and I'm glad I did. The gnocchi and the house made pasta with veal sauce are delish. I can't get enough of it.
