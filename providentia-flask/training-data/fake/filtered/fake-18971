worst thing about this place is waiting to be seated. we had to wait an hour and we went at 6. fortunetly we live a block away so it was no bother. we got back and had to wait another 15 mins so had a drink at the bar. the women at reception are not very friendly. drinks were 3 bucks for coke 6 for beer....not bad. the restaurant is very cool insdie, good vibrant atmosphere...the noodles are great and only 2 bucks for extra. def worth a visit. dont go on wkds u will have a long wait and they dont accept bookings. staff inside are very nice and food is good
