Great service, wonderful atmosphere. Since we were there early on a week night, it wasn't crowded, and even when the dining room started to fill up, the noise level remained acceptable. The calamari appetizer was indeed tasty, if sweeter than expected, more Asian than Italian. That the mojitos were half-price was a plus. The Cuban skirt steak was as tender as comparable dishes at Flor de Mayo and about $10 more--but then Flor de Mayo's service is on the perfunctory side and somewhat lacking in atmosphere compared to Calle Ocho.
