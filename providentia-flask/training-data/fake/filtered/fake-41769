Where do I begin... The decor is sooo New York, the original mixed with the new and the old and the view and the river. All conceived and handmade by Maud and Philippe. Fantastic-huge-bar you never want to leave,with a sexy bartender- The Bakery goods are out of this world, baked by this hotshot .I get the multigrain bread everyday. And to finally end with the food-fresh-good-and affordable. My favorite tagliatele mushrooms and steak au poivre of course. This is the place where the true, cool, understated New Yorkers hang out with the celebrities who don't want to be seen and those are the ones we want to hang out with, right? BAKEHOUSE has it ALL...
