I find it odd that a pizza place in the new haven area is only open two days a week???? There's enough competition and colleges in the area for them to be open 6-7 days a week! Overall the pizza was fine but I have had better. The honey crust is a nice touch, but any restaurant can do that and to top it off the waitress had to come back over a few minutes after we ordered to ask if we wanted it. If that is something that makes you "unique" then wouldn't you know right then and there to ask your customers?? The menu is extremely limited and overpriced. It's also on a piece of paper which shows they don't care. They have one size pizza and one size salad. If I wanted a small salad before pizza I'd have to order the $9 salad that could feed a family of 4. This place had two tables filled which makes it suspicious why on a Saturday night there was almost no one there. The decor is just OKAY and the fact that they won't have any live bands for another month makes it even stranger. I don't see this place lasting long because they can't even open or re-open properly. The wait staff was nice but seeing the girl at the register in her iPhone looking bored solidified that there's not much going on here.
