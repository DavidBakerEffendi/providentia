I don't know where to even begin with this place! Okay, so I went on a Saturday night. It was slammed! The dining room and the hookah lounge was packed! We ended up staying and waited 25 minutes, which was fine considering it was a Saturday night. The hostess was nice, polite, and very welcoming. The managers were friendly and the rest of the staff was good too. Food Food Food! Appetizer.. We had Hummus. Very tasty and surprisingly the best I ever had! They give you a lot and it comes with as much as pita bread you want. Entrees... I had the full order of the chicken kebab. It was absolutely delicious. The chicken was grilled to perfection with delicious creme tume and basmati rice! My date had the shrimp tripoli, a little spicy, but hey everyone's spice tolerance is different! It looked delicious, and was certainly delicious too! We skipped dessert and got hookah instead. The biggest thing with hookah is that there is a 12 minimum per person. Any customer complaining about not knowing is pretty STUPID because it says it big underneath the choices of hookahs they have. The biggest problem I see with other tables around me is them not reaching their minimum. If you have a table with 4 people, don't expect to walk out of the restaurant only paying $24 after you guys sat there for 3 hours. SO, the minimum is there and I think it's decent. It's better than paying a cover charge or other bs charges. But that night we went, we had watermelon mint. Yum! Overall amazing place! Great ambiance, great staff! Definitely coming back!
