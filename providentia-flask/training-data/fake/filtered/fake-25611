I have never had a good experience at this place. It's great if your drunk and belligerent, because, only then, you will not notice the attitude of the service or the fact that they forgot about your order while you're standing right in front of them! I just left. They do this to serve the best cold pizza in Hartford, because that is the only thing that I have bought from them. Delivery is a mistake, picking up didn't help, and ordering there and waiting is not worth the service. I tried to give them a chance for a while, because of the lack of good pizza in Hartford, but they are bad. If you want good Halal food, go to Tangiers! If you want pizza get Domino's, Very sadly the best pizza place in Hartford, even with the bullet proof glass at the counter, seriously bullet proof glass.
