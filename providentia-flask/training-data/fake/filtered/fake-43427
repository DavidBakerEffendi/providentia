Very good. They give you a TON of food! Highly recommend the "Jewish Sloppy Joe" OMG. So good! Breakfast omelettes are always pretty good. Waitresses are hit and miss, some are more friendly then others. The "hostess" isn't very friendly, thought it was because she was pregnant in the past, but she no longer is, and is still grumpy.
