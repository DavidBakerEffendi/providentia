I visited this restaurant on Thursday and was very disappointed to witness the owner/manager mistreat his employees. This was very disturbing and frankly, he should know better than that. As a customer, I don't want to support a place that treats their employees with disrespect. The irony is that the wait staff is professional and very good at their job. It's a shame to see someone taking advantage of their power and mistreating the people who work for them. Will not return - can't give this nasty, nasty, man my money!
