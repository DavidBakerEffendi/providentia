My favorite thing here is the "Nasty Burger" with a massive halal beef patty corn fritters, onion rings, lettuce, onion, tomato, cheese, ketchup, and their traditional sauce all with a side drink and fries for only $6.95. This is what I come for. Also, the pizza toppings are great, they can customize your toppings too.
