I came for Sunday brunch with the express purpose of trying their crepes. I've had excellent crepes in France, London and Sydney, Australia but I haven't found a good place in NYC yet.... sadly Le Grainne's was extremely disappointing! The savory crepes were over-cooked! they had the texture of a toasted, hard crepe that cracked at the folds; it was so dry, so unappetizing, inedible. Not only was the crepe poorly executed, they failed at pairing the filling too. We ordered from the menu (not choose your own filling combinations) one with sausage - which were greasy, seared slices of dry, hard salami... the other crepe was turkey, ratatouille and goat cheese - the turkey was very dry, and they hardly had any ratatouille nor cheese so not only were the crepes dry on the outside but inside filling was dry as well. Horrible menu combinations for crepes!! Now I know why, when you order a savory crepe in France, their fillings have creamy gravies with meats, mushrooms, etc. Their crepes are chewy and soft with a lovely buttery flavor.... just soooo good. Why can't I find a great crepe in NYC!!! I've tried Vive La Crepe and Creperie NYC - they are ok, lacks the chewy texture of a good crepe and I had to tell them not to overcook the crepe. Seems like these places think crepes should be made crispy - blasphemy!!! I've had pre-packaged crepes that are better than these crepe establishments; that's pretty sad!
