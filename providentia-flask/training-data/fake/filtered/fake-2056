Normally it's difficult to dine at most restaurants at 1pm and so I found it strange that there were only 2 customers dining but it was cold out and I was hungry.  I was not greeted by the waitress but was promptly handed a menu which was somewhat limited but interesting.  One entree was "Hard Eggs", bacon and potatoes...sounded perfect, I asked her to describe and explain hard eggs and she answered "visualize sunny side up eggs" ( I laughed silently).  I then asked if I could have scrambled instead of hard eggs and was told she didn't know, she seemed somewhat annoyed when I suggested that she ask the kitchen. You can imagine my shock and displeasure when without any apology she told me that the chef would not accommodate my request! I paid for my coffee and left, I now know why this restaurant was empty and fail to understand why they have so many positive reviews!
