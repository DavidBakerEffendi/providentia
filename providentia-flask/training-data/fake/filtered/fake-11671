I've eaten here quite a few times, for both lunch and dinner.  Very good Italian food at a reasonable price (for New York).   Crazy mix of clientele - lady lunching shoppers, families, business people in suits, tourists.  Fun atmosphere.  We like to take visitors here.  Most of the other restaurants around Herald Square are over-priced business spots or mediocre chains.  I wouldn't take a business contact  who I'm trying to impress, but if you want a relaxed spot with a very good meal, this is the place.
