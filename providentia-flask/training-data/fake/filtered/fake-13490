I decided to try this place out since I was going to the movies after dinner but it wasn't worth the visit.  Got there and there as a short wait, no more than I expected.  But when they took me to the table they gave me a menu and the specials.  When the waitress returned with my drink and I tried to order the special she then told me they were out of it.  For a restaurant that is to be open until 11pm it is strange they ran out the of special by 7pm. So I ordered a burrito and have never had Mexican food this bland.  I tried to enjoy the free chips but they were stale and according to the menu the only way to get salsa was to pay for it and it came with another basket of chips.  As I was alone I didn't want more chips and every mexian restaurant I have been too includes salsa when they give a basket of chips.  So the Burrito had no flavor at all and it wasn't very enjoyable and the chips were stale.  Decided I would try dessert in hopes it would be better.  Wanted an Apple Chimi and ordered it as I finished the burrito hoping for better.  Waitress disappeared for several minutes only to come back and tell me they were out of that as well.  It was a Saturday night and they were running out of food this early, no wonder the place was near empty by just after 8pm.  Wont go back and won't recommend it to anyone.
