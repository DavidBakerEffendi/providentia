Had an extraordinary dining experience here yesterday, celebrating my daughter's graduation.  Showed up (unintentionally) without a reservation, and they welcomed us in immediately, setting up an extra table since they had two very large parties.  Service was very friendly and exceptionally attentive without hovering.  The food was very good, but it was the service and the genuine caring that impressed us.  My wife's seared tuna was a little overdone, and they insisted on cooking it over (and it was PERFECT!).  They even went so far as to prepare a special dessert for my daughter (for her accomplishment) and my wife (for her inconvenience).  It's not often that a restaurant moves me, but this one showed such attentive care for people that I love that it was very, very meaningful to me.  We don't love in the area, but would travel to Hartford to visit this restaurant.
