AMAZING!!! Food was to die for or to wait for :) lol. I went there last week with my entire family which in total were 7 people- the wait was 1hour. I thought that was insane but my daughter convinced us that it was worth it. Wasn't I happy we listened to her. The waiters were a little cold and no personality but egh i guess thats okay. The food was so delicious and huge portions!!! Lemon Potatoes are amazing and the desert at the end was great.
