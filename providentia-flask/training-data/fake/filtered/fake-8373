I loved this restaurant.  Lovely interior, lovely staff, and wonderful food.  I'm recovering from a cold, and wanted to be soothed with some pho.  The pho was excellent - the broth was wonderfully rich, flavorful and fragrant - it was about as good as it gets.  The egg rolls -  also very, very good.  I spoke with another patron while there, and she said they have a beef sandwich that is also terrific.  I will probably try that next.
