This is a worn-out approach to tapas. Most items I sampled lacked flavor or were non-memorable. Nothing stood out all evening. The octopus was flavorless and tough. The shrimp were bathed in garlic, which overwhelmed the dish. Really the whole meal, (lamb meatballs, beef short ribs, pork shoulder) was dull. Service was very good, but won't be going back.
