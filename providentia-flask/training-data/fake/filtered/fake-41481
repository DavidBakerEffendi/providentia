After a night of going to a bunch of bars that disappointed us, my friends and I randomly showed up here and it was the best decision of the night. The atmosphere was comfortable and people weren't snobby, everyone was talkative and social and it actually felt like a fun place to be. The drinks were great and they weren't unreasonably expensive like a lot of Philly bars are. The bartenders, especially Sam, were awesome and suggested great drinks for us. We never had to wait for a drink and the bartenders definitely took care of us. It was overall just a great experience.
