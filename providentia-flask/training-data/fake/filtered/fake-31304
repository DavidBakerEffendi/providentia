my first visit here was better than my second. Good hamburgers, good tacos, horrible ribs and even more horrible desserts. The display case of beautiful desserts is very deceiving. I have tried a couple and they dont even resemble whats in the case. The ribs are way overcooked and tasteless. Just go for drinks and maybe a burger and it will probably be ok. The food has to get better than this or they wont last. The bar makes good martinis. Someone compared plan b, well I hate plan b and dont understand why anyone likes their tasteless, overpriced hamburgers. So I dont think thats a good comparison. Maggies does have better burgers than plan b, but so dont a lot of places. Go to Goldburgers in Newington.
