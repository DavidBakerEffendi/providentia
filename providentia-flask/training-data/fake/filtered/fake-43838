This place has to be the worst diner experience in New Jersey. The management and servers were very rude. The food was a complete disappointment even for diner standards. Seems like all the food is frozen and nothing is cooked to order. We ordered a burger that came out like a hockey puck even though we asked for it medium. The manager came over and could not have made us feel worse about the fact we wanted a new burger cooked the way we asked for. Do not stop and eat here if at all possible. There are so many other options!
