Pulled up a seat in front of Black Rock and tried the chicken and lamb platter over rice.  For six dollars, they give you a good amount of food.  Did not walk away hungry. I was disappointed that much of the platter was chicken and a small amount of lamb. The chicken was rather dry.  Plenty of rice in the plate.  Iceberg lettuce on the bottom.
