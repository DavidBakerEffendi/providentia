Came here for a quick bite while I was in the neighborhood with some time to kill... I ordered my two favorite things, French onion soup and creme brûlée. The French onion soup was just okay: a little wine heavy, and a bit weak flavor wise, and for some in fathomable reason they topped the cheese with cilantro and diced tomatoes (an unwelcome addition, but I picked it off without trouble). The creme brûlée though was absolutely incredible. It had a perfect sugar crust, with a delicate custard at the perfect temperature and consistency, and you could see the ground vanilla beans at the bottom of the ramikin. Sumptuous, well-balanced, attractive plating, great ingredients, and an attentive and traditional technique. I would go back twenty more times if only for that, but I would absolutely look further into the menu given the time. A must-have if you're in the neighborhood!
