Madrid and Lisbon is a restaurant i order from frequently. Being of Portuguese decent it's good to enjoy a meal that is reminiscent of home. Their staff is friendly and mean well. However; once in a while they have made mistakes on my order but they always offer sincere apologies. I would recommend anyone looking to for a good meal. There sandwiches, paella, and picadinho are all very tasty.
