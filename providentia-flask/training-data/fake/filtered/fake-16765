wow! what a great find! while my fiance and i strolled down south street looking for a vegetarian or vegan restaurant that wouldn't cost an arm and a leg, we stumbled across this little gem just as we were about to give up and either pay too much for a meal or go home and cook for ourselves. great vegan menu with lots of options, food was delicious and the price was right, atmosphere was small and welcoming. very friendly staff. and the desert we shared was unreal: a coffee brownie over vegan chocolate ice cream... delectable! to top it off there are photos of an adorable cat on the wall with a sign that says they will post pictures of your pet if you bring them in. CUTE! i loved this place. i wish there was something like it in the lehigh valley, where i live. if you are in philly, you need to check this place out. period.
