This place is a casual restaurant for snacking while drinking. If you've been to Japan you will recognize it as authentic Japanese food (e.g., karaage chicken, menchikatsu croquette or gobou salad), but this is not your "typical" Japanese restaurant (e.g., when I went they didn't have sushi or teriyaki in the menu). The place itself is small, good for eating with a friend or a small group of friends. If you're planning on a larger group you probably want to call in advance and check (e.g., we were 8, more than that would have been complicated). In terms of quality I was quite impressed, really juicy hamburger steak, moist and tender fried chicken and a perfectly fried breaded combo platter, with a delicious melt-in-your-mouth sweet bean jelly for dessert.
