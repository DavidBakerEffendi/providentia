I struggled with 4 stars here because great place- nice ambience and friendly staff but on my last visit i saw something near the kitchen i didn't like and expressed it to one of the waitresses and the head chef. He kind of just blew it off saying that sorry but it is what it was and that was that. I wish i hadnt seen anything because the food is amazing, ambience is great and highly rated place. - Customer service goes a long way. I want to go back for the food but we will see.
