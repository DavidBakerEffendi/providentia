I work in financial district and always used to go to Pound & Pence or Suspenders, right next to my office.  I just found out about this place.  They have awesome food!  Great atmosphere, with lots of big TV's.  Friendly service.  Honestly can't think of a bad thing to say about it.  It's my new favorite spot in the neighborhood.  Highly recommended!
