What happened to this place? It used to be delicious. The sauces are still great, but the fries are terrible. They are not crispy at all, they are too chunky, and all I could taste when I ate them was starch. Plus the potatoes are full of black spots. Are they using bad potatoes, or simply undercooking them, or reusing the oil too many times? Pommes frites, please bring back the good potatoes!
