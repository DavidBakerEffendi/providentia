Every month my husband and I have a date night. It's very rare that we try a new place unless recommended by someone we know. Even though this place had good reviews I was still a little skeptical. However, when I arrived at the spot I was not disappointed. Tabare was super cozy and romantic. Perfect for date night. It's was Friday night Â the place was packed but we were seated 5 minutes later. Waiter was friendly and attentive. Drinks and food were really good. Considering we had one appetizer, two entrees, drinks, dessert - the bill was not pricey at all. We'll definitely be going back and recommending this place to others.
