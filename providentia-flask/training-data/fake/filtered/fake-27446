Having been coming here for more nearly 30 years since I was a kid, here is the real deal: The pizza is great.  This is why people come, and why you should go if you have never been.  No one else makes a Sicilian pie this good. The restaurant end of things, however, is seriously lacking.  Tonight was my second time dining in the restaurant, and it was truly sub-par.   The food in the restaurant is typical non-gourmet southern Italian, and the prices are a bit higher than many better local Italian places.  The house salad was boring, the baked clams were fresh, and the penne with vodka was drowned in what was basically a salty pink cream sauce. What really makes the restaurant a place to which I will never return, however, is the unendurable wait for a table, and the horrible service from the hostess.  At 7:30 on a Friday, the wait was a full hour, and you must wait in the completely freezing and unheated area where take out orders are served.  The hostess slips in the "regulars" ahead of you, and never seems to get to your name on the list unless you keep pestering her about how long you've been waiting. Even after being seated, we waited about 25 minutes for appetizers, and another 20 or so for entrees. Summary: Don't bother going for the restaurant.  Wait until the weather is warmer, get a slice and a spumoni, and leave it at that.
