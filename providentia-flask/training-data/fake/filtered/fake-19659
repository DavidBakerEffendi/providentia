Another holiday to-do item.  I don't work in the city so I can never get there before they sell out/close normally.  I had the beef hummus and every item on the platter, from the hummus to the pita, to the little piece of onion was amazingly tasty. The surprise for me was how filling it was.  The hummus platter (pretty much all they sell, but with different toppings) was a perfect size for a filling lunch.  It's obvious they take the quality of their food very seriously. The eating area is kinda like a shack, it's crowded with communal tables and hectic.  But to tell the truth, I can't envision any better layout; OK maybe one more table.  The staff was very friendly. All in all an awesome meal.  Now all I need to do is find a job downtown.
