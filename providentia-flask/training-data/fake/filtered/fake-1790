Went early, 4:30, as we were off to a broadway show later, and were seated in a crappy corner, even though the place was empty. It is a much larger place than it looks from the street. However, the service was excellent, almost over the top, and the food was served very quickly, and there was lots, and it was very tasty. We had the Matador combo, $36, and split it between us, and still brought some home. The salads and sauces were fresh and tasty. Peruvian beer was yummy, and desserts were also. We were pleased that they offered espresso or cappuccino, too. My wife and I would go back again.
