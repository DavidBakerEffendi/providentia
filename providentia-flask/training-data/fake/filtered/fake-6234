I have travelled across the world and this one has been one of the best sushi places I have been to. The crab and avocado salad is phenomenal. There are nice people running the place. The sushi presentation is creative and eye catching. They treat you with an orange at the end of your meal....and added plus. There are several sushi's that are not bite size. When ordering, you have to be selective.
