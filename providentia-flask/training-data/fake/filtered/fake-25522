First of all the food is great, so is the beer. This was our second time and we like to sit at the bar because of the atmosphere. Unfortunately there was not much of it yesterday at 8:30 pm, we could barely hear the music. One of the bartenders did not seem like she liked her job and barely acknowledged us. The other one was friendlier but paid more attention to her friends. Â We ate our meal, drank two beers and finished our evening at another bistro. This was different from our previous visit where the bartender was happy to serve us different beers to taste. This will not stop us from going back but we are hoping for a better experience next time.
