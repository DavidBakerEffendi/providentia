Seriously ?! Ugh ! After reading all the good reviews , I decided to give this place a try. Obviously, Greenwich village hillbillies don't know what a true falafel tastes like !  3 bucks for HALF a falafel sandwich ! That's more evil than paying 20 for a slice of pizza.   The falafel itself was cracked and way tooooo crispy.  I felt as if I was eating chips. Instead of Israeli salad , they put lettuce in their pita bread !  This place is tiny and there is no place for you to turn or move once inside.  I am giving it one star because the pita bread was warm and sort of crispy too.   If you love falafels , go there , you"ll hate it.
