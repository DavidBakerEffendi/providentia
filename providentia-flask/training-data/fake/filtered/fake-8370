The food was to die for...everything I ordered was interesting, fresh and flavorful. The cocktails were creative and delicious. The service was fantastic...everyone was pleasant and attentive. The design detail of the restaurant gave it a really nice atmosphere...the bathrooms were very clean...plan to come back soon with friends. I would definitely recommend Laetus...this is soon to be the new hot spot!
