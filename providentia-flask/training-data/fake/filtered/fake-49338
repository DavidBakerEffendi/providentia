Very pleased with all aspects of this place. Not an avid consumer of Indian food, and enjoyed everything I ordered. Get a bread, just do it. I ordered from the main entree list and got a very hot chicken dish with potatoes.... Amazing. Finish with a chai tea. Servings are moderate to big. Price is mostly 10-15 dollars. Service amazing. Big fan. I hear good things of their lunch as well.
