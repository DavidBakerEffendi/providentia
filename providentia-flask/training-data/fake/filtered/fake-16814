Ambience amazingly shabby chic.  Sea carmel sundae - amazing.  "Best turkey sandwich you'll ever have" per the waitress - no by a long shot.  Dry and meh.  Be wary of your credit card charge - a friend and I show three charges totaling $200 for lunch and currently working with ABC to get it fixed.  All in all, a cozy restaurant but I wouldn't necessarily come here for the entrees.
