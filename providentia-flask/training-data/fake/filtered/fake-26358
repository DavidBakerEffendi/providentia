I don't know how this place is in business. I stopped in for take out. The staff was friendly and thats where it ends. I ordered a 10 piece honney bbq and a burger. In the car, I was immediately overwhelmed by the odor of Ketchup.  I thought it was the burger until I got home and opened the food. The wings looked like 4 day old soggy leftovers drenched in a thick sauce that smelled more like ketchup than honey bbq. The burger looked like something out of a microwave.  No one at home would even try to taste the food so it all went in the trash untouched. I'd rather starve than have to eat here.
