Oaxaca Kitchen proved to be the best find in New Haven. I first visited this restaurant last year and had such a wonderful experience. The combination of delicious food, great drinks and an unbeatable ambience proved to be the ingredients for a fantastic evening out. The menu was not only fairly priced but also extremely well presented. The service was great and my group was made to feel welcome immediately. The manager and his team have continued to do an excellent job ever since our first visit. This is a must visit restaurant!
