Excellent spot in montclair for some good food with a great atmosphere. Granted its decor is a tad hipster, but it all comes together very well. I usually come here for brunch and its always packed but im alone on my way to work anyway so seating is no problem. It is a cafe so a specialty coffee is a must. I prefer an iced dirty chai latte for the hot summer days along with my corned beef hash. Food is always tasty, the coffee is enjoyable and the service is kind and attentive. Overall awesome place.
