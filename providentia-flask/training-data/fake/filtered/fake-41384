Over the past couple of years, I have co-hosted and attended a number of events at City Tap House (fundraisers, informal get-togethers, events with large groups, etc.) and I think they do an excellent job with accommodating reservations made by large groups. Last night was no exception, and I was so impressed by the fact (even though it was so busy and crowded for Penn Homecoming) our large party received excellent service and we had a fantastic time at Tap House. I could not ask for a better place to host our events and dinners... Keep up the great work! :)
