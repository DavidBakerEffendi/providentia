I was excited to go to Jamonera just 2 days after it's opening, considering how much I love Barbuzzo and all the shops on 13th Street. Unfortunately, it was Restaurant Week, and most places I've been during that week, you don't really get the best feel for a place with the limited menu and desire for quick table turnover. My friend and I got almost everything offered on the Restaurant Week menu to share. Most of it I did not like. The pumpkin croquettes tasted like fried mozzarella sticks from Cheesecake Factory. The 2 desserts - a honey cake a la mode and some sort of biscuits with sheep's milk spread - were awful. My friend and I were like, what is this stuff, and why are desserts so salty? Maybe it's just me, but I like my dessert to be sweet. The worst part was when we asked for more bread with the foie gras. They had given us 3 very thin slices of baguette to eat with the foie gras, which was not enough. When we asked for more bread, we were told that it only came with the dish, and if we wanted, he could "put in an order" for us (meaning, he could charge us for bread). Are you kidding me?? With all the money people spend at your restaurants and shops, and the fact that this place is brand new - I would think the owners wouldn't want another Bindi situation. I mean, what restaurant charges for bread? I am a major foodie and love to try all of the yummy restaurants around Philadelphia. This one will not be on my recommendation list, and I certainly won't be going back.
