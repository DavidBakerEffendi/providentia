Very disappointing business dinner. First, after a wait (and everything in this meal involved a long wait), 2 rolls are brought to a table with 3 people. Never again do we see another roll (90+ minute meal) even after asking for bread twice. Same with water, empty glasses for 30+ minutes. Restaurant half empty but waiter too busy to spend time at our table, busy chatting up some women at anoither table (even sitting with them). One of my companions gets wrong order; 30+ minute wait for correct order to come, which is vastly overcooked (medium rare ends up well done). He ends up eating long after we have finished. I don't typically like the topic of a business meal to be how bad the restaurant service is, which is what happened. That just makes my job all the more difficult. I have had some good meals here in the past, but nobody seems to care anymore, and for nearly $50 entrees, that's just not forgiveable. My companions were both upset and won't be back, also seem to think I can't choose a restaurant. Thanks Trattoria Dell'Arte!
