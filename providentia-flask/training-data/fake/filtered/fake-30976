Been to the New Haven restaurant numerous times and enjoyed it every time. Thought we'd give the place a go since it was located closer to the friends we were meeting. -Server was attentive but "upselling" at every moment. Her "Why don't you live a little?" comment at the fact no one was interested in "upgrading" to truffle parmesan fries for an additional $3 was uncalled for. We upgraded to the pretzel roll, wasn't that enough? -Beers arrived with about 2" of room at the top of the glass. I'm not looking for the pint to be overflowing, but it shouldn't look like someone has already taken a drink. -Grilled Cheese and Pesto sandwich was utterly disappointing (If you had one at the NH location don't expect the same here). My friends burger had more mayo on it than this sandwich had cheese. I'll stick with the New Haven location from now on. The cost of parking is worth the better food and service.
