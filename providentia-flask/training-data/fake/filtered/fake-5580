We had a reservation- I'll admit, it was for eight people, but there is still no reason to keep a reservation waiting for over half an hour.  The hostesses more or less ignored our group as they sat everyone standing around us as we continued to wait.  When we were finally sat, it was at a table a bit too small for the number of people, and crammed against the wall.   The ambience was loud.  The goodwill from the chocolaty magic I felt when I walked in the room had long been spent on the wait.  Our waitress really tried, but it was impossible to keep up with such a crowded restaurant The food was pretty good, but not very much of it for what they were charging.  I had a burger that was a little bit undercooked for what I asked for, but edible.  One of my companions said the mac and cheese was a bit too rich though.  Portions were small, and their waffle fries didn't taste any different from the ones I had whilst working at Friendly's. Surely, dessert would be better. We got the chocolate fondue, split among the 8 of us.  I wasn't impressed with the presentation or the quality.  The chocolate wasn't warm enough, and the marshmallows, brownies, and cookies all tasted processed.  For $25, you think they'd bake their own cookies.  It ended up being about $60 per couple, which is a lot for burgers, one beer, and 1/4 of a dessert. So, to sum up: Your reservation only matters if they're not busy Lots of money for a fairly small amount of food I wouldn't go again.
