I have been reading advertisements in Suburban Essex on The Yellow Plum.  We decided to try the restaurant.  What a pleasant surprise!  Love the decor especially the zebra wood chairs and the collection of Ocean Clark's paintings.  The food was plated well.  My husband enjoyed the chorizo burger and I enjoyed the linguine with clam sauce with an interesting twist.  Musician Mike Buscio was the perfect background music for the venue.
