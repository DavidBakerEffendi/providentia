Want some down-home stick-to-your-ribs food on the cheap?  Percy Street has the best macaroni and cheese appetizer - no fancy additives like lobster or crab - with garlic, and juicy barbecue.  I love their ribs.  The rootbeer chipotle glaze is surprise at first, but grows on you.  Now I love it and order it every time I'm there.  The pecan pie tastes just like the one I remember Grams making for me.  If you have a humongus appetite, the combo plates are mountainous at a very reasonable price.
