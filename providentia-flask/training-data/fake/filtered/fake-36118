We were denied service because we asked for our group (which was to be split between to tables) to sit next to one another ---- after we were seated. Â The staff and ?owner? where possibly the most unsavory bunch I have every encountered at any eating-establishment. ME-N-U is MUCH better....and just down the street. Good luck
