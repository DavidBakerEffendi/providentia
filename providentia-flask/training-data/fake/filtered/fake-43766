I went here with my girlfriend and she was so impressed with my taste :-) She loved the ambiance (no sign out front, freshly arranged flowers everywhere, cozy dining room with traditional atmosphere). The food was delicious and beautifully arranged, if the portions were a little on the smaller side for what you pay. The staff was friendly, service was quick. We both had an amazing time and will definitely come back! One tip: There's an adorable table in a little garden outside, ask for it if you're on a date!
