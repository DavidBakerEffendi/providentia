I went to Eulogy last night (a Sunday) - 2nd floor and enjoyed the food and beer, but there does seem to be a mouse problem - while we were eating, one especially adventurous mouse would try to scamper across the floor from the bar area near the front windows. We would stomp and sent it back to the corner. So wear boots!
