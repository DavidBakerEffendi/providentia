Gramercy Tavern is one restaurant I treat my parents to dine when they come over to New York. Their food is totally delicious and my mom and dad really loves it. It's a little busy at certain times but it's not a problem at all because they still give out a really good service and it's because they have a really nice restaurant so no wonder there are a lot of customers. The value of the food is just right for what you get in a complete course.
