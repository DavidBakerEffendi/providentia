Favorite place in NYC! I came on last Friday with some friends and had a wonderful time! Beautiful bar and fun atmosphere! The staff was very friendly and the service was stellar. The food was delicious, too! We had a round of appetizers and loved the pulled pork french fries. Also had the "Lillie Penni" cocktail. It was amazing and they make a pretty mean hot toddy there, too ;)
