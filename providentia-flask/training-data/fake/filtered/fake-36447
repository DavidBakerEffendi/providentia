I had heard several people rave about how good the food was, so I thought that i would give it a try... The hostess asked if my party of two would be eating- I said yes and by saying yes she did not mention that there was a minimum of how much one must eat to sit at one of the 4 open tables at 11 PM on a Tuesday night. After ordering wine for both, I ordered a salad- a moderately priced salad ($15). The waiter came back to the table and said he could not put my order in because the kitchen required two plates PER PERSON and said that we would have to go to the bar next door if we were not going to order more food and said we could speak with the manager and she had said that we could not be served. He then sent over the "manager" (who was Â also the hostess) asked us what we needed- she clearly did not know the situation like he had said and she agreed that we could not be served. They handed us the bill and took our drinks next door for us to enjoy them there, where the server was completely charming and hospitable. I have never been treated so terribly in a restaurant. I love the atmosphere and the feel but not the staff. I explained the situation with my friend who had recommended Casa Mono and she said that is totally not true, last week her and another each ordered A salad....
