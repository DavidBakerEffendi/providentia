Had a late lunch on Sunday, 8/30 and probably would've given 3 or 4 stars: food was good for the price, service friendly and attentive and a patio was a plus. However, I was double charged - called 17th st location first, was told to call 20th st. Spoke to several people, everyone was very friendly; they took down my contact info, receipt number, etc etc. and ...nothing. I've been told that the records already been transferred somewhere. I don't understand why it is so difficult to find a record of a transaction that occured day before! At this point I would like to reverse the tip as well - I've alread spent couple of hours for a $30-something overcharge - contacting PETITE ABEILLE, my credit card co, looking for receipts... I'm a business owner myself and it would probably take me about 5-10 minutes to pull any record, recent or old.
