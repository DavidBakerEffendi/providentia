My husband was taking me out for a nice dinner. We mostly eat at Italian restaurants and cook Italian style meals, for the most part, so we decided to go Greek. Although the service was great, the food was not. I appreciated how great the food sounded when you ordered it, but everything was incredibly salty when it came out! We didn't even finish our food (and that is rare for us). The only good thing that came out of this dinner, was the great bottle of Riesling we bought before dinner.
