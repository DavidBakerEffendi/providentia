Very enjoyable experience. Food could have been warmer but the taste was awesome. Very nice setting (especially later in the evening), and both beer and wine was great as well. It was crowded and if you sit next to a yeller you will be part of his convo, but I would reccommend this as a place to dine for many occassions.
