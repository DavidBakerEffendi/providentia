Need better management and food quality has to be better.  Since their website wasn't working (not paying their web hosting fee?), I couldn't get the 10% coupon from their webpage.  I asked if they can give me the 10% off, they refused saying the owner not in.... What the heck is that!!! Took the food home and found that the sushi and the udon were terrible!!!! We have found that the quality of the foods is getting worse and now the service is typical of a Chinese restaurant ... they don't give a %h*t about costumer service!! Been a customer for a long time and now it is time to find another sushi place.....
