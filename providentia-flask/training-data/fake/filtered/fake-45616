This is my and my boyfriend's new favorite place. We usually sit at the bar and find the staff, management, and other patrons to be friendly and enjoyable. We are mid 30's - early 40's. The food is outstanding and well priced, as are the drinks. There is only one bartender who seems a little behind the pace. We have not had table service yet, but there seems to be ample space and tables available. A delightful addition to our area and SO much better than when it was O'Connor's.
