This bar is uttlery pretentious.  The bartenders on the night I went were rude and seem to think that if you wanted a soda you should not be in the bar.   Also, the music was so loud that we wound up screaming at each other and finally had to leave.  I can't imagine what the people in the buildings around the bar must think.  Perhaps the owners can take a clue from the other bars in park slope and keep the music at a level where you can talk to your friends. I certainly wouldn't want to go on a date here - you would just end up saying "what" the entire evening.
