Whoever claims this is authentic Italian food is out of their mind!  I had a plain mozz pie and it was way below average.  Cheap cheese, sauce with no taste and crust that was undercooked and doughy!  Tasted a little bit like Domino's back in the day.  I had a salad with chicken that was subpar and extremely expensive.   He claims to have a authentic Brick Oven and he should be sued for false advertisement.  Pepes and Modern, they have true Brick ovens!  Oregano Joe cooks his pies in a rotating pizza oven similar to Domino's.  It is obvious this guy is a wanna-be!  Tomie T. was correct.  There are way too many great Pizza joints in New Haven County, Orange and Milford to waste your time on this place! Also, the girl was anything but friendly on the telephone.  Why give someone business that makes me feel like they are doing me a favor.  They advertise like crazy to get business (I got a menu and decided to try it) and now I see why!  I do not think they have many repeat customers. Take it from a true Pisan, do not waste your time!
