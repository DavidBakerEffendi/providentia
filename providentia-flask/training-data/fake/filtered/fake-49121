Went here for my birthday last month.  The service was great, the food was very good, and the owner is awesome.  You might recognize many faces (and menu items) from Hot Tomato's - but that's a good thing. Interior is nice, they definitely improved on the space compared to what it was like as Dulce.  It can still be loud in there with some large groups, but has a nice atmosphere overall. You may not be blown away but you certainly won't be disappointed.
