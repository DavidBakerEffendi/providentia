Went to this legendary place last year with my husband to celebrate our wedding anniversary. We ordered their famous Margherita Pizza which was thin and crust and make my heart fly to the moon and back. We got seated on the basement which was kinda cool bacause it seems that they store their wine there. But I just wondered if they only have one restroom (unisex restroom) because if they only had one,oh my,that restroom really work hard..
