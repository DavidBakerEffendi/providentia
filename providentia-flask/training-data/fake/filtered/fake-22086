Best place to go if your group can't decide on what type of food to eat. There's everything from Chinese to cheesesteaks to fried chicken. During the weekday, it's best to go after the lunch hour. Because it's downtown, it's ridiculously busy between 11:30 AM and 1:30 AM. Great tourist spot to hit if you've never visited the city before.
