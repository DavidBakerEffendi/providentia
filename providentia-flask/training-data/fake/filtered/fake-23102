Had dinner tonight during the Louisville/Kentucky Final Four game.  Arrived early enough to get a booth in the bar.  Andrew was our server:  good energy, humor, very knowledgeable about the menu and options.  He was always on the go but never too busy to stop at the table to check on us.  We told him about our wobbly table.  He scooted under the table and fixed it right up.  Dinner was sirloin steak and garlic mashed potatoes.  Salad was fresh and well balanced, not ice cold and pre-plated.  Dressing in small metal gravy boat was a nice touch.  Steak was perfect medium rare, nice sear on the outside.  Garlic mash could have had more garlic for me, but that's a minor thing.  Overall experience was very good--food and service exceeded our expectations.  We will definitely be back!
