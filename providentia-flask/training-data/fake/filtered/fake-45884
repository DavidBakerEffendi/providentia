My favorite place for Sunday brunch. The best pancakes in New Jersey. After tasting pancakes all over New Jersey, I won't even bother ordering them anywhere else but here. In the summer it is especially nice to sit outside and have a leisurely brunch. Good service and warm atmosphere. Prices are equivalent to everything else in Princeton area.
