My wife and I have been there about 6 times.  We've always enjoyed the food and the service has been fine.  Sure, it's touristy but so what.  It's a local place that delivers.  They started off small and because they were successful opened up the theater district spot. P.S. My wife and I went to Katz's Deli because it's the oldest and so forth.  It's dirty, they herd you through like cattle, and the staff are completely disinterested in their customers.  Trust me when I say do yourself a favor and avoid the place.
