The pizza itself was decent but the poor standard for customer service overshadowed it for me. This may be their protocol or it may have been that of the guy working the counter but multiple customers were called out for leaving their pizza trays on the table when leaving. Even the diviest pizza shops, that aren't charging you $24 for a pizza pie, bus and clean your tables. I've worked in the restaurant industry for many years, and yes it can be annoying to clean up after others but that's an unfortunate side to what you signed up for. Also, when I go out, I'm more than happy to clean up after myself as a courtesy - but to see others be called out for not bussing made me want to do it less. When getting ready to leave, my boyfriend asked for a box for the rest of our slices and the counter guy says "how about a bag?" To which my bf replied "I'd prefer a box" and the counter guy walks away without saying anything and grabs one. To me, and this is based off of my one experience here (and could totally be skewed by poor experiences with the counter guy) the place has an air of an independent coffee shop with the arrogant barista that thinks he's above all.
