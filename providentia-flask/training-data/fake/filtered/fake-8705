Five of us Wine-Geek men dined at Modo Mio and elected to have the restaurant "just feed us".  We must have sampled close to 30 dishes plus 7 desserts.  Unlike most Italian style restaurants where Chefs seem to carry a common cooking style throughout the dishes, Modo-Mio diplays impressive diversity.  My favorites were the Paparadelle and the veal (a creative twist on veal parm), but not being a gnocchi fan, I was impressed with the light style in an unassuming sauce.  The server was sure to inform us that the bruschetta was only made approximately 4 weeks per year, only when Jersey tomatoes were available.  The Bruschetta was in fact very good, but having my own supply of Jersey tomatoes, I have to report that ModoMio's supplier in NJ can't compare to what I have on my counter.  With regard to the server, Brett was very personable, efficient and accommodating.   He was knowledgeable of the menu and was excellent in providing a great selection of food and we kept him busy opening about 12 bottles of wine.  The desserts were also delicious and I couldn't find anything I would not eat again!
