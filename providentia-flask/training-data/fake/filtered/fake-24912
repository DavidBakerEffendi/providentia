On a 1 to 10 scale I'd give it an 8.8 because I'm a fussy customer. Most people would give it a 9 at least. Let's eliminate the negatives right away. One of the items on the " Today's Specials" menu was not available though it was only 6:30. The choice of vegetable was corn, corn or corn but since the waitress forgot to bring it and I don't like corn anyway, it was a wash! The overall experience was positive. I was greeted warmly by the owner or manager, promptly seated at the table of my choice and served by an effervescent waitress who couldn't do enough for me... extra bread, nice salad, good portions of solid diner food in a brightly lit and super clean space. The aquarium with tropical fish and the free sugar cookies by the cash register put a smiley on my face as I went out the door. I'm going to change that rating to a 9 at least.
