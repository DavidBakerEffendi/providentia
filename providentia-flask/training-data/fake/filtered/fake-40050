I drove until Midwood as I was told that it was the best place of NY. I was ready to wait, I was in a good mood. When they told me it would take 1 hour to 1,5 hours to get a full pizza I said OK. After 1hour they told me it will only take 30 min if I wanted slices, otherwise it would be an extra hour for a whole pizza. I said OK for the slices (16$ for 4 slices!!!). 30 min later the slices were not ready, they said it would take an extra 30 min for the slices, or 45 min for the pizza. They pissed me off: honestly, am I ready to wait for 2 hours to have a slice of pizza? this is ridiculous. If I want a proper Napolitan pizza, I'd better take the first plane to Sorrento. At least I will sit in a proper restaurant while I wait, instead of standing like an animal, ready to jump at each other's throat for a slice of pizza. They say the wait makes it better. In my case I passed that stage: I wasn't hungry anymore so I left after 90 min of waiting, without any pizza not slice.
