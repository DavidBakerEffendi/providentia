Good/Better/Best Good- place is clean and byob a plus Better- service is great... very friendly and quick Best thing about it - Chinese food that doesn't make you feel absolutely drenched in grease. Vegetables are fresh and not canned. Definitely no MSG... I'm allergic to it so I would know. Great hot green Â tea... not the powdered kind.
