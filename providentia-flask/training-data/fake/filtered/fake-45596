When a tv show visits a diner or any eating establishment they focus on the one or two things the diner does best. In this case it was breakfast and specifically, corned beef hash. We took a ride and order eggs with the homemade hash and it was terrific. Freshly made, crispy and worth the drive. For the reviewer from Mass I love the idea of the road trip and trying places you've seen, we do it all the time while traveling. Id just recommend that you stick to what the specialty was. Other then that, the diner is small, service is nice, its a bit out of the way as others have mentioned but go get a breakfast wrap or stick with the Corned beef hash, the owner is making it from scratch every morning. Cheers.
