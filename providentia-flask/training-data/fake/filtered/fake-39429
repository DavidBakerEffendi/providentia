I've been living downtown in the Financial District for over a year now and Blue Spoon coffee has been my perfect go to coffee place. They brew good coffee and during the weekdays you can get sandwiches, soup, or salad (although I would opt for the soup they always have delicious flavors and variety) The only red flag I throw is the credit card minimum of $4.00...makes it tough to get coffee on the go if you don't have cash.
