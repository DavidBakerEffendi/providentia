Definitively one my favorite spot in nyc!!! I'm not a big fan of ramen but this place has became one of my favorite place for a various series of reasons. First ambiance is very trendy... I really like the design. second the service is super attentive . Third the prices are very reasonable!!! for my experience I suggest this place for a date!
