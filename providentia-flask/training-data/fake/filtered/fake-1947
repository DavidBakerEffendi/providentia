We went in January. Friendly staff, chef came and delivered our food. Bus person very friendly giving us infomation/history on the Red Hook area. The carrot cake was incredible and my friends really enjoyed the apple pie. Would look into visiting in the warmer weather when it's wide open. I had a ceasar salad clam chowder that was very good. We saw crab delivered to other tables and they were huge! We'll be back!!
