On different occasions I have tried the Bibim Pap #7 and Galbi #7 both dishes were excellent in taste and the restaurant was extremely clean. The prices are market value for excellent food. Customer demographics were college students, professors and local community residents. I would give them a great endorsement. Angel G.
