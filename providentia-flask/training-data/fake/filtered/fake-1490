Wonderful restaurant. The decor is very inviting, and the staff are warm yet professional. Some of the menu items are a bit off the map, but White Dog Cafe's choices are healthy by origination, and the plating and presenation is very attractive. I had the scrumptious Cajun Crusted Catfish, which is prepared perfectly, and has an incredible spanish chorizo finish. I recommend this restaurant for anyone who enjoys a comfortable fine dining experience.
