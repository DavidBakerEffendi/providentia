we've been resisting it because of CH gentrification yadda yadda, but wow. What a place. The food, first, is as good as everyone says. The steak tartare was fantastic, kale salad i'm obsessed with now. Wine list is fine. Our server was congenial and attentive. she (plus the bathroom decor) made it a really down to earth, neighborhood experience.
