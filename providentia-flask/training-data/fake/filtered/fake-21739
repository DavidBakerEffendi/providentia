$4 Parking Scam. Beware severe physical intimidation and threats of being arrested for felony theft. On its website where it advertises $4 parking (readingterminalmarket.coâ€¦), there is no mention of time limits, except 2 hours. The site says to pay $10 to a merchant and parking for 2 hours is $4 with discounted rates after that. It's a scam, and a frightening one at that. My family, including my 14-year-old son (on spring break from Phoenix, AZ) visited the Market specifically to get a cheese steak sandwich. Our lunch was great (about $25) and we had a blast in the Market. We walked around outside, too, taking photos. We stayed a little over 3 hours. I gave the parking attendant our validated receipt and was told our parking was $29. I asked to speak with a supervisor. A huge man - well over 6 feet tall and close to 300 pounds came storming out screaming at me. He shouted until his face was red saying I would be arrested for felony theft if we did not pay $29. He stopped a police officer and had me get out of my car. My son was terrorized and still is. The cop said I had to pay it. Under duress, we did, of course. Reading Terminal Market stole at least $20 from us and truly frightened my family. We are filing complaints with the BBB, Philadelphia Tourism (visitphilly.com) and the Philadelphia Convention and Visitors Bureau (discoverphi.com). And we are contacting Philadelphia media outlets to report this scam.
