This is hands down the best breakfast spot in the world.   Anywhere I travel or have lived, this spot is beyond better.   I also dig that the common 45 minute wait deters people who have no idea what they're waiting for..  you're definitely not a local if you think that worth is either too long or not "worth" it.
