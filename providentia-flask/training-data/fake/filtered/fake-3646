I wanted to love this place. Ordered blueberry pancakes, chicken and waffles and tater tots. The chicken and gravy was way too bland in my opinion. I'm used to Roscoe's where the gravy is flavorful and oozes then delicious essence of simmered onions and the chicken is perfectly fried. The pancakes were a little weird tho they get a plus for using real blueberries. Tator tots were interesting. Not what I expected (the looked like hush puppies) but grew on me.
