Took my Colleagues to the Guild & Co in Early December for a Holiday meal.... Honestly I expected more for the price. The food quality (I had the 14oz rib steak with sides that were shared around the table) was at par with other good restaurants in the area in terms of flavor however below par in terms of portion size particularly considering the very high price tag. My Rib steak alone was approx $48.00 and would have left me hungry by itself. Service was good and the atmosphere was average. Personally my next night out I will visit any other of the areas fine restaurants many of which in my opinion have much better atmosphere, equal or better quality/quantity of food and a considerably lower price tag. Also, some other of the local restaurants and school cafeterias for that matter also by local "farm "products without exploiting the practice for personal profit.
