This place is phenomenal. My wife and I have been going here for years ever since our first meal immediately after receiving our doctorates. The staff is very polite and the food is awesome and very affordable. Whether you go for lunch or for dinner, you will not be dissapointed. This is a great place to take a bottle of wine, relax, enjoy some pasta, and forget about everything else. Also, went here for a group birthday shindig and was amazing with how smooth everything went, especially for a large group (~10 people). I would definitely suggest trying this place for your next group celebration!
