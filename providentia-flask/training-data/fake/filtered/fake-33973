DON'T GO.  I don't care HOW good the pizza is, I don't care if they make if out of caviar and truffles and Angelina Jolie's vagina, NOTHING is worth the rude, horrible service of the lobotomized, shuffling, arrogant Italian senior citizens in their house slippers TOTALLY IGNORING an entire restaurant of people who had made the pilgramage to this so-called mecca of pizza only to wait outside in the cold for an hour and a half (and hey, we're New Yorkers, we can take it, we're used to waiting for everything) and then once INSIDE to wait another HOUR and A HALF for ONE FUCKING PIZZA, an hour and a half with no booze, I might add, while the idiots stand around the kitchen picking their noses.  We finally walked out.  What a waste of a Saturday night.  Fuck you, Sally's, and if Frank Sinatra said you're so great, then fuck Frank too.
