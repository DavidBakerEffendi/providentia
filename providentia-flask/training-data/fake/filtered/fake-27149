Let me start by saying that I like the Marathon group of restaurants.  They put out good food on a relatively consistent basis.   Three times in the last month, however, I have ordered food for delivery and each time I have ordered a salad on the side.  Each and every time, without fail, the lettuce in my salad was brown.  I don't know how early in the day they cut the romaine, but I feel like it is something that can be done to order.  I've gotten salads from Qdoba and even their lettuce is green. I don't like writing negative reviews, so I am going to go write a few positive ones to balance out my review kharma.
