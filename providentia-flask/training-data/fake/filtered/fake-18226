I will preface this by saying that I' m a person of color who wrongly expected friendly and fair treatment from a  " respectable " establishment. My mother and I made the mistake of trying (on a recommendation)  this restaurant on a Sunday afternoon. We were greeted by a very thin dark haired man who emerged from across the room and informed us that brunch was over and only the bar was open. I  asked if we  could get something to eat at the bar and he said that the kitchen was closed until 5:00PM.  As we turned to leave,  a white couple entered and passed us looking to eat and they were informed that only the bar was open but he told them to wait... and proceeded to retrieve a bar menu from behind the host's/reception desk.  He then handed it to them and told them that he would check with the kitchen and turned and walked back across the restaurant. Of course my mouth dropped and I will refrain from expounding about this sort of unconscionable behavior as it would take up too much room. I thought we were past these issues in this day and age but obviously I'm wrong. UPDATE: ONE MONTH LATER Unfortunately it's non existent; I did email the restaurant the very next day and expecting some sort of response or at least an acknowledgement/apology (and of course they're aware of their reviews) but  I have heard absolutely NOTHING.  Taking into account the disappointing lack of response, obviously this is their modus operandi (THE WAY THEY ROLL)
