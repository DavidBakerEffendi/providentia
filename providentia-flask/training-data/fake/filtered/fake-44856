Horrible Manager !!! That is all I can say. Walked in and place was empty and this manager ( Marcus).. I believe his name was gave us such snooty attitude. I will never go back. He acted as if he had no tables but he had a whole opened back section bit would not seat us there !!! It was past 6 pm and he said it was not opened yet?! We waited a few minutes by bar and left before he could give us anymore nasty eye contact. I will never go back
