I used to be more of a  Newark-er not to long ago and actually lived on 25 Halsey right above 27 Mix, the owners are great people always tentative of guests, making sure that everyone is looked after, and as happy as possible. i enjoy the outdoor area in the warmer time of year, but when the moment suits me i can grab a smoke outside without having to park my drink somewhere out of sight.  drinks are always reasonable, and the food is always some creative fair. I will being going back in the future when ever possible, and always recommend this place to anyone who is venturing downtown. I must admit that i haven't been there is at least six months, but see the menu has changed again, so no better time then this weekend. i will update post after i make a trip.
