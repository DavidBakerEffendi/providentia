I traveled to brooklyn to get a way for the city with my family and we passed by the Good Fork. The ambience was pleasant, lots of families, and very nce modern interior design. The menu is quite massive and I had a hard time choosing my entre. I decided to go with the gnocchi and convinced my wife to get the duck (just so that i could have a bite or two as well). The only thing keeping me from 5 stars was the bathroom. It was kind of dirty (paper towels on the floor, sink kind of nasty) but other than that it was a great restaurant, kind staff, and good family fun. 4/5 guys, congrats!
