I was very excited to find Coco's again for our work Happy Hour.  The Bartender Heather was very friendly and welcoming.  I also talked to the manager planning for a week ahead of time who guaranteed a nice experience.  The prices were not comparable to the area's Happy Hours, that I have been to and the drink prices were changing every time we ordered, when I questioned this the answer was the .35 or .50 cents charges were for taxes...what!!! Most places in the area do have pleasant wait staff and Happy Hour prices run from $4.00 wine, $3.00 domestic, $5.00 drinks.  Not a very Happy Hour!!  I would have tacked on another star if the wait staff were friendly but they were not.
