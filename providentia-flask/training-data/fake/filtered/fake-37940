just came back from new york. we stayed nearby. we were looking to have a drink near our apartment and happened upon this great little place. we enjoyed ourselves so much we ended up staying for dinner, which was great! the staff were also great. one very helpful woman ended up jotting down 5 places we might be able to find a bottle of wine we loved at the restaurant. we searched all over new york and finally found it at one of the places she had written on the list. ended up in the restaurant 3 times during our week in the city. will go back for sure.
