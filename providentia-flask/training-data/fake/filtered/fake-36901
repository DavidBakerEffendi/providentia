I just went to a wedding here, we were let in a half hour later than scheduled.  I got the distinct feeling we were in the waitstaff's way anytime I tried to use the bathroom, they watched and waited for us to leave so they could pounce on the tables.  I felt like a burden and a nuisance just for being there.  The food was okay, but it's too small for a wedding and the service was horrible. I felt bad for the bride and groom for wasting their money. Go there for a modern Italian American meal (it's not traditional) if you like that, but for the love of all that's holy, don't throw a wedding reception there.
