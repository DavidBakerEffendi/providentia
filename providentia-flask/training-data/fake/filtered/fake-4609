My first time having this type of food and it was pretty good.  Great ambiance and the retractable ceiling gives a nice flare.  Really nice environment.  I went with a group of 8 people and the price for the amount of food we got was NOT worth it.  A couple drinks with appetizers, entrees, dessert and sangria came up to be $1,000!!!.  They have this weird policy where you have to order family sized food for at least $65 dollars depending on the size you want which I don't understand.  Why can't we just order individually  off the regular menu so everyone gets what they prefer to eat?  If it's just a few people (2-4) then i definitely recommend it but DO NOT GO otherwise.
