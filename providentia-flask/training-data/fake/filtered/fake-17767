The pizza and appetizers were unmemorable and the environment a bit like an upscale sportsbar but when we were told to leave our table as others were waiting (though we had not lingered, had already paid, and were finishing our drinks) we all decided never to return. Seriously? What restaurant does that? It's inexcusable to value turnover more than people, particularly when the food is not worthy.
