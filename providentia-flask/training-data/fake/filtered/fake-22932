I moved in just around the corner and was so happy to discover after trying Cent Anni for the first time that their daily homemade pasta is delicious. I've been back three times now and have tried a different dish each time. I highly recommend any of the pastas, but especially the rigatoni with any vegetable as a side. The staff is always friendly (they invited us for Thanksgiving dinner when they found out we had no where to go) and the atmosphere is laid-back and romantic. Easily my favorite restaurant in the neighborhood.
