BAD BAD ATTITUDE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I decided to go order a take out meal by phone, I ask if Pork Chops was on the menu and I was told no. When I arrived to pick up my  meal I saw Pork Chops listed on the board.  I asked a young lady who I believe was the manager if  the writing on the board was correct.(fried/smothered pork chops)  OMG!! The answer that I received was unbelievable!!!!!!!!!! I paid for my order and left before the police would be called and someone would see on the Channel 7 News!!  I will never go back Amy Ruth's again. The new management?? Unprofessional!!!!!!!!!!
