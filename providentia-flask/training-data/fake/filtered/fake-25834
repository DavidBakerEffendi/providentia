Finally a real Greek Souvlaki place in New York!!!!!!!! I am Greek and I have tried several Greek restaurants offering souvlaki. Some of them, they are not even closed offering their so- called Greek souvlaki. In Stix all the food was real Greek food. I do not know what to say about the tztziki, it was same or even Â better than the one I make at home, their souvlaki the best in town (all kinds), the meat balls and their sweets just amazing!!! I know that they have a few weeks of operation, I am wishing them good luck and keep the same food standards. We will recommded this place to all our friends and younger people of our family. Just a little note, the service needs to be a little quicker but that does not change my opinion about the Stix
