What a disappointment. Grew up in area, always loved Lui lui's so took family. Rolls were both stale & over baked. His pasta was supposed to be in a marsala wine sauce, but had no marsala & was generally lacking in ingredients for almost $15. My pasta was supposed to be in a spicy broth but was bland & also had almost no ingredients besides pasta. The "house" dressing was bottled italien. $55 later we both left very disgruntled & unsatisfied. Ambience doesn't justify high prices for terrible food. The only highlight was the sweet girl who waited on us.
