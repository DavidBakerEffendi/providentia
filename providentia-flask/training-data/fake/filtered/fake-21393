A wine bar is a place to go to have a glass of wine-not water. If you are going to drink water, choose a different place other than Heidi's. It is a small, cozy neighborhood place like Cheers but much smaller. I love the place and adore Heidi and her husband Ed. They did all the work themselves. The location use to be a dry cleaner and it is unreal what a wonderful comfortable place they created. The cuisine has the same personality as the place itself. Delicious dishes that are warm and comforting like the mac and cheese, the paella-every dish is sensational. I have met many new friends hanging out there. This is just what the Upper East Side needed. An intelligent couple finally created a place we were all looking for but did not know we could find. Accolades to Heidi and Ed!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!.
