This is my new favorite restaurant! flower crowns and straw hats?! yes please.  The potato and mushroom dumplings were fantastic.  My meal was the mushroom stroganoff and it was amazing.  Hubby got the the beef stroganoff which was just as awesome! we topped off the meal with the cherry dumplings- so delicious! Will return to this place asap!!!!
