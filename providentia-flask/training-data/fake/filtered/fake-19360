My husband and I recently moved to Vermont from RI.  We have been vegetarians for over 30 years.  The meals that each of us had at Revolution Kitchen was the best vegetarian restaurant meal that either of us had had anywhere in the US.   The food is gourmet with flavors that are unique and absolutely incredible!!   Amazingly, this is the only true vegetarian restaurant in Burlington.  I cannot give enough praise for the wonderful meals.   Janet
