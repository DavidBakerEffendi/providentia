I envision a perfect meal somewhat like this: warm, ambient lighting as soon as you walk in. Upon sitting down at the cozy yet spacious table, delicious bread and wine mysteriously appear out of nowhere! Appetizers wow you, especially the savory cheesecake, Mac & cheese, and array of salads, and give you pause to wonder what the main course has in store. Entrees far from disappoint, but cause exclamations from all parts of the table at the creativity, flavor, and exquisiteness of the variety of dishes. Most notable is the pork chop - take my word on it. Although stuffed to the brim, dessert is a must, and the myriad warm, cool, fruity, and sweet delicacies tantalize your tastebuds. Â After dinner, cocktails punctuate the gastronomical success of the evening. Their Aviation is an exceptional retro favorite, and the bartender knows just the right amount of maraschino to add. I've considered a move to Brooklyn Heights just to be closer to this place.
