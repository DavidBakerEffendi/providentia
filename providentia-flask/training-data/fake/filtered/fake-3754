Went to this new restaurant twice and was extremely impressed with the service and food. I met the owner Bill and he was extremely customer oriented,and made me feel at home. Props to the chef and waitress for giving me such great food and service. I will definitely recommend this restaurant to others, and will continue to frequent it- Chris- Florham Park
