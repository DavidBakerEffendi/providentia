Ok here's the deal: The drinks are fine. The food is actually REALLY good. The service is not amazing but in this location... I am fine with it. Definitely a higher quality than other neighborhood options. Hate the tv, kind of sometimes hate the music. Like the atmosphere unless its busy... Then it's way gross.
