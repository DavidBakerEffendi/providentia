My boyfriend and I stopped by here last thursday night. We were looking for a new local watering hole. We asked the bartender what her favorite cocktail was and she mentioned the Barnyard dance....WOW. Spicy and delicious! We asked her for a follow up drink to that which my boyfriend and I thought how can another drink top that!  She indeed recommended another great drink... Green eggs and hash, certainly not with a power punch kick, but flavorful with a tang. It doesn't end there. She mentioned the charcuterie plates where on happy hour. My boyfriend and I said why stop there and let her pick out some cheeses for us. Again, all the cheese she picked out were amazingly paired. She gave us great descriptions of them upon serving. Then to top it off. $1 oysters!! Here's the catch, you have to order them by the half dozen or a dozen. The bartender said we can start with half a dozen and if we enjoyed them we can always order another half dozen. We went ahead and ordered a half dozen. Superb. She mentioned they were local from long island. My boyfriend and I did not pick out a single thing for ourselves. We were so happy to have a bartender with such great taste. Our whole experience was great due to letting go of expectations.  We will return!
