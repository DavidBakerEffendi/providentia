Before show at St.George theatre, I went to Enoteca for dinner because my sister is from staten island, and she likes very much.  I had reservation, and there was no problem.   The restaurant looks very like home with brick walls and a warmth that comes from family cooking your food.  The voices and music were very loud, but it was not unlike my home growing up so I did not mind.  It was different experience from other restaurants that are more reserve and quiet, but I enjoy the atmosphere and it was fun to watch and listen. My food was delicious.  we came for a light meal, so I had mussels and they were perfect with so much flavor and they were very clean.  The salad was also excellent.  We share cookies and espresso and went to the show.  The show in the restaurant was better than the show we see.  It was a good time, and I want to come back.  Only thing that was not so good was waitress was a little rude and seemed stressed out by busy.  She was annoyed at something and was not happy, but she served us on time for the show.   I am going back with my sister soon.  She goes all the time, and insist on going there when I visit her next.  It was fun, and I recommend.
