I was really looking forward to coming here, and the place has alot of potential to be AWESOME. HOWEVER---- the service was TERRIBLE the waitress literally barely came to our table even after i asked for a drink menu i waited for a good 15 minutes before i had to ask her for a drink. When we got our food mine was COLD.. i'm not talking a little bit on the warm side i mean literally cold- the bottom inside of the mashed potatoes was slightly warm. i could NOT get out of there fast enough and we ended up having to go somewhere else for food. I spent $20 at a nearby restaurant the night before and the food was exceptional compared to the $40 dollar freezing cold meal i had here. i will not be going back ever.
