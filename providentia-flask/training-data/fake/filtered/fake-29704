I love sliders. More than I can possibly say. Naturally I gravitated here when I started my job in an office nearby and YIKES it's good. I was there with some new friends and it was a great time. Daisy is fantastic, so treat her fantastically, as she will efficiently serve you fantastic sliders. I was told to try the sweet potato fries, which I most definitely will next time I go. That bacon shake is something I'd rather watch someone drink than drink myself. I hope they get those t-shirts back on sale...
