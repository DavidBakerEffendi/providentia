I went there because of a close friend recommendation and I couldn't be more pleased, not only for the freshness of the food, but also for the great service. I couldn't catch the name of our waiter, but he and his manager were very attentive. We also tried "masala tea", something new for us, and perfect for the freezing night we stepped in there. Just make sure you order your food mild or very little spicy if your stomach can't take it. I just read another review below, and I couldn't stop myself from laughing by bringing up some funny memories from the past. Many years ago I went to a fancy Indian restaurant in Manhattan to celebrate a friend's b-day. As soon as I finished the entree, I started sweating excessively, and ended up sick all night. Believe me! ...it's nothing to do with the food since no one in a table of 10 got sick. I always had sensitive stomach and grew up eating food with minimum or no spices and condiments. If you are like me, make sure you order very mild or no spicy at all. Please note that this type of veggie fresh food is very healthy and a great place to bring family and friends over. Two thumbs up!
