Historically I have not been a big fan of Thai food but without a doubt this is the best Thai food in New Haven. The Steak salad is a savory beef prelude to any number of the ecclectic (yet delicious) main dishes. We eat there at least once a month and we always enjoy our service and are always satisfied with our food.
