I am not one of these people who watch those Bravo shows about food or unhappy Housewives, I don't Blog or really take peoples opinions as the end all. I pretty much grew up with generic home cooked meals, but after hearing about this place from a coworker I am ready to experiment. This place was awesome, good drinks, good food and really super nice staff. I am always the first one to arrive and my friends were about 30 min late. The Host/esses were all very nice and understanding about my  friends being late. I sat at the bar and had the Morini brand beer and waited for my friends while watching reality TV in real time - this place had  a buzz and was exciting. My friends arrived and we were taken to a table shortly after speaking with the Host. Our waitress was very nice  and offered some suggestions. This is not your typical Italian food - it's better. I have to say everything was good. The staff was really welcoming and attentive, and we even got goodbyes and thank you from the staff as we were leaving  and walking out the door. I would definitely come back.
