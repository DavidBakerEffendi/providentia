Worst food and not worth the money.. Have been a regular customer to Anjappar in Northbrunswick, NJ. Â I have ordered pickups...their vanjaram fish fry sucks no salt no spice looks like a old stock fish sitting in the fridge and delivered to you..Their chicken briyani smells like made from stale food...not once or twice almost more than 3 times i have tried their chicken briyani every time I buy i had to throw it off...Anjappar is awesome in bangalore.but here I wouldnt suggest anyone to try here..
