honestly think this place might have the best Italian food in Astoria. There are so many wonderful, authentic choices and great, well-executed sauces. I mean, they know what they're doing. They also have this amazing appetizer on the menu - I think it's called an Italian spring roll - that we order every single time because it's that good. The wait staff are warm and attentive but never intrusive, and everything is delicious.
