This is hands down the best Mexican restaurant in Philadelphia, maybe the world. I won't tell you what I ordered or what you should get because the answer is: everything & anything. The cocktail list is fresh, tasty, and imaginative. And the michelada is the best in the city. Even if you have to save it for a special occasion, Xochitl is a must try.
