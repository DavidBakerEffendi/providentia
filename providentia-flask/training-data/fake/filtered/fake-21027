Ate brunch at Kanella today, the first time we have been there.  It really was a relaxing fun experience.  The service from Bill was great, just enough with out being patronizing.  We put him on the spot and basically made him order, everything was great, the rabbit soup with Fava beans was fantastic----wish I could get the recipe out of the vault.  We will return again, with a hearty appetite for really good food.
