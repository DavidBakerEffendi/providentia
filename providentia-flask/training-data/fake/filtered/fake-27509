One of the few authentic Italian restaurant left in Bensonhurst.  The pizza is ok but all the pastas are out of this world.  I would recommend their ice/ice cream to everyone.   If you are a pistachio fan, L&B is the place.   The only thing is the outside dinning area especially on the back are kind of dirty.  Pigeons are dinning with you at the same time.  Hope they can fix this problem.
