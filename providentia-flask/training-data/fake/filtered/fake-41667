Wonderful place. Definitely malleable as far as how casual to formal it can be! Food is good. Definitely on the healthier side. Like they don't drown their food in sauces etc (unless that is the kind of dish you opt to get) happy hour is freaking awesome too. Just be ready to spend at least $50ish for dinner for two. Not like Applebee's or Fridays or something.
