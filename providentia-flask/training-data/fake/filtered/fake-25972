I have lived in this area my whole life and have settled on Wazu several times and always regretted it. They have cleanliness issues and bugs are always buzzing around you while eating. The sandwiches are only ok at best and you are charged a premium for everything here by the guy who runs the show. I would not be sad to see it go.
