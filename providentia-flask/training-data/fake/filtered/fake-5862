OK, so there are already 3 reviews on Yelp for Kingston's new Sushi Palace, but you know, ordinarily I am "suspicious" of on-line reviews... I have found some of them are "planted".  Indeed, that may be good reviews, or bad reviews.  Whatever, try to trust my review, or just go see for yourself. Sushi Palace has been open ~4 weeks now.  It's in the 'plain' so-called "Kingston Mall" (what you & I would call a 'shopping center'), same as PA Dutch Farmer's Market.  Here's the deal... it's damn good!  The ambiance is nicely done, the fish is fresh and all the sushi is made to order.  I've spent 2X what Sushi Palace charges to get sushi as good!  (BTW: owner is one of the sushi chefs.)  Our waiter (Jason) recommended a few things, which we found _superlative_ "Kani" salad & "Pink Lady" sushi, in particular.  We also had a variety of other sushi - all good!  On top of all this, they have Japanese ice cream flavors, eg, red bean & green tea.  Disclaimer: I didn't try any of the cooked meals... I have no reason to suspect the cooked food was not very good too, but to be clear, all I ate was the sushi, and it certainly was really good... damn good!  See other Yelp reviews for more info (which I will not bother to repeat), but note that web site listed in one of the Yelp reviews, is incorrect.  So, excellent food, and rather good value.  Two adults ate well, leaving a 20% tip... the total with tax still less than $50.  5-stars for sure!
