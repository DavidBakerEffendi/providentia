Nam Phuong is a stellar joint to check out if you like authentic Vietnamese food.  It stands out as one of the best in a neighborhood loaded with top quality Asian and Italian cuisine.  One block from the Italian market on 11th street, this spacious restaurant offers an extensive menu packed with enough to keep the adventurous foodies coming back.  I frequent this restaurant and I'm never dissapointed.  One of my favorites is the needle noodle soup and recently I've enjoyed the beef salad appetizer (raw beef and lettuce marinated in lime and spices) which was surprising.  It has all the elements, sweet, sour and salty goodness.  Check it out.   They also serve liquor and beer.
