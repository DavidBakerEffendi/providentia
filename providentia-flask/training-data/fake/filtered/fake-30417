Pleasantly surprised by a lovely meal at the Kitchen Table, a restaurant below my radar until this past Saturday. The service was a bit slow but very friendly as others have mentioned. We enjoyed everything about the meal, from the interesting and cozy dining room, to my two perfect quail stuffed with chestnuts and cranberries, plump and tasty mussels in a fennel-infused broth, the basket of substantial breads and flavored butters, and the fireplace. Lots of local and regionally sourced ingredients and many sustainably farmed elements as well, prepared without precipitating any flashbacks (for me, at least) of the many back-to-the-land hippie juice poured over stuffed zucchini disasters I remember from the 70's.
