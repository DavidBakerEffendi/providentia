I have eaten here plenty of times and each time the meals are delicious. If you are a fan of good brunch spots, this is where they really shine. Go there early on a Sunday afternoon and you can easily spend 2-3 hours just indulge in fresh fruits and pastries. Service is top-notch. There can be a wait sometimes on Sundays, but it is well worth it.
