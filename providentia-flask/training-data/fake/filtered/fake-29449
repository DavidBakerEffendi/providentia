You can't go wrong with this Staten Island staple. The ample menu sports a delicious array of Tex-Mex specialties, from carne asada, burritos, chimichangas, diablo chicken and then some. Appetizers such as the Hot Shots keep you wanting more. The beer list is far and away the best on the island. 100s of international and domestic beers. Even the seasoned beer afficionado will be greeted with a new brew. Stop reading this review. Go there... now. Go on. Scoot.
