Decent food but overpriced. If you care only about the quality of the food, then this restaurant is perfectly fine. What is hard to ignore is the service. It seems like every time I come here, the service gets worse and worse. I thoroughly enjoyed my first couple of times at the restaurant (especially the Sunday brunch), but I stopped eating here because of the service. When I am eating the brunch around 30 minutes before closing time, the chef came out of the kitchen and informed us that they were closing, and that we should pay and leave. The man at the desk glared at us and shot us nasty looks while we were eating. Everyone working there expressed that we should be leaving even though there was half an hour left to the brunch. There are many other instances of horrible service, but this one is clearest in my mind.
