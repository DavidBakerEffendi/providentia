The wait was the only negative part of this experience, and only because the tantalizing scent of biscuits covered in butter wafted out and tortured us as we sat on a bench directly outside the door. We only had to wait for about half an hour, which we don't normally consider doing in NYC (so many different places to choose from!), but we thought we'd give Pies 'n' Thighs a chance. Once seated, in the back room, service was quick! We had drinks after a minute or two, and ordered our food within five minutes. And the food arrived after about ten minutes! And was absolutely delicious. I had a chicken box, with fries (you get to choose which side you want). One of the very best fried chicken pieces I have ever had! And I've had real southern fried chicken down in Arkansas, Oklahoma & Kansas. Mmm! I'm definitely going to have to go back for more!!
