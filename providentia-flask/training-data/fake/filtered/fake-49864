When I was a little girl my mother would buy us sandwhiches from DeFonte's.  This is a very found memory for me. She has passed on, but I remember how excited I would be to when she would put in front of us the familar sandwich with Boston Creme pie.  We would buy Manhattan Special, which they do not sell anymore.  I want to go back and enjoy the food.  I am happy that you are still there.
