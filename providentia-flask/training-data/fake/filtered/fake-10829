I was very excited when I found out about this restaurant. But I have to say, it really is such a disappointment. It tastes way too much garlicky. It's nowhere near as good as The Boiling Crab. The fact that it's cash only really turns me off because you can easily spend over $50 here and it just doesnt make any sense.
