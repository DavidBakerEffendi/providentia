Ok, so i heard great things about this place. My girlfriend and i went around 5:00 and were the only ones there. Ambiance was fine, everything looked alright, and we ordered numerous rolls and a seaweed salad. The seaweed salad was perhaps one of the best i have ever had, and then the sushi came out. Everything was presented nicely, and upon first bites i was impressed. Until, a silver bug came crawling out of my wasabi and ginger. I was grossed out, but I understand as it was humid this particular day. I told our server who promptly used his BARE hand to dig the bastard out, and then told us "I have never seen that kind of bug before" and he left the sushi on the table. We each took one more bite and thena Â moth came out of our soy sauce and I refused to eat any more. He brough us our bill, and NOTHING had been taken off the bill. I do not reccommend this to anyone.
