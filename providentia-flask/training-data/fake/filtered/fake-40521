My fiancé and I love this place. This is the best place to go on a Saturday night, as well as any night. The live signing is an added bonus!  The food is great and atmosphere is warm and inviting. It is romantic for lovers and nice for families. I had things here from my private engagement party upstairs, to my 40th birthday party in the main dining room, as well as dinners many times. Antonio never once let us down. If he is not in the front making everyone feel like they are that special person he was waiting to see again, he is in the back either preparing the food or making sure it is perfect!  My step-son loves the fact that Dave, the bartender, always remembers him.  The last time we were there was Christmas Eve, and as usual.....it was fantastic.
