Must have been amateur week in Chelsea last evening. the 1st of 2 restaurants with indifferent , bored hots/hostesses. when we asked for a table for 3, we were met with an indifferent shrug, and told ' maybe in 45 minutes' . i see more hospitality from the homeless. Any place that doesn't appear to care. is a place i prefer not to eat at. I always feel that the professionalism of the front of the house is a reflection of the ownership and chef. Until they trade the kids looking to find themselves for people who care - pick some where else to dine
