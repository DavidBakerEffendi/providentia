I work in Harford and get to "The Steam" frequently for lunch. The beers are excellent, Naughty Nurse is a winner. I have tried many things on the menu and like most restuarnts there are hits and misses. The hits far out number the misses for sure. The service and consideration of the staff is excellent. I have seen first hand the caring and attention given to satisfying the customers. Beer and homemade rootbeer excellent. They are ambitious and creative with the menu and come up with some serious flavors and combinations of sauces and spicing. I think they can be $1.00 or $2.00 cheaper, but the prices are consistent with downtown. No chili on the menu or on the nacho's! (small flaw) The portions are solid. The Steam is relaxed and casual. Is it fine dining? No. But Â for Brew pub it's pretty darn good!
