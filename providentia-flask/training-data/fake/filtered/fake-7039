We went to Verita the first time the other night and will be returning as soon as possible!  I noticed that many reviews complained about the long wait to get in, so we utilized our ability to call ahead and put our names in.  We were seated 10 minutes prior to our arrival.   Now I'll be up front, this place gets busy.  As a former worker in the foodservice industry I find it commendable that the service was as comprehensive as it was, being that our server seemed to have a large party along with a couple other tables besides our own.  That being said, our service was never compromised.   On to the pizzas.  We sat very close to the kitchen, so could see most of what was going on around the pizza chefs.  The quartet of cooks in the pizza kitchen consisted of someone pushing dough, another topping pies, one cooking the pies, and an expediter the garnish and cut the pies and send them on their way.  A pretty good system.  The cooks do not stop!  After each round of pizzas in the oven were on plates, the next round was going in.  That being said, our pizza took a while to reach us, which our server explained to us may happen being that the restaurant was very busy.   When the pizzas arrived, still piping hot, they were cut into smaller slices by our request so that everyone at the table could taste the many different pizzas we had ordered.  Each pie was phenomenal, with its own unique combination of flavors, but still remaining true to their Neapolitan roots.  Delicious. If you're looking for a typical pizzeria that's going to let you make your own pie or have monster pizzas by the slice, you might want to call leonardo's or one of the other 50 pizzerias in town that hover around mediocre.  But if you're looking for a delicious and refreshing pizza experience (the best in town), look no further than Pizzeria Verita.
