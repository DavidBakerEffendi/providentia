I had original Ippudo Ramen in Japan and I was very excited about the NY location. After waiting on a line, we finally got a seat (we had to share a table) Interior design was superb, very clean & modern atmosphere. I ordered Akamaru Modern ramen, it was OK but little bit greasy and it did not tasted same as one in Japan. But my friend's Shoyu Ramen was good. Other thing was it was little pricy for ramen and toppings were extra, plus appetizer came out to much more money than we thought. But I'll definitely come back to try other ramen.
