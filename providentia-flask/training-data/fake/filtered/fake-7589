i cross this cafe few times, but i even go in... until today. Each time i corss there, i talk myself that I must be try once! today, i eat breakfast with my gf. we order Euro breakfast, the savory crep with egg and smoke salmon/ Panini signature with prosciutto parma with mozzarella, tomato and basil pesto. Those taste excellence and full of stuff, also the drink is good too! Especially is the hot chocolate, not too sweet, strong coco taste and smooth. (even i m not a coffee man) I can said the Cappuccino taste better then Starbxxks a lot!! xd... Overall, thats the best cafe in Bensonhurst.
