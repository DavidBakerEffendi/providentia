So I discovered this little place just after they opened a few months ago.  The food is just sensational.  Turco has excellent turkish cuisine coupled with clean and modern interiors.  I normally get their vegetarian platter because I like their baba ganoush, hummus, and bean combination.   Staff is sweet, friendly and especially hardworking.  I hope this little place does well - it's my favorite Mediterranean food in hell's kitchen.   Austen
