If you are looking for the best Indian Food in Philadelphia you MUST try Karma!  It is a perfect blend of atmosphere, food and great service.  My husband and I LOVE Indian food, so we have tried a lot a Indian restaurants around the city, but Karma without a doubt is the BEST.  Their Naan is so soft and delicious, and I especially love the Paneer Tikka Butter Masala.  If you are new to Indian food, or are not sure if you like it then you have to try the Karma lunch buffet.  They have a huge selection of food, this way you can ease yourself into various types of Indian cuisine and decide what you like.  But I have a feeling once you try the food you will love it!!  They have great cocktails and various Indian beers that I really like.  We will go back again and again
