In terms of ambience, I don't know if I've ever been to a place as purely caucasion as Marlow & Sons. It's kind of New Englandy pale & tight. Not that there's anything wrong with that. I'm just saying this because it's just kind of fabricated & fascinating, like going to a facsimile of a waspy alien planet. I've had supper here only once. The food & drink was completely excellent from beginning to end, and therefore the five stars in spite of... The Humanity. Oh, God the Humanity. You know when you meet someone and you have a very deep feeling that that person is completely incapable of feeling real joy? It's just a matter of neurological engineering or perhaps a cultural perversity? Well, the room was kind of like that person's family reunion. Also, the waitress was kind of annoying. Normally, such a restaurant for me wouldn't get five stars. This a a testament to the quality of the food. Strictly.
