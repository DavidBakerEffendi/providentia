Michael's Riverside is an outstanding dining experience.  Newly redecorated and expanded, it is a great place to have your family party, or a relaxing meal with friends. The entrees are an epicurian delight, and the service incomparable. We had our daughter's wedding here four years ago and our friends & family still compliment us on what a great wedding it was.The most unforgettable part of your dinner here is the friendly exuberance of the owner, Michael.  He greets everybody at the door, and remembers everybody's  name.  He and his wife Marilyn make everyone feel at home.
