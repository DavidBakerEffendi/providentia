I was psyched when this space finally reopened and even more so that it became an Argentine steak house. Having spent a lot of time in Buenos Aires, my favorite places to eat there remind me much of this restaurant. The meat is very authentic and delicious and the ambience is nice but straight forward and NOT in competition with the hipper restaurants of Cobble Hill. I hope this is not its downfall. Reasonably priced, lovely help and my new favorite spot.
