The food may be good, but the labor relations are sour.  Owner/manager, refuses to pay a former employee $600 for work performed last year.  This is a serious violation of labor law and NJ State law.  Please don't eat at Nunzio's until the owner pays his workers what he owes them.  Call Nunzio's and let them know that workers' rights are just as important to you as good customer service.  732-750-0990
