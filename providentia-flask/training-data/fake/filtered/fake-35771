The beet salad with burrata was fresh and such a great combination of flavor and food.  The filet was juicy, tender and cooked and seasoned to perfection.   My date had the salmon and it was so flavorful and filling.  Most restaurants over or under cook salmon, this place gets it right.   Great atmosphere and lighting, absolutely delicious food. Will be returning for another steak soon.
