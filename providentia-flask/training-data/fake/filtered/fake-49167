I was walking with my girlfriend and her parents and we passed by this miracle of a sandwich shop. My girlfriend and her family are from Naples. I however was born in NY.  This was the only place that satisfied a true italian.!!!! The food is remarkable to say the least. I have never  had a better meal in my life.. This is an absolute must!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    Please RUN and do not walk.. The owners are as  fantastic as the food... The greatest eating experience I have ever had... Thank you Carmelo and Antonella Massimo
