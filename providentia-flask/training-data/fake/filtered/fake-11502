The food is great, the drinks are strong, and the karaoke is a blast! A descent selection of English songs, but still a great time.  Haven't used the dining area yet, but the karaoke rooms are great!  They have big leather couches, even the small rooms are very spacious, and each room comes with a private bathroom which is so convenient, perfect for a party! The staff is very nice, the waitresses are fast.  The first time we went, one of the microphones was having an issue, the manager came in immediately to fix it.  The key to this place is the customer service, the stylish rooms, and the speed at which drinks and food comes out.  They are very attentive of their guests' needs. The price is also very good, but tricky to understand.  Basically you rent the room for a flat rate per hour, but that rate is like a credit that goes towards your tab.  So for instance we did a small room for $38 per hour, that $38 is like a piggy bank of money that you spend on food and drinks every hour.  You can always order more of course, I only explain this concept here, because the first time I went I had no idea what the young lady was talking about, so I hope this helps others! The other thing I have to say which is amazing, this place has a lot of hours of operation.  The karaoke rooms are open from 4pm--3am!  Also of course, right next to the building is 9th and Race Chinatown Parking which is super cheap.  Makes a great combination to sing for a few hours with friends, and you only have to walk a little ways from the parking garage to the store front.
