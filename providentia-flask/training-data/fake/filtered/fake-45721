Went there with friends for the first time on 12/21/2012. we had a 8:15 reservation. Atomshpere Â was nice entire staff was friendly and informative. The waiter gets two thumbs up he was very helpful and knowledgable. The food was great! I think my onky complaint was that it took a long period of time for the main course to be served and my duck frites were to salty... The cheese selection was great along with the condiments...We will defintely go back...well worth the drive from southern New Jersey.
