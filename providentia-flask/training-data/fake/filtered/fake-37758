We were really looking forward to coming here. The reviews have been amazing. Unfortunately our experience was not very good. Despite the very cozy atmosphere, and great servers, the food was less than good. While the sauces were rich and flavorfull, the lamb in our dishes seemed to have been prior cooked and dumped in the curry.  The lamb was obviously not cooked in the curry, because it had no flavor.  The goat was chewy, and clearly not cooked enough to seperate from the bone, also not flavored. If you dont mind pretty chewy, unflavored meat floating in admitedly delicious curry sauces, you could enjoy the food here.
