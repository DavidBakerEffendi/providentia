I've been coming to Peaches since it was a BYOB establishment and the food and service at that time was awesome! Now the service is crap. The last time I was here a few weeks ago we had a waiter with a poor attitude. He took forever to bring condiments and he said nothing when I mentioned all the flies in the area. Why is there a swarm of flies in the restaurant to begin with? I ordered "The Lewis" dip which is nothing more than spinach dip and it came to the table watery. I sent it back and of course the water was poured off so now the dip was dry and not creamy at all. The swarm of flies got into it and I had the waiter take it back. And the shrimp...so mushy. One would think Peaches is buying the lowest quality of farm raised shrimp possible. This is not the first time I've had gummy mushy shrimp at peaches. This also was an issue with a po boy sandwich I had as well. Word of advice peaches stop having such a high turn over rate in staff and serve better quality food.
