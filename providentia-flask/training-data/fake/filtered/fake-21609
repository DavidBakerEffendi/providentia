I went there last night and enjoyed the perfomance. The guy who played couple of songs with harmonika just blew me away. It was awesome. After the perfomance I spoke with him about techniques to play the instrument and he gave me so many good advices. I might try to learn how to play harmonika based on his perfomance.
