This place was awesome! We arrived and were seated immediately.  The atmosphere was nice there was a patio in the back and the drinks were on point.  The Caesar salad was good but I am not sure what type of greens were used.  The skirt steak was great especially when paired with the Mac & Cheese.  I had the blackened salmon.  It was a bit under seasoned but when eaten with slaw and the plantain it was perfect.  The only complaint I had was that the music was a bit loud.  Even though the music booth was in the front of the restaurant and we were seated in the back, it made it very difficult to hear the person across from me.
