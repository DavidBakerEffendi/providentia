It's a small space so the wait to get in might not be pleasant for you. I'll admit, the presentation is all really great. Especially the diy ice tea! Which is 5 dollars, so I guess it's fine if you're a spender, but I'm on a student budget! Pretty mediocre tho, didn't really meet up to my expectations. The food is as basic as can be and not as flavor filled as other Thai places I've been. Still never bad to try new places though! A one time visit definitely. 3 stars for the cool presentation.
