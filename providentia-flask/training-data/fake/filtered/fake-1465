The beauty of New York is that if you look hard enough, you are able to find a taste of almost anywhere in the world. Cafe Sabarsky is one of my favorite places to go to in NYC. Each time I have gone there, whether it is for a quick coffee and dessert or for treating special people to what is in my opinion an out of this world dining experience, I have always left with nothing less than a smile on my face or the satisfaction to have been able to have shared with someone what I consider to be one of the hidden gems of this city. The atmosphere, the decor, the service, the impeccable attention to detail, are all reasons that keep me coming back when I need a break from the high pace and the "I want it good, I want it cheap and I want it now" attitude that us New Yorkers become accustomed to, and sometimes makes us forget that quality takes time and time is worth money. The desserts are absolutely divine. The coffee is addictive. The food is delicious. The wine is amazing. Cafe Sabarsky is perfectly Austrian, perfectly perfect; and perfection speaks for itself.
