Went to Degustation on a recommendation from a friend (who knew the previous chef)  The restaurant is set so you are basically in the kitchen (like a sushi bar) and a few feet from the chefs as they prepare the meal.  IT could be a very intimate setting and one that lets you appreciate the food being created in front of you. Unfortunately it was anything but this.  The chefs never once made eye contact with us; they never explained the food or seemed pleased that there were customers. It was slow when we got there and they took every effort to avoid us.  That waitress was not pleasant and did not seem to want the patrons to have a good experience either, Upon our arrival,she said we were not on the reservation list (my wife had to show it to her), they openly rolled their eyes when we met friends and talk by our seats for 5 minutes and throughout the meal we had probably 5 different people bring us our meal. One of the servers (a Spanish guy) was actually good.   He took the time to explain during one of our meals (we had the 10 course tasting) that we could eat the entire shrimp that was being served, head and tails; it was delicious. I noticed that our other waitress then served the people next to us and didn't explain anything, they only ate the middle of the shrimp and sadly missed out on a tasty albeit very small offering. It they want to serve food and pretend the customers aren't there, that is fine.. just get a normal restaurant space and work behind closed doors. All they have created was a feeling of to many people in a crowded NYC apartment kitchen hoping to get someone's attention and have triscuit thrown their way.  For a $300+ meal (with wine) for 2 people  I expected more.
