Both spots are great I believe there's one in Park Slope and one in Bay ridge. Both places make great brick oven pizza. Def got my stamp of approval 5 star! all day every day. Margherita pizza is really good at Peppinos you will savor every bite. They even deliver pretty far. So if your in the Ft Greene area and your in the mood for some pizza give these guys a call.
