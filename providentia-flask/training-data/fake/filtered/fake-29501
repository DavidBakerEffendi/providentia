Our group of six ate dinner june 26th. Only one in group did like their food. I had the Obama smothered chicken, collards red beans and rice. It was all good! My first time there and I will go back. The service was good and portions were huge. The appearance of the front door (finger prints and smudges) left something to desire. I would suggest that on down time that the works tidy up the place.
