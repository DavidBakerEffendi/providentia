They offer many traditional fast food dishes; and yes, true to their claim, they offer the same pre-frozen flavorless stuff you can get on the "grease trucks" on Rutgers Campus. Their Fat-Cats: Let me preface this by saying that "Fat Sandwiches" in general are one of the cheapest ways to "get full" on Rutgers Campus.  Usually the perfect filler for often broke students who "don't care" as long as it fills the tank.   Here in Central Jersey, we've seen sampled these sandwiches from dozens of restaurants.  Given the nature of the sandwich, they, rarely run for anything over $7. Mr. G's  uses tasteless cheap Italian rolls (you know the one that stays "fresh forever" but tastes like Styrofoam). ...seriously, the bread almost completely dulls the flavor of the remaining ingredients inside the sandwich.   The burger inside was overcooked and seriously inedibly bland. You could neither taste the beef nor the fat (much like a flip-flop). Seriously guys, step it up.  I've had better burgers at Wendy's.   The fries were okay.  Again, the same frozen stuff you find in all local spots.   Wings:  waaay overpriced at $1 per wing (double what anyone else charges, including Cluck-U)!  Despite the lack of variety in sauce styles, I went ahead an purchased an order to see what the price tag was all about.  I was disappointed by a tray of tiny dry flavorless mini-wings.   If you want the "same old" blandness offered by the cheapest spots in Central J, this place is for you.  They don't even deliver.  So I can simply order the same dishes from just about any Pizza joint in the area.   The hardest/worst part about writing this review is that the cook/staff are clean and fast.  They need to use better ingredients (meat patties, bread, etc.).
