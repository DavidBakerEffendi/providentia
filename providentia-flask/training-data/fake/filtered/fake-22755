The biggest problem with this place is that some dishes are made of unfresh meat, which sometimes made me sick. Service is really bad, yet they would even tell you that they're under-tipped. The weekend dim sums are not recommended any more, because the same unsanitary problem. Actually I'd really like to see they improve on their food and service.
