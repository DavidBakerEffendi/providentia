This place is amazing, but the food can be on the rich side.  I went with my mom and we ordered empanadas, sea food pasta, and the steak envolitine.  Everything was delicious, but when served with surgary wnie cocktails, can be a bit too much for one sitting. I recommend very carefully picking your drink and food pairings and watching out for over ordering, as the portions are sizable. Overall, amazingly delicious!
