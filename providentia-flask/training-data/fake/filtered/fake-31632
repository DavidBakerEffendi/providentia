I recently visited Eco Bean & Juice with a friend for a coffee and ended up walking out with a coffee, a growler of Kombucha, new shampoo, conditioner and a birthday gift to give a friend filled with beauty products! I was thrilled they had all these new and exciting products! Eco Bean & Juice is the best coffee, fresh juice and smoothie place in Burlington, especially knowing everything is organic and all of the great choices. I can't wait to go back!
