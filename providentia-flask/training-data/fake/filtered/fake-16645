Unfortunately worst Turkish food I have ever had. I am Turkish and I needed a take out. I ordered the Adana Kebap, anchovies entree, fried calamari, and grilled octopus. The only thing that was ok was the house bread. That is it. Everything else was pretty bad. Portions way too small. It took a long time for the take out. Â Nice people though:(
