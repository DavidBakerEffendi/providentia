"Very good food, very bad service" - Indeed! Had what amounted to a "Soup Nazi" experience there last night, likely my last visit. The food is good and plentiful for the price, but the abuse is simply not worth it. One owner's loud diatribe on "sniffing jockstraps" capped the evening off nicely! Full agreement with Brian on the tax run around. Unless you enjoy a Walmart style dinning atmosphere I suggest getting takeout.
