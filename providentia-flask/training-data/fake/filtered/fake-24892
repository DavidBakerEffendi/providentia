Through Open Table I requested a table in the main dining area, I was sat by the front door next to the hostess station. It's primarily a seafood place, but since we started with the seafood sampler and then a bowl of clam chowder, I ordered the rib-eye steak as my entree. So blame me for ordering steak at a seafood restaurant but as this is an upscale establishment I assumed they would prepare and present a good cut of beef, I couldn't have been more wrong. The rib-eye was laced with connective tissue, I couldn't cut it or chew it. My dinner companions did enjoy their seafood entree's, but our side order of mushrooms, which we noted to our server were not presented with our entree's were never served even after a follow up inquiry later in the meal. Additionally, as to the service, the timing of our meal was poorly executed with long waits between each course. Max's is a popular restaurant in West Hartford with a lot of energy, but if you are looking for a fine dinner go around the corner to Flemings. I spent three hundred dollars for a seafood sampler, three apps, three entree's, 2 bottles of wine, one desert and one cappacino, with a twenty percent gratuity. I could have done better elsewhere. Would I go back? probably. but I would order seafood. Would i recommend Grants to a friend? No.
