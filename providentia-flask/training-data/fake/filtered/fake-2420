you stupid yelp hipsters. please leave this genuine place alone. I am from sri lanka myself and I know thiru's story. in face his name isn't even thiru. do you know he is from jaffna? bet your hipster ass does know jaffna but doesn't care. it does love to say it knows. lemme guess, you are probably white, asian or abcd and in your 20s you love to say you are international "loooove" "traveling" and eating international cuisine your "fashion" and "lifestyle" is farmer brown plaid shirts, unshaven beard, belgian beers, green vacations where you can milk your own goats or volunteer to teach english at the local school, sustainable meditation, you love the latest bars & recession-era styled bars & restaurants (think dark toned wood, missing / speakasy signs) and your single gear bicycle that you love to show off as if this was the first time humanity has even ridden on any one of those (save that millions of people ride these every day in 3rd world countries and suddenly, because of you only, they are cool). please save this one from your garbage, save it off of yelp. in fact yelp itself claims it knows restaurants when you have 20 something hipster younglings claim they know anything about food. like umm so like cool and stuff - reviewing dumb sloppy joe sandwich places in san francisco (which is where majority of hipster yelpers originated anyway) as if you knew anything about good food. please leave ny dosa alone and remove off of yelp. it will make it live longer.
