It depends on what you are looking for.  If you don't mind sitting shoulder to shoulder with the folks next to you, hearing every tidbit of their conversation and having to talk louder than them to be heard, than you will be fine.  The food is good, but they pack them in without a care for the dining experience.  We took awhile to order, and several waiters came asking if we were ready.  They want you in and out.  Specials were recited without prices (pet peeve).  When we walked in there was someone at the front desk who had his back to us, never turning to acknowledge us.  The hostess appeared and was more welcoming, but informed us we had to wait for our reservation.  This place is popular, so most folks are not worried about the noise or the rush.  It depends on what you are looking for.
