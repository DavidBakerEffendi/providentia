The absolute BEST Turkish food to come along in years!!!  Not only is the place so very clean, the various salads are totally fresh & so delicious!!  Their homemade lavash is what i would order either for sandwich or a go-with, for the salads - the varieties of eggplant salad seem endless, some spicy, some not, and all yummy!!  I had a chance when they first opened to sample many of their hot Mediterrean specialties, like the falafel, Sigara Boregi (phyllo filled with feta & dill), spicy cigars, the zucchini pancakes are out of this world!!  I have yet to try the grilled meats because i am slowly working my way through their entire menu - LOL Oh - also had a chance to try their baklava & again, totally delicious!  If you like Mediterrean food you'll LOVE Turco
