had a party in the wine room! Everything was great until the manager took a shot with the bill. When questioned they reduced the bill by 1k! Saying it was a miss comunication. Who reduces a bill by 1k on a mistake? Owner did not correct the problem and it became a bad experience! Have been there many times will never go back
