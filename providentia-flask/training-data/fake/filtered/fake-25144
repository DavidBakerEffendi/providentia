We went here straight from our flight to Philly last week, and it was a wonderful experience.  The food was delicious - especially the cacio e pepe pasta, the veggie fritto misto, and the trippa.  The Roman comfort food menu was authentic and reminded my husband and me of our food explorations in Rome.  I was concerned about taking my toddler since I'm not from the area, but they were very accomodating, and he enjoyed the food as well.
