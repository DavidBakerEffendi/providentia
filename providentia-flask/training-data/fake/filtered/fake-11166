This place was recommended to me. I was shopping in the area so we (my sister & I) decided to try it. We arrived at 12:45, mid lunch on a Monday. Seating was available both inside & outside. We were seated at one of the small tables near the wall (seating was also available at the bar or outside). Our server took our drink order and explained the ordering process (using markers and the menu). Our food came quickly, the owners were there cooking & managing the kitchen. We ordered pork with parm cream & beef with mushroom gravy (no mixing of meatballs allowed). Since we were first timers we ordered rissoto, spinach, salad, and roasted veg as side orders not knowing that you can top any of these and more with the meatballs & sauce. I already know what I want to order the next time I go, that's when I take the husband & kids. Â Menu is pretty basic, but what they offer is done well. Five types of meatballs, five types of sauces, a good choice of sides/unders (as they call them). Eat the all in a bowl or on a sandwich. Either way, very good & filling for when you need a comfort food meal & don't want to cook for yourself. Oh and don't forget your ice cream sandwich for dessert!
