My wife and I stopped in here during a weekend business related trip to Burlington.  We had stopped at another restaurant and the wait was quite long so we thought we'd try something else.  Sweetwaters is where we ended up and we were very pleased. The wait was about 30-45 minutes on a busy saturday night.  We had a drink at the bar while we waited.  I tried a couple of local beers which were enjoyable. Service was good, and fairly quick/attentive.  We got the gargonzola pear flatbread appetizer and it was EXCELLENT.  I highly recommend it. I got the sesame crusted tuna with peanut noodles.  The tuna was rare and yummy and the spicy sauce was definitely spicy.  Overall, i was happy.  I did not like the peanut noodles side dish though, but i won't complain.  It just seems there could be a better fit side for the tuna. My wife got the mustard crusted salmon and it was very good too. Overall, good food, decent service.  I would recommend it and am giving it 4 stars.
