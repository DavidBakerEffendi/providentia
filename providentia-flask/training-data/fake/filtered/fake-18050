One of my favorite places to get food in the city. I have never been disappointed, and I tend to bring out of towners here often. It's a fun atmosphere, great food, good prices. The service has always been great. The only complaint would be the drinks are a little over priced, but it is center city so what can one expect? Try the blueberry BBQ wings if they are on special, soooo tasty.
