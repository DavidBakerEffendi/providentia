Hands down, my favorite Park Slope haunt.  Fun bar, festive atmosphere, and unfailingly delicious food.  I rarely eat fish, yet at Bogota, I always order it.  They do a blue corn crusted trout occasionally that would knock your socks off.  And I salivate just thinking of the empanadas.  Seriously.  Their food also travels surprisingly well.  We've had many dishes delivered to the south end of the Slope and they've all arrived hot, crisp and perfect.  We've attended a couple of large parties there, which the staff handles beautifully.  And there's a ridiculously hot bartender (female) who makes eating at the bar that much more fabulous.
