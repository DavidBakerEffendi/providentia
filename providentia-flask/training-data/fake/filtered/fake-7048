LOVED this place!  The atmosphere, space and decor of the restaurant gets an A+.  I love the fact that you can sit right at the "kitchen" where they are making the pizzas and the open architecture of the place makes the focal point the beautiful stone oven shipped directly from Italy! The staff at Verita was simply delightful from the woman that seated us to the fabulous waitstaff that attends to your every whim!  They have trained them all well and you can surely see that these folks LOVE their job! The food was absolutely wonderful and enough for two to share!  Salads are incredibly fresh and the way the pizzas were presented leaves you drooling!  Cannot wait to try the Mais Pizza next time!!  Yummy!! The Nutella pie for dessert is to DIE for!!! We plan to make this place "our" place as it is the location we chose for our first date and definitely started out on right foot just due to Pizzeria Verita!! Congrats on following your dreams!!!
