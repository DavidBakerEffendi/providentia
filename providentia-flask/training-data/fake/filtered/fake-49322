From the moment we arrived at this beautiful gem of a restaurant we knew we were in for a treat, not just the meal, but the ambiance.  The owner has perfectly appointed the restaurant with flowers, trees, candles, copper amber lighting, a gorgeous bar, to immediately exude a feeling that you are somewhere other than a street in Manhattan. The staff is very friendly and attentive. Oh and the meal? Superb from start to finish, from the mussels, with broth my husband had to finish to the last drop, to my endive salad with just the right amount of sharp roquefert cheese, to the main courses.   I can't say enough about this wonderful find. I can't wait to return!
