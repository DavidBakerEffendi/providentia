The food lived up to it's reputation and was excellent but the service was sub par for being in such an upscale restaurant. Our waiter was very neglectful and we were sat 45 mins past our reservation time. There are many other restaurants in the Philly area that have just as good as food and consistently good service that I would think twice about spending the money for the Fountain when they can't deliver the entire package.
