I hate that I even have to give a star to this place. It used to be a fav but have found with their growing popularity, they've let things go to turd. It took an hour and 1/2 for mediocre overpriced burgers and soggy fries. The back kitchen door was open the whole time where I had the pleasure of watching a gloveless employee cut vegetables into the rustiest bucket I've ever seen and then transfer them to more "presentable" plastic bowls before carrying them out to the grill. Did I mention they don't have a sink back there? Â Nice.
