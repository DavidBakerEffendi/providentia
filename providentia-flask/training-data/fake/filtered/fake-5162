My husband and I were shopping in the area with our children and we decided to try this cute restaurant.  I had a very nice chicken dish, french onion soup and my kids had the onion soup and french bread. My husband had a fish that I do not remember but he like it.  The food in general was tasty and the service was very good also. A nice place to eat while shopping in Soho.
