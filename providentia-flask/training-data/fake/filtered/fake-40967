Best Pizza I've ever had.  Normally I love to smother the crust of my pizza with ranch dressing to give it a little more pizzazz, but that is completely unnecessary with Lombardis. It is a thin, crunchy crust and delicious.  The San marzano tomato sauce is like heaven.  I always get half ricotta/meatball and half sausage/peppers.  I am obsessed with pizza and this is hands down my favorite!!!
