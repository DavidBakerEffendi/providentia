I came here with my family the other day. I wanted them to get a taste of philadelphia and the culture here since I go to school here.  I was very upset to see that Sabrinas has changed for the worst! The food gave all of us stomach problems. .portions way to large. It is a waste. I noticed the cooks weren't wearing gloves!!!! Also our server was flustered. She had a manager breathing down her neck. I felt really bad for her, the woman had the angriest look on her face! It was unsetteling. We were ready to order for a while with the menus stacked while our server talked to her other tables nonchalantly. NO Wonder the wAIT IS SOOO LONG!  They used to be quick and straight forwars over there. It was an overall annoying experience. Also what is with all of the new faces? I miss being waited on by experienced servers who recognize me. Anyways, I won't be back. I have given sabrinas too many chances.
