I actually had a business lunch here thinking it was something other than a kitschy burger joint (maybe the word Palace made it seem more than it is). For $35 we got a Philly burger (mozzarella, onions and mushrooms) and a grilled chicken breast sandwich with goat cheese and 2 sprigs of watercress. The buns looked Le Bus-ish but were not much larger than White Castle burgers. We ordered sweet potato fries (they were ok) and onion rings which were very flavorful although had too much batter on them. The service was ok. Nothing to complain about but not necessarily worth the trip to University City and parking hassles there.
