Consistantly the best sushi and hibachi I have had.  Always attentative service, fresh quality, nice atmosphere, whether you want a sushi table or hibachi, and the owners will make sure you always enjoy yourself.  I have been going here for years since they opened and always love the quality and presentation they offer. For the $$ rating, it could be $$ or $$$ depending if you go for hibachi or sushi and whether or not you go for their 1/2 price sushi happyhour during selected days.  I find it reasonable for what you get.
