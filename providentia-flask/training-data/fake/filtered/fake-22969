I don't always get the chance to go here because it's such a pain in the hoot to get to- wish I could go more. I have been here many times for the past 5 years. From make up sessions with my Boyfriend, Birthday drinks before the real fun begins, and promotion parties. This place is chill it's just a few things to watch out for in order to enjoy. They don't take reservations for two people. If it's just two of you make sure you get there early, or you will be waiting for a table and the amount of time you wait- people take their time getting up to leave and I don't blame them. If you have a party of three or more, I suggest you call them in advance. They ask you to leave just your name and contact they will reach you in less than 24 hours (they really do). There is one section of Couches (I believe it's only two?) that's when it's a big party ( I would say 6 or more). The other seats are regular tables. The place is very long in length but short in width so it's hard to move! To go to the bathroom (which is in the back downstairs) prepare to put on the blank stare and keep it moving. They will move out your way. Other than that their LYCHEE MARINTIS! For $5 are the reason I always go back and their asparagus seared in sake and garlic (SO GOOD). In the summer I tend to get their summer rolls. Its a good place to chat with friends and chill or to get some drinks before you hit Rivingtons Lounge across the street or Bobs down the block. Get there early and you should be ok. And don't drink 50 martinis because they are strong. They will smack you right in the face and say good morning. So relax drink and enjoy!
