Made a reservation for our anniversary, called in, spoke to someone who confirmed reservation for 2, on Sept. 22 at 8PM, I get there, lights are off and doors closed...no words can describe my anger and how upset I was. The lack of consideration, the lack of customer minded orientation, the lack of care. Please stay away from this place because if they care this little about their customer I can't imagine their food will be any better (or safe).
