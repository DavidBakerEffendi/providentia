Wow! You can't always trust the hype you sometimes come across on Yelp! Of course, a business can be having an off-day when you visit. In our case, we found all the positive responses to be spot on! We flew into Newark a day ahead of a cruise and hired a limo for a four-stop eating tour. Our driver dropped us off and went around the block. We got two orders of the fried dumplings for $2.00 and had them scarfed down while standing on the sidewalk before the limo returned. They were hot, garlicky and delicious! Nice thin skins, crunchy on the bottom. If we didn't have three more stops to make, we would have run in and gotten three more orders!
