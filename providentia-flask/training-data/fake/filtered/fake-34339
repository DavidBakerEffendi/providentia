My review is based upon my attending a wedding at this place: I had high expectations of this place due to glowing reviews from a coworker who had been there.   My experience at this place was less than positive after attending a wedding here during one of the worst rainstorms in March 2010.  The place was very grand and had decor intended to evoke Old World Money.   When I arrived for cocktail hour, there were supposed to have 3 hot stations serving meat and some seafood.  1 station was moving particularly slow so I had to skip it.  There were also servers that were supposed to walk around with Hors d'œuvre, I only saw ONE person walk around with a small tray of food the entire time during cocktail hour!  I was expecting more, but never saw anybody else in the 1.5 hour time span that I was there.  The bar was another issue.  I went to the bar a total of 2X the whole time I was at the wedding and each time I was made to wait for the bartender to fetch some Coca-cola in small quantities. The service and food during the main meal and dessert was OK.  However, right before the meal started, the place lost power and eventually, the bathrooms stopped functioning.  I cannot believe that the place had no generators! The wedding itself was wonderful despite all those setbacks, but if I were the person paying for the reception, I'd be demanding a refund!
