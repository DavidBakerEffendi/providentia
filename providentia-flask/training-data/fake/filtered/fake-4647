looks like it is getting ready to open. The Buzz is that they are getting there coffee from Red House Roasters, a small batch micro-roaster in Union City NJ. The menu, while simple, promises to be made with fresh local ingredients! They will be serving Balthazar bakery breads and pastries as well as serving Boylan's all natural sodas on fountain. This "old school style" coffeehouse will also be promoting local artists and musicians via open mic nights and art displays on their walls.
