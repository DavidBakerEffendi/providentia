The place is a cool and hip. PSYCHE! just kidding. but it is a nice place to be. the ambiance is relax and chill.  I always order the chicken sandwich with blue cheese and franks hot sauce.  With every order you get a house salad.  The sides are rather cheap but AWESOME.  I havent really tried the bar or different drinks, but the few that i had  were good. also the waiting staff there is very polite, courteous and nice.  they always come and check up on you.  atleast the times i have been there.  best time to go is before 5 pm weekdays especially if you want some alone time with your special someone. me and my girlfriend go here about once every 2 weeks. so relaxing. go here and try everything.   i always leave happy. OMG i almost forgot. they have CHEESE FILLED CROUTONS FOR SALADS!!!!! ..... nuff said.
