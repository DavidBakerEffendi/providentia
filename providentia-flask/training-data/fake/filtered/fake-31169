Just love this place!! This is their new place. Hard to believe they came from as he describes a "12x12" older storefront. The owners son was working the day we went in for lunch, so we did not get to meet his mother and his sister. He took our order and told us about his recommendations...he was extremely friendly to us and the food was absolutely delicious. It probably was the best kufta kabob I have had. Also, they deliver, however I live just outside the delivery range...he said no problem, that I just have to ask if they are not to busy at the time I call and they would make a exception! That's what I call taking care of your customers...and building a lasting relationship!!
