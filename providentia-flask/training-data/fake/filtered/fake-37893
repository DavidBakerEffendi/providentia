Went for lunch with a group of 20.  Terrible service.  Wrong orders delivered but very very slow.  Per waiter, the kitchen was stressed and behind and there was little he could do about it.  Somewhat true.  Folks were served long before others.  When advance reservations were made, the Restaurant required that we limit our menu choices to 4 items.  Are you kidding me???  They only have 9 items to begin with.  The Chicken Caeser and Shrimp Salad were terrible and small.  No better than an appetizer or the size of the salad served with some of the lunch meals.  Unacceptable.  Folks enjoyed the burger but waitress stressed that it should be ordered with some pink in it as it was a very lean cut and it would be dry otherwise.  Fine with me, but most folks at the table wanted their burger cooked with no pink.  For the price, the Turkey Club should have real turkey in it...not processed deli meat.  I was appalled.  The dessert menu was not up to date and they couldn't deliver on some of the items as described....of course we weren't told until we attempted to order.  Just sad.  Just shut the place down.  Second time there and no improvement.
