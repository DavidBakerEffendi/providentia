I visited for my birthday with a few friends, they were skeptical about the idea of a southern restaurant, but i'm accustomed to southern food since I attended college in the south. I ordered the red velvet waffles and chicken and it was amazing. I love the atmosphere and the d√©cor, I will definitely be having another birthday dinner here.
