Stopped in with a friend to  grab some lunch on the go, Was so hard to choose because everything looked  so amazing.  We ended up getting a eggplant sandwich , 50/50 meatballs,  Dessert  we grabbed a carrot cake woopie pie , something called crackle, biscotti and couple other assorted things. To sum it all up, it was an amazing and extremely satisfying lunch! Won't think twice to  go again and again and  would recommend it to anyone who enjoys something great when craving Italian or just great desserts!! Continuare il grande lavoro!
