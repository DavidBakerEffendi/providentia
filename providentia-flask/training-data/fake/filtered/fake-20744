Teeny tiny place (and teeny tiny bathroom, but clean) with lovely ambience, but super loud.  My husband and I had trouble hearing each other across the table.  I can't imagine what a larger group would experience.  That said, we had a lovely meal.  Great service from the waitress and the owner (a woman -- which always makes me happy). The bread basket comes with oil & vinegar, which was surprising to me since I think of butter when I think of French restaurants. I had the goat cheese tarte appetizer (served with a small salad on the plate).  It was quite large with a nice crust and a lot of goat cheese.  My husband had the pear and blue cheese appetizer (also served with a small salad on the plate).  His was super delicious! For my main course I had the small portion of the moules mariniere.  I'm glad I had the small, as it was quite a large portion.  I can't imagine what the large must be like.  I was very very disappointed to discover that virtually all the mussels still had their beards.  This is a dish I have had often elsewhere and I can't remember that every being the case.  That said, the broth was lovely. My husband had the cassoulet and enjoyed it very much.  It's quite a heavy dish for summer, but he was very happy with it. For dessert we shared the cheese plate: three cheeses (a soft brie, a semi soft stinky cheese, and a hard waxy cheese) served with soft bread, three slices of apple, and a teaspoon or two of jam.  I did not care for the hard cheese (not enough flavor for me), but the other two were fine. A very nice experience overall.  I would go back.  I strongly recommend making a reservation. FYI: It's BYOB and cash only.
