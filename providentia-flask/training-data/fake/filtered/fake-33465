Definitely my favorite place in the neighborhood. To bad it is always packed. I would go there more often. My thing is to try brunch but when I see amount of people waiting... Our favorite dishes on the menu are the house made ricotta - always so good - and the seared scallops. Drinks are little expensive, but still this place is the best in the neighborhood.
