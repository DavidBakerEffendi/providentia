I have eaten here four or five times as it is in my neighborhood.  The food and service is typically very good at a reasonable price point.  I only knock off one star as they sometimes over-season a dish so as to make it too hot.  To their credit, they have quickly replaced the item when it was brought to their attention.  Other than the rare seasoning misstep, I highly recommend Benares.
