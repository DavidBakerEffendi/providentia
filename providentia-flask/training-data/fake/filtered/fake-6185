June 17, 2011 - Just called to make a reservation for tomorrow night for a party of 4.  I was told that they do not accept reservations if your party is smaller than 8.  I thought that was absolutely ridiculous and that does not say much about the business.  It says to me that they are rude and greedy and only want large tables so they can make more money.  Will never call there or go there and will NEVER recommend anyone to them.  Not a good way to run your business people - open your eyes.
