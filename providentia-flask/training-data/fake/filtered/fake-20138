Gottino is one of my top two or three wine bars in New York City. Gottino specializes in Italian wines and the glass and bottle lists are very well chosen. Service is great.  Very knowledgeable and friendly staff. The food is "small plate" stye and surprisingly good.  (My only complaint is that I usually end up eating too much!) The experience is much better sitting at the bar.  The no reservation policy, tight seating and popularity make Gottino a challenging place to arrive at a prime hour with a group of three or more however.  The best strategy is to arrive early or late and have a nearby "Plan B" (Gonzo on 13th Street for example).
