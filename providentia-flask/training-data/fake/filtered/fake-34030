The food is hit or miss. Sometimes you meal is outstanding and sometimes it's so-so. I got the caramelized salmon one time and it was absolutely delicious! The grilled food is always good, they cook on wood instead of gas. Then another time I got the steak and shrimp salad and the steak was nothing but leftover fat scraps, very disappointing. Don't try to order by phone because you either get a busy signal or it just rings until you get the answering machine. You basically have to go in to order your food. Also, unless you enjoy eating around chaos, take your food home. The waiting/eating area is very small and every time I've been there, it was very noisy and crowded. p.s. Beware of the fellow selling bootleg DVD's...they are also hit or miss. Sometimes they work, sometimes they don't.
