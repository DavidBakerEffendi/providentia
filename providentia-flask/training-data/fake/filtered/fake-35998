Just a hop skip and a jump away from the Morgan Ave stop on the L Train, Roberta's looks like a dive bar surrounded by warehouses. We walked out of the brisk,snowy evening and through two heavy red curtains only to be greeted by a rush of warm air and punk music. We were quickly hurried to a room off of the main dining room, (a large great hall type space with a plethora of long, communal dining tables) and sat adjacent to a wood stove that kept the area toasty. The atmosphere (waiter, aura, menu, etc...) was a bit pretentiously hipster, but the prices (for the pizza at least) were reasonable, and my friend and I were not disappointed in the least with the pizza. We ordered the Millenium Falco, a pie with a perfectly light layer of mozzarella, tomatoes, some sort of delicious sausage, and a smattering of aromatic basil. The crust, additionally, was delicious, with the perfect blend of an outer crisp, and a bit doughier of a center. The beer on tap was a bit pricey, but gave representation to microbrews from across the country (along with the necessary option of a tall boy of Modelo Especial), and although we were unable to partake, the selection of after drinks looked to be quite adequate. I would recommend the pizza at Roberta's (only because I have not tried the slightly more expensive entrees) with enthusiasm, the only qualification being that, to enjoy yourself, you must be able to withstand a fairly inconsequential, but constant, din of pretension and punk rock. I, for one, was sent back to Manhattan sated.
