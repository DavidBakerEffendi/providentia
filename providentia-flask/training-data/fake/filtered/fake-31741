Couldn't believe  how bad the service was .it was a lunch time  so many people were there for their buffet service but that doesn't mean you don't take care of customers who are there for regular menu food ..I have ordered Paani poori..they gave me mixed Paani-extremely tangy and filling was just plain potatoes -no salt -pepper given -when I asked the waiter to give me regular green /spicy Paani rather than the tangy one, he gave me a look , brought the Paani I asked for and said 'here' and left .Tht is the customer service I was provided , extremely disappointed -never going there again..save your self time if you believe in being treated well and want to get better taste and food for the price you paid . worst taste
