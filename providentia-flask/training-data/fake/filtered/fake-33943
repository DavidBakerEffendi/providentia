Never got to try the pizza because the older woman behind the counter was so rude to me that I walked out.  It was my first day in New Haven, I just wanted to get a pizza as take out, and she glared at me like I was some kind of criminal.  She acted like she didn't know what I was talking about as I tried to order, finally flung a menu at me when I asked for one, and never once put down the iPhone she was mumbling into. I don't care how good the pizza is, they don't have to treat you with such contempt if you're coming in to give them your money. Wound up going to Tony and Lucille's Little Italy pizza-by-the-slice section across the street (and down a little), where the people were very very nice and the pizza was still tasty. Most of the locals I have talked to have recommended I stay away from Sally's because the service is so bad, so I'm not sure if I'll ever try to come here again.
