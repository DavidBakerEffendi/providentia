Alright, I read all the glowing reviews and heard this place is supposedly one of the top 10 sandwich shops in the US.  What?  First time I went I had the meatball hoison. Meh at best.  At worst, gave me gastro problems within 30 minutes.  Wrote that one off as a bad day for them.   Went back today and had their "signature" pulled pork bahn mi.  Please.  Tasted more like tuna fish out of a can.  Too much hot pepper spice.  The bread was good I guess.  But again, more gastro problems.  Am done tryong to like this place.
