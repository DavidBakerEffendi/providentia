It was pretty good considering the competition nearby. I had originally planned to take my cousin to Pepe's, but there were 50 people waiting in line to get inside. My little niece was getting hungry so we went to Anastasio's. We weren't expecting really good stuff, but then, their Wooster special pizza surprised us. It was perfect, crunchy seafood and not a lot of cheese on it( I liked that). The other anchovies pizza wasn't that good though. My cousin ended up packing another Wooster street Special to take home with him. Would def go back for that.
