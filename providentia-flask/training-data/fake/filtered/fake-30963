I'm glad I didn't read the reviews before I had my daughters 15th birthday here.  I have to say it was a little pricey but the girls (10) and I thought the food was delicious!  I had called prior to our reservation and asked for a "set" menu for the party - Trisha was very accommodating and our waitress was very attentive!  I would definitely come back and now they deliver:)
