Needless to say but this was by far one of the best seafood restaurants i have been to. Weekends are the busiest time and expect to wait for an hour or more. The restaurant is worth the wait and being only couple of blocks from my place, it was very convenient. i am not a big fan seafoods but i would have to give this place a thumbs up for the food and the environment. Service is not top of the class but it's the food that counts and you can't bea that.
