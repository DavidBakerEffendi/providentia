15 minutes for drinks to arrive 40 minutes for salads/appetizers to arrive 80 minutes for entrees to arrive The smoked salmon appetizer was supposed to be served on a potato pancake, but came out served on top of a pile of....mashed potatoes??? As someone said below, 'Uhm...this place is so weird".  The pasta came out raw - not al dente - uncooked. Yes, raw pasta.  They offered to fix it, but since we had already been sitting for 90 minutes and had to get to a party across town, we declined.  The check arrived with no adjustments, but after a short conversation that went something like "Seriously?", they took the pasta dishes off of the check.  To be fair, the waiter tried hard and the pulled pork was good - but I'm not sure how this place can still be in business.  I guess open table availability will get people in the door - once.
