Firstly, as I read some of the reviews I am confused how someone can mark down a review because of personal tastes.  Shocking to me.   I have been to Kanella countless times and I have never been anything except for pleased with each experience.  The wait staff is super nice and always willing to educate and talk to diners.  The food is always exceptional.  I dined at Kanella on Wednesday and had the veal flank steak.  Cooked perfectly and tasted wonderful! Kanella is a place I keep in my arsenal for special occasions, suggestions to friends, and when entertaining out of towners!
