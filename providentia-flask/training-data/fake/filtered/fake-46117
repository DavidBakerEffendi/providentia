The food tasted great the first 3 times I ordered....... the 4th time is when all went wrong and I decided to never eat anything form here...... I ordered for Â a Takeout.... I had to trash the entire order once i found a Cockroach in one of the items i ordered.... I wish i had taken a picture of it along with the food...... but i was so freaked out after finding the Cockroach.... If i had the picture i must have showed a copy of it to the Manager of this restaurant..... what if a child had eaten the Cockroach and fell sick? Every time I think of this place....... i find it difficult to shake off the Cockroach feeling.
