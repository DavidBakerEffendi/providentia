I thought La Sirene was an absolute great find for a delicious dinner that does not break the bank.  I ordered the duck which I have had at many other restaurants and this was the best one by far (perfectlly cooked, great sauce).   My favorite part was the chocolate lava cake with coconut ice cream that for once looked like chocolate lava when you put your fork into the cake.  All around great experience with a date.  The only negative thing I can say is that if you go right when they open and until about 730pm, it can be a little noisy from traffic going to the Holland Tunnel.
