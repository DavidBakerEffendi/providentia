A friend of mine brought me here for dinner after a class last month and the meal was really yummy!! I found the service to be attentive and thorough and, although small, I really liked the ambiance. I enjoyed it so much that I ended up having a party there for 28 people utilizing the Hour Glass's lovely 3rd floor space! I love the music instruments on the wall on the 3rd floor and the whole ambiance was intimate and fun! The food was fantastic and very well orchestrated so that there was always a wave of something new arriving for the buffet at reasonable intervals. And did I mention the food was absolutely yummy?? :o) We had a pretty diverse menu and I found the owners very accommodating to help cover all the dietary needs of all our guests. The young girl who bartended for us was absolutely charming and helped make the atmostphere all that more fun! The second floor bar was also available for those of us who wanted to continue chatting after our time upstairs was complete. We had the room for 3 hours and I think the price was really, really reasonable for the space, the amount of food and the great service! Give it a shot, you'll be happy you did! I just wish they had more space downstairs on the first floor, but then again, that would take away some of what makes this place so cute!
