I had went there with my friend a couple days ago. But i have to say the atmosphere is always family friendly and they employees where always attentive and friendly. The best dish in the house was what i had, which was the Leitao (suckling pig). Every Saturday there is live music played by " Os unicos." You can even book parties there with the owner of the restaurant and they will provide you with any thing they can provide to make your party a great success. The portion sizes are so big for a more that reasonable price. The thing that i enjoy doing there is sitting down and enjoying a well cooked and server meal while watching they soccer games from the FIFA World Cup 2014!!! Over all this is an amazing restaurant and i go there every day for lunch or for a night out with my family. i would definetly recommend it for all people to enjoy there deliciously cooked meals and watch soccer all day long, because even if u missed to watch a game they have it taped and they will replay it for all to see!!!
