Excellent dinner last night.  I hear they have a new chef and are under new management which must be true because it is so much better than it used to be.  New cleaner look too.  Everything was delicious - sushi, ramen, the chicken entre - and the desserts were to die!  Loved the banana bread pudding.  It not the usual thing, but oh so good.  Interesting list of beers too.
