Had dinner here months ago, but writing a review now because it's simply not cool to bash a small BYO because some bigots happen to eat there one night!! We were there with a party of 4, service was great, attentive but not lean down on one knee, I'm your BFF and going to annoy you. We had a little wait for our entree's, nothing major, especially on a busy busy weekend night, maybe 40 min? And it was well worth the wait! Everyone enjoyed their meal, and we always pass the plates to sample each others, and I can honestly say there was not a single thing that wasn't mouth watering. Even the side dishes were perfectly seasoned and soooooooo many places neglect the sides! All in all, money well spent, we will be back!
