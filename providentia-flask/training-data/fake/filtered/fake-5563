DON'T DO IT!! We were in at Â 06/18/13 Tuesday night 9pm so it wasn't busy. We were so excited to try the place. The hostess who wasn't very warm seated us right away but at the smallest corner table when there were so many open tables nearby and through out the place. Our server was friendly but forgot our apps (wings) and brought our dinner out. He admitted his mistake and dessert was on the house. The dinner was blahhhh. i ordered the sesame salmon, it tasted like nothing. We paid our $53 bill for 1 drink and 2 entrees plus the suggested 20%gratuity listed on the bill...and I went use the ladies room. Disgusting!!!! Ugh it was trashed with bathroom paper all over the floor and no hand towels. Being in the industry, I went over to the hostess who noticed me approaching her but sort of ignored me. I said "excuse me, I wanna let you know that the ladies room is in terrible shape." She looked right at me shrugged her shoulders and said "Kay" in the rudest way possible!! I wish I could impersonate how rude her gestures were. She walked away from me to talk to our server smiling. No apology no thank you for joining us or have a good night. Wth? Both stared us out as we left. We walked away feeling like we just wasted $60 on nothing. The staff needs to take hospitality classes ASAP.
