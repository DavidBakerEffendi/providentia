Nice Ambiance .. Loved the atmosphere and the service was very pleasant and efficient. We had been looking forward to our dinner and had read many nice reviews about the restaurant. Many of the dishes were good and adequate. Crab masala was a little spicy and the Kothu Parotta and biriyani are awesome.
