Went here last weekend with my girlfriend and her mother and we had a great breakfast. Our server was very friendly and the chef who I think may also be the owner was very friendly as well. Gave us a free plate of Talya Wraps to start which were great. Blueberry pancakes were fluffy and filling. Both the girls got French toast and liked it as well. After the meal they brought us a free plate of apple pie cookies which were awesome.
