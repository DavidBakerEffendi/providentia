This is a very good place for Idlis, Vadas and Dosas. Very delicious, fast service and huge portions. Everything was good ... ample choice in the buffet, tasty dishes and great made-to-order dosas too. We were a huge party of over 20 people and were surprised how quickly our meal got served, made to perfection and no attitude whatsoever.
