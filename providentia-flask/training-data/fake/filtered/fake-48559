All you people that are giving this 4 stars are truly blowing my mind!! There Arecibo better middle eastern restaurants in Brooklyn! This place should not even be categorized as a restaurant, as it only has a bread oven to cook everything in. No grill surface whatsoever!! If it was called Bedouin Bakery and only sold pita bread my rating would be much higher as the bread is really good and fresh. All you people that don't know any better and keep ranting and raving about the hummus and babagnus, go 4 blocks down the street to Sahadi's. It's light years better. The falafel is not good mushy and flavorless. Just incase you've never eaten falafel it is supposed to be crunchy outside and soft inside. Try Mamoun's the best! Even crappy Cheaps falafel near St Marks is waaaaay better. Avoid this place at all cost. If you rated this 4 or 5 star please try another place then you will see what you have been missing all these years.
