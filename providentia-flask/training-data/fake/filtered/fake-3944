Couldn't believe it when I read Laura B's review from May 2012, as my husband and I experienced the exact same thing this morning.   We came into the restaurant today with our toddler and 3 month old baby.  Every single time we've come with our kids, we receive terrible service and attitude from the owner/manager.  This time, when we arrived, a waitress approached us, asked how many were in our party and said she would set something up.  The place had at least 4-5 open tables that would easily accommodate us.  The manager saw us, went and spoke to the waitress who was helping us and then returned and said, "Sorry, it's going to be at least an hour wait." I asked him about the open tables and he again repeated "Sorry, at least an hour."  As we walked out of the restaurant, another group of four (without children) came in and were sat right away.   This is beyond bad service.  This is discrimination. I am contacting the Better Business Bureau.
