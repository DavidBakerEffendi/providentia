I have been here twice in 5 days, both times excellent service and even better food. ALL the chicken is white breast meat. The soups are to die for. The $6.55 lunch specials are large enough to share if you buy an appetizer $5 with use your yelp check in coupon for Â homemade ice tea enough for 2 as well, and you're out the door for under $6/person. How they make any enough $ to pay employees is beyomd me, especially ones that can cook so well. Only 2 negatives are 1) its 40 miles from home and 2) I can't stomache going to my local americanized chinese fast food shops near me now, when I know how good it can be...As a customer I'm a picky bastard so getting 5 stars out of me is almost unheard of... getting it twice in 5 days NEAR HAPPENED BEFORE..it was so good I got 4 lunch specials to go just to tide me over till my next biweekly trip to woodbridge area..next rime I may jist order a party tray amd bring it home and freeze it...
