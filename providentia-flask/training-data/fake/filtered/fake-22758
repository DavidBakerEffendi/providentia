This is THE worst restaurant I've been to during the past five years, if not my whole life. The people there, including the owners and workers, are very mean and unbelievably rude, not only to the Mexican workers but also to THEIR CUSTOMERS. Once I invited a Brazilian friend to have lunch there, the taller/thinner/younger/prettier waitress literally threw the dish on our table. My friend just looked at me and couldn't believe this is what just happened. This is not the first time we experienced these things. One more thing, never complain there. If you do, they will let you know that this is JUST THE WAY THEY WORK. Once I complained, the waitress loudly scolded me that why I'm the only god damn person that complains. This is just a terrible terrible place. If you want to find a decent place to eat, please avoid it.
