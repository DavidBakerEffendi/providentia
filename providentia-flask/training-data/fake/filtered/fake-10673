Beyond Sushi is the biggest step up for Vegan eating I have ever seen and or experienced. Sushi is amazing for vegans and non vegans but when you go to a normal restaurant, all the vegan rolls are boring, and the fish and eel rolls are pretty. At Beyond Sushi everything is vegan, everything (i had) is tasty and everything is beautiful and masterfully crafted. Thank you so much Guy for creating such an innovative dining experience for me.
