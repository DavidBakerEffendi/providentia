I used to be a huge fan of Georgie's. We live in the area and have previously been satisfied with the quality and service, although I've always thought their prices a bit steep for diner food. But my last experience with them totally turned me off. We placed the order for delivery. Fries arrived soggy and unseasoned. A grilled cheese was completely smooshed and also soggy. My niece's mac n cheese (from the kid's menu) was literally kraft macaroni and cheese FROM THE BOX. The container wasn't even half full! And then the delivery driver forgot to give us the ice cream from the kid's meals. I was so disgusted I called to complain and was told that most children actually PREFER kraft mac n cheese to their homemade and if I wanted that instead, I would have to pay $10 and order it off of the adult menu. That any establishment could possibly have the gall to serve a boxed macaroni and cheese and charge for it is shameful. I will not be going back.
