A Japanese friend told me they have one of the best sake bars in town. A hard bill to fill as the competition for best Japanese anything in NYC is pretty fierce. Fast forward to my first visit and I was amazed not only by the Sake collection, but also by the incredible tapas style dishes we ate. The sushi/sashimi was unbelievably fresh and the chicken and bbq beef dishes equally amazing in quality and taste. This hidden basement resto made me feel as if I were in Tokyo. Sakagura is A MUST if you want to experience Japan in NYC.
