This was a doomed location until Sushi Koshi arrived. The staff and chefs are terrifically welcoming and pleasant. While that is a great bonus it is the fresh food ,  artful preparation, and  good prices that have us coming back again and again. Just got back from Vancouver and thought I ate the best sashimi of my life with some white tuna. Walked into Sushi Koshi and got the same feeling.
