This place was highly recommended so me and friends went to check it out. The atmosphere was alive, music was GREAT and the food is FANTASTIC! The service was fast and Up to my expectation. The bartender Priscilla was always checking up on us to make sure we were taken care of. The coconut mojito she made us was AMAZING! My friends & I will definitely be going back and I will recommend Blend to all my friends and co- workers.
