Reds Dips & Flips serves food unlike anything I've ever tasted.  Chicago Beef sandwiches, a delicious amalgam of tender, thin sliced beef and unique relish, dipped in a cauldron of fantastically flavorful natural beef au Jus...the taste is "out of this world" good.  Available in half or whole sandwiches, I say go for the bigger sandwich although half is still plenty.  Reds French fries are among the best I've had  anywhere. Great hot-dogs are a guilty pleasure of mine and Reds does unique and wonderful things with a Kosher Hebrew National frankfurter; definitely worth a try.  The pulled chicken is also killer good.  I've visited Reds about 6 times, always promising myself that I'll try something new & different on my next visit...but I just can't keep away from that signature Chicago Beef.  Reds is a little out-of-the-way for me, but it's absolutely worth the trip.  Prices are modest, food quality is excellent, restaurant is spotlessly clean, all employees are pleasant, true, but in the end it's all about the taste.  This is where Reds really shines; it's all about the taste.  In a word: FANTASTIC!
