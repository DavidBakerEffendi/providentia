One of the best Vietnamese restaurants in Philadelphia.  The charbroiled chicken is one of the best dishes.  The price is also unbelievable.  I had a group of 8 and it was still under 100$. I am keeping the last star because despite the talented chefs, the staff was not the most attentive people.  Also, I've noticed for the last few years that I have been coming, that not one female waiter or employee has worked there...interesting......
