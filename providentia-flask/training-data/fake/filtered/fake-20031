Honestly one of the best restaurants I have ever been to. Decided to go during restaurant week and was worried we would not be able to get a reservation, but the restaurant offered early dinner times (around 5) so we were able to make a reservation only a couple of days in advance. The atmosphere is great. The dumplings were phenomenal. The pork (I usually never like pork) was beyond delicious. It came with a few onion rings, which really was a great combination. I also tried my friend's steak, which was just as great as the pork. Overall, no complaints and definitely recommend.
