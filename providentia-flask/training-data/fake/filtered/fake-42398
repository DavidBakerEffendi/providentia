Went to De Mole this evening and got pretty bad food poisoning from the chicken enchiladas. My girlfriend's tacos were alright but my food definitely had chunks of raw chicken hidden inside which i had the displeasure of seeing later in the evening. I'm not sure if this was done intentionally but I will not be returning to find out.
