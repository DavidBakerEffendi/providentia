I have never written a review on Yelp before, but after eating at Joe's Shanghai last night, I felt compelled to set the record straight.  Bottom line:  The food here is horrible.  I had high expectations coming in after seeing a four star rating on Yelp with 1000+ reviews, but was utterly and completely underwhelmed. Could not for the life of me understand the hype about the dumplings.  They are gross and horrible.  The whole fish is fishy and horrible.. the service, decor, everything - all horrible.  Best part of the meal:  the orange slices that come with the check. Not even worthy of half a star.
