So this isn't really about the food, just the service. I ordered delivery twice through grubhub from this place. the first time, they said that they didn't have a driver to take the order and that was okay. the second time; however, I waited for close to 2 hours for my food and when I called, the lady said that my order has been cancelled, I asked why and she said that I called and cancelled it when I didn't call, i was waiting for 2 hours for my food. of course, by the time i called and discovered it was already too late in the night to order from anywhere else. a very sloppy job and poor poor service and it seems i'm not the only one who thinks so. never ordering from this place again.
