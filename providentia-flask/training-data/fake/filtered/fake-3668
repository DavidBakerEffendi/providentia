I've known owner/chef Neil Ganic since the early 90s, even before the original La Bouillabaisse on Atlantic Ave.  Perhaps I'm a little biased but he's one of my favorite chefs in NYC.  Cantankerous, opinionated, passionate, obsessive... everything a brilliant chef should be! It took me a couple of years to make my first trip to Petite Crevette but I was happy to find that it had continued La Bouillabaisse's tradition of excellent, affordable food served by a master.   Honestly, if I lived walking distance to it I would be there almost every night, as I was at La B.  The only thing missing is the warm, entertaining personality of Amanda Green, La B's gracious Brit hostess and co-partner.  There's a photo of Amanda on the wall as you enter the larger dining room. I always get the feeling that she's there in spirit. Everyone else has talked about PC's menu.  What I like to do is ask Neil to just just make me something he likes.  I might wind up with a skirt steak and a sauce not on the menu or a shrimp, salmon and angel hair pasta dish.  Whatever, it's always excellent.  Last week I had dinner with business friends, one of whom is a vegan.   Neil was happy to oblige his diet and my friend was blown away with what he was served.  Dinner for five, with apps and dessert, was $160.  That's hard to beat.
