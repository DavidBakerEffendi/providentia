The service absolutely sucks! We were there for brunch on saturday and the place was only half full. After ordering a bottle of wine we were told it is not available AFTER 20 minutes of waiting for it. Then we ordered a different wine which didn't show up for over 10 minutes, at which point we decided to leave. Would NOT recommend this at all.
