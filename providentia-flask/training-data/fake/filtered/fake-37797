I hate to have to write this because this is my neighborhood deli and my family and I frequent this place on an almost daily basis. Literally the past 10 times I've been there I've bought expired products. I've gotten milk that has been up to a week expired before. I've gotten bread, brought it home and it's completely green and moldy. Cigarettes are stale. It makes me not want to purchase anything from the pizza place because the food and beverage products, in my opinion, are a direct reflection of the quality of the hot food being sold there. How would I know that the ham in my sandwich isn't expired? The staff is very nice but I don't see why these things can't be checked on a daily basis. More pride should be taken in this store.
