The food is great but the service was absolutely horrible. I was there for brunch today and I was served food without utensils and wasn't even asked if I wanted something to drink. I had to keep calling the waitress to come over to our table. She had a bad attitude. it was very uncomfortable. Not a kid friendly place at all either.
