Completely can not understand if people are writing about the same cafe, that i know? LaVa is gorgeous and warm, friendly and serves great food. Such an excellent mix of coffees combined with a tasty, "not your run of the mill menu." I've been shocked since moving here about the lack of cafes with personality. Lava has character. and ps, "what's with the name knocking?" What does that have to do with a review? I personally, don't like cutesy, babyish names for cafes, but is that really part of a review, or just a personal, unkind statement? In a city where i see scores of people waiting at Starbucks and Wawa, two finely named, obviously superior establishments, can we lay off the independent businesses? And, about being friendly, is this a match.com review? "loved his looks, but his/her name and smile needs to improve." It's a cafe. And as a cafe, it rocks! I wish there were more places like LaVa! I can't imagine either negative reviewers going in to a place and being friendly and smiley. People in this city, jabber on cellphones while ordering and rarely say thank you or please... I Don't work at LaVa or own the place, but was offended by the 7th grade criticism. I think that anyone looking to be comfortable and eat a great meal at a good price will be thrilled to eat at LaVa!
