I love this place...everything in here is good. I've tried almost everything on that menu and I can't complain. I always have to order the mac and cheese. I think they shut down every day for about an hour or so and you can't order anything outside of the bar until their kitchen is open...but trust me It is worth the wait! I love the indoor patio area...it's a great place to sit and eat with friends. I recommend this restaurant 100%
