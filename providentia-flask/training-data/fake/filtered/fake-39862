The DMV of restaurants. I have been here a handful of times and every time I am somehow in the wrong "line". Â My girlfriend and I went in search of pizza and upon entering a woman demanded to know if we wanted pizza OR dinner. Odd, not only because, why can't we have pizza for dinner? but also because it was before noon, we didn't think pizza for lunch was too much to ask for. We had to option to either sit down and have dinner or go back out, come in the side and get pizza by the slice and eat outside. Not terribly accommodating. Service took way longer than it should have considering there was only one other table in use. My date asked the waitress for a recommendation and was told "Tony and Lucile are my parents, I like every item on the menu as much as the next" Thank you for that. The whole time I felt like I had walked into the back of someones house and demanded they make me food. We were a thundering nuisance to them apparently. My girlfriend was in a hurry to get to work by the end of our meal because of what a late start we got and we sat around waiting for the check an amount of time not disproportionate to the large volume of time spent waiting for initial service. In frustration she pretended to cry a little. I cried for real There in no quantity of people that could be waiting outside Frank Pepes that would make me decide to come here instead. Order Domino's and go home if it's that serious.
