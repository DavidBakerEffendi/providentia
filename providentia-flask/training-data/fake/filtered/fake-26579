I'm confused by some of the good reviews for this place. We ordered delivery. Took about an hour to get here. The pizza was alright - very greasy, crust was a bit soggy, and the bacon had no flavor - but it wasn't the worst that we've had in New Haven. The chicken parm was disgusting - chicken was burnt and dry, sauce was just gross, and the spaghetti was overcooked. The chicken fingers were dry. The mozzarella sticks were under cooked. The calzone was really meh - again, gross sauce. We won't be going back.
