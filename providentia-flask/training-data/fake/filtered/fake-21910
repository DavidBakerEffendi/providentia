NOTE: I've only been here for brunch. 5 of my 6 times here, the service has been exceptional, though my most recent visit (November), it was lacking (servers more interested in cell phone & each other than working). They have a real nice outdoor area that is a must when open. The daily vegetable omelette is excellent and highly recommended. They normally have an interesting drink special for brunch (bacon Bloody Mary). The make some sinfully good starters, but only order if you're sharing. The food quality is high. La Columbe coffee too!
