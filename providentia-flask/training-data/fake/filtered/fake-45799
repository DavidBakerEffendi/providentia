We very much enjoyed Max Fish..Very clean, nice ambiance..My wife and I were lookin for a late lunch/early dinner and Max's seemed perfect..We started off with several apps..Butternut Squash with Apple and Crab Soup, Buffalo Shrimp,and Fried Calamari w/ 3 dipping sauces..All were very,very good..My only wish was that the shrimp were tailless..Having the tails on made it somewhat tricky to remove them..For dinner we had ordered the Lobster Cobb Salad (her) and The Grilled Swordfish Sandwich(me) with side salad & fries..The Cobb Salad was nice but no "WOW" factor..My sandwich was very moist, with marinated cucumbers and a tasty aioli. I would have preferred ANY other kind of bread because it came on a plain burger bun..but whatev, it was "lunch". My side salad was just too basic, a tiny amount of field greens with a Sherry Vinaigrette..Something simple as shredded carrots or even some croutons could of helped out tremendously..Fries were very good..Overall we enjoyed our experience..Our waiter knew the menu front to back..Which was nice ..No waiting for answers to our questions..Definitely will go back ..Prices seemed fine for a somewhat upscale lunch,although dinner looked to get pricey..P.S. My wife said the coffee was excellent...And that was without dessert..
