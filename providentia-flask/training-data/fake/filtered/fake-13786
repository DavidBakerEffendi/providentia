I worked there for only a few week before it changed over and it was bad then.  the owners husband was a nasty mean SOB.....She wasn;t much better.  I went back just a few weeks ago and was shocked at what I saw....Surprised the place is still open, they must be paying somebody off........ Not a place I would even admit to being there.....
