Delicious!  Delicious!  Delicious! Have eaten here twice, and everything has been very fresh and delicious.  I recommend the red lentil soup, and I'm not even a "soup person"!  I also enjoyed the Spiced Ezme tomato appetizer.  Plenty of vegetarian choices, I enjoyed my Imam Bayildi (eggplant) entree.  The bread that they bring to your table before the meal is heavenly and comes with olives/oil for dipping.   The only thing I would watch out for (and its not even their fault) is the taste of the local tap water.   All in all, I highly recommend this place!
