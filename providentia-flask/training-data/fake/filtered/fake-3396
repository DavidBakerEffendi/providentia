Terrible service unfortunately. I am confident the evening could have gone differently, Â but our server had a bad attitude from the time we sat down, and it escalated from there. We left after 20 minutes. There is no reason why, in a city like NYC, one must ever subject themselves to terrible service. There are too many excellent options out there. Riposo 72, however, is not one of them.
