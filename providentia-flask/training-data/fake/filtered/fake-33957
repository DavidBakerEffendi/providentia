I heard that Sally's was a comparable to Frank Pepe's in New Haven, so I thought I would try it out.  Here's a breakdown of why it got one star from me: THE WAIT: I was expecting a wait to get into the restaurant, only 20 mins, which was not that bad.  But I was NOT prepared for the long wait to get the food, I waited approximately 1.5 hours to get my order!  This wouldn't of been that bad, except I saw that groups that came in after me were getting their pizzas before me even though they had ordered after me!  I was getting so hungry and decided to just ask to get it to go and eat it outside so I could spend less time there.   THE PIZZA I got the pizza (2 small pizzas: 1 red pie and 1 white pie) and was expecting the same great taste as Pepe's - but all I tasted was mediocrity.  What a letdown. CONCLUSION: NEVER GOING THERE EVER AGAIN.  Decided to only go to Pepe's from now on.  Hope this helps someone!
