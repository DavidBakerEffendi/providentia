I have been to every single coffee shop around this area and i think i found a perfect place.. coffee doesnt taste burnt like dunkin or starbucks and not weak like any other small local coffee shops.. i ordered insatiable sample where theres a little bit of everything they have. and i fell inlove with the cinammon sugar waffle it was included in the sampler that i got and when i ask my waitress if i can order another one for to go she asked me if i want it plain or stuffed or topped with fruits and chocolates? and i was amazed ( i didnt read the full menu) so i ordered stuffed with strabwerry and dark chocolate and its heavenly.. the food came out a little longer than i expected but its understandable theres like 9 more tables and one of them is a larger group the theres people on the couch and tables outside, so i will probably be back on a weekday when its not so busy... but definitely going back... 2 thumbs up..
