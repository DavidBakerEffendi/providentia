My boyfriend and I went here on a Friday night after a recommendation from a friend. When we arrived we were first seated in the middle of the room but asked to be moved to a more snug location. They happily accommodated us. We were served bread and roasted red peppers, an interesting spin on the expected bread and oil. I ordered the veal piccata and he ordered the crab ravioli, which was a special. The food came out in less than 10 minutes, which was great. Our meals were excellent both in taste and presentation. The perfect lighting and a quiet murmur of patrons made for a perfect atmosphere. It was BYOB, so we regret not bringing something as the other guests had. The meal was perfectly portioned, leaving room for dessert. We ordered the cannoli and blood orange sorbet, which were both phenomenal. It was an excellent experience and we will definitely be coming back for more.
