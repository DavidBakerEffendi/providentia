I've been eating at star since before I could walk about 32 to 33 yrs and my parents have been eating there since they were kids and to this day its gotta be some of the best, and I mean best pizza anywhere. nothing really comes close anywhere outside NJ( If authentic thin crust is what your after ) or in it if you ask me. and I've been all over the country. Jersey style Pizza, perfect amount of everything and not some gigantic mess. if you need more order another I think the cheese pie is still around $8.00 maybe $9. the sandwiches and salads rock too. great fried calamari.OH and lets not forget there eggplant parm sandwiches. i order with some geilled onions and some hot peppers on the side...man o man am i hungry . i just might have to go now after writing this.Go and you won't be dissapointed if you are maybe you should try dominos, papa johns or pizza hut.
