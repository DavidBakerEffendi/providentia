The service at this place was terrible.  I read great reviews about this place and decided to try it out.  I went with a few girlfriends.   The food was good.  It seem very athentic and had a lot of choices!  Over ten pages in the menu.  The restaurant ambiance was great too and it seemed like a happening place to be.   However, the service was awful!!!  We had to call someone over to get our order after ten minutes of sitting there with no service and we had to ask for utensils.  The wait staff would just throw our stuff down on the table and walk away.  No one checked to see how anything was and when we did ask for something, like water, they made it seem like we were bothering them.  The second time we asked for water refill they rudely plopped a water pitcher down at our table. This was suppose to be a fun and free night this experience was just awful.  We will never return to this restaurant.  Hopefully they were just having an off night.
