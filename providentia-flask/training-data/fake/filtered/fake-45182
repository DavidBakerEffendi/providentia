Gorgeous inside, and lots of high hopes and anticipation for this place, but the food is...not so great. And expensive. We've tried it twice, and the second time was a $400-ish celebration meal with family. It was depressing to shell out that kind of cash for such an average meal - we certainly turn out better entrees at home. I don't think this kind of menu/pricing bodes well for the future of Ricalton's. It's a bummer, but unless I hear of a big sea-change with the menu and pricing, I probably won't be back. The owner knows what he is doing with burgers at his other place, but the food here just isn't making sense. If it were delicious, or even reliably good, a la Huntley Tavern, I'd happily come back and recommend to others.
