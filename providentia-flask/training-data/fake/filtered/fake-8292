good for pizza's and a simple pasta dish.  Entrees never seam to work out for me here. Have been here dozens of times and I can never get the right entree.  Cod cooked to death...... Steak Fiorentino.... way over priced.. grizzle, tough as nails even though it came out as ordered... med rare?  The last straw was the Porchetta.   Just a mess... tasted really strange.... so much fat..... it was inedible.   The waiter asked and I told him I did not enjoy it.... he said sorry and never offered anything.  I barely touch it and they stilled charged me.  I did not care... last time I will get an entree there.  Pastas are great... pizza pretty good.... nice selections of cured meats and cheeses and a good but overpriced wine list.  I like it there and will be back often I am sure.....just no more entrees for me!!
