Really like it here! Been there several times and have to say I'm never disappointed. I'm crazy about their desserts, especially the yogurt & honey. Amazing! The fish is wonderful. Rare to find a place where they grill and entire fish that is filleted table-side. Cooking it whole gives the fish great flavor while keeping the fish moist. Nice. Portions are a good size so I always bring extra home for lunch the next day. They do have a tendency to slightly overcook the meat so just order it "medium rare" if you want it medium. I'll be back!
