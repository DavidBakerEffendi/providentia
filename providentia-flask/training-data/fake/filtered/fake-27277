Went for brunch.  Delicious. Price agreeable.  The Spinach and Goat Cheese Croissant was phenomenal! Service, delightful, clear, professional.  There is a definite need for two bartenders on Sunday.  It seemed as though the man that was working was over- worked and annoyed at the notion. Bathrooms too dim, but the lovely soap makes up for it.  Will return.
