This is my first and last time EVER to order and eat from this place. I work at a hospital, decided to order from them because all the nurses RAVED about how great the hoagies are. I ordered two hoagies, they told me that they would deliver it "shortly"..after about an HOUR, i called to get an update on my order. An older gentleman told me that the delivery guy should have dropped off the hoagies awhile ago but may have dropped off another order first. 30 minutes later the delivery guy finally drops off my order. I take my break to eat my hoagie and GO FIGURE i have a soggy hoagie. I called the deli to complain about my order, the older gentlemen said i could drop it off because "our bread is NEVER soggy". Â I told him that I was currently at work and that I could not drop it off but that the delivery guy can come pick it up. He asked me if I could find someone to drop it off. I politely reminded him that i was still at work till 730. He told me that he needs to see the soggy bread because," You People at Pennsylvania Hospital rip me off all the time". I told him that I would gladly take a picture of it and send it to him. He said "i would rather see it personally" He also told me that the delivery guy has left for the day and that the only way he could do anything is to physically see the soggy bread. Conversation ended with him saying that he would call me back. Never did. Needless to say...i will NEVER do business with them! And I am still hungry...
