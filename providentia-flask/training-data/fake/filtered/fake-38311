I'm new to yelp, but at the top of my reviews I have to give a shout out to Catahoula!  We just moved into the city and my wife and I now consider this our local, it's the first place we bring friends who come to visit for a beer, a cup (bowl) of gumbo, pickled everything and a po boy.  The vibe is very relaxed, they have great craft beers on draft and my wife loved the fact that they put brown sugar and cinnamon on the beer glass rim of the Blue Moon Seasonal to give it that christmas sparkle.  The bartenders seem to always be in a great mood, usually not too crowded, and it's an awesome place to watch foodball as they usually have a special.  The food is excellent and one of these weekends we've got to make it in for brunch.  Anyway, here are 5 stars for a fantastic and and unique place to down a few drafts in the city.
