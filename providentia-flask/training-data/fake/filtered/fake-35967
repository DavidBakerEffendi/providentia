My friend and I decided to come here on a Saturday night, and we probably should've thought that through a bit - we had to wait for over an hour but oh, well, at least the sprawling garden area is a nice place to wait, and the staff was considerate. Once we were seated, we were told that there would be an additional wait if we ordered pizza, but we opted for pizza anyway. So, after about 90 minutes, we finally got our pizza and, how was it? Well, it was pretty good: the pizza with cheese, honey and black pepper was tasty but not mindblowing; the (more-expensive) pizza with tomato, capers and tuna was OK, but dull - the tuna was touted as 'Sicilian tuna belly,' but it tasted like plain old tuna to me. For desert, we tried the olive oil gelato: delicious, but priced prohibitively at $7 a serving. In other words: Roberta's was pleasant, but now that I know a bit about the hit-or-miss quality of the food, the somewhat high prices and the long waits, I doubt I'll be coming back.
