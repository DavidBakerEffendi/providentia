I'm a Skinny Pancake regular and for good reason. I've enjoyed the Lake Street location for a few years now. The establishment has weathered some frustration over wait times or poor service - but sometimes the most awesome places suffer from their own popularity - especially in high season during the summer. What I'd like anyone interested in trying the Pancake to know: - The food is EXCELLENT!! SO FRESH, you can practically taste the dirt. But not really. That would be gross. The Johnny crepe, breakfast monster, noah's ark and spinach artichoke dip are faves. - The staff turnover seems to have settled and the morning crew is BEYOND great. (What's up Bettina, Pablo and Alex!) - It's true this is a "hipster" place, but - puhleeze - you're in Burlington, VT. This is the case most everywhere you go. Let. It. Go. - Just relax. Take a deep breath and smell the amazing culinary skills. Get a pint of Switchback. And dive in to one of the best meals you'll have locally. It's totally worth the wait. If there is one.
