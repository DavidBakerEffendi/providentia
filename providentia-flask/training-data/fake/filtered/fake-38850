Chef's counter defined. Before Brooklyn Fare, Atera or Atelier Joel Robuchon, Jack and Grace Lamb set the NYC standard with their strings of octopus legs, steaming planchas and furious cooking machines. Degustation was one of my first forays into fine dining, and I still revel about the meals I have shared there with friends, or eaten by myself to marvel at the cuisine. The food is simple, in a meat and potatoes kind of way, but it is fresh, flavorful, well prepared and paired with different flavors, textures and styles of cuisine. Try any of their seafood preparations; one preparation of octopus, persimmons and frisee was a dish I will never forget. Razor clams, usually subtle sea morsels, are hand picked gifts from mermaids - mythical, can't find bursts of flavor that only Corton does (did) better. Service is charming, welcoming and efficient. They can definitely use another hand, but it is a tight space. Any technical errors, or fast movements are replaced by a genuine smile and sense of hospitality. Its not pretentious, but it is not casual either. GO.
