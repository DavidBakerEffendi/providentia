I use yelp all the time but never right reviews. After eating at Trattoria Tricolori last night I had to write one. I'm visiting NYC and was looking for a good italian place. The service was pretty nice but my dish was what really wowed me. I ordered the Farfalle Primavera and was absolutely shocked. This pasta dish with a lot of fresh vegetables was exactly what I was looking for and I ended up taking a picture of the dish and making notes about every bite so I can try and recreate it when I return home. Bravo, Trattoria Trecolori! I will definitely recommend your restaurant and return soon.
