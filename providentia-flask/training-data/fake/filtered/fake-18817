Just recently, I brought my mom to Roma Restaurant for dinner. The dinners we chose were excellent. Our waitress brought us fresh baked bread that was delicious. I had Veal Francese with a salad and my mom had Chicken Marsala with spaghetti. Â Then for dessert we had the Pecan Gelato Pie which was very pleasing to look at and even better to eat.. All of the staff was very friendly and courteous. Our waitress was very attentive to our needs. She kept checking to see how we were doing and asked if we needed anything else. In addition, the atmosphere was relaxing with music playing in the background. Before leaving I used the restroom which was very clean, I would highly recommend this restaurant.
