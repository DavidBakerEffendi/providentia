Loved the food and the price is right, but get Mr Horowitz away from customers.  He is not friendly at all and obviously feels he's too good to be a server.  He doesn't say thanks have a nice day etc.  Has an attitude which will keep me away from here.  I love the food however but if you want my money, treat me nicer!!!!!!! The rest of the staff was awesome though.
