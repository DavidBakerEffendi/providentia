It is not always a treat to drive your departing company 140 miles to Newark Airport for their return to Germany, so we stopped at the Spanish Tavern for lunch. I do not want to get gushy, but Â it made the trip worth the ride. This place is great and I would recommend it to anyone. Thank you for a very pleasant dining experience.
