The primary reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars: the crust. Beware. I have been here multiple times per year for the past several years, since I live relatively close. You can pretty much rely on the crust to be well done. I've told the waiter 'go light on the crust', yet sometimes, somehow, the guy making the food fails to comprehend that phrase. I don't mind a nice crunch when it comes to crust, but blackened? No way! I love the crust, I don't want mine burned to a crisp. Sometimes it's just the edges, but I can tell you I've sent their $15+ pies back to the kitchen at least once because they were just too well done.  Other than that, I love DeLorenzo's tomato pies without fail. This DeLorenzo's location is definitely too small, given the popularity of their pies. I'm not sure what they were thinking, as this is neither their only nor their original location. As a result, the almost always present group of waiting individuals is crowded into the corner, right  in front of the door. It's especially a pain in the winter, when you may find yourself waiting in your car instead of standing outside the place. (fyi, you can give them your name and if they say 40 minutes, just be back in 30!) Another issue with the popularity of DeLorenzo's & this relatively small location is the noise level. Sometime it's too much & I totally prefer to bring the pies back to my nearby relative's house, but that's not always an option. One honorable mention-  all male waiters? What, am I supposed to forget I'm dining at a casual eatery in the 21st century? I know DeLorenzo's is not alone in this practice, but I find it laughable nevertheless.
