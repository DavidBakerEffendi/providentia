Food is great! The service was beyond awful. We went for my boyfriend's post graduation celebration. It was 2 in the afternoon, hardly prime time. We waited 45 minutes for water. An additional 15 for our drinks. They messed up our order and were somewhat rude. The manager couldn't have cared less. However, if this was just a one time fluke the food was very good. The guacamole is handmade and delicious and the burgers were great.
