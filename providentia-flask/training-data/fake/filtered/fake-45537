The service was absolutely terrible, and the food was just so-so.  For instance, we asked for oil to dip our bread into, and the waiter said no!  We must use our butter.  Wow.  AND, they do NOT serve coffee, only espresso.  Definitely never worth the trip from Long Island, and certainly not even a 5 minute walk.
