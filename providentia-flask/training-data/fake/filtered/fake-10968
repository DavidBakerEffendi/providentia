Oh my gosh.....after reading the second review I was floored!!!  I've worked in the same building where Cafe George is, and have had breakfast, lunch and brought home dinners and have never EVER been disappointed with the food nor the quality!!  The food and service are AWESOME!   The crab cakes and coconut chicken are incredible, her daily soups are YUMMY!!!!  The salads are so fresh, and the dressings are great!!
