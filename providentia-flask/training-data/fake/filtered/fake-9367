I only gave 3 out of 5 because I went to brunch will review more when I have their dinner. The place is also very small but for brunch it was OK, it made it quite cozy but (couldn't imagine dinner waiting) I had the surf & turf tacos for lunch and with an excellent mimosa ending with the dough-nuts over nutella were to die for, i can not stop raving about how amazing they are. I will most definitely be back for dinner, hopefully followed by a great review... until then
