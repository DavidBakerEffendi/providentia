ewwww. this place is so gross. i still cant see why people would line up for their disgusting halal food. i love halal food and all but this place does not know how to make it. it is by far the most overhyped halal cart i ever seen in my life. their work station is so messy and the their food quality alone is horrendous! the way they serve their lamb and chicken is nasty! its just complete mushh and just tasteless. i see a bunch of people loading it up with sauce. if thats the case, they should just ask for white sauce and put it on dog doo and eat it because thats just the quality of their chicken/lamb combo. just disgusting beyond beilef. the owners here are just banking on the name of their location. its so overrated......
