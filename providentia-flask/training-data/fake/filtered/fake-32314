The owner/main cook from this falafel cart goes into the bagel store across the street and insults the owner by pretending to speak loud broken Korean for about 4 minutes.  During this time he turns to his friend and says "I can get away with this.  What are the customers gonna do, beat me up?" The food is good, but I'm boycotting this place.  On my grandmother's life, this is exactly what happened.
