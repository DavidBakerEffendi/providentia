Nothing special..the owner yelled from across the room "Is everything OK".kind of tacky? Â He was also yelling the kitchen staff. Bad day ? The Pastrami was at best OK, had much better. It's way too big and has lost all it's soul, looks like it was designed by the same designer that does a chain. Not the greatest experience, no one is smiling and no one seems happy.
