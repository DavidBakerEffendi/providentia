I was curious about Vanessa's because the store posted all kinds of positive reviews on their window display. I went to the Eldridge st branch both yesterday and today at 11 am. I went there two days in a row to give a fair review. Â This place is over hyped and there are plenty of better places in Manhattan. Unfortunately, tourists might buy into hype but I would not recommend Vanessa's to my family and friends. I give it one star for their shrimp and pork dumplings. 1. Terrible service: Vanessa should train cashiers in basic manners. Both cashiers from yesterday and today at 11 am were rude and unprofessional. 2. Filthy bathroom: The sink and toilet were not clean. The floor was wet and littered with tissues. It's hard to believe this restaurant passed inspections. 3. Mediocre food: 3-1. The gongee (mung bean porridge) was so watery it had no flavor. 3-2. The shrimp and pork dumpling soup was decent but didn't stand out. There are plenty of dumpling stores with better quality. 3-3. Their kimchi was not kimchi at all. They should call something else. I'm a Korean and have never had kimchi like this. 3-4. The smashed sesame noodles was so soggy I could eat only a few bites. 3-5. The sesame sandwiches were soaked in oil.
