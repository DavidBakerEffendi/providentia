As one who enjoys good italian food, and has traveled Italy on several occasions, I was looking forward to dining at Amis, trust me I won't be going back. For starters the host's attempt to seat us in a a tight table for two was foiled as we spotted an alternative section which was nearly empty.  He did honor our request and place us in the less crowded elevated section.  Next came confusion as to who was to wait on our table, first we had no attention, then too much as beverage orders were taken twice by two different wait-staff people.   After ordering 5 starters only one was truly palatable, the eggplant caponata.  The others, marinated sardines (too much vinegar), octopus (chewy with no flavor), fried artichokes (greasy, greasy, greasy), meatballs (we never received them, but were instructed that we had, we where then told what a meatball looks like as though we where the ones clueless.  All this from the manager who was willing to fight us until the bitter end regarding the missing meatballs.) One pasta course was passable, the tonnarelli, while the other, the bucatini wasn't even true bucatini.  The kitchen must have mixed up the boxes as there was no hole down the center of the pasta. Dessert was the chocolate tart it was OK, while the espresso and cappuccino not so good.   After spending over $250.00, including a $70.00 bottle of wine,  we left shaking our heads feeling violated and unsatisfied.  We've asked ourselves how we could have made such poor choice while vowing never to return.
