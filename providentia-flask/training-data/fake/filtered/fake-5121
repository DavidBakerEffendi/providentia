Food: I started off with the BEET SALAD which was remarkable.  It was comprised of a great deal of roasted red beets, haricots verts, greens and a very nice chalky goat cheese.  The harmony of flavors and subtle hint of figs in the fig-infused balsamic will encourage me to order this salad with every visit. My girlfriend and I shared the SMOKED SALMON PIZZA which had a layer of pita, topped with hummus, smoked salmon, capers and red onion.  Simple, but very tasty. For dinner, I had the LAMB SHANK TAGINE- braised lamb shank with vegetables and cous cous.  The lamb was succulent and fell off the bone with little effort.  A prominent saffron and citrus flavor emerged which was quite pleasant.  I enjoyed the texture of the cous cous, also. Service: In spite of the large volume and high energy environment, an older gentleman and woman kept our water glasses full and were quick to keep our courses moving along.  We brought two bottles of wine that were opened promptly, chilled appropriately and poured for us.  Our table was touched with every course. Environment: Very cute inside with old looking tables, Moroccan artifacts and a beautiful ceiling.  I also like that you can see the kitchen and smell the food cooking. We were too full for dessert, but I will absolutely return to try a fig-related treat.  I plan on also giving their brunch a try.
