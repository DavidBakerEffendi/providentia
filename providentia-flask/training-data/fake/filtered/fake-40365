The food is good and the atmosphere is cool, but very unfriendly.  The seating hostess is the most unfriendly of all, which is not the person I think the owners would want to have giving customers their first impression of the place.  The servers are also never over firiendly, there are a couple who are very pleasant, but one of two equally as not.  If the owners would address this, I would go back.  But with all the choices in Park Slope, I don't need to spend my money at a place I don't feel welcome.  Also, when I was there each time the music was way too loud.
