It's really Venezuelan. Food is delicious and the best include: tequenos, arepas called "Reina Pepiada", empanadas are great, and the arepa with white cheese from venezuelan Guayana. If you have eaten in Venezuela's restaurants this is really authentic. Waiters are nice and the environment is truly friendly. It's good to go also on weekends for brunch.I would prefer less boleros or Mexican music since they may have good music from Venezuela too. I like it.
