As a middle eastern eating kabob is like breathing air but I'm very picky with the food I eat and the way its made and I believe that the Kabob Shack really just went the whole nine yards. Not only is it affordable, it's probably one of the best kabobs I've eaten in a long time. You cant go wrong ordering the chicken or the beef kabobs and slapping on some of that good white sauce and the fries with what they call the "kicker" sauce really takes it to another level. Usually when you eat things like fries and kabob you have this heavy feeling and you just want to go home and sleep. I have to say after eating it was a nice full. Not to heavy not to light, it's a nice place to go before you go party in the city or if you just need that place to go to if you had a long night at the bar or the club. The staff is very friendly and when you're there you really feel welcomed. You have conversation with the people there not like most restaurants where the mission for the establishment is to get you in and get you out as quick as possible. It's a very "home" style environment. I say check it out but to everyone at the Kabob Shack I say keep it up and you'll definitely see me soon.
