Ive eaten at Five Tacos a few times.  For me personally it's a hit and miss.  Sometimes I have incredible tacos and sometimes they lack flavor.  I am not sure if it's due to the cooks shift changes, but one minute they are amazing and one minute mediocre.  I will say this, when I do come back and I do get a great Taco I am so happy.  The tacos are cheap (around $3.50) and are good for a quick bite.  Don't take my word on it, try it for yourself.
