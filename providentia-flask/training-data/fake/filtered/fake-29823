This restaurant was highly recommended by a Portuguese friend and our experience was the opposite.  First, we were served portuguese rolls covered with a cloth napkin thinking the bread was at least warm.  When I touched the bread it was cold and did not seem fresh at  all.  Next we ordered the Lulas Fritas a Sevilhana-Fried Calamari Sevilha Style appetizer  which was pretty good  and we were looking forward for our entrees.  The sangria was great and then our entrees were served and we were disappointed just by how the food was presented.  We ordered the Salmão Grelhado, Bacalhau Cozido C/ Todos and Espetada de Marisco.  The food was very bland with no flavor and did not seem that they put any effort into preparing  the food and cold.  If it wasn't for the appetizer or the sangria the whole evening would be ruined.  I would only recommend the place for the sangria and appetizers only.  Don't waste your money on the expensive bland and cold main dishes.  This is definitely the first and last time I would eat at this place.
