For all the people in the world who lack patience, get a life. I'm from Manhattan, and Pizzeria Verita could very well compete with some of the  best pizzerias in the city. The restaurant has a great vibe - upbeat and everyone is super friendly. I was quickly greeted when I opened the door to one of the owners  who delightfully engaged me in a conversation. Food is wonderful, service is great, end of story.
