Great ambiance (great for date night, and out with friends), wonderful food, and excellent service. Everyone at Mes Reves is very friendly and accommodating. The ambiance rivals that of the cozy eateries in Manhattan. As another yelper wrote, "The Chef is always trying out new dishes and may drop a complimentary tasting on your table...". And those extra dishes didn't disappoint! :) On our last visit, we started out with the scallops appetizer. The scallops were perfectly cooked and that cream sauce was out of this world. I know there was a salad on the table, (Mesclun Salad) however, I was not able to partake as my boyfriend took the reigns on that one. The plate was clean so it's safe to assume that he enjoyed it very much. For entrees, my boyfriend had the pork tenderloin and I had the steak au poivre (I can't help but be a meat and potatoes type of girl). I really enjoyed my dish. The temperature on the steak was a perfect medium. Dessert? Of course we made room - well I know I did! Though my boyfriend was ready to throw in the towel. Ordered ice cream (I know, very generic) but it was tasty! We also got to taste the chocolate pistachio creme brulee. Again, plate was clean (boyfriends doing, but this time I did get a spoonful). It was definitely very good. All in all, it was a wonderful evening and we are looking forward to coming back.
