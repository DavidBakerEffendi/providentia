If you're like me, you don't have an abundance of GF options for dining in your hometown.  I found this place while searching GF options prior to my trip and was thrilled to hear about it's GF accommodations.  Unlimited GF breadsticks brought to the table as soon as we were seated!  My friend is not GF and was not super impressed with them, but I thought they were delicious and so happy with the gesture.  The GF menu offered several options for paninis, another meal I usually don't get to have.  I ordered the Italian sausage panini and it was fantastic.  There are also options for GF deserts and they sell GF baking mixes and snacks to go.  It was a wonderful experience to go to a restaurant and not be limited to a tiny selection AND to be able to enjoy the breadsticks instead of grudgingly watching others eat them while I can't.  My friend ordered a pizzette (not GF) and was quite pleased.
