Went here last with with out of town friends.  We went after the theater crowd left and it was a very pleasant evening.  I had the steak, wife had the pasta of the day and friends had the meatloaf.  All in all - adequate.  Nothing to really complain about, but wish I could have impressed out of towners just a little more.  They turn out to be foodies and it was...ok.  Not blown away.  Service was not overbearing, but didn't seem to go out of their way.
