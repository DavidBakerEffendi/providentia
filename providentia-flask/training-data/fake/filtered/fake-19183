While this place is usually a good place for college students, if you turn 21 and are from out of state, DO NOT COME HERE TO DRINK. EVEN IF YOU ARE 21! I am from out of state and my ID say age 21 in 2014. (it does not expire until 2018). When you look above that it says my birthday, which proves that I am 21 (and my picture looks  like me but apparently that doesn't matter either). But to the Burrito Bar an out of state license WILL NOT COUNT AND THEY WILL NOT SERVE YOU. So if you or your friend has a fake New York ID they will let you guys drink, but if you have a valid out of state license, you will be denied.  That is horrible service for a place that claims to be a bar.
