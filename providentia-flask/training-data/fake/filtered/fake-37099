From a number of family experiences including school and banquet events. Three words:   Find Another Place! Food was overly expensive probably to pay for the upkeep of the grounds and building. Portions were small at best School meals as well as banquet menu items weren't palatable for any age Nice thing to say, the staff was nice.  They had ample parking close and within the grounds.
