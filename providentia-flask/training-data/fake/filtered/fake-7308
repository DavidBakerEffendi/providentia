To me it is best place to try real American burger and Steak! You will be melting while eating.. It is a promise! I Â just dont like the way they help you in the entrance. The receptionist says they put you on a waiting list but They dont even take your phone number. You either come back after 1,5 - 2hrs later or wait ourside or hang out at the bar area. And you have to ask and remind that person several times that you are waiting for the t - it seems tt need more efficient system.. So what I recommend especially when they are packed on Fridays and Saturdays just skip this guy in the front and hang out at the bar, as soon as you have a bar chair order your food-otehrwise you will wait 2 hrs maybe more to be able to order!
