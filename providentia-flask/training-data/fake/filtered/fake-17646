It's a very nice place to have lunch. The decoration is pretty Japanese style. There are poster about books of Japanese writers on the wall. They have lunch specials as well as weekly specials. Salmon and Ginger grilled pork are very good. Mochi Ice Cream is my FAVORITE!!! It's just $1. Anyone should have a try if you go there. But they do have insufficient staff. We went there several times. One time, the restaurant was so crowded that there were just 2 people serving the customers!! We waited for about 20 minutes before we sit down. If you want to try Japanese food, this is a very nice place to go. It's not expensive and dinning environment is good.
