First Review on Yelp. Figured I would do one of my favorite EATS. Jose Tejas is on of the best mexican places i have ever been to and its extremely cheap, how can you beat that. Always a fun night at joses. Does tend to get really crowded at dinner time, so be sure to leave early if your looking to go around 6-7.
