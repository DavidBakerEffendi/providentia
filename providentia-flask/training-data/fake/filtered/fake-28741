We were just there on 8/23/14 for the Phillies game and I had read reviews on this place and we were not disappointed!!  It was a great little place to have some bar food and beers before the game.  I am from the south and every time I come to Philly I am looking for the ultimate cheesesteak and all I had found were one's topped with "Wiz" down south we use provolone so not a real fan of the wiz but at the Tavern they cooked it just the way we wanted it and it was delicious!!!!  I come once a year to see my Phillies play and we will definitely be back!! Thanks for the great food and service guys!!!
