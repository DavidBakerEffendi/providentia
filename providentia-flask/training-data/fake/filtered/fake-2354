I love pancakes. And I'm guilty of being too lazy to make them at home and too lazy to get up in time to get a table at the Clinton Street Bakery. So I resolved to drag myself out of bed and got here in time to grab the last free seat. As this is February, pancake month, the special was far too tempting to pass up. Poached apple and walnut. They were sublime. I thought the two slices of apple on top were all the apple I'd get: wrong. The pancakes had apple in them and accompanied by the triumphant maple butter my tastebuds were in heaven. The service was fast, friendly and they refilled my coffee 3 times which has never happened to me anywhere before. I'd recommend you get here early if you want breakfast/brunch because waiting outside in a Nor'Easter isn't the happiest prospect.
