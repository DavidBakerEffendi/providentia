I'm sure the food is amazing; however the blonde takin people's name for seating is really stupid and not capable of doing a simple job.   -  take down your guest name -  call them when it's their turn to eat Her style is to take your name and forget about you....unless she knows you. This girl told me (table for 2) it would be 30 minutes. Standing outside the restaurant for 45 minutes, watching her seat people that showed up after us. I approached her and asked how long it would be. She asked my name, searches for it on multiple pages of paper and then says, "you haven't waited long enough, it's going to be at least 30 to 45 more minutes" I asked if she ever wrote my name on the list and she said for me to please wait outside. F*ch her and F*uck Jack's wife Freda's" The dumb blonde should have admitted that she neglected to write my name down and tell me I'm next....not "you haven't waited long enough"
