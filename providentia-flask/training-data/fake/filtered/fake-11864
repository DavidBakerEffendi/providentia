Best pizza in Morris County! Crazy Busy- Plan on eating before 5pm or plan on waiting. Wait staff is down right rude- Don't come here for the service. But the food is just so good, it is hard to stay away. Delicious bread- Toasties are an acquired taste but Love them! The Eggplant Melanzane is my favorite if I'm not going for the pizza. Truly everything on the menu is delicious- Have never had a bad meal- Just bad service- But hey, keep your sense of humor and just keep eating! Newly renovated bar is beautiful-
