This was a good place for me an my guy friend I am dating. The food had a good greek taste to it, I ordered the Chicken Platter It had tasty pita bread that came with it. What I did not like to give it a 5 star the parking we had to look for a while to get a fair spot to park. But I look to Return Again In The Future.
