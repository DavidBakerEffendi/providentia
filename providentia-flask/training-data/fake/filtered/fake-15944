Was in NYC for the weekend and discovered this fairly recently opened gem.  Finally a place in NOLITA that serves authentic italian food.  We had the timballo and the burrata to start.  The timballo was delicious and the burrata was fresh.  The real surprise is the pizza - having spent many summers in Italy I can tell you that this is as close to the real deal as you can get (they use organic flour).  The pasta we had was the taglierini which was cooked perfectly al dente and had the right amount of porcini and truffle..awesome. We finished our meal with the tiramisu (what else) and the brule.  Perfect ending to a great  dining experience.  The ambience is.. well, NYC...Wood, iron, industrial lights, very cool and very welcoming.  The wine the waiter suggested was the negroamaro (Kalema) and it was as good as he said.  I'm from southern italy so I appreciated it.   Thanks to Piacere! Real italian and really good honest food.  We will be back.
