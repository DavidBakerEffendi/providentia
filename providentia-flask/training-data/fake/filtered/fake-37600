The pizza is bad, the staff is rude, they just sound angry when they take your order, like you're wasting their time & delivery takes way too long!! A bad experience from start to bad-tasting end. I was dog-sitting for a friend over the weekend and am glad New Haven pizza is way better with nicer people.
