This family friendly restaurant was a lovely surprise.  My server Olga was attentive and knowledgeable about the menu and she was great with the children.  No request was to small for her and she did everything with such a great attitude.  She earned every cent of her tip.  We left her more than 20% because of her great attitude and attention to detail. I wouldn't go there for the food alone.  It wasn't worth it.  To be truthful, I have had better Columbian food at little holes in the wall scattered around the city.  But if you want to sit down with the kiddies and have a couple of drinks with the adults in your life....this is your place.  Don't get me wrong, they do some things in a stupendous way.  The side dishes are one of them.  The kale can't be beat and the red beans are a must have.  The meats do NOT impress on any level.  The empanadas were quite lovely but nothing you couldn't get anywhere that serves a decent empanada.  It is best to have a reservation.
