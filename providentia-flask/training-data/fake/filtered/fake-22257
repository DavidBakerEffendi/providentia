Absolutely fantastic experience. Siggy's changed the way I think of health food places. It was so delicious, I had the Gluten free garlic olive oil pasta with artichokes and kale, it tasted so fresh you forget all about the health purpose of it. my friend had the organic steak sandwich and he was in heaven. There is a dish for every diet needs, The space is a work of art, smiling faces everywhere. So lucky to have Siggy's on our block. Highly recommended.
