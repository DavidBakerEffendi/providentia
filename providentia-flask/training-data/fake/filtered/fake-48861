There food here is horrible nothing is complete every plate is served half cooked ther do not use gloves while makin or serving your food and I highly doubt there food preper uses gloves because I have seen him handling food with out gloves that is very unsanitized nd can cause bodily illnesses I would not take my kids there and take a chance of them becoming ill due to unsanitized workers and foods the front line has consistantly cought arguing and exchanging bad words to where we the customers can hear them it is very pricey for cheap half cooked food I have a degree in this field and this restaurant is really unsanitary and they will get adults and children sick if not already have I would not come here ever again and neither should you or your kids
