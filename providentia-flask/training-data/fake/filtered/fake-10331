Sadly it was the first time my husband ventured out of the circle of always good favorites!   My daughter and I were quite disappointed for the 1st time the hubby was visiting this restaurant!   Service was great! Our waiter was attentive, knowledgeable as well as not too over attentive! Unfortunately the food was not up to par the night we went (  8/12)). My breast of chicken needed a steak knife, the zucchini flowers were only breadcrumbs and egg and super bland!. ... The specials... We ended upbringing them home.. Only to toss our the next day!   I've always enjoyed them before ( 3 or 4times for lunch)  but I willNOR spend all thaoney for terrible food again. ( $160.00 for 3 adults... One beer, one wine 3 dinners, 2 apps)
