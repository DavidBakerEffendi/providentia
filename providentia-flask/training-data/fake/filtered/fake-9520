The server took a while to seat us- there is no clear arrangement of who one should ask to be seated. Though some servers saw us waiting at the entrance, they took a while to seat us-even though seats were available. They were impatient when taking our order (even though we already knew what we wanted, they neglected to tell us at the start that they were out of one of the items) and we had to ask twice for the check. The food came out fast and tasted fine, but nothing out of this world.
