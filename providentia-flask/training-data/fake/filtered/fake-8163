Great place! I stopped in here the other day with a few girl friends after having a horrible time at another local bar, and thank goodness! The bar area is small, but the bartender was a really cool dude. I got the Sangria, so yummy. A few of my friends got some apps, and they loved all of it. If you are looking for a chill spot that has great ppl and great drinks... def try this place.
