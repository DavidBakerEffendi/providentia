So... There's a big button on Empress Garden's page in the Yelp app that says "Order Delivery". DON'T DO THAT. The online ordering system itself is seamless, and supposedly your food gets delivered from some service called Dining In Philadelphia or delivery.com. Now I've never ordered food from this restaurant and this delivery service and its vague names seemed a little sketchy, but we were hungry. Â We ordered ma po tofu and chicken for delivery at 6:45pm. At 8:00pm, I called the number in the email confirmation to check on the order. The number led to a voicemail system for the administrative office of the delivery service (under yet another vague name). Hmmm. So I called the restaurant and reached a lady who yelled, "You pick up!!" a bunch of times as I tried to inquire about our food order. Then she hung up on me. Then I called some other number in the confirmation email and reached an actually very nice lady who kept me on hold for a while as she tried to call the restaurant (probably got yelled at), and then finally returned to my call and cancelled the order. Fine. It was about 8:30 at this point. We made quesadillas and went to sleep. 9:30pm.... Phone rings repeatedly. It's the delivery guy! He's outside! Almost 3 hours after we ordered! I tell him we ordered hours ago and had since cancelled the order. He is dismayed and says no one told him. A few minutes later he calls back and says he talked to someone and we can have the food anyway. I said thanks but we ate already.
