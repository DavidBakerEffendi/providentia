I've always had a decent experience at Hu, and love the food lifestyle philosophy they subscribe to. However this morning the service was brusque and unfriendly. There were 4 other customers at the juice/coffee bar, it was not busy at all. I was ordering the demi vert and the fellow helping me directed me to the fridge for the pre-made juices. The one I wanted wasn't there, and he was very reluctant to make a fresh one for me. When he handed me the juice, he asked if I wanted a straw and threw it at me. The woman ringing me up on the register was rude as well. The manager made a weak apology which did not seem genuine at all. I am never going back there. Their branding it great, but it does not follow through to the people and their attitude.
