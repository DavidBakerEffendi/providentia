We made sure to get on the wait list at 5pm Wed for a table at 8:30 that same night.   We were lucky we had to wait only 20 minutes. . Most everyone who came in for dinner had to wait 90 min, but I must say the woman at the desk was incredibly patient and very polite with everyone.   We had a great table, and the food was wonderful. But not so wonderful in terms of being so over priced.  The entrees are basically the meat or the fish with some beautifully prepared sauce. But if you want anything to side with it, you have to order that separately.  We ordered the bass, the skate, the skirt steak and the burger. The fries were so-so, the fish was terrific , the burger was kind of ordinary. However, except for the big pile of fries with the hamburger, the main dishes came with  a lot of bare dish i. At  $32,. No sides. They are extra at $8 apiece.   The portions are artfully  presented with wonderful sauces, but so small most of us  wound up eating a lot of bread - the olive oil served with the bread is amazing.  The ambiance is nice - little pigs everywhere, and the wait staff is friendly, and well trained.  But the noise level especially with the ceiling made of tin, and the pipes is so loud that it was very difficult to have a conversation. Thus the reason for the two stars  - basically that for each wonderful experience, there was a downside.  Tasty food, but small portions and way overpriced.  Friendly earthy sweet decoration, but terrible noise level, friendly well trained staff but because of the crowds, very over burdened.  I am glad I tried the Spotted Pig, but I won't be returning.
