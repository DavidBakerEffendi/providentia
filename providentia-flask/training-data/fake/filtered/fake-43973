We went to Mac's with a group of 6 and although fairly crowded, we got a table right away which was nice.  The atmosphere is nice and homey.  We were waiting for 2 people from our party to join us and starting ordering drinks and some appetizers.  The waiter took our drink orders but told us to just "order all the food at the same time."  Meaning, he would not take our appetizer order.  Odd.  Well fortunately we never saw that waiter again. And replaced with a waitress, who we learned was her first day.  We took advantage of our good fortune and ordered the apps with her instead.   Unlike the waiter, she was okay with us placing the food order although not all of us were there.  We all got out drinks except for one. Although she had previously come over and asked the person who ordered the drink if they wanted it on ice or warm.   When we didn't get it still and asked about the one missing, she looked at us like we had 2 heads.  "And what drink was that?"  Again, odd.  Took about 15 minutes, but we finally got that missing drink.  So all 6 of us arrive, we get our food.  And all is good.  Food is decent.  What happens next is (once again) odd.   One of us ordered the fish tacos which was displayed nicely in a build-your-own kind of way but way too little served of the salsa.  When one in my party asked if she could get a little more of the salsa, the waitress went into the kitchen to inquire and came back and said "no, he said he doesn't have enough to give you."  What?  Not an extra tomato and onion back there to cut up.  Fortunately we were all in good spirits, and in a chill mood, so those odd encounters made the evening a bit more interesting.  Would I return there?  not really sure.
