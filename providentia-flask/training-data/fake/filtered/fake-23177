Excellent meal. The sorbet trio for dessert was fabulous. Only complaint is that the portions were on the small side, I had the shrimp as an appetizer and the cod as an entree. The cod was presented beautifully, but again on the small side even for fancy NYC standards. I would definitely return because the quality of the food and service was higher than most, especially for the east village Another bonus is that I was able to make a reservation for a Friday night the same day. Definitely give this place a try before it gets too hyped.
