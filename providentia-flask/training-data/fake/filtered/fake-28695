I ordered a Rock Shrimp Tempura with Mango Chili from here to go for 6.75 and I got something I was COMPLETELY not expecting. When I got my order and opened it, it was NOT rock shrimp tempura. There were veggies in the container and BARELY any shrimp. The shrimp was not crunchy at all and were extremely tiny. I brought back the order strongly believing that this was not Rock Shrimp Tempura with Mango Chili. However, when I went back, the man working there opened it and said it was Rock Shrimp Tempura. What I got was DEFINITELY NOT rock shrimp tempura. Neither was it worth the 6.75 I spent on it. The "Mango Chili" sauce that came with it tasted like a spicy fish sauce-like they mixed fish sauce with sriracha. I'm probably never going back here again after experiencing this.
