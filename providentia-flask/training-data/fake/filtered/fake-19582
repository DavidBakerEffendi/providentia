There's one reason I keep going back to Tres Jalape√±os: the wet burritos. Whether you get mole sauce, the green sauce, or the red enchilada sauce, your burrito us bound to be delicious. They also do a good margarita mix if you want to add your own tequila. Aside from some rather dry tacos on one occasion, everything I've had there has been delicious. I prefer take-out to eat-in, as the restaurant is often quite empty during the times that I've dined there. Service is generally very friendly, and they assemble take-out orders very quickly. When I've made special requests on GrubHub and Seamless, they've always gotten it right.
