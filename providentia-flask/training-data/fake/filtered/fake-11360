this place is the BEST!  however, it's a very different dining experience, and you've got to be prepared in order to maximize your pleasure.  I've read bad reviews of this place, and it's usually because the writer didn't take the time to get the lay of the land, to properly understand how the place works.  A map would help, and I have yet to find it if it exists.  I'd advise you to check out a few different counters, the seafood, the pasta, etc, and be willing to experiment.  Order what you're familiar with.  The place can overwhelm with variety and size!  But the food is excellent, the atmosphere very fun and lively, the workers very friendly!
