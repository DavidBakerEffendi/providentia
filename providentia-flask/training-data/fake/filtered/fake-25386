One of our favorite spots in the city - our family & friends will attest to this as we've brought all of our out-of-town guests here :) We love love love the grilled corn & coming here for brunch on the weekends. Cafe con leche and Mexican hot chocolate on a cold fall/winter morning, yum! But a few of our favorites have disappeared off the brunch menu (pancakes with caramel & chilaquiles), thus the 4 star review...
