I was looking for a nice fancy restaurant (non commercial one) and this popup. I was impressed with the way everyone explained their experience at this place. I visited the website and got even more impressed so decided to come here for our anniversary dinner. Our night was so special as we entered to this hidden gem. First impression a lovely cozy place with a lot of charm and Italian feel to it. We were greeted and as we had reservation made we were seating in last than few minutes. Our server was extremely pleasant and knowledgably. The place is totally made for you to feel that you are not in Dirty jersey any more ;) :p. The restaurant is small so don't hope for a big place with a lot of room. It is super comfortable and cozy. We ordered our food and everything from start to end was totally unbelievable. Love the way everything was coming on proper time giving us plenty of time to relax, talk, and enjoy wine with great ambiance. Place is clean, food is great, prices are very reasonable (not for college kids) and this is a perfect spot for a romantic night out. We already went back for lunch and got the same 5 star experience all over again. Lunch you get soup or Salad so it's even better. It's a BYOB and they also carry some decent wine collection. We will be back here soon.
