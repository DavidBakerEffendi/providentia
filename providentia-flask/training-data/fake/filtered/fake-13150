This place deserves the hype it gets. The burgers are cheap (only $5) and the old grills give it a flavor that you can't find anywhere else. The cheese sauce they used makes me not even care they don't offer ketchup. The potato salad is as fantastic as the burgers and as a bonus they offer Foxon Park soda.
