I went to Calandras 2 weekends ago with my future mother-in-law.   To start, the soup was watered down.  It tasted like the cook was too lazy to make fresh soup and just added tons of extra water.  My mother-in-law's turkey sandwich was overloaded with oil and was missing provolone cheese.  I guess I should have checked everything before we left but because my experience in the past was great so I didn't think it was necessary.  Needless to say I will never be taking my mother-in-law back to your Italian Village again.
