I have lived in the city for 7 years and go out to eat all of the time. I have been to Sampan a few times and wanted to bring my family who was visiting from out of town to a great restaurant. I have always had consistently good food here. The problem wasn't the food so much as the server. She was extremely rushed with us, and before we had our last course she placed the check on the table without anyone asking for it. She didn't offer us after dinner drinks and really didn't even seem to care - just wanted to flip a table. She put the check on the table and said "I'll take this when your done." Well we had no food on the table, and we were still waiting so it was impossible to be done. Â I thought it was one of the rudest experiences I have ever had at a restaurant dining out in Philly I called to speak with the manager the next day and got a voice mail. I did not receive a call back and had to call back myself two days later. I spoke with him and he was actually really nice offering me his sincerest apologies and told me this was not a typical dining experience for the restaurant. He said he would love to have me back so I can be treated with the level of respect customers are normally treated, and would love to offer me a gift card. He took all of my information and told me that he would send me a gift card in the mail. I live 5 blocks from Sampan so if he actually sent me a gift card it would of showed up that week. It isn't the promise of a free meal, but the fact that the manager was going to do something to rectify the situation and never did. He lied just to appease me in hopes that I would forget about how awful of an experience my family had at Sampan. It is really disappointing and I will think twice before bringing someone back to this restaurant or suggesting it to so many people who often ask my opinion on where to eat.
