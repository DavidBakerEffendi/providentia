The worst experience I have ever had at a caf√©. It was pathetic, and primarily due to the owner. The girl who waited on me, who did not seem to know what she was doing, went back to make my meal leaving no one at the counter to wait on the long line of people. The owner came to help make lattes for people who came in after me. She did not greet the customers, even though the latte station is in front of the register. There were several people working but they were prepping or bringing cardboard downstairs. There was no structure, just utter chaos. I do not recommend this place, especially since the owner showed no concern for her customers. I work in the restaurant industry and couldn't imagine not helping or acknowledging my customers. I am appalled!!
