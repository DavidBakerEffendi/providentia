I'm a regular at this place, and never seem to get tired of it. Came here during Halloween and they get an A for effort for decorating this place up. Everything is fresh and clean. They actually bring the condiments to your table unlike other places where it's communal. I didn't find it to be expensive. Sure it's not all you can eat, but I spend less money compared to other hotpot AYCE places and I'm pretty full still. Place is small so I would recommend booking ahead if you have a big party.
