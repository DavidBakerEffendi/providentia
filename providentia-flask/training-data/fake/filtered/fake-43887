I LOVE this place!  The Taproom is great because it has so many veggie options for me, and also lots of meat dishes for the hubby.  I have been here too many times to count, and I have tried all the vegetarian options on the menu.  My current fave is the shepard's pie.  I also swoon for the mushroom grinder.  I get the fried pickles almost every time, which are apparently local pickles with a nice light breading.  I know I don't have to mention the beer, but I love that I can come here and try something new every single time!  The only drawback is their lack of high chairs for my toddler and the huge crowds that started after they were featured on the Food Network.  Good for them, but bad for the regular neighborhood folks just trying to get a table.
