Just went to Front Street Bistro for the first time after watching a movie at the theater.  We sat at the bar.  Service was great and the bartender was personable and friendly.  Had delicious salmon sliders and guacamole.  Actually ordered a second order of guacamole and chips since we enjoyed the first one so much with a Sam Adams draft. Happy hour prices were excellent.  Definitely will go back.
