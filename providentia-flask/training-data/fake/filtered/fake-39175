Lillie's has so much potential.  Came here with 5 friends for a night out.  Like many others have said the atmosphere is pretty great!  Drinks were good.  Food was pretty good.  The killer was the service.  It was downright awful.  Clearly our table was an after thought and the waitress was too busy for her own good.  The hostesses (yes, there were two.  One really should have helped out the drowning server) just sat at the hostess podium and acted like a couple of stuck up snobs.  I don't care what career field you are in NYC trying to break in to, (dancer, actor, dancing actor or starving model) YOU ARE A HOSTESS.  That is your paying job at this point in time, so quit talking shit IN FRONT OF CUSTOMERS and do your damn job. In the restaurant/bar industry you are only as good as the people you have working for you.  Lastly, someone should tell the DJ (term used loosely, I don't actually know where the music was coming from)  that it isn't ironic-cool to play "Baby Got Back".  It's pretty lame actually.  C'mon Lillie!  You have the perfect ingredients for a kick ass establishment!  Let's kick it up a notch.
