We came here because we had a living social voucher, but i would definitely come back.   I had the quesadilla- which was so good! It's not an American quesadilla at all with just meat cheese and veggies but filled with all sorts of deliciousness- rice, beans, etc. It also came with fries. In addition to that we shared two papusas and flan. We also had three drinks and our bill was low  Plus I still had half my quesadilla to take home since it was very large. I also give them credit- it seems like they are reading the reviews because A) when I asked for water the server asked if I wanted tap or bottled for $1 B) spoke English to us, or at least enough to communicate back and forth ( but even if they didn't, the menu is in English- you can get by) and C) was very friendly and food came out quick.   Great place
