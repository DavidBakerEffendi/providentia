The first visit to this restaurant was a disappointment.  The appetizer (Greek dips) was only mediocre, and my main course was not good (fish, but i don't recall which) and the side dish of some kind of rice mixture with vegetables was awful.  (none of the four of us could eat it).  We went back last Monday as there aren't a lot of choices on a Monday, and the friends we were joning had had a very good meal there.  This time it was really good!!!  The dips were much better, and  another appetizer of fried zucchini chips also very good.  The bronzino was dellicious and now we are going back tomorrow night and bringing some other friends.
