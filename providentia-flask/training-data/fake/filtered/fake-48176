My order was missing the 2 sides of ketchup I requested and it was poorly packaged. The paperbag was so wet from the steam of the fries that it crumbled and the fries were basically just sitting in the plastic bag- very unsanitary. Also, the sauces that I did receive were half open and leaking. I will never order from here again nor will I recommend it.
