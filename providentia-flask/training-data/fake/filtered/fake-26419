Dead Rabbit is a cocktail bar in the financial district. It's very much a speak easy atmosphere. The drinks are very good but on the pricey side. Try the Scottish Egg appetizer, it's egg with Sausage. The downstairs can be pretty cramped but still a good time. I wish they had a bit more space downstairs at the main bar.
