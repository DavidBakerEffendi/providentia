This place is awful! Not only was the food below average (although it was very cheap) but I am allergic to shellfish and asked the waiter specifically if the wontons had any shrimp or other seafood in them and he said no. Then I said "ok, just to be absolutely positive there is only pork in the wontons, nothing else at all. No shrimp" And he said "Yes, only pork". Well luckily the food was hot and I cut the wonton in half- to discover it was filled with shrimp! I couldn't eat any of my meal and the people I was with didn't eat any of theirs because it was low grade meat and greasy.
