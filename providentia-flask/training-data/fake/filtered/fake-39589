just went to this oh so well-known thai restaurant in queens,,, and must say that my views are mixed... for one,,,the appie of bbq pork roasted in honey in chili was very delicious... it was tender, the restaurant gave plenty of it, and very flavorful... however, we then ordered the pad see u with beef and chinese broccoli, and must say it was mediocre,,, the tastes were unordinary,,,and it seemed like a dish that one could find anywhere.... we ordered thai ICE teas, good as usual,,, and then a mango with sticky rice dessert that was still good,,,very fresh mango,,,,made the meal better.....service was fine,,,, meal was good, but lackluster main entree dish keeps the meal from being 5 star worthy or even 4...
