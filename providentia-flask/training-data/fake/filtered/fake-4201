OMG this is the best restaurant I have ever been to!. The whole experience was amazing! Our waiter was a young man who treated us like we were the only people there.  He was amazing which is good because he was at our table so much cooking our meat. I have wanted to try korean food for years since I am korean drama addict and it was everything I had hoped it would be! We ordered the Galbi and the brisket and both were delicious. The sides were fantastic too! I also finally got to try soju even though they were not yet selling as they had just gotten their liquor license our waiter brought a shot to try...it was also great! I can't wait to go back and bring my friends and family!  I hope I get the same waiter every time I go!
