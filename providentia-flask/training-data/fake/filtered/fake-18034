This was only my second time visiting this place. I had the half bbq, fries and green salad. The sauce on the chicken was good and the salad could have used some cheese and onions. I did ask for the onions and was giving them so that was fine. My Aunt had the salmon and she enjoyed it. The lemonade was sweet. I will come back next time I visit.
