This place was such a disappointment.  Overcrowded and way overpriced.  Their vegan options are a joke.  In a space that enormous, in the middle of NYC why can't they have ample vegan options, especially in this day and age?  I've never seen so many animal products in one space other than a butcher shop EVER.
