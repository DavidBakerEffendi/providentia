Mercato is AMAZING!!!!! That's all I can say, I'ma foody-wino and really think this is one of the best spots in Philly: Yes, sometimes you have to wait for a table but so be it: The food is amazing; quality ingredients, excellent execution, and mammoth portions. Granted 'mammoth' portions are not usually synonymous with haute cuisine, but I guarantee you that in this case, quantity and quality go hand in hand. The staff is friendly as well, the location is perfect if you're looking for a night out on the town, and this place works for couples as well as for groups of 4-5 friends. Give it a try, folks; you will not regret it.
