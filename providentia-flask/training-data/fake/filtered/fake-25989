The Great Wazu is my absolute favorite.  I can't go a full week without having one.  It's the best sandwich place around, hands-down.  My Wazu friend who mans the slicer knows my favorite sandwich and makes it perfect every time.  I have NEVER been disappointed.  I just ate there yesterday and just writing this review is giving me a terrible craving.  My little nieces love it so much they eat a full sub every time and beg me to take them there for a "dream sandwich".  I LOVE WAZU!  Can you tell?!
