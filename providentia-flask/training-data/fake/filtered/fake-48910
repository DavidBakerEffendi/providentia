I'd written a negative review about Almond before. First, my review was filtered. So I wrote an 'update' and it apparently went through. Long story short, had a solid meal there but service was not good. Management seemed to be aware of this but only reached out to part of our group to make amends, ignoring the rest of us. The owner reached out to me through yelp to directly apologize. I really appreciate that, it's great to see a business owner at a high volume restaurant who cares to reach out to individuals, and i'm confident that next time I'm there - on my next trip to New York - Â the experience will be different. So, I'm now a fan of Almond. The food was good from the beginning, now I know they take pains to follow up and reach out to customers who aren't happy with service.
