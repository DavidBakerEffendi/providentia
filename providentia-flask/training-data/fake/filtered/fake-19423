i love freddy and tony's on front and indiana. their food is always fresh and delicious. i've eatten there many times and have never gotten sick. however, yesterday (sunday), they were closed so we decided to order from the one on 2nd and allegheny. never again. several hours later i was sick to death. way over priced. we ordered a steak platter with two can sodas and two alcapurrias and were charged $17. with $17 we could have gotten a large rice, steak, totones, two bottled sodas and two alcapurrias at front and indiana. my opinion...freddy and tony's front and indiana all day. freddy and tony's 2nd and allegheny not at all...
