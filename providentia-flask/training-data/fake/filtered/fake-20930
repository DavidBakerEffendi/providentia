I have been going here several times a week for a while but I must say the quality has experienced a noticable decline Â in the past month... The cilantro in the sardine sandwich is inconsistent and this sandwich could now easily be called the cucumber sandwich because that's what its main meat seems to be... But, well, it's only 4.25 bux... so... if you are hungry... why not?
