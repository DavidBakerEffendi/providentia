We live near this new restaurant and were excited to learn that it had opened for business.  So went Friday night and what a disappointment.  To begin, the place a very loud and you also have to scream to  be heard.  The ambiance is okay.  I ordered a Capt. Morgan on the rocks and got a very small glass of rum.  When I looked at the bill, the charged $6.50 for the rum and $1.50 for the ice.  Outrageous!! My wife ordered crab cakes and she got 2 fairly large and nicely made with mostly crab and little filling.  I ordered Peking Duck for $25, and sadly it was overcooked and tough.  It came with risotto which was very good.  The bartender was not friendly and in fact became rude when I asked about the price for the ice.  The waitress was friendly, but failed to tell us about the specials.  All in all, very disappointing and will not be back.
