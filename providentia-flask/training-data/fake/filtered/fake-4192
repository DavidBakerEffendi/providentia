We had a party of 18 to celebrate three birthdays. I reserved a spot 24 hours in advance for a 5 p.m slot and even confirmed the day of. As we walked in, before seating us, the manager told us we had  to leave by 7pm.  I asked her, "why didnt she tell me over the phone that there was a time limit to eat at the restaurant  since i called twice ?"  She replies, "sorry but i booked another party at 7 so you have to leave. No one eats over 2 hours."  I told her that i booked. 24 hrs in advance so she justified it by telling me her next party booked it a week in advanced. Then, i said i had a party of. 18  which is a large number, she tells me the party coming at 7 has 19.  I was so shocked and stunned that everything i said had a response to justify that my party of 18 was not important since the party after me was larger and had booked, clearly, way in advance than i did! The manager wanted us to leave at 7 yet only assigned us one waiter.  She wasn't understanding or compassionate to the fact that we were celebrating 3 birthdays at their restaurant! We had to rush the cake cuttin and eating because she came in and said we had to be understanding to her!!! I refuse to support a company/ restaurant who mistreat their customers.   Food was typical korean taste, nothing out of the ordinary to make it special.  Water tasted like chlorine. However, there were many side dishes(small amount) and there udon seafood soup was good. Besides that, the worst experience ever and fully regret booking with them!
