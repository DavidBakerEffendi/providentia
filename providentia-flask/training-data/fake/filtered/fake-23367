La Lanterna used to be a charming West Village spot where authentic Italian food was paired with good service. Alas this is no more. I returned last week after a short hiatus to find that the place has gone down the drain: tried, unmotivated servers and an out-of-stock kitchen and cellar. 1. Our bottle of white wine came warm, poorly dressed in a plastic chiller that nothing could do to cool the wine; 2. Mozzarella was out. I can understand if the catch of a day is out after 11pm but mozzarella? In an Italian restaurant? That meant that both our chosen appetizers (Caprese and Farro con Bufala) were not available. We patiently opted for Rucola (that came with three thin slices of parmigiano) and a bland farro salad with... farro; 3. Prosciutto con Stracchino was not available because... stracchino, a common Italian cheese, was out; 4. Same for our choice of "3 cheeses" cheese platter: taleggio, stracchino and fontina (two of which were out); 5. Having downed the bottle of warm wine in despair, we asked for one glass of the house Sauvignon Blanc, but needless to say that too was out. To clarify: of three house wines, one of them was out. At this point, our sever had notified Vittorio, who came to our table to explain that it had been a "busy night" (although it was only 8.45pm) and apologised if most of our choices were not available. He then presented us with our check: 90 dollars. Â I am sorry Vittorio but your dinner was not worth 9 dollars: it was a miserable evening and a complete disappointment. Someone needs to take a look in the refrigerator before opening the doors to the public, or not open them at all.
