My husband and I are going to have to begin going to Mogador in cognito because it is starting to get a bit embarrassing for us to show our faces there several times a week!  It is not that they are unwelcoming ... on the contrary, they are always so happy to see us, and treat us like royalty.  What a delightful place! We've been for lunch, when they have an insanely reasonable special.  I get the chicken tagine with a tangy spicy cilantro sauce (for only $11), and my husband usually gets the grilled salmon nicoise salad ($15).  We go back and back! For dinner, they have a chicken grill accompanied by an Arabic Salad, with rice and a small serving of cucumber and yogurt.  The chicken is simple, yet seasoned and grilled to perfection.  The atmosphere is cozy and comfortable for dinner, with small candles twinkling at every table. The servers all have just the right touch.  They seem to show up when we need them, or are tucked away when we are in a conversation.  And, they are all so attractive!  There is a surprise in the back of the space, with a covered garden that is usable all year long.  It is very nicely done. We are watching our sugar intake, but the people at the table next to us were oohing and ahhing over their dessert.  Maybe next time, for a treat!  I have a feeling I won't have to wait too long.
