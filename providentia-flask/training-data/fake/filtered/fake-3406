The two words that sums up my experience would be "rude service". The girls who worked here were unpleasant and it felt like you were bothering them by ordering anything and not to mention they were constantly gossiping. The lady making the cheese steaks also had the same attitude because once she was done making the cheese steak she just went out to where the customers were sitting to talk with some of her friends. The manager was the nicest person there but he was in the back for what seemed like forever. The actual cheese steak was blah for the seven bucks I paid; even the lunch carts at my school have better ones for a lot cheaper. The negatives of the cheese steak would have to be that they give you a tiny bit of cheese, dry meat, and the rolls aren't the freshest. The positives of the cheese steak would have to be that the fried onions on it were pretty decent. My sister got the chicken and she said it was pretty good and that's why I gave it two stars instead of one. Overall if you want a cheese steak do yourself a favor and find some other place to go unless you want a slightly less than mediocre overpriced sandwich and believe me I know good cheese steaks after living in Philadelphia for my whole life. Try Tony Luke's, Geno's, or Falone's Â you'll be happy you did.
