Celebrated my 31st birthday here with my Friends.I so glad. The food was excellent. The place was packed and noisy but fun. The yuca fries were also incredible, My favorite part of the meal was the Empanadas..Loco Tuesday Â half-priced tapas and happy hour drinks. Consistently exceptional service and food from this place, Our waiter was really good with checking up on us.I don't remenber his name,but I know his from Brazil. I got a Caipirinha, Brazilian drink it's amazing also yucajito really good. The drinks are great, stick with the sangria and Caipirinha and you can't go wrong. The food was excellent. We loved everything we ordered . we had a great time .we will go back. recommend this place
