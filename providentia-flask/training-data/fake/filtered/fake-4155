Fantastic, fresh food in a charming little spot. Not sure if the other commenters came on an off-day, but I've always had brisk, very friendly service. We ordered 3 plates for lunch (a beautiful burrata, tomato and arugula salad; kale salad; and chicken milanese) and got them within minutes - with perfect presentation and great flavors. Good pastries and coffee, too.
