I love Sanfords, and for one reason: the meat. And I'm not talking about no dish you order off the menu. I'm talking about ARMANDO, baby. Oh my god, what a hottie he is. I probably shouldn't tell you all this, but one night me and my friends Dave and Shawn came in after a night of clubbing, and Armando was there looking absolutely divine. We all had some drinks, and he came back to our place and had a serious f-in party. I have never been manhandled like that. Shawn almost threw out his back. Armando was just so strong. He's a soccer player, boys. A goalie, and boy what hands. So yeah. If you fellas are out in Astora late night and you want something hot for the afterhours, go to Sanfords and ask for our favorite manager, Armando. Que paso, Armando, you naughty naughty nino.
