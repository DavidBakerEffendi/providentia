Tandoori Bites is THE best Indian restaurant in Princeton.  I live two hours away and drive down once a month to feast in the restaurant and then also take home a huge order for later.  The food is amazing and fresh.  The ingredients are high quality.  I have had almost every dish they make and really enjoy the buffet, but I usually go for the Goat Curry, Lamb Curry, or the Tandoori Chicken.
