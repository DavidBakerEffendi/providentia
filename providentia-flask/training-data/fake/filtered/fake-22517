The location is great, but its menu is defiantly overpriced. Â I honestly have no problem paying extra for a great meal, but Mediterra will not perform. I tried a couple times in the past year. Sometimes the meal is good, and others is not. What doesn't change is that the average quality of the food justified its price. If you like wine, you will enjoy the extensive wine list
