The tour was a total delight!  My friends and I had a blast filling out the Pocket Pizza Journals along the way and comparing notes.  The pizza had variety and was all so delicious.  I learned more about pizza ovens, pizza history, and pizza ingredients than I knew was possible.  Scott's enthusiasm is totally infectious.  I highly recommend this tour to locals and non-locals alike.
