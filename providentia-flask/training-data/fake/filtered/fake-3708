The chocolate chip cookies at Boubouki are some of the BEST I've ever had! I've never had such wonderous chocolate chip cookies! How good? My gentleman and I travelled out of our way, from the UES all the way to the Essex Market this past Friday just to get some of these cookies. Luckily, there were 3 left which we promptly scooped up. We also tried some of the almond shortbread, which were equally amazing. I'm looking forward to trying the spinach pie on our next trip to New York.
