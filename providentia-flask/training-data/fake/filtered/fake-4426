We really like going to the Belgium cafe at the end of week for a relaxed easy dinner.  Food is always consistently good.  It is hard to find a great croque masouir. Hope I didn't butcher the spelling....my one issue is some of the staff is exceptionally friendly and some are just So miserable it can ruin your meal.
