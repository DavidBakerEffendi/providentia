After visiting the Republic of Georgia three years ago I fell in love with the hospitality of the people and soulful savory cuisine of this nation nestled in between the Caucus Mountains.  There are few Georgian restaurants in the USA so whenever we are in NYC we make sure one of our evening meals is Georgian.  This week we were able to introduce Georgian cuisine to a friend. Thank Old Tbilisi Garden for opening in Manhattan.  We arrived too late on Saturdsy night -the kitchen had closed, but we stayed and enjoyed a few glasses of wine because Georgian wine is some of the finest in the world.  But we returned Sunday with a friend who never had Georgian food. Now she is a convert. We started with the tomato cucumber walnut salad, followed by the baked cheese filled pastry-Khachapuri was excellent, as were the dumplings, the trout (the whole fish with tail and head). The lamb kabob was prepared to perfection.  We will be back.
