Great fried chicken! Price is really cheap and the service is great. I'm going to try the gyros or lamb over rice next. They're open until 12am, but if they were open later it'd be a great stop for late night drunk food. As it is, I now know where to go if I get a hankering for some good fast food that's not some national chain. Close to the train station too!
