This place is our little piece of heaven. So lucky we found it! Everything is delicious here. The place is small, but it's clean and the people who work there are Awesome! Things to try "treasure cups" if your feeling down it will put a smile on your face!!! I promise. This place is wonderful I would give it a 10 star if I could!!!
