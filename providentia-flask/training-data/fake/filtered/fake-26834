i really like this place - definitely a better bet than chiptole or other taco/burrito joints in nyc.  i ove the chicken quesadilla - it's great to grab and go when you need something on the run.  the chicken is always flavorful and the salsas are really fresh.   the place gets packed though but the line usually moves quick. still, it's best to go after the lunch rush.
