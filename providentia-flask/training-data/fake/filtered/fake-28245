I ate here on my last trip to New York last month and I was pleasantly surprised. Not only did they have my favorite Belgian beer but also the matching glass with it. This was the first time I had 'hopus' in New York! The waitress served it perfectly and when she opened it, it popped like a champagne cork like it should. The crevettes where awesome and the mussels where great too! Everybody from the staff was really friendly and helpful with all our needs. I am definitely going back on my next trip so I can try some more of their eclectic beer selection.
