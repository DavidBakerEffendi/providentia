For around $5, you get a nice sized bahn mi, stuffed with really great meats, nice pickled carrots and good sauces. And all of these things are perfectly portioned so it's not like too much bread or an overwhelming amount of carrot. Jussttt rightttt and Â the flavor is soooo good. Also I must say, they're bahn mi/kimchee fries are excellent. Now those are a bit overpriced (I think also around $5) but they're so so yummy and addicting!! Technically I consider this a fast good place, and I suppose that's something to keep in mind. Yeah it's gonna be kinda cramped, sometimes it can get hot, and the service is quick and not very personal, but it's not rude or unbearable at all. Overall, the sandwiches are really good here, and I'm really looking forward to tasting them all at some point!
