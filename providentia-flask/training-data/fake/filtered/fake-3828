I got 4 different price quotes for each of the 4 times I asked for a price for a tray of only 6 grilled chicken breasts.   Was quoted a price and was told I could call in my order.  Couple of days later, called in the order and was quoted a higher price.  When I questioned the increase, someone else came on the phone and didn't know the price.  Called the first person back a couple of days later who told me they would be "about $1.50 per piece".    Called my order in, went to pick it up and was told the highest price yet!  When I questioned yet another increase, I was yelled at and told the first guy was "only a kid and didn't know"!   When he started to tell me all about how much he had to pay for chicken breasts I knew this place didn't have much control and decided to go elsewhere for better service.
