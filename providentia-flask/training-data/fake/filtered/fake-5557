The only reason I am giving this one star is strictly because of the manager that was on duty when I was there. We went for restaurant week and very excited to go. Heard great reviews about the food and especially the chocolate.  Our reservation was for 7:30 but didn't walk in til 7:35. We were seated right away. We looked over the.menus, read all about the chocolates. And no one came over. We waited about 10 mins til I finally made eye contact with the server. She brought us water and took our order. 15 to 20 mins later mm u boyfriend asked to speak with the manager. Our drinks haven't come out yet.  After speaking with her I witnessed her going behind the bar and making our drinks.  Our server came over and said the drinks are on the manager. Right after our appetizers came out, one right one wrong, but cold. As we finished the apps and the server removed the food our entrée came out. This time hot. I am not saying what we had be this review is not about the food it's about the service. We finished and our dessert was right out. OK here's the thing. Our server never asked if we were ok, if we needed anything she never checked. She never asked if we wanted another drink. We could have had one but we're afraid it would have taken another 20 mins. As we were ready to pay we asked to speak with the manger again. We explained to her why we were unhappy with our service. Between my boyfriend and I we have been to many restaurants in philly. He is a chef at a culinary school. Simple things a server does she didn't do. The manager was very sorry, and has asked us to come back and try again. Hopefully next time it is better service We were leaving and so was another table of our servers.  We asked how their time here was and they said terrible. Sooo tye food was good, again my apps were cold. I had the meatballs, salmon and my boyfriend had the spinach dip and also salmon. The fondue was great! Fingers crossed for next time
