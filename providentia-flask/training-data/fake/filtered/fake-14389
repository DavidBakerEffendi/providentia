Coming from a Spanish person who's grown up eating Spanish food, I have to admit that this is the best I've had outside my own dad's cooking. It's quaint, decently priced, and the quality you get is incomparable to anywhere else. Come here and you will not be disappointed. My boyfriend and I usually order one of the dinners (priced around 11-15 dollars). We both fill up and have more to take home. I have yet to find anywhere better.
