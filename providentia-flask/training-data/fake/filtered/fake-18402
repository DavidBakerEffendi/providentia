Not the typical Cuban restaurant I'm used to in Miami and North Jersey, I just visited this restaurant on 10/11/09 after reading a review on gophila Not what I expected at all. The dining room is a cocktail lounge with small cocktail tables, the food is not the typical Cuban food I expected. It is over priced for the small food portions they give. Dining room is too dark where one have trouble reading the menu. After filling out their comment card I was approached by the general manager, one Mr. Mark Dombkoski or perhaps DUMBkoski, who after I complaint claimed that the restaurant was not a Cuban restaurant. EXCUSED ME. THEY SURE G HAD ME FOOLED. WONT RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE IT SUCKS
