I went here for a vegan"Nice Kream" date. My friend ordered the 9oz O' Ginger Snap! and I ordered the 9oz Mr. Cookie Munster. First of all, if I hadn't walked in knowing it was a vegan restaurant, I would never known my nice kream was vegan. Both choices we made were phenomenal. We each tasted the others and found them both to be divine. The presentation of our order was beautiful. I'm very much looking forward to going back for a proper meal (Hopefully tomorrow)! As with most vegan/organic eating establishments, Positivitea is a bit on the pricey side. Our two 9oz nice kreams came to $18. If spending that kind of money on a regular basis isn't in your budget (it's not in mine) I would recommend saving a visit here for a special occasion, a little self indulgence or a well deserved treat. I HIGHLY recommend Positivitea. I'm looking forward to trying one of their vegan burgers and one of their uniquely named smoothies.
