Stopped by last night and was pleasantly surprised. Enthusiastic and energetic staff, great tapas (serrano ham croquettes and garlic & butter frog's legs..hmmm). They're still waiting on their liquor license, but eagerly offered house wine. Warm, clean, and attitude free. I'm looking forward to going back for a full meal. An after dinner stroll through the cobblestone seaport ends the evening perfectly - nice place for a date.
