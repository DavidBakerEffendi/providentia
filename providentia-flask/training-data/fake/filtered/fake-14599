I have been to the Plan B in Milford several times and each time I am thoroughly impressed.  Their craft beer list is one of the best in the state and their burgers are some of the best I've EVER had.  I'm just getting into bourbons which just by looking at the drink menu, is extensive to say the least. The layout is huge and covers a LOT of ground.  The service here is also fantastic.  My girlfriend and I informed our server that we were on our way to a show so we were in a little bit of a time crunch.  Not a problem.  We had drinks, food, payed the bill and was out the door before we knew it.  I'm particularly fond of the West Coast Burger with Truffle Tots, but have also had the Baja, BBQ Blue Cheese and Pretzel Burger... all are fantastic.  I also recommend the Disco Tots, too.  Kind of, amazing.   If you are in the Milford area or a short drive away, and are looking for some of the best Craft Beer/Burgers in the state, look no further than this place.  I highly recommend stopping in.  Bravo Plan B Milford... I'll certainly see you guys soon!
