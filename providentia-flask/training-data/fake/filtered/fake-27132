Well I gave it another shot, sometimes mistakes happen. Well I'm disappointed again, no French baguette bread, no flatbread at 7:30 pm, really. Panera bread has no bread. Anyway, changed my order, got home and the black bean soup was watered down. Last time the clam chowder was watered down, they removed the whole supply when I complained.
