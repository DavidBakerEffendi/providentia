Serving fishy unfresh seafood is completely unacceptable. I should have walked out when the appetizers came out.  I ordered the curry puff and calamari, and there were only two puffs on the plate and the calamari was fishy! Entrees:  Duck Pad Thai and Yellow Curry with Shrimp.  I should've realized that the seafood isn't fresh at this place from the calamari but I gave the shrimp a try.  Surprise -- old and fishy to the point where it was inedible, and the duck was also dry.   They charge extra for rice in teeny tiny little bowls -- like an unauthentic Chinese restaurant charging for tea.  The horror! I cannnot come back to this place -- I'm going to go throw up now. Do yourself a favor -- order the Thai Iced tea...then leave.
