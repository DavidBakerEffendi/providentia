I used to order from here all the time when I lived in Bayonne.  It was by far the best pizzeria around. All of their food is excellent!  The grilled chicken wrap is delicious!!! I've also ordered the cavatelli with broccoli and the chicken parm dinner.  My husband loves the stromboli!!! My brother still lives there and he orders so often they know his phone number when he calls, he doesn't even have to give them his address!!! My parents knew the original owners and when the new owners came in they didn't change a thing!!! Smartest thing they could have done!!!
