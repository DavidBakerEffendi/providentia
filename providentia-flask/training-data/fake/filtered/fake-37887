This place really is as good as it gets. I always came to eat at this local pizza place when I was in college and this past weekend we had a reunion so I called ahead and Marco's was more than happy to reserve tables for us and make us all feel right at home. We brought 45 people to the restuarant and everyone loved their food and beer and the service was fast and friendly. Since there was so many of us there are really too many good meals to talk about, but I will say you can't go wrong with the pizza, so good, great crust and toppings. The chicken parm sandwich is amazing, garlic knots are a favorite, add cheese even better! Buffalo chicken calzone was excellent. Salads were good for those on the healthy kick. Clean place, nice people. You really can't ask for much more, thank you to everyone who works at Marco's, especially those there last Saturday!
