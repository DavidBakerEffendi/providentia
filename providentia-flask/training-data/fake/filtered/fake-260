To make a long story short. The place is gaudy (neon sign) and bigots. The sandwich is only famous because of celebs.There is no flavor or taste outside of the cheese whatsoever! I asked for the works and they put some barely fried onions on it! What a joke! Garbage totally. I'll try Pat's next time but I can get a better cheese steak from my local Italian pizza joint. I'm glad I finally went because I wanted to know what the hype was about but there really is none. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY OR TIME!
