This place is OK the lamb meatball was good but the bolognese and the garlic chicken were decent but not fantastic.  I mean don't get me wrong it's a cool space with tasty food but this place is heralded like it's special.   Bottom line if I'm in the neighborhood I might stop in but I'm not going out of my way.
