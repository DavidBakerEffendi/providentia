I ate at Mamma Rosa's last night.  When we drove up to the place, we were unsure whether to give it a try, but all four of us are thrilled we did.   The owner, Gino, was so welcoming.  It almost felt like being in Italy.  We ate outside, and that worked well for us - not at all  noisy.   We had two appetizers - the artichokes were excellent, the roasted pepper and mozzarella was very fresh, but needed more flavor for my taste.   These were entree size portions.     We had 3 entrees.  All were very good, but the standout has to be the eggplant Parmesan.    This dish is one I usually don't care for as its typically too heavy.  At Mamma's, it was light and incredibly flavorful. Even the bread that was served was very good, as was the seasoned Olive oil. Nice deserts too, and to cap it all, very reasonably priced. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
