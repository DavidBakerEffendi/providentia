I am very happy to be visiting this place again and again as the food tastes excellent. small, medium or big parties all of my catering orders are always from this place. Mutton Sukka, chicken biryani and chicken 65 for the die-hard non vegetarians...gutti vankaya & mirchi bajji very tasty. they bring together enough of the "good things" so i rate them higher than other places nearby.
