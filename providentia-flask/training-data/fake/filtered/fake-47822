Three of us had dinner last night and everything was as good as it gets! The seafood was so fresh and well prepared. There were two standouts for me that others haven't mentioned, the smoked bluefish appetizer with endive and the sweet potato fries. They were substituted for the lobster roll fries. The only problem was they didn't have the bluefish entree. Good, consistent food, service was a 4 out of 5
