This was not my first visit to Tony's. Other times the food and portions were very good. This time we ordered the Chicken and Shrimp Special. It was very salty and the smoked mozzarella cheese was very overpowering. At 32.00, it was overpriced. On my next visit I will not order the special for the day. I will stick to the regular menu. It is always noisy,, but you have to give up something to get good food and service.
