Spent a three day stint in Burlington, VT which was a relaxing getaway from NYC.  Pingala became our 'go to' cafe in spite of so many great options in this town.  The food was amazing - not for vegan standards - but any standards.  They didn't hold back on flavor.  We enjoyed the hash and scramble wrap with chipotle sauce which was filled with peppers, onions, and potatoes + scrambled tofu - very zesty.  And also the vanilla, cinnamon, banana pancakes with local maple syrup.  The indoor space is warm and cozy - surrounded by windows and art. The outdoor space right next to the river is calm and soothing - a good place to work and think.  I've eaten a lot of great food, but this place has a comfortable vibe along with great food that made us come back.  There's also a yoga studio next door if the mood strikes.
