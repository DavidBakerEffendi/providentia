Solid food, solid service, solid prices. I LOVE the tacos (esp the pork and rajas), the trio of hot sauces are stellar, and the corn...oh, the corn. Dig the micheladas and fantastic tequila selection here too. On the flip side, I'm not a fan of the little bowl of guac and overly greasy chips. I think you're better off passing on those. And yes, they need to crank up a/c during the summer because it's bloody hot!!! Heat and weak guac aside, this is my go-to place for dependable Mexican.
