Panini #25 is so awesome I want to marry it.  The chocolate chip macaroon is also delish.  Love this place.  I wonder if a few of the people who site bad service went for lunch - when you have to go to the counter and order/pick up your food yourself.  I've never had an issue here, and I really like it!  Try the #25 panini.  Seriously.  So good.
