Well let me start with what i ordered which is the first time i had ever ordered here. 1 Large Pie Extra Sauce, 1 Meatball Parm and a 1 garden salad... Ok as far as the Pizza their sauce is honestly not bad, the cheese is ok but maybe it would of been better if it wasn't burnt. So if you order pizza maybe you should suggest to them, not to over cook it or cook it medium. Meatball Parm sandwich the cheese makes you gag and the meatball don't taste fresh strange taste really, maybe it was from yesterday or older. Salad was good but not enough dressing. However this is the first time i ordered at Ferrulli Pizza maybe next time will be better.
