Everyone in Astoria needs to stop talking about all these terrible burger places that "specialize in burgers" and start realizing that the best burger in town is served at a Bar, yes a Bar! Good drinks, great staff and a kick ass burger that no one ever talks about. Difficult to go on the weekends, in fact save that time for the 21 year old's.
