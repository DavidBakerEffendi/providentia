Went to Hot Tomato's yesterday for lunch. This is one of my favorite places!! Was greeted at the door by Carrie who seated us promptly. Â Our server was there immediately to take our drink order and let us know about the specials. We both decided to get salads and they came out quickly which is wonderful when you have to get back to work. My chopped salad was great!! I suggest it with the burger in the grass!! The atmosphere is cool even at lunch. The dining room was full of people there for lunch or working lunches. I will be back!! "KC"
