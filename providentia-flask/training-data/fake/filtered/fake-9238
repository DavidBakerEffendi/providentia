I opened a Yelp account just to express my dismay and disgust over my experience. From my understanding, this is the 2nd store. The 1st is "up the hill" in the hood. Unfortunately, this kind of substandard "food" sells in the hood. I don't know how they will fare downtown though. I went in on a Wednesday evening and ordered fried shrimp and their "world famous" seafood rice. Before I ordered the rice I asked was the crab meat real or imitation. The mouthpiece at the front assured me it was real. When I got home, not only was the crab imitation, the shrimp were smaller than "a fleeting thought". And it was covered with an opaque, white sauce that resembled "ejaculation". Yuck. The fried shrimp was no better. They were laced with grease and the container they were housed in, had 2 tablespoons of oil in the bottom of it. Totally disgusting. Do yourself a favor, go to McDonalds. ..
