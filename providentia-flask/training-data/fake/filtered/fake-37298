I'm not sure I can say anything about this place that hasn't already been written.  It is amazing.  Every detail, and every ingredient is spot on.  I was there for brunch and thought that my meal was utter perfection.  I also, found the price to be reasonable considering the overall quality of the food.  Moreover, the atmosphere was spacious and comfortable and the fact they allow you to bring your own makes even more enjoyable.  I'm excited to go back here sometime in the future.
