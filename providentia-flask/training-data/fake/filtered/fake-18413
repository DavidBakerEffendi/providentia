Service was terrible.  No one came to offer drinks or menus and we finally had to shout at one of the fembots who allegedly work here as they continually passed us without acknowledging us.  The waitresses then couldn't decide whose table we should be.  When that was finally resolved, the experience improved.  Food is good and the atmosphere is nice, if a bit of an urban cliche at this point.
