I came here last Saturday night on a date. Even though it was a Saturday around 7, the place was not that crowded yet, maybe it gets busy later? The food was great! The warm goat cheese appetizer pretty much hit all the right spots. Atmosphere was romantic and the servers were actually friendly. I would definitely recommend this place! I'll be back for more cheese
