I was looking for a local Ethiopian restaurant and found this one. My family and I went on Saturday night and LOVED it! Not much for atmosphere, but the food and service were outstanding. This was the third Ethiopian restaurant experience that I've had and Abyssinian really knows what they're doing! I was also impressed that the chef came out and explained somethings about the food to us and shared some additional spices with us to try on our already magnificent dishes! Thank you, Abyssinian, for a fantastic meal! I only wish you were open for lunch, so I could experience it anytime I wanted.
