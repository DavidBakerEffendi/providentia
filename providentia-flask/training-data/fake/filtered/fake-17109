I chose The Sea Fire Grill for my 52d birthday and truly enjoyed one of the greatest dining experience of my life.  My wife, oldest daughter and I started with a seafood sampler that was extremely generous in selection and taste.  I grew up on the shore in CT, where I still live, and the oysters here were second to none.  At our request, the waiter chose wine for us and he was on the mark.  For dinner, I had sea bass, my wife had halibut, and my daughter had the filet rossini.  We shared and each meal was prepared perfectly and flat out delicious.  The desserts were equally enjoyable.  Enhancing the evening was the attentive and prompt service, all the more remarkable given the large crowd that Saturday night.  From start to finish, we were greeted warmly by numerous friendly employees.  The seating was comfortable and the surroundings pleasing to the eye.  This is a meal I won't forget - how often can one say that? -  and will be sure to return on my next vist to NYC.
