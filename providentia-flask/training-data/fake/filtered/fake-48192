I think this place may have been way too overhyped. I took a trip up to NYC once and decided to see what the hype was all about. I don't know if it's because I think all fries taste the same, but the fries at Pomme Frites were just, OK. They did taste a little different, but for the price I'd say the overall experience was okay.
