I liked it a lot, would go at least once a week, but it just changed hands. Same name, same menu, - trust me, not the same food. I'm not a complainer, but these folks gave me the greasiest, soggiest egg roll imaginable. The General's chicken (my regular) was 99 % corn syrup with something spicy in it. What a disappointment to lose the very nice, friendly people who used to run it and the very good, nicely priced food that they served. Â Where do I go now???
