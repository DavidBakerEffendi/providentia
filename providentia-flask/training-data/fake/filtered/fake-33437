Tried the two piece plus biscuit take-out fried chicken. If you are looking for southern fried chicken, this is not your place. If you want fried chicken with a distinctive Asian flair, this might be for you. The meat is brined so it has that odd, seemingly raw meat texture that brined bird has. It is not raw, just looks that way. Tasty and crisp, but from somewhere other than the south! I miss Mama's.
