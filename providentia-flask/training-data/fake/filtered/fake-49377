El Vez is chock full of every Disney World-esque idea you could ever think of throwing at a mexican concept. The food was mediocre at best and the lackluster hipster service leaves A LOT to be desired. The scene on the weekend looks like what you might expect if all of UPenns douchey frat guys got together with all of South Jersey's girls in one room. Oh, and If you can make it through dinner without getting hit on by the Suuuuuper creepy General Manager then kudos to you! Â Go to Distrito.......same ambience, better service and WAY better food.
