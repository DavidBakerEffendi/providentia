I had a stellar meal at the Gander last night.  We started with a nice glass of white wine, recommended expertly by the bar staff.  We were seated in a very cozy and comfortable booth - the room has a very attractive atmosphere - the staff is constantly moving - no layabouts here.  The first course was the brisket tots.  One thing  I have to say about the brisket tots, is that due to the content and the crust - the tots stayed hot the entire time I was eating them.  That is key with something like a tot, because a lukewarm tot is not hot. I moved into the pasta course with a dish stocked with suckling pig belly pieces, really hearty and with a nice bite of vinegar to give the dish a little NC bbq taste.  Very nice the richness of the pork with the bite of the vinegar. I then had the halibut, not being shy about delving in to a foodstravaganza, which delivered a nice hearty piece of halibut, again no shy portions tonight.  That was backed by a rich morel and peas and artichokes, which made the whole dish sort of a balanced attack of flavors - super. My wife had the burnt butter pasta dish, she was pleased with its richness and flavor. On to the dessert, the poppy seed cake with a little sorbet and caramel and some strawberry rhubarb and we went over the top with another shot of the strawberry rhubarb sorbet - it all came together in a finish the meal dessert shootout. I'm not a drinker, but I had assurances that the wine list is stocked for those who don't want to miss out on the grape.
