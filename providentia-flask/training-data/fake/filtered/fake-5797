I had walked past this very unassuming place for years, and never even gave it a second glance... and what a mistake, this place is great... So, it you are reading this on the street outside and wondering if you should go, stop reading and go... I have only sat around the cooks.. And even though I guess they have an official Japanese name, I have no idea what it is... so lets just call them cooks.. anyway sitting around the cooks is the best place to sit, you can see how they cook and then they pass they food over on a stick... yes, I said stick... And even though I once again mistook Sake for water, I have no idea actually what we ate, but I do know that everything that came out was good.. There also is a back section that looks more official...
