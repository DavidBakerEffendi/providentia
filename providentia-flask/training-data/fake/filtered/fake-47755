I'm a Chicago girl, so naturally consider myself a pizza expert.  I wasn't expecting to be an east coast pizza convert, But after sampling Grimaldi's, I have to say I'm a believer.  I thought service was good, and our host had the proprietary air of the owner.  Either way, he was a sweetheart,  and I left feeling like I belonged in the neighborhood.   The pizzeria was charming, but packed.  The pizza was a dream.  The sausage was superior to any I've had.  It was piping hot and quick.  The crust was crispy on the bottom and crusts, but the crust had a tender interior that really grew on me. This dream pizza date was preceded by a walk across the Brooklyn bridge and followed by ice cream at Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory.  Perfection!
