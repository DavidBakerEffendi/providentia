My husband and I have eaten lunch there twice, both times after seeing the line at the Chipotle's next door.   On the basis of the food alone, I'd rate 3-4 stars.  However there are other issues.  Observations: 1.  I'm quite literate, have a grad school degree, but had one hell of a time parsing the food options displayed on the wall at the front of the restaurant in order to choose something to order.   The layout and combinations made my head want to explode. 2.  The music was too loud, particularly at the front of the restaurant where you wait in line to order (probably contributed to the feeling of my head wanting to explode). . Although Chipotle's does this too, this is a really BAD feature, one that shouldn't be copied.    The kids may not mind this, but for my middle-aged ears, the sound levels made me want to leave.  If I wasn't absolutely ravenous at the time, I would have left before ordering. 3.  Ordered large veggies & tofu (both times, with different sauces).   Veggies and tofu were good, rice was way too abundant.  In the future (if we return) would probably order small plate instead of large and order extra vegetables to get the ratio of protein/vegetables/rice to where I'd prefer.   4.  Waited quite a while for our order on the most recent trip.   It seemed like the server was overwhelmed.  We got our order after the cashier left her post and jumped in to help get orders to tables.
