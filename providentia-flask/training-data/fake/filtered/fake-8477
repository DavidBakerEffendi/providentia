This place is so convenient for those that work in the area, but that is the only good thing about the place.   Went there 2 nights ago with a group of 12 co-workers.  All of them sent their drinks back as they were very disappointed.  I stuck to beer, so I was fine.  Heard the Blue Moon on tap is gross, so I passed on that. Food is nothing to write home about, it is below average and unreasonably priced.  I don't  think it will be open for too much longer.
