Go for the Atmosphere and drinks...not the food.  We stumbled accross Fraunces Tavern while touring lower manhattan and were shocked that we hadn't heard of it before.  The History is astounding and yet it was empty.  I had the fish and chips and my wife had the soup.  Both were terrible but the craft beer was delicious.  Definetely worth a stop for drink and to soak up some history.
