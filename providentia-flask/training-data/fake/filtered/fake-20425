Well the name of restaurant must of have been named after an anorexic wife that barely eats, the portions are tiny miniature size. Her name could easily have been Fraila intstead of Freda unless of course she's aFreda to eat anything. Bulemia is another possible name for this joint that comes to mind. Please you must have to go to a another restaurant for dinner before coming there. However if you are on a diet then perhaps this is the restaurant for you. The arugula salad is just that.. arugula.. Pure and simple.. Nothing else.. Oh yeah I almost forgot.. There's a bit of dressing.. Please forgive me..  Looks like the owners like to keep their overhead low.  The food is ok.. If you can find it on your plate that is.. Good luck!  Again do not come here unless you are full.......
