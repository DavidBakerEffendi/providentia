This is a fun bar.  The drinks are nice - its a little strange that they serve wine in water galsses, but it's all good.  It's a nice place to hang out for a low key evening.  There is no dancing space, so don't come here if you're super energized, lol.  They have a menu which I haven't tried, but others I was with said the food was pretty good.
