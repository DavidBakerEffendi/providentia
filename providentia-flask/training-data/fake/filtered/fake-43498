First time your fault, second time my fault. Service was good. Salsa is just a pur√©e. Too watery and bland. Had to pay extra for guacamole which wasn't seasoned at all save for the sea urchin topping which was way too fishy! All food was cold. Fish taco was not seasoned. Chicken taco was too dry. Lengua taco languished. And who serves grapefruit virgin margaritas? Dafuq! If you're going force people to bring their own alcohol, compensate with great food!
