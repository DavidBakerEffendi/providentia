I went here for dinner and was impressed with the food. I had the filet mignon and it was quite exceptional. It wasn't too big, so I was able to eat all of the red meat deliciousness and have room for dessert. My friend and I got two different desserts, but we shared. I would recommend the Dark Chocolate "Bag" dessert. It's dark chocolate in the shape of a paper bag with raspberry mouse filling and berries. The chocolate brownie sundae was good too, but I'm still thinking about the "bag" a week later. I agree with other reviews, the wait staff leaves something to be desired. We had to wait five minutes before seeing our waiter to ask for the check. But the food does make up for it.
