I feel like I went to a totally different restaurant than the majority of these reviewers. My husband and I went for breakfast last week while staying in Burlington, and it was really really awful. We were charmed when we walked in -- the decor is very homey and cozy, but our meal was frankly inedible. He got the cinnamon bread french toast and it looked (and tasted) like someone had sprayed on some fake egg product and then lightly toasted it. My lemon ricotta pancakes were dry and gummy at the same time and had a weird garlic flavor (no kidding!), the coffee was room temperature. The staff was very sweet and attentive, but wow that was one of the worst breakfast's I've every had.
