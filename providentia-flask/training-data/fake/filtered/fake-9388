We visit Perilla every time we visit Manhattan ( from Boston) We give it 4.5 because nothing is perfect so want to round down rather than up. It NEVER disappoints! The food is uniquely delicious, the staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is great. We eat very healthy - we own a wellness center, so quality wholesome food is critical to us. We'll visit again nest trip. Mark
