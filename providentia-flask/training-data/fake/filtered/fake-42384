I'm a sucker for horses, so I liked the premise before I ever walked in. Fortunately, the design delivers in the best possible way. I felt relaxed and happy. Love the simple space and the rustic references. Even better, love the food! My favorite were the mushroom pot and the lemon carrot soup topped with a marshmallow, if only because they were such a happy surprise. I also had the burger which was decadent and delicious. Plus, the waiter was kind enough to ask the mixologist to prepare me a special mocktail, since I wasn't drinking that night. Looking forward to my next visit!
