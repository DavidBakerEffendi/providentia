I'm a sporadic patriot at Cuban Pete's, never had a problem of all my comings.  I decided to take a good, good friend for her birthday along with some others.  My friend has never been there before, so I wanted it to be special and impressive.  I got a lil nervous after reading some of the reviews but that did not hinder me.  We reserved a table for 6-7 people.  Six of us showed up and the first timers were blown away.  They thought the ambiance superseded delightful. They felt like they were in the somewhere in the tropics in a restaurant opposing to the opposite.  The food tantalized their taste buds (and mines as usual) and the drinks were blended with the right combination of fruits.  Dominic, the proprietor accommodated us with a wonderful professional touch of class.  I ALWAYS enjoy myself whenever I go there.  I hope the experience continues and never end.  My names is Debra (R'bed) you can take my word that's why I am putting my name to it.....
