Nice ambience, great food and exceptional service. Only been here for dinner time but since I work nearby I decided to stop here for lunch with some coworkers. My coworkers and I got bibimbap on hot stone bowl, slider specials and farmer's meal (which I wasn't sure how to eat) on the lunch menu. The server kindly explained what it was and how to eat it the farmer's meal. My server was VERY accommodating and friendly. Really like the barn-like ambience and their portion is pretty big too. I really enjoyed Barn Joo and definitely will revisit. Hope they serve wings during lunch though.
