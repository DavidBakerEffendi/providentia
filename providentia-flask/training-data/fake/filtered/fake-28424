Went here with my friends on a fun day in philly. We chose it over Olive Garden, and it was a nice restaurant. I really liked the atmosphere of the restaurant, and granted, the service could have been better, but I ordered the margherita flatbread and the rest of my friends all ordered pasta. While the food took a little longer than I hoped it would to prepare, there was free bread and the waitress wasted no time in bringing out more free bread for us when she noticed we had eaten all of it. We all enjoyed our food. I have to admit that the food was a little bit pricey, but I would probably go back if I could. If you're looking for something a little less pricey, there happens to be an Olive Garden across the street from Fratelli's.
