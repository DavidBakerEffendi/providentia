Elegant restaurant in a great location (looking over Lake Champlain) that most people haven't yet discovered.  Five of us had dinner last night:  aside from regular sushi offerings, special favorites were the Nabeyaki Udon, a lobster-tail appetizer, the Chef's Special (four courses), and the fried green tea ice cream.  Unusual for all five people of any group to be raving about the food, the service, and the place.  Very reasonable price for  a memorably fine meal.  We'll go back very soon.
