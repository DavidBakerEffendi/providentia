Looking for the end of the night out cheese steak.....there is no better place than pats.  Come and wait in a line that really isn't that long and see everything that Philly has to offer.  However, if you want the best cheese steak and do not need the teen club atmosphere, Gooie Louie's on 3rd and moyamensing is 10 times the better steak. PS would all tourist please continue to go to pats so I don't have to wait at GL.
