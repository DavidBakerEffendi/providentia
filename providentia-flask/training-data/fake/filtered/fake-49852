Went to the lobby FRIDAY for dinner... Food was delicious.. Waiter was very pleasant and helpful with the dishes.... Dessert chocolate brownie with icecra am was great; Could have ate it all myself..... Ended up staying for drinks; the drink Lobby punch def is something you should try, Think it has jack Daniels but Ohhh myyyy is just perfect.... After a few drinks my dinner ended up as a night out... Def enjoy the Dj and the music was on point.... Will go back soon....
