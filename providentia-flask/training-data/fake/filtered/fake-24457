I have been using Custodi Caterers for several years now for my pharmaceutical lunches.  The food is amazing and healthy, the lunches always arrive early, delivery staff are pleasant and courteous to the offices, and the presentation is very neat and organized.  Everyone there is extremely professional!!  Makes my life so easy to use them as my caterer. Highly recommend them to anyone.
