was truthfully headed into the city to try the new roast beef joint "bowery beef" but made a few wrong turns and found myself in front of this place lol. so my gf and i pulled over and decided we would each try a cuban sandwich.she got hers with the chipotle mayo and me without. ive had my share of cuban sandwiches but this one was just on a whole different level of goodness!! the pork is perfectly shredded apart and is super tender!! the whole thing just comes together beautifully and this is Â one sandwich that you will never regret ordering!! im from williamsburg, brooklyn but from now on when ever i crave a cuban, this is the place for me.
