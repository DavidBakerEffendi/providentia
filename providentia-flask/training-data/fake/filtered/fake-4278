This used to be a destination diner for me, didn't mind the 20 mile drive because the food was that good! It's now a diner with pretensions of being fine dining - which is OK if you back that up with great food. We were there today for lunch and I have to say the service was great, and the atmosphere is very nice, although the bathroom could use a good cleaning. The prices are very high and there isn't much selection . My friend really liked her burger and fries. She also liked the bread they serve before the food comes, it was way too sweet for me.  I got a roast beef sandwich with gorgonzola and arugala, it was pretty tasteless and the semolina bread was so hard it scratched up the roof of my mouth. We also had our 2 kids with us and ordered them meals from the Children's Menu  that were totally inedible, we had to give them our french fries for lunch. I think it is admirable that the restaurant is promoting healthy meals for kids, but we didn't realize that "roast chicken pasta" meant some macaroni with broccoli and dried out chicken breast with barely any sauce was what healthy means. My friend's daughter got the grilled chicken strips, which was the same gross chicken (plus grill marks)  with two big hunks of sweet potato on the side. It came with a big cup of ranch dressing so she just dunked our french fries in that and left the rest. They did like their cookies at the end though. I'll bet this is really a fun place if you are into jazz and a good martini, just don't expect it to be a diner, and if you bring the kids, stick with burgers or grilled cheese,  Healthy food is only healthy if its edible.
