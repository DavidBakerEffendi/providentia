Service was impeccable- Very attentive without being overbearing. Also, this is some of the best display of traditional Greek food that I've found in Philly. Highly recommend the cheese plate and grilled octopus appetizer.  The wine list offers a nice variety of whites and wines with a focus on Greek wines (for a nice change).  Certainly give Opa a try.
