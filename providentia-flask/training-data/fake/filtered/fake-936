This is decent, greasy Greek pizza. OK, the cheese layer comes off and flaps down on your chin with the second bite, and the tomato sauce beneath is virtually guaranteed to blister the roof of your mouth. But it tastes absolutely awesome after a night drinking at Toad's. You can get big hearty salads and hot sandwiches, too, and it's fun when it really gets hopping on weekend nights.
