Read the reviews and decided to give this place a try. Orderd delivery, everything arrived piping hot!! The chicken was delicious and so was the buffalo jumbo shrimp.  The mac and cheese was average as was the mash, but the cornbread was very very tasty. Very impressed with this place overall!  My new and only go to now for delivery of hot fresh fried chicken and shrimp with sides to please.
