The half chicken with yellow rice is always amazing with the green sauce. I always order the same thing when i come here. It's always sizzling hot and the chicken is juicy. The only bad thing i have to say is that they charge you $1 for extra sauce which kinda sucks but other that they have great food for a decent price.
