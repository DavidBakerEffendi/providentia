magnolia is a totally decent breakfast/lunch place. good, friendly service; tasty food. nothing i've ever had there has been super original or really striking though, and i feel like burlington has better options. magnolia is a good third or fourth choice for brunch. the lemon ricotta pancakes were delicious. and the coffee was good as well. my wife got the potato pancakes, which were good i guess but left me underwhelmed. fruit plate was small and didn't seem particularly fresh. had a lot of dry melon. very friendly wait staff!
