Finally - just what the NNE needed!  Having lived in Burlington my entire life....La Boca is the "Miracle on North Avenue".  The pizza is amazing (loaded potato is the BEST!), the local beer selection is perfect, the atmosphere is relaxing and beautiful (especially the old bank vault as the wine rack) and the staff makes you feel like you are eating at home with your family.  Also, one of the best parts of the experience is that La Boca is using Vermont fresh meats and veggies!  Please visit La Boca and help support our local economy full circle!!  Bon Appétit!
