Very DISAPPOINTED!!! My friends and I went for dinner last Sunday, and we all got severely sick from the food. I am 100% Filipina and can truly tell when food is authentically made! This place is obviously not authentic at all!!! We ordered adobo chicken wings and their chicken wings were not cooked at all! They need to make sure their food is cooked very well. I will never recommend this place to any of my Filipino and non-Filipino friends!!!!
