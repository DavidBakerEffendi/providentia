I have been ordering from this place an average of twice a week over the past several months because I love the food.  It's the best Cuban I've had in Greenwich Village.  I've also eaten in the restaurant several times and found the food excellent. But on my most recent Seamless Web order, there was a foul-up.  After an hour and twenty minutes, I still had not received my food and called the restaurant.  The person who answered claimed she had never received a call from Seamless to confirm the order (as is the usual policy).  In curt tones and with no apology (though she did offer to re-take my order then and there - I would get my food but would effectively pay for it twice), she told me she had not received an order from me and that I would need to take up my issue with Seamless.  Her phone manner suggested she may have thought I was either crazy or lying to her, as in her mind there was no way there could have been a mistake on her end.  I hung up and called Seamless.  Seamless refunded my bill and gave me a coupon after calling Cuba and receiving the same brusque treatment and adamant denial I had received. I really love the food here and it breaks my heart that I will not be ordering again.  But I can't recall a more unpleasant customer service phone experience with a restaurant  in NYC.  A tragic failure of the owner/management of Cuba in choosing staff to represent the restaurant to customers.
