Kanella is my favorite restaurant in Philly, hands down. The food is authentic, delicious, consistent, and interesting. Â I like the fact that every time I go there the menu is slightly different, with certain staple dishes remaining unchanged, and new, unusual dishes presented often enough to keep things exciting. For those who don't understand, this is not merely decent Greek fare. Decent Greek fare often gravitates toward a sort of homogeneous palette of grilled meats, fried seafood, thick lettucy salads, fries, etc...What Kanella offers is not only a high-class re-examination of such staple Greek dishes, but also an education on the unusual spicing and innate variety of the Cypriot menu. The variety of meat, poultry, and fish entrees offered is very wide, including the use of parts of animals that are seldom seen on menus in Philly. In addition, there are always delicious vegetarian options available, and there are numerous tasty side dishes and starters to choose from. I have spoken with the chef and asked about his background; he studied in England and worked very hard learning to cook high-end French cuisine in addition to perfecting his native dishes. This shows in his presentations at Kanella: the food is prepared with total commitment, refinement, and quality. Ingredients are always fresh, meats are always prepared to the right level of doneness (if not to one's liking, the chef is amenable: he will cook it to one's liking, of course), service is wonderful, ambience is romantic and nostalgic. The prices are very reasonable, and the place serves as a romantic dinner destination, while still remaining family-friendly. I highly recommend this restaurant, and if you do go, talk with the chef and enjoy his slightly eccentric and warm personality: it will make for an experience you will never forget!
