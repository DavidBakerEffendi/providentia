Oh. My. God. Saw this place on the Food Network and tried it before going over to Terror Behind the Walls at Eastern State Penitentiary. Loved the selection of craft beers while we waited for our table. The cheese steak Empanadas were incredible. The Good dog burger was absolutely fantastic. Incredible quality meat and ingredients were used. Thinking about my meal here is making me drool as I write this review. Will definitely return next time I'm in Philly.
