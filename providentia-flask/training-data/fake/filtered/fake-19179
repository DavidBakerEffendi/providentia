Had dinner here last night. Wonderful! Everything we ordered was outstanding. My BF had the beet salad prepared like I have never had before with fresh basil and small pieces I walnuts (I think). He also had the rigatoni Bolinas(?) very good. I had the linguini lemon. I was afraid it might be bland but it was very tasty, yum. I would definitely order the same meal again. I typically will not order pasta out because it is always over cooked and boarding on mushy. NOT HERE. The pasta was perfectly cooked just like in Italy. Cannot wait to go back!
