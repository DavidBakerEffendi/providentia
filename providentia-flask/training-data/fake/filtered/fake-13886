I went to Melt Shop yesterday for the first time and completely enjoyed! Even though it was just a little walk up almost everyone in the kitchen said hello and greeted me with a smile! I chose the truffle arugula sandwich and it was fantastic and came out quick. It also came in this adorable little box. Overall satisfied my craving for a gourmet grilled cheese and they did it so quickly!
