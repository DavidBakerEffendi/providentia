The food is good, but a bit overpriced. I went here twice, the first time for a tori donburi and second time for unagi donburi. They were delicious, but I would like a little more for the price of those things. An eatery at a university shouldn't cost that much, students already have difficulties paying their (very VERY expensive) tuition as it is, with little else for food. Also a reason why I do not consider coming back any time soon.
