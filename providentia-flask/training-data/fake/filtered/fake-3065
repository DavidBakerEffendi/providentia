This is absolutely one of my FAVORITE restaurants!! The food is so good! I'm stuck on the mariscada (naked paella) and I get it with yellow rice! Also I love the Carribean flounder which I get with coconut rice! All of the tapas are good! Love the sangria. Great atmosphere! You would think u were really in Cuba. It is very loud but I'm young and fun so I don't mind it :) it gets very packed on the weekends and very very tight standing room but definitely worth the wait and the owner ALWAYS gets me seated right away when I go! Perfect place to go for any celebration dinner! Enjoy
