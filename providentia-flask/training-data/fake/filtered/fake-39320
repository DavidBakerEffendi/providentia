OK, full disclosure here.  I am half owner with my brother.  Please come check us out for breakfast or lunch.  We have homemade soups and salads, many of which are our mom's old recipies.  We hand-cut fresh french fries every day.  We carry boarshead meats, and have a number selections from both the grill and fryer.  We named the place after our mother and are striving to make her proud.  We serve quality food in portions that are guaranteed to please, and focus on keepin a clean and freindly environment.
