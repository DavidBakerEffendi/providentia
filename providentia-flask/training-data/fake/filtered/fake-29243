Since this was going to be my first review on Yelp, I thought I would cut these guys some slack. On second thought, I believe prospective diners (victims) deserve an honest opinion. As someone who has lived in the Middle East and has sampled some of the best Falafel on earth, I consider myself somewhat of a Falafel connoisseur. That said, Mamoun's ranks among THE WORST in NYC. First, their pita bread tastes like cardboard. Secondly, they use bland Iceberg lettuce as a 'filler', instead of real salad (cucumbers and tomatoes). The Falafel itself is horrible, and to add insult to injury, they give you three or four balls. The runny swill they call 'tahini sauce' is the icing on the cake. As for the ambiance- My friends and I always joke about the offensive odor which overpowers you when walk into their MacDougal Street location. We unanimously agree it smells like flatulence . So..if you like eating little pieces of dog-doo in a an envelope (the only analogy I could come up with) then Mamoun's is the place for you. After reading all these glowing reviews of the aforementioned establishment, Yelp has lost all credibility as far as I'm concerned. Bon appetit ! P.S.If you want to eat real Falafel, then go to Lebanon, Syria, or Israel.
