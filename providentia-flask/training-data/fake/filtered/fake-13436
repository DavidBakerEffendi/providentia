very rude waiter, was very pissed and left. There were three tables outside, and I saw one just handed their bill to the waiter, so I asked him if I can have the table outside. He told me no, I had to wait. I asked how long, he said he doesn't know, and turn to the table who just paid their bill and said, WTF, if people leaves, you can sit, if they don't, then you wait, how the hell would I know how long...his attitude was very bad, like I was an idiot... which I dont' think I was. There's nothing wrong for customers wanting to know approximate how long they have to wait for the table and decide whether they want to wait or go somewhere else.   on top of that, I was still standing right there, even if a customer asked a stupid question, you don't say mean things or make fun of them to their face.  on top of that, the table who just gave you the bill, how long do you think they will stay there for? another hour?! come on... if the restaurant keeps that kind of waiter, they will loose lots of business. I live right down the street and I am going to make sure all my friends and neighbors don't go there ever again.
