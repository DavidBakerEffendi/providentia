This place is solid. I mean it's hard to do a stellar brunch since it's mostly just eggs and biscuits. But this place does a good job. It's a cute little place with cute decore and music. Expect a tight squeeze and a long wait because this place is popular. But there's tons of things to explore in the area while you wait and they text you when your table is ready! I got an omlette and my guy got the country breakfast. Both were pretty good. Not well seasoned but oh well. The wait staff was ok. Not very attentive but that's because there's to few of them and a lot of people. Also THIS PLACE IS CASH ONLY! Annoyingly they don't tell you that and it's not posted anywhere that we say so we didn't realize until we got the bill. Like i said, that was annoying but whatever. All and all it's a chll spot.
