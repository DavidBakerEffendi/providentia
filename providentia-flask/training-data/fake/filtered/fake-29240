The food from this place is worse than even from a street vendor. I ordered a plate of combo shawarma with hummus, farafel, and babar ganouj, hoping to test a bit of everything in this shop, and guess what? not only does the price of this combo meal is $11, but the amount and quality of food do not even worth half of this price. First, the meat was just bits of burnt meat so dried up that it tastes like salty paper (they only gives you 3-4 bits, a tiny amount per combo set). Then, the farafel is also dried up as well. For hummus and Â babar ganouj, they only give around a table spoon worth of each, and they were very oily. Last, I expected them to use fresher, store-baked pita for that $11.00 combo price, but instead they just use grocery-store-bought version and heat them up.
