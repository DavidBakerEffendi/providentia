I was so excited about brunching here on Valentine's Day--the menu looked exquisite! I called ahead on our way to see how long the way was, and the employee answered, "it's hard to say...I'd say 20 minutes." We continued on, parked, and went in to a packed house. This is understandable since it's a holiday. We waited for about 7 minutes and finally a front door hostess appeared & noticed the 3 new parties that had arrived in her absence. She took our name & told us it would be 35-45 minutes for 2 people. The man behind me was greeted with, "Hey, Bob! It's gonna be a while--you have 3? It will probably be about 20 or 25 minutes." We left & went down to Bussaco, where I had an EXQUISITE reasonably priced meal & was seated immediately. I did about 10 years in the restaurant industry. I know about seating regulars, just make sure it's not within the earshot of other customers...
