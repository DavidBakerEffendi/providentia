First time my California born and raised daughter actually tasted real pizza.Couldn't get enough of it. She loved the square which was great ,different than I had as a kid when the cheese was on top. But it was delicious and the crust was wonderful. The thin pizza is my favorite. Good amount of oil and the cheese actually stretches, which doesn't happen on California pizzas.Took a spumoni garden square with us on our flight home. Of course that was in 2002.Wont be able to do that any more. Also ate some delish meals at very reasonable prices. Italian ices were great. Sure are a lot more flavors since I was a kid in the 60's.Still stick with the lemon or chocolate ice.
