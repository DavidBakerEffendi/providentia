Our afternoon began with a bottle of wine from their wine shop and then we ordered a cheese plate. First, our waitress upsold us on the cheese and told us to order one more cheese than we really needed.  Later, a waiter came by our table and refilled only one person's glass of wine, for a table of three who were all drinking wine. Around 5, the waitress brought us our check.  We asked whether we could order a deep-dish pizza.  Then, the manager - a pretentious guy with a pocket square -- came out to explain that they were "fully committed" for the evening, so we would need to leave before 6:30PM.  He did not offer to accommodate us at one of the high top tables, or offer to comp a portion of our check. He suggested we order some "quick food, or maybe we could get our pizza to go, but it would take an hour."  When the waitress came back to see what we had decided, we told her we'd decided to order a pizza -- and she was barely able to manage a tightly lipped smile.  She stopped refilling our water.  The pizza -- and the check! -- arrived around 6:15.  The food and wine were great.  The atmosphere is lovely.  But the service definitely leaves something to be desired.
