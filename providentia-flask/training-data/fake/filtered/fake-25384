I've been coming here for the last 4 years and the food never seizes to amaze me. Need I even mention the corn? Absolutely scrumptious and delicious in every way. I would give it five stars if it weren't for the rude servers. I understand a lot of touristy Asians come here but do I need to be treated like piece of crap? But honestly the corn... Oh the corn is sooo worth the bitchy attitude and the dirty looks. That's how much I love the food~
