I went here for my birthday  and too celebrate my 60 day challenge on Paleo. My main focus when i first came to Fogo was to devour every single piece of meat as possible and staying away from the salad bar; from the first moment i laid my eyes upon the salad bar i couldn't help but resist the delicious items they had. This place is great, everything is gluten-free for those who cant eat gluten or on a paleo diet like myself.  The meat were so moist and tender it melted in my mouth. The waiters were kind and courteous and always made sure to replenish our sides and drinks. Also they gave me a complementary flan, which was delicious for my birthday. This place is great, i would recommend anyone who wants quality dinning and great ambiance to come here.
