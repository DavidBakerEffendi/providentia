I have been a regular to Toby's Public house since I moved to Brooklyn 2 years ago. The staff is casually nice and the pizza is great. But recently, my family came to visit and I decided to share the pizza that Brooklyn has to offer. Unfortunately, on multiple occasions, the staff was rude and difficult. Which brings me to write this review. We asked if we could split the bill two ways between the families and they said, "No." We asked why they couldn't split the bill and they said (in a bitchy tone), "its their restaurant policy." Sounds like a sad excuse to me. This place only has 8 tables inside and is "CASH ONLY." Then we asked for waters and got 4 for a table of 6 (not to mention they were room temperature). Im thinking math isn't their suited skill set. After several requests we finally got a cup of ice. Having guests that were from Germany they acted annoyed, no smile or patience for the broken english. Mind you the restaurant was dead at the time. However they didn't mind adding 20% gratitude to our bill. To conclude, the pizza is still good but from now i will not be recommending this place to my friends or family.
