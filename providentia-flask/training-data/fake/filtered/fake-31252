Been here a few times, great atmosphere inside with the hanging lights and glass panel garage door.  Very chic and trendy, so fits into the area perfectly. Roast lamb was delicious as well as the lentil salad with pecans.  Great for dates, parties or just to sit at the bar. I also like how they have outdoor sitting facing Elizabeth Street.
