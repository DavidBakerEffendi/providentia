Had a great experience @ Tinto. We walked in without a reservation on a Saturday night but ended up getting a couple spots at the bar. The bartender Josh was outstanding. I have seen some mixed reviews on the red sangria, but I will say that we enjoyed it (fairly light on the palate, but it went well with the food we were eating).
