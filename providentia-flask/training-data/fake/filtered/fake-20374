My wife and I tried it last week. We absolutely love Indian food and were thrilled to try this new spot - especially after seeing the good reviews the Secaucus restaurant gets. We tried the butter chicken, lamb vindaloo, chicken 65 appetizer, and garlic naan. Chicken 65 - it was fine I guess. I wouldn't order it again but I wasn't turned off. Butter chicken - bizarrely sweet (there is no ingredient in butter chicken that should make it sweet, did they add pure sugar?). We couldn't finish it, it was not good. Huge disappointment. Lamb vindaloo - not as bad as the butter chicken, but not good. Sauce was thin and watery in parts, and bland throughout. We ordered it extra spicy. It was not spicy at all. Garlic naan was fine, no problems there. i can't comment on anything else from the menu - but it's worth noting that if your butter chicken and vindaloo aren't good...I'm not convinced anything else will be much better. We didn't save our leftovers. I have never not saved Indian food leftovers before! We won't be returning. Luckily there are several better Indian options in Montclair and other nearby towns. It's not fun writing negative reviews, and we're bummed this place didn't work out. Oh well :(
