Finally!  A restaurant that serves Paleo friendly/gluten cuisine!  Fresh 'clean' hearty food that's good for the body and soul and well worth the price to get such quality!  Chicken was fall off the bone tender and delicious, beef saltados was the perfect amount of spicy with crisp veggies and tender beef....ceviche loaded with calamari, shrimp...And finally a place I can order dessert without the guilt...decadent sweet potato brownies!  Add the quaint atmosphere and owners who are warm and welcoming making sure their diners are taken care of and it's the perfect place for a night out.
