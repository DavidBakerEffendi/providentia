This place was meh. I've walked by many times and seen that it was empty which usually means that the place is not very good. After reading reviews here I though I would give it a try. Food was nothing to rave about. Pretty basic and nothing stood out or impressed me, The prices were very cheap but still if you are looking for a great meal this wouldn't be on the top of my list. I was was left underwhelmed. Being a fan of Turkish cuisine I still have to say that Toro's in Paterson is on top of my list. I'll much preferably continue to take the drive to Paterson for Kebab House type food. Four Season's makes an effort and gets you in there once. Although probably not a second a time.
