Don't understand the hype. The "chicken shawarma" is about as unauthentic as it gets. Portions are small. 3 balls of falafel, hummus, and one boureka for 12 dollars you've got to be kidding me. The only thing redeeming is the chef is incredibly friendly. The guy working there however is inattentive and arrogant.
