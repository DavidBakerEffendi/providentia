My first time at Burrito Box, I asked the guy behind the register what was their most popular vegetarian burrito.  He said portebello mushroom and spinach burrito and that's what I ordered.  I was surprised how HUGE the burrito was.  And the free chips and salsa with every order is definitely a plus!!  With the burrito, I couldn't really taste the portebello mushroom because it was mixed in with all other ingredients.  Overall, it was good.  I went  back there a week later and ordered the portebello mushroom w/ hard tacos.  The portebello mushrooms smelled SOOOOOOOOO good!  And tasted great!!!  My only compaint was, the tacos were VERY soggy!  That was a disappointment =(  And this past weekend, I ordered the veg chilli, which was ok.   I definitely agree that this place is better than Chipotle's.  First, Burrito Box has much more items on their menu.  Second, their food is MUCH tastier!  I used to eat at Chipotle's so often that I got a little tired of their food, but I don't think I'll be tired of Burrito Box since they have much more choices! Someone mentioned the fact that they don't take phone orders for pick up.  I called them up and tried to place an order for pick up, they guy said "no."  I asked why.  He sounded a little annoyed.   He explained that they used to take phone orders and people called in but never come pick up the food.  I think it would be MUCH more convenient for the patrons to be able to place phone orders instead of waiting at the place, since there's NO place to stand!  That's a little annoying =(  Since I live only a couple of blocks away, I'll be back often!!!
