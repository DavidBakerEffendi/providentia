Dear Bonnie's Grill, Please please please bring back the homemade veggie burger patty.  The one you use now sucks & is just like every other veggie patty in NYC, meaning it's awful.  You had the best veggie burger in the city, and possibly in the USA.  It wasn't broke, but you need to fix it.  Please.
