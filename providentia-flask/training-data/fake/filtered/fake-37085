I can't believe so many "oh-so-precious" little yuppies have published their precious little thoughts here.  There's a nice, safe, brightly lit Olive Garden just around the corner waiting for you, with just the kind of special food you deserve. Tiffany will be your server. And the little girls crying about the parking.  The place is on a city street for crying out loud. I travel once or twice a year from "down the shore" to the Belmont because there's nothing like it. Walk in the door and get a Ballantine from Jimmy and make some small talk while you wait for your table.  There's no list, no beeper, no podium.  They'll tell you when it's your turn. Whaddya need a menu for?  Eat your salad and bread while you wait for your pasta and then your Savoy.  Cow bell ringing?  It's ready. It's as close as you'll ever come to sitting in a room filled w strangers that feels like a big family dinner w all the cousins over.  It's not a blast from the past, it's timeless. Finish up w some expresso in an aluminum pot over a flame, and a shot of sambvca. Get back on parkway.  Repeat 6 months later.
