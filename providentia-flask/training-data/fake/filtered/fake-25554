I so wanted this restaurant to be the place to go!!! I love Spanish /Puerto Rican food!!! I was so disappointed. Lacked seasoning and meat was so limited in traditional items. I hope owner takes note...do less on menu and do it well. You are a small business that I really would love see success for.
