My wife and I were at the St. Patrick day parade and stopped in to have a few slices of pizza and a couple sodas. I got up to use the bathroom and there was a guy sitting in front of the door and tells me I have to pay $2 to use the bathroom and I told him we just ate here and he tells me it's still $2 !! First I don't know if this is legal and second I get that people just come in to us the bathroom but I was eating there. The pizza was ok nothing special as there are a lot of better ones in New Haven but the greed of the owners is not worth going to this place ! STAY AWAY
