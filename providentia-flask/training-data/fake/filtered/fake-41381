Wound up here randomly on a trip to Philadelphia. Such a nice staff... Turned on my football game for me, went out of their way to modify an item to make it vegetarian for me, bartender was so knowledgeable and helpful about the beer selection. Food was unbelievable. I couldn't recommend this bar enough!
