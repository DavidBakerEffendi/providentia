My wife and I had dinner before a show at the NJPAC. As we entered, the noise level and the d√©cor gave me pause for concern; there were less then 20 people seated but with the high ceilings and lack of separation other than a few partitions hanging from the ceiling, it sounded like there many more. The room felt cold and industrial and the carpeting, while clean, seemed tired and worn. Once seated, we were given a plate with two small rolls, a dish of olive oil and 5 olives. The menu was limited but the quality of what we ordered was outstanding! We ordered mascarpone polenta fries with gorgonzola dipping sauce and a romaine wedge with prosciutto di parma, ricotta and Caesar dressing; both were very tasty and nicely presented. We both ordered the "Fascino" Ricotta Gnocchi with sweet sausage bolognese, parmesan and basil; it was delicious, flavorful and satisfying. Dessert was a plate of cookies and biscotti and coffee. A wine list had a decent selection with a great Grayson Cellars Chardonnay for $32. The prices are EXTREMELY reasonable and the service was friendly and efficient. This would not be our choice for a quiet leisurely special dinner, but it a perfect choice for before a show.
