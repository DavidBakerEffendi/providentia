grimaldis pretty unassuming from the outside and a bit dark on the inside and could easily be missed. We went there based on the tripadvisor score and it was right on! It was four of us and we ordered two small specialty coal fired pizzas, the Ron and Paul Young (meatball, sausage & peppers) and another variety. Get the pizza with both green and hot peppers, it was delicious and we left there stuffed. You will not be disappointed at this place. We also saw another party near to us having the oven baked chicken wings that looked deelicious! If you are in the Ft. Lauderdale area, don't miss Anthony's.
