My review differs from most in two ways: first, it's from a distance, all the way from the west coast. Second, the meal preparation and delivery were to offer comfort following a memorial service for the recently departed family matriarch. The "thank you" call I received afterwards spoke volumes about the wonderful vegetarian dishes that were shared. In our need to somehow contribute during difficult times, Miss Rachel, upon my simple request, went above and beyond with her sincerity and willingness to provide exceptional customer service. And her product speaks for itself!
