I was drawn to this restaurant by a nice website with interesting menu options.  I was with 3 friends and we started off with the cauliflower appetizer that was recommended highly by our waitress. It basically tasted like it was dipped in balsamic vinegar.  We then had the bacon appetizer which is a bad copy of Peter Lugers famous side dish.  I had the pork chop as my main dish which was just ok with a side of butternut squash. The squash was ok at best. The rest of my party felt the same way about their experience. I should also mention that we were initially seated next to a family with babies when the majority of the restaurant was empty. This is a very nice restaurant with a nice menu but the overall product of a delicious meal will not be found at Almond!
