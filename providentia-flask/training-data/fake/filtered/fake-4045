Went here for lunch for the first time this past Tuesday because it is the only place in the area open for lunch and it was overall a great experience! I had one of the specials of the day, a frittata with ham, gruyere cheese, and potatoes. It was amazing, and pretty too! And the best bloody Mary I have ever had. I have had so many bad ones lately I was starting to think maybe I don't like them! This whit should be bottled! Anyways the service was great as was the atmosphere. Fortunately I was not waited on by a hobbling old lady, but a friendly and efficient young woman. It was really busy and everything I needed still arrived in a timely fashion.I will be back very soon.
