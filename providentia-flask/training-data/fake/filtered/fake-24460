Ok. So I love Chinese food huge fan and don't expect much at all. I was told by friends to go to this place so I went! Food was good. But the problem was that the service that they provided to me was absolutely disgusting. Food was thrown at me, waiters bumped into my chair 5+ times, I had to ask for water 3 times before we all finally got waters and they yelled at us because grandma was slow getting out of the warm car. These people have no respect nor do they know how to run a business. The food was good too and it was all destroyed by people who run the place.
