If you have no idea what you want to eat this place has a great variety of choices.  From pizzas called Brooklyn Flats (the one with the apples and balsamic is amazing!)  Burgers with eggs on it (I only had this at ihop once and it's amazing. Even though it's basically a heart attack, we all know the things that are bad for us  are always the most delicious and hard  to resist). Jambalaya, which I've never tried before trying it at Box. I've eating here about 3 times a month epically for their happy hours and specialty drinks.  Since I took my girl friends out for one  of their bdays, they go in for brunch now because we love the all you can drink mimosa's. It's a comfy atmosphere. And since I'm always happy with a diner date Box63 has that diner food but at better quality.
