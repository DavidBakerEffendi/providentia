I was visiting friends in NYC and from tokyo. The friends just moved into this neighborhood and still exploring the area. Jack & Nellie's is about 5 to 10 min walk from the Forest hills station, 30 min train ride from downtown. Since arriving in NYC, I kept hearing about  'brunch' being the new  trend, that everyone does. So we did brunch. :) I would say Jack & Nellie's has that Sunday morning delight  quality. Lot's of energized buzzing people at its place, probably enjoying the long brunch and luxury of time you don't get to enjoy during weekdays. The menu was pretty homey style 'breakfast' menu, that can be found at any breakfast place. The sausage here was superb, egg perfectly light and soft as I like it. The one thing that made this brunch very special was the live jazz music played by a couple of  high school kids. They were pretty damn talented for sure, and a pleasant surprise to your lazy Sunday morning.
