Is "tapas" Spanish for "you've should've eaten before you arrived"?  Yes, it's a lovely looking place but too expensive:  We had a party of five and sat in the bar.  We had tapas and one drink each.  The bill: $55 a person.  We all left hungry and stopped for slices at the corner.  Give me a break.
