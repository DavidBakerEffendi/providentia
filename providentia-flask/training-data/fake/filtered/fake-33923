I thought the menu very different and exciting, the food was delicious but saying that, after booking a week in advance a table for three people, we were taken to a table that only barely seated two to which they added a third placing. We complained and were told that's all they had and then we sat looking at a table behind us that was free all evening. At the end of the meal, we happened to overhear our server describing a special that sounded very tasty unfortunately she didn't tell us about it. I'm very sorry I wasted my time and money and certainly won't be back.
