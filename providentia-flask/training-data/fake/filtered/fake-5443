NOT TO FRIENDLY TO PEOPLE OF COLOR!!!!! A co-worker told a couple of people at my job about this place saying how good the food was. Unfortunately this place does not take kind to people of color. Myself and my sister in-law decided to visit and soon as we walked through the door the bartender asked if it was something she could help us with ( in a manner of what are you doing here). I told her we would like to sit down and see a menu. After we sat down she handed us a menu. I asked her if she could make me a fruity drink and she told me "don't make me think cause I don't feel like thinking". I was so disappointed by her customer service as well as her bluntly disrespect. We decided to just leave. The next day I went to work explaining to my coworker the vibe and service we received and another coworker stated how she received the same type of service and vibe as well.. They were also people of color and stated they made reservations however they still waited an hour to be seated and another couple who was not black came in after them and the bartender lady went and sat them first. When my coworker asked the bartender weren't they there first? The bartender said yeah you were here first and what does that mean. My coworker stated the man she was with said ok does it have something to do with our color and the bartender stated "not to go there with her". Do to the fact these were two separate incidents I don't think it was a coincidence that we both got the same vibe and crappy service. Don't know if the food is good or not and from the service I will never know...
