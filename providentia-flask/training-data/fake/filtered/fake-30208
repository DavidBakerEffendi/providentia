Worst dining experience in a long time. Enough to write a review. From start to finish: Disorganized, not particularly friendly staff. A mumbled 'what are you ordering?' and cashier girl walking away while I am in the midst of ordering. Do we sit, can we sit, do you bring us our food...? Unclear. I guess you get brought the food. Backyard is pretty. Food. Came without silverware, firstly. The waiter cheerfully brought us some upon request. My order was put under the wrong person's name, so the disoriented gentleman was wandering around for some time, calling another woman's name. Food arrived, with portions fit for an anorexic bird. $10 for a few chopped beets and a cold over easy egg???? Absolutely ludicrous. $10 for a piece of toast with a scrambled egg on top of it and two asparagus??? Insulting. Then, finding random bits of pork in my meal. I am a vegetarian. After bussing our own table, I let the person at the front know this. She stared blankly at me as I repeated 'there was meat in my meal. No, not BEET, MEAT'. "Oh, like bacon?" "Yes, like bacon". "Oh, I guess they didn't write that on the board...." WHAT?!?!?! That is the reply? Firstly, NO, secondly, if there was supposed to be bacon, the 5 nubbins of pork I pushed to the side of my plate would be a paltry amount to claim that the dish comes with bacon. No apology, nothing. I left hungry, and pissed off. I should have trusted my gut and stuck with new local business that are welcoming and community oriented, like Express Yourself Barista. That is what Bushwick is about.
