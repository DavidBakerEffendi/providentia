Expensive but good. Being new to NYC this is a place which is famous whether you like it or not, with a namesake restaurant even opening up in Shangai (I am reliably told that it is not related). Very nice set up, the restaurant itself is atmospheric, service was prompt, friendly and staff were very knowledgeable. Is too expensive to be a regular dining place - bill came to $250 for 4 people with a couple of drinks each.
