I had an absolutely terrible experience here (probably the worse service I've ever seen at this price point) and will never return and highly encourage others to follow suit especially on wknd nights. I went for a party and rather than the relaxed experience you might expect from a BYO, they brought the food in about ten minutes of us ordering and the check within about 10 seconds of us finishing, despite nearly every person having a half-glass of wine. It was raining cats and dogs outside at the time, and they wanted to kick us out as quickly as possible to make room for the next party. They didn't bring bread or red and white wine glasses and they wanted to charge us exorbitant amount to bring an outside dessert (which is fine I suppose, but they were very rude about it and not in the least bit apologetic). As for the food, it was fine but I definitely prefer the food I've had at other Italian joints in the city, such as Porcini (right next door), Paradiso (South Philly) , La Viola (Center City). I never write Yelp reviews but I was frankly infuriated on behalf of my friends who were expecting a nice, leisurely meal, and were instead treated as if they had entered a fast-food joint.
