Underwhelmed I recently had the opportunity to go to Fork for a family dinner and I was underwhelmed. Ive been there in the past for drinks & appetizers and we really enjoyed ourselves; the atmosphere, service and food were excellent. Maybe my most recent experience was due to unrealistic expectations, but I don't think so. In fact, every member of our group was equally disappointed. Briefly, the atmosphere and service were very good, but the food just came up short. We had a variety of appetizers, entrees and desserts (not to mention a couple bottles of wine) to form our opinion. The Broiled Sea Bass (entree) and Bittersweet Chocolate Mousse Cake (dessert) were standouts; but most of the other items were considered fair at best. They included Grilled Bacon-Wrapped Chicken Livers (app), Braised Pork Belly (app), Seared Duck Breast (entree), Bread Pudding (dessert). I wont get into the gory details, but they just weren't all that great; I was expecting more, and at $50 (not including wine) I don't think that my expectations are off base. What do you think?
