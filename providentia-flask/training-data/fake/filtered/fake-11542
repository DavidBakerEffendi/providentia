As someone who frequents the Asian Grill, I can truly say what a great place it is to go and a great place to eat.  As I read some of these reviews I see that I am not alone.  It is a rare find to have a nice sit down chinesefood dinner in this area.  The staff is attentive, the food is excellent and the quality is good.  In the years that I have been going, I have never had a problem with either the staff or the food.  It is nice to go into a place where most of the staff knows you from previous visits.  I am a bid fan of shrimp and the variety of shrimp dishes offered gives me a sometimes tough choice.  Grand Marnier Shrimp is a must to try!     I also read the negative remarks written on 9/14/14.  I want to say that this guy must have had a bad day or maybe an off day at the restaurant.  But I do not think that is the case.  Formerly a service worker, I know that a long day is tiring and people want to go home.  I also walked in to this restaurant late and had a meal.  I had no problems with the staff or management but I was also respectful of the fact that the staff has most likely worked long hours and want to go home to finally relax.  Most people who go into any place late, do not realize or even care about what the employees went through that day or how long they have been there.  Even though I walked in late with my friend, we were welcome.      So trust me, as a man who likes to eat and a man who likes a relaxing sit down meal, this is the place to try.  Hopefully you won't run into a miserable person who wants his butt kissed instead of enjoying the little things in life!!
