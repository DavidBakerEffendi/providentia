We went to Grimaldi's over in Brooklyn under pouring rain, but the pizza was entirely worth it. The restaurant was packed at lunchtime when we arrived at lunch time, bustling with activity. I really liked the open kitchen where one can see the brick oven and different cooks stretching the dough and putting toppings. It gave the whole restaurant an even more dynamic, homey feel. We ordered the basic pizza which comes with fresh mozarella and basil. It came piping hot from the oven, I took a bite and thought: near perfection! The crust was thin and crispy like NY pizzas, but there was also a slight element of chewiness (very slight, as the crust itself is very thin) that allowed the flavor to fully come through. The tomato sauce had a tinge of spice and was perfectly seasoned. The fresh mozarella had melted in the oven and coated the pizza with a perfectly proportioned layer of moist, flavorful, high quality cheese. And finally, the basil was surprisingly flavorful for the quantity that was sprinkled on the pizza. All in all, the perfect marriage of ingredients. Grimaldi's has definitely lived up to the hype. Rain or shine, I'm going during my next NY trip.
