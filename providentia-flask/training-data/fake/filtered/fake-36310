KJB is the Best of the Best as their award from the Home News Tribune states.  Their bagels are delicious and always fresh.  The sandwiches and wraps are incredible and the portions are huge.  The owner is very creative in her menu choices and even her bagels.  Stop by around Christmas time and you will see candy cane bagels, St. Patrick's Day brings green bagels etc...  Try the French toast bagel or the giant stuffed bagel for your next party you won't be disappointed.  You may wait in a line for your food but that is because everything is made fresh and to order.  You can save yourself some time by calling or faxing your order in ahead of time.  The shop is open until 3pm on weekdays and 2pm on weekends so if you stop in late you may find a few flavors sold out but that speaks to their popularity!  They do catering too.  Everything I have had is delicious!!!!
