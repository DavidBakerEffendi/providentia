Ordered pizza at 9:45pm.  Pizza never arrived at the hotel.  When I called Vinnies III Pizza at 11:15 pm they said driver was on their way.  In addition they were very rude with a New Jersey take it or leave it attitude so I sent the Pizza back.  Like other individuals customer service is horrible at this place.
