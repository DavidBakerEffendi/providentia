Awesome neighborhood spot! The food is delicious, the atmosphere is nice and casual and it is so inexpensive ...especially when you consider the quality.  I went last week with 2 friends and we each had a side/appetizer, a main course, 1-2 glasses of (delicious) wine and 2 desserts to share.  The total bill was $90.  Amazing.  Highlights: calamari salad, red quinoa, roasted chicken.  The East Village has been waiting for a place like this!
