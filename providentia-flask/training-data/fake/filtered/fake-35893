The costumer service is superb! The food is pretty good. I had a chicken quesadilla, which was freshly made and tasty. There is a pretty standard selection to choose from in terms of breakfast/lunch. They have pastries, nice cafe drinks, and to top it all off ice cream, which is delicious. The location is perfect! There is a nice patio in the back that over looks the river and passaic (third ward) park. They also play lovely music that just sets the perfect mood for the morning/afternoon. I had a lovely afternoon there. I would definitely recommend you try this place out!
