i travel to MA every two month, and I've tried many good asian buffet restaurants there.  Grand buffet is one of best asian buffet restaurants in VT can compete with them!  i've tried both their lunch and dinner menu, i'd say if your budget is tight, then try all you can eat for around $7, you get lots of choices from chicken, beef and shrimp!  my favorite dishes is their crab rangoon, best! food is always hot there.  i also like their fresh pineapples and grape.  One of my friends told me, she saw the girl from Grand buffet shopping at Costco once, buying tons of fresh fruit and cooking oil there! that's good, at least we know where are the things we eat coming from! I sometimes crave for bbq ribs and crab legs, i would go for dinner on weekend, for around 12 dollars, you get all the seafood and other good stuff, never get dissapointed. and i think you can only find good sized crab legs in Grand buffet, no one else has them!  they have a sushi bar, cuz i don't really eat sushi , so can't commend, but i hear others who eat them saying it's pretty good.   i like this place, i always bring my whole family there when we have a get toghther. Got to mention  they have very pretty uniforms there, even the american hostess wears it, wish they sell it, so i can buy one for my mother!   just one thing, waitress need to work on their english more, but they are very nice, and efficient.  I talked to the american hostess once, she told me she sometimes teaches the girls English too, that's very good.  i hope they keep up the good work, and i think they are doing well , because they opened another one in south burlington, it's smaller than the one in essex, but very pretty decor inside. Next time, i will bring my family to south burlington location when they come visit us from MA.
