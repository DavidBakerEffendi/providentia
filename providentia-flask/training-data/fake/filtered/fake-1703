Always happy to give $100+ of my hard-earned money to the owners.  Those attractive men with rolled-up shirt sleeves, tight pants and bistro aprons seem to charm forth even more $ from my wallet.  Great location in SoHo, not far off the Spring St. blue line, first floor with a subdued facade shyly stating the name in the lower corner of the window.  Walked past it the first time. Be aware you'll be taking a wee hike if you bring a bike! All the trees and posts and front stoop banisters and fences and parking meters and stop signs are taken.  Bone marrow app completely worth the $16, as is the terrifyingly large pork shank deserving of the $35 it commands.German Hefe always tasty.  A burger will still run you $14, but it's a small price to pay to rent a 5 square foot piece of Manhattan for two hours.  Plus you might end up sitting next to Jane Lynch. Win.
