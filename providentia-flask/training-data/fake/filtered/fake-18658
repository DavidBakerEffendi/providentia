A friend was in town and I learned this was her *spot*. The must-do thing on the line-up. Having never been, sounded good to me. Everything was under complete control here. You walked in and you either had a reservation for the full-on restaurant or you could put your name in to be seated in the tavern area or put your name in to be seated at the bar. We did both and were able to quickly score a couple of seats at the bar. The menu at the tavern and bar is different from that of the back restaurant area. Everything on the bar/tavern menu looked great and was under $20 (save the steak my friend was able to talk the bartender into requesting of the kitchen - which came to $25). They had a fabulous holiday-esque appetizer of some variety of sausage complimented by herbs and nutmeg. It just tasted like holiday in a sausage form. Delicious. The cocktail listing was very impressive and varied. I tried their cranberry margarita, which was amazing. It used a house-made cranberry syrup, fresh cranberries, and vodka. When a drink is $12 it had better deliver, and deliver it did. For main course, I had their bacon-wrapped trout. If I had one critique of the menu it would be that for a menu that is seasonal and ever-changing, they did not offer descriptives that fully did the dish justice. I inquired to the bartender about the preparation of the trout and it was only then that I learned that it was not only bacon wrapped, but also stuffed with spinach inside. Extra selling point almost missed. And it was amazing. We topped off the evening with their brownie which came with toasted marshmallows and graham cracker ice cream. It was so good. And kudos for the restaurant for through-and-through splitting our split courses (appetizer + dessert). The dessert was like s'mores with a grown-up flair. Loved it!
