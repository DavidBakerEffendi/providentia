Order type: Dine in Order: Grilled cheese, corn bread, chicken biscuit. The service was fast and friendly and the food is very well priced. Unfortunately the food strikes me as essentially McDonalds with local appeal. The grilled cheese was just Kraft singles on white bread, the corn bread was good but was far from home made while the chicken biscuit was tasty but nothing to write home about. It's a piece of fried chicken, in a biscuit, with a pad of butter. Â For it's location in the world it is a culinary oasis. There is nothing of Pies 'N' Thighs taste or quality for a while in any direction. Putting aside is local monopoly though it becomes little more than a fatty, salty, fast-food joint purveying simple American standards to upbeat electro-pop.
