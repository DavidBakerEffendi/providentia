Sushi Kuu in my opinion is one of the top spots to eat in Morris county it has great service and food has always come out fresh. I recommend the black pepper ship its delicious and has so much flavor and also the snow crab rolls. Everything about the place is great and prefer it over Kazumi sushi. A must go to place if you like sushi.
