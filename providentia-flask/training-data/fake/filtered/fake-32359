By far the best truck/cart food I've ever had.  Better than 99% of the restaurants in which I've eaten, including ones where they check your Amex platinum card before they let you in.  (Don't ask how I got into places like those!)  And those guys are sweethearts. I've eaten every kind of plate, wrap and kebab they make, and I still can't make up my mind which is best.  Like most people, I've eaten the chicken and rice plate most often.  But I like to eat the schwarma--the best I've had--or "Freddy's Junior Plate," with chicken and kefta on rice.   You can get yellow rice, but I recommend the basmati:  It's very aromatic and flavorful. One caveat:  They will lard your dish with white and/or hot sauces unless you tell them otherwise.  I like a little bit of white and a good dose of the hot sauce.  And, yes, I take my plates and wraps with salad, mainly because I love those pickled beets. And ya gotta love those guys and their sign.  If any of them were single, I'd  take him home with me!  I mean, come on, nice guys with a sense of humor who can cook (and are kinda cute, at least to me): Where ya gonna find that?
