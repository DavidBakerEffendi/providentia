I frequently order delivery from here during the week to Tribeca at peak dinner hours. The food comes reasonably quickly and the quality is outstanding. They list as Italian comfort, and if you're thinking that might imply grimy/greasy, don't worry its not. The food is fresh, tasty, and filling. I highly recommend to anyone in the West or East Village, Soho, and Tribeca. Oh and if you're wondering, yes they are on seamless.
