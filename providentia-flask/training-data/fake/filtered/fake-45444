Four of us went to The Tavern to have two of the best dishes we have had.  The lobster mac and cheese and the meatloaf.  We arrived this afternoon only to be told that their menu had changed and they had neither of those dishes!!  The menu now is more bar food and no one was in the restaurant.  We immediately left and went to another restaurant.
