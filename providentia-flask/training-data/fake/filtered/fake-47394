I was staying at a hotel nearby and wanted a simple quiet dinner by myself.   I "found" Sotto 13 and was glad I did.   Stylish but neutral-tone, relaxing interior.   The bar area is attractive enough, but the skylit dining room is really special.   Simple menu.  Everything well prepared and presented.   Pizza crust so light it's barely there.   Tapas items are fairly large (a good thing, obviously).   You can make a great meal off 2 tapas and a glass of wine.   Friendly, engaging bar tender (Giovanni).   Most other diners appeared to be local resident regulars.    This is hard to pull off in New York, as the competition, especially in the west Village, is fierce.   Sotto 13 is not a "foodie" restaurant, but I was so impressed I took a New Yorker foodie friend of mine for dinner on another night, and he really liked it, too.
