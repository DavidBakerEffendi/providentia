The minimalist decor was too Ikea for me. It felt unfinished and I was underwhelmed. The service was very slow. We waited 15 minutes to place a drink order. And our appetizers came before our drinks. Getting attention was next to impossible for most of the meal. The food was excellent though. The poached egg with creme fraiche appetizer and miso cod entree rocked. The drinks were delightful, when they arrived. My friend said it was the best goat cheese omelette ever. The dessert was supposed to be a molten lava cake. However it was overcooked so there was nothing molten or lava like about it.  The center was barely moist and the outside was crisp.  the prices were great but I would be willing to pay more for better service. Given the location on the west side highway and the hike from the subway, I probably wouldn't venture back anytime soon. PS---The bathrooms felt unfinished like they were thrown together on a budget. I also requested a candle for my friend's birthday celebration on my open table reservation and they did not remember to do it.
