I have been coming here for my entire life and it is hands down the best Chinese food I have ever had. My family and I love their sesame chicken and fried dumplings among many of their other dishes. Service is always great and everyone is friendly. We love to both dine in and take out. I would recommend China Pavillion to everyone!
