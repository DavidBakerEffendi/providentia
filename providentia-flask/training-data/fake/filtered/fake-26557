hmmmm how can i start this review for Tops Diner.......EXCELLENT!!! I have been going to Tops for many years and it wasn't as good back then as has been the last couple of years.  They renovated the entire diner years ago and also made their mark as one of the best, and maybe The Best diner in the east coast!     Aside from having an extensive menu, they also have a bakery on site where they make fresh cakes, pastries and the best cheesecake every single day!  I must say....more people travel miles to go to the Cheesecake Factory for their cheesecake, I tell these folks "you have not tried a real cheesecake until you head to Tops"  They have a variety of flavors and as always, it's a big portion (cheap too for the size ) But I do have to warn those who are reading and have never been to Tops....make sure you wear comfortable pants becuase you are going to need to extra room around the stomach after eating.  Tops is know for given very generous portions of food.  The first time I order the cheese fries for an appetizer, I was thrown back by the mountain of fries and cheese served on the dinner plate.  It is easily an appetizer for 6 people. (Their fries are great too, freshly made for every order). As another reviewer wrote, the waiters are extremely nice.  I have yet to have someone who was rude or inattentive.   Tops used to be 24 hours...but recently did change their hours.  Such a drag not being able to go and having a huge portion of quesadillas at 4am :(   :)
