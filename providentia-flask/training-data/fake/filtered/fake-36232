Went here for Sunday Brunch.  I had the filet mignon benedict. It was very good.  The special hollandaise that it came with complimented the meat very well. It came with onion rings inside and, while they were good, it was a bit difficult to eat as intended, but I just treated it like a side NBD. And when you consider that you get a free drink, it is not a bad deal at $17. My friends had the smoked salmon benedict and the Pecan French Toast, both were good as well. Getting seated took a while, but that is to be expected of a brunch spot on Sunday in Manhattan.
