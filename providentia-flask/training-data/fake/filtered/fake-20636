We had the special burger, A-ok.the trout, beat salad and mixed greens, coconut cake and vanilla ice cream along with 2 good red wines $180.00. I had a really special beer on tap while waiting for a table. The place has such a true old world NYC flavor, the quality of ingredients were 5 star. The bartender at no charge brought out lovely hot cheese puffs just for me. The $8.00 beer seemed like a steal.The waitress threatened us if we asked for more pickles their would be an up charge. When you are paying close to eighty with tip included, does this seem right? Â But the food was good and I would go back.
