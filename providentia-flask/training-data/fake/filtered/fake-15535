If you are looking for a good sports bar with amazing food Manhattan Proper should be at the top of your list. I visit MP regularly and keep coming back for more. I don't think I have ever had better bar food. They mushroom truffle burger is probably top 3 out of anything I have ever eaten, and I personally do not like red meat with the exception of MP's burger! It is seriously so good. And their fries are also amazing. If you don't get the burger than definitely get the truffle fries, your mouth will explode. If you want to eat healthy they also have a really good salad, the pear and gorgonzola. But get it with chicken because it adds a lot more flavor. I seriously love this place; its decently priced, they always have specials on the food and drinks and its a good crowd!
