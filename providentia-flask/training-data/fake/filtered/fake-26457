Stopped by here yesterday for mother's day with my family and we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.  First of all, the spacious and bright floor plan is the perfect vibe for weekend brunch.  The blood mary is light, if you're looking for something more on the refreshing side, post-hangover. The pickle in the blood mary was awesome! The food was simple, yet done right.  I had the burger and my sister had the shortrib "hush"  and both were delicious and satisfying. They could really benefit from a cocktail menu, but I'm sure it will come in time.  I'm so happy this place opened in my neighborhood, where a good brunch spot is seriously lacking!
