WOW! My family and I went for dinner on a Monday at 6pm and there was a wait.. not a long one but we were surprised to see a constant flow of people coming in and waiting to be served. Â The waiter came to the table for our orders pretty much as we sat, but graciously gave us a few extra minutes. Once the order was placed they brought out the Greek salad rather expeditiously...and I must say it was the best Greek salad EVER! They give you two huge blocks of feta cheese so that you could basically toss it in the salad yourself. We ordered three different dishes and they were all exquisite! The lemon potatoes were also yummy.. by the time the desert (which is on the house) came along we were completely stuffed but ate it anyway. The only thing that I would like to point out is that it is really loud and not the best place to hold a conversation.. truthfully I was stuffing my mouth the entire time so this was a none issue for me.
