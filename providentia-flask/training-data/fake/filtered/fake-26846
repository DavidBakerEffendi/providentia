I just tried this place for the first time... I was in the mood for something fast filling inexpensive and relatively healthy.  I ordered a Chicken Burrito and it was delicious as well as fitting all my criteria.  I was so pleased that I also posted a review on Yelp for the first time.  It was simple and satisfying with fast and friendly service.  No complaints here :)
