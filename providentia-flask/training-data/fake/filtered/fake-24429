Food Network fame can cause gourmands to raise a cynical eyebrow toward celebrity chefs, but those of us who ate at Bobby Flay's former greats, Bolo or Mesa Grill, never lost faith.  Gato is amazing.  The atmosphere is elegant and interesting.  The menu choices offer something for everyone.  The "Bar" selections offer a choice of three small appetizers  from a tempting list.  The entrees we chose,  Berkshire pork, rabbit, steak, were abundant and beautifully paired with sides.  The service staff is friendly and helpful.  We had a lovely, if somewhat expensive evening.  We miss the blue corn duck tacos at Mesa Grill but love Gato and will be back.
