As I was coming home from work on R t21 South I saw The Jersey BBQ Pit and Grill I stopped in to bring home some dinner for my family and since that day I have fallen in love with this place.For only $10.95 you get a whole chicken or ribs with rice and fries.The chicken and ribs are cooked on a huge Bbq pit and basted with homemade seasoning.They are nice and moist. The salad is very good too. It is made with romaine lettuce and  your choice of dressing  You get a good portion of great food for a great price They also have wraps, burgers, and seafood the shrimp in Garlic sauce over yellow rice is delicious. The Staff  is very friendly and attentive.  This a great place if you want to dine in with friends or family. They have a large dine in area with big screen tv's and its a very clean enviroment. This is my favorite BBQ!
