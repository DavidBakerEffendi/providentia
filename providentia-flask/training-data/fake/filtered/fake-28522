My wife and I moved into the neighbor a few months ago and Station House quickly became our go to neighborhood bar. The atmosphere is loud and inviting, not the greatest date bar but a most go to for the beer and whiskey connoisseur . The rotating tap list always has something interesting and fun to try and fall in love with. And just like the weather if you don't like it wait a few minutes and it will change. I especially love the digital pour on tap board that let's you know how far along a tap is and when it is about to kick. The food is delicious especially the burgers. Now a personal note and observation: When did the buy back become extinct? I have noticed this a lot lately. It started here but ironically enough last time I was here we got a buy back. I thought the rule was after 3 or 4 beers the next round was on the house. Did this change and I miss it? Station house is worth the trip to Forest Hills, now that I said this please leave 2 bar stools open for me and my wife.
