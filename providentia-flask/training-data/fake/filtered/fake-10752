We looooooove Chicken City! Especially at 3AM after a night of partying, always good to pick up a bucket of chicken with EXTRA hot sauce! It's in a convenient location next to a gas station and a convenience store and the food is so good. They will customize your order to your liking, but wont let you use the bathroom. Unfortunately there are no places to sit in and it is very small, so if you get food from there, you either bring it some place or eat it in your car.
