My husband and I visited doma for a relaxing meal and got that exactly. They did a wonderful job with the decor and overall theme of the restaurant. They didn't miss a single detail, including the bathroom.  My one complaint is that there weren't nearly enough tables with chairs. Most of the seating consisted of bar tables with bar stools. The bar stools were incredibly uncomfortable and for me made the experience an annoying one as I was constantly adjusting myself on the seat. Now I don't mind a bar stool, but if you are going to occupy most of your restaurant with them, at least make sure they are comfortable. My husband and I started with the rock shrimp tempora which was nothing to rave about. It had a sauce that resembled buffalo wing sauce and was too strong. We also had the octopus ceviche which was delicious. Our main meal consisted of the DIY hand rolls. What a wonderful idea and it was such a hit at our table. The sushi was excellent and the prices weren't bad at all. Dont forget to bring cash. My husband and I received 10% off our meal which was a plus!  I will definitely be going back to Doma and perhaps bringing a seat cushion with me.
