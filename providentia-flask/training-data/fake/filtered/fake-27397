Went there on a Monday at noon when they weren't busy. It was 93 degrees outside and we are not teenagers. No one acknowledged our presence for at least fifteen minutes. No water was brought to our table. service was very poor. If you asked a waiter for something, they wouldn't do it because it wasn't their job. They have divided responsibilities. The Sicilian pizza was delicious. Meatballs were mealy. They brought the wrong salad. I will not return to this over hyped restaurant.
