Traif is energetic and exciting; if you can get a table for four you're working at pace. Fast moving space, warm colors, well volumed music. The kitchen is open and strikingly small. And you can see the dizzying dance of waiters and the lone wolf chef, opening a refrigerador with her foot while sauteeing greens and looking for an extra hand to plate something. The menu reads like a long list of ingredients. So you've really got to think in combinations. It seems overwhelming at first, but once you get the hang of it, you sort of get to curate your own tasting menu. For three people we ordered 9 dishes and felt full but not stuffed. The food, really, is great. Probably the best restaurant I've eaten at in Williamsburg--for the sheer variety and relative consistency. That being said, there were a few misses (but out of 9 dishes, I could say that 6 were really stellar and 3 were good, but not something worth coming back for) As I'm looking at the menu now, to decide what I would recommend, most of it has changed. The staples have stayed and you really can't miss with them: Pork belly Seared foie Strawberry cinnamon ribs and the scallops, oh the scallops. Eat on.
