One of of my old friends came into the city and a bunch of us went here to kickstart our weekend with brunch at The Smith. We had made a reservation and even after being 30 mins late, they still kept a table aside for us. The staff was nice and friendly and the food was delicious. Huge quantities but slightly pricey too. Would definitely ask everyone to go for a once in a month kinda brunch place.
