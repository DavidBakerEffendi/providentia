Went there on valentines day and had to eat from a pre fix menu, which was subpar. The whole roasted chicken was oily and lacked flavor, not resemblant of a 5 star restaurant, which piora is supposed to be. While looking at the menu, my boyfriend and I had to choose from either the vegetarian or meat option: a head of cauliflower for two or a whole roasted chicken for two as the entree. When explaining that my boyfriend is vegetarian and I eat meat, we asked if we could each have cauliflower and chicken to which they said no, that we had to pick-that each entree has been pre-made/ordered. That being said, one of us went home starving after a relatively expensive meal. Furthermore, we were seated in the front on tiny tables and were told we would get comped ($125 to $100) for not sitting in the main dining room. When the bill came, it did not reflect this. The manager came over and fixed the bill. However, when we told him we were not happy with our meal, he offered no discount etc.
