We walked in without a reservation for an early dinner and decided to sit outside. The beautiful hostess greeted us warmly and made us feel welcome. We all ordered cocktails that took a while to get to the table, but were well worth it once they did. Try the watermelon mint drink, very refreshing . The service was attentive and polite, very professional. I wish I remembered the waiters name. The food was good, not great, I felt the portions were a little too small. When we were almost done with our meal it started to rain and we moved inside by the bar. Some of our food got wet and we lost our drinks in the storm. The manager noticed we lost our drinks and insisted that he send us a round at the bar. This wasnt necessary , we told him that he didn't make it rain and we chose to sit outside. He brought us to the bar,made room for us and told the bartender to take care of us. We appreciated all the pampering and will be back.
