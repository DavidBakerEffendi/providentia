DON'T EVER GO TO THIS RESTUARANT, IT WILL B A HUGE MISTAKE.  Hands down the worst restaurant I have ever been to.  Not only was the food terrible, but the service was even worse.  It took us two hours to get our food and it tasted nasty.  Furthermore, it reeks of smoke because they allow people to smoke hookah.  DON'T EVER GO TO THIS RESTAURANT.
