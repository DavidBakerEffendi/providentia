Having been to Austria many times, my wife and I were craving an authentic Austrian meal.  She has been to Seasonal a few times--whose owner also owns Edi & the Wolf--and likes it a lot.  And upon reading the good reviews, Edi's seemed like a slam-dunk.   That's where things went all wrong.  Once we got there, we each ordered a glass of wine.  My glass of red came cold, really cold.  While I am not a wine connoisseur, it's wine 101 that red wine should not be served cold.  Strike one. I ordered the Wiener Schnitzel--which happens to be pork.  Although I prefer veal, I'll accept a good pork Schnitzel.  While it's tasted good, the presentation was not good at all and the price was pretty high ($19) for a pork dish, especially for its size.  Strike 2 (caught looking). My wife ordered the flatbread which has artichokes, cheese, arugula and cipollini.  She could only eat half because it was that disgusting not to mention greasy.  Because I was still hungry after I finished my meal, I decided to have the rest of her dish.  After one bite, I couldn't stomach eating anymore because it was that gross.  Strike 3.  We're never going back. I'll also mention that the waitress service was not that good.  I expect something more professional and knowledgeable from a serious restaurant.
