My wife and I went for dinner on Saturday night. While the food is good, it is not "great" and the portions are small. If you have the fries in duck fat you will be asking yourself waht the big deal is! The service was very good. It was disapointing that they don't have a full bar and only one bathroom (which is to expected for a LES restaurant). It's the kind of restaurant that was intersting to go to once but not a place that we will be running back to on a regular basis as opposed to Prune, Little Owl etc.
