Great food, great service.  My boyfriend and I have been here twice now and have been impressed by the quality of the food and also the service.  The second time we went, the waitress (who remembered us! A great feeling) brought us a different kind of sauce to try on our food, as well as a taco de lengua to try - the boyfriend thought it was pretty good. We had the taco de carnitas as well as the enchiladas suisas (we had ours with chicken), both tender and flavorful.  As Eric H noted, the salsa is clearly homemade and delicious.  Both times the rice has been fluffy (not dry) and flavorful.  The waitress was happy to accommodate my request for no cilantro. A great restaurant I hope you'll try.  On Sundays from 1-4 there are Mariachis!  What more could you ask for?
