I echo some of the comments below ... Overpriced and unfriendly service.  Worse yet, very deceptive business practice. Ordered take outs, and when we got home and opened the package, it was not even close to what I ordered -- most of it was just white rice and broccoli, not to mention the food smelled and tasted funny.  This place is not cheap -- $10 for a lunch special!  That's outrageous especially considering the portion and questionable quality of the food. Called to point out the problem and air out my concern, and the manager was confrontational and unapologetic. Avoid this place -- not worth it!
