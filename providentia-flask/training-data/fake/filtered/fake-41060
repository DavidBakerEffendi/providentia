I had dinner here on my trip to NY. I heard great stuff about this place. Plus, it was featured on a Food Network special as one of the best pizzeria, so course, that convinced me even more to stop by. The wait was long, but my group and I decided to wait the 20-30 minutes. After waiting outside in the cold for a bit, we managed to find seats at the bar and have a drink before being called. The place is rather small, but it has a nice and cozy feeling. We were sat at the end of the restaurant away from the big crowd, which was nice. We ordered the house salad and a large pizza with peperoni. There was a total of four people in the group, and our order was more than enough. The salad was really good, especially their house vinaigrette dressing. I think I even served myself twice. The pizza was excellent. All the ingredients were fresh, and each slice was bursting with flavor. I'm not sure what type of pizza this is. I would categorize it as a thin crust although it is slightly thicker than usual, but it's definitely not thick/deep dish. Service was great. Everything was prompt, and our server always checked up on us to make sure we were okay with drinks. At the end of our meal, we were so full that we had a slice of pizza left over. I would recommend this place for anyone that is visiting NY for the first or fifth time. Its a mush go to place.
