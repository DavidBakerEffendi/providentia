Worst Indian food in US. I concluded this after visiting 3-4 times to this restaurant. just to make sure its not one bad day for the restaurant. 1st time - We ordered chicken tandoori as appetizer and fish curry as main dish. chicken tandoori was red, pale,rubbery and awful taste. I complained to the owner and just to our astonishment, the owner told that to save our time they cook tandoori in the morning and just warm them before serving to customer during Â dinner time ( I don't know what FDA people will do if they know about this). Fish curry was horrible and asked the server to replace it. The server replaced it but told us that it will be charged. Second and 3rd time was also same awful experience. I tried 3 times because this was the only Indian restaurant near to my hotel. Indian taste buds - Not even think of going to this restaurant. I'm damn sure you can cook any food better than this restaurant. American taste buds - Please don't have any bad perception about Indian food just by trying food at this restaurant. There are not many Indian restaurant in Burlington but try Indian food whenever you go to big cities.
