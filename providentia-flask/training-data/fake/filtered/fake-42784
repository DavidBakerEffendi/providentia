In response to Bob P,'s review it seems he visited a different restaurant!  I have eaten at Hendrickson's for over 20 years and continue to go back for more.  They serve the best steaks as well as all of the other menu items.  My family and friends travel for over 50 minutes one way to dine here.  They serve quality, fresh, huge portions.  I cannot imagine your complete meal costing $40 per person considering Hendrickson's gives you soup or salad AND FRESH veg and potato with your meal!  They make their own mozzarella.  Their bread comes from Altamuri Italian Bakery fresh daily.  I know this because I have asked where the delicious bread comes from.  As for the pictures hanging, they have been hanging there for at least 20 years.   Your review is so off base it seems as if you were referring to a different restaurant.  I feel certain that diners will get a very good meal and should not be swayed by your negative comments.
