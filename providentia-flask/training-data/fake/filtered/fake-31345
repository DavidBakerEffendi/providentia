It wasn't the food that was bad (the food was great), it was the service that was unacceptable. In particular, the service from a waiter named Christian at the Tribeca location. I tried so hard to overlook it because I wanted to enjoy my birthday dinner with friends. We weren't rude, nagging or anything like that, but he made a point not to check in much at our table at all. It was mind boggling to see him stop pleasantly at all the other tables around us and not check on us even once. We arrived and waited 20 minutes before he said hello and took our drink orders, it took another 20 minutes before we could order our entrees, and instead of asking us if we wanted dessert he put the bill on the table and walked off without a word. We saw him three times during the entire time we were there (once to order drinks, once to take entree orders, and briefly when he dropped the bill).... oh wait there was one more time.... when he came back and said we shorted him 20 bucks. That was the last straw... we left an additional tip on top of the bill after all that to "kill him with kindness" and he accuses us of trying to get over. What the hell was that about?!? Instead of bringing the money back with him (even though I know he wasn't shorted) he says he mixed it in with the other money and just needs an additional 20. Who does that? That's like telling a bank teller he/she shorted you and you already took the money home so they should just give you some more money. Unbelievable, unacceptable, and never again.
