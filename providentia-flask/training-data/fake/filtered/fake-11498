OMG best BBQ a in town! The night my boyfriend was in town he mentioned walking by the restaurant earlier that day and asked if I had heard of it. I had never seen it as it is kind of hidden by a quaint quiet street. Anyway, I'm so happy we found this gem, the food and service were outrageously good! From ribs, to Mac and cheese, to the homemade banana pudding!! Go there right now, you will not regret it!
