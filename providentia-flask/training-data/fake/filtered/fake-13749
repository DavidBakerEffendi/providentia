My wife and I have lived in DUMBO for the past 4 years. We used to order take out from Grimaldis every few weeks. But over time it became clear: the fabled pizzeria started devouring its own hype. From there, the standards started slipping. The last few times we went (this past summer) the pizza was always under cooked or unevenly cooked. Enter Juliana's. After months of anticipation owning to a long construction schedule and court battles with Grimaldis owner Ralph Ciollo, the place finally opened. My wife and I have eaten there twice in the past few weeks. Here's where they're better than Grimaldis: Service - people are very friendly and approachable as opposed to Grimaldis who runs the place like a sweatshop and appears to have members of the Russian mob involved. Atmosphere - the place has been fully renovated to a tasteful (read: not kitschy), well lit restaurant as opposed to Grimaldis whose new digs at 1 Fulton can't overcome a Â kitschy, shite experience. Mozzarella - Juliana's has a more flavorful mozz on their pies. It's instantly noticeable. Crust - The crust is perfect. Slightly thicker than Grimaldis and more importantly it's cooked properly, slightly charred on the outside consistently, all around the edges and hot and moist on the inside. Here's where they're different than Grimaldis: Sauce - they both use high quality San Marzano tomatoes to make their pizza sauce, but where Grimaldis is tangier and brighter, Juliana's is more seasoned, particularly with Oregano. Toppings - from what I've seen so far, Juliana's has more topping choices than Grimaldis (meatball anyone?) but both places have equal, good quality toppings.
