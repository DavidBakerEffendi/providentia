Steer clear if you have any special dining needs.  Even a request for a bowl of soup without a sandwich will be a problem (serious wheat allergy here).  The nasty waitress was annoyed by my health problem and it's really not necessary to pay $14. for a mediocre margarita in New York.  My dining companion reported a so, so burger on a grocery store roll and a stingy serving of fries  for $15. bucks.  You would tolerate this place in a suburban strip mall, but it's not up to Soho standards.
