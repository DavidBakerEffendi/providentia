Came here on one of those groupon deals Monday night. Happy we did. It was a great deal with a lot of food for the price. I hope they keep it! The service was good but the spagetti was sub-par. A little dry and the sauce was watery so I prob won't order that again but the portion was great. Heard their brunch is off the hook. I'll be back to try that soon.
