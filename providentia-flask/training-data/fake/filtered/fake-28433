Apparently, the reason why the Strawberry Waffle for my 5yo son was served 20 MINUTES LATER than both mine and my husband's orders was that "they had to make it fresh" (ah! what a joke - should I have expected a stale one to get a better service?). When the waffle finally got to our table, it was barely lukewarm. Hence, the waiting was even more unjustified. I pointed that out to the waitress telling her that that kind of timing was unacceptable. The waitress only concern was taking the plate away from my son (who still hadn't even taken a bite and that after that was in tears) informing me that she'd already proceed to take that out of our bill. All the while she didn't even stop at our table to properly hear us out. The experience was so awful, I signed up on yelp for my very first review.
