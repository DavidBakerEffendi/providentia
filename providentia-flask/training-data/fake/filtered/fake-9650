I think the reviews Single Pebble is getting are relatively unfair and fall under the "i only ate here once" category.  I have been eating at this establishment since it was conceived many years ago when it was just a chinese place next to a bowling alley in Barre (Anyone else remember this?).  It definitely had it's busy fad moment where i recall people saying "you need to make a three week or month advanced reservation".  These days have passed and now only the burlington restaurant remains.  Over the years I have noticed these things.  It is definitely Chinese-American fusion mixed with some other asian culinary aspects.  It is NOT "too expensive" and yes, the mock eel is delicious.  I would not say it's on par with some of the restaurants I have eaten at in NYC but it is very, very good for a Vermont fusion restaurant.  The service can really be subpar at times and that's where it loses 1 star for me.  I once had an experience where a group of us asked if we could add two people (it might have even been one person but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt) and they said they couldn't... which really really pissed off my friend's dad, who never returned.  This aspect of the business is hot and cold though... i have had excellent service many, many more times than bad service. The food, in total, has been excellent though and I could not love a dish more than the Buddha's Sesame Beef which I think could be the single greatest vegetarian dish ever.
