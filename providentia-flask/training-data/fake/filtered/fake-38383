What an amazing experience my boyfriend and I had at Tashan.  From the food, to the service to the ambiance, everything was an A+.  First off I must say our waiter Tyler was outstanding.  It was my boyfriends first time ever eating Indian food and was very reluctant to try this place out.  Our waiter was extremely articulate and enthusiastic about every question he answered and dish he described.  I told him it was my boyfriend's first time ever eating Indian food and he had some great recommendations for us.  The butter chicken, naga beef sumi and lamb chops were just a few of the phenomenal dishes we had, all recommended by our server.  The ambiance was great to, I loved the open kitchen and modernized feel the entire restaurant had.  Even though the restaurant was very busy the night we were there our server made us feel as though we were his most important guests.  The food came out in a timely fashion, the plates and silverware were changed out for each course, and I never once had to ask to refill my water or for a new drink.  The cocktails were also spectacular, I had the Tashan and my boyfriend had the agni (both recommended by our waiter) and they were absolutely delicious.  It was also a great touch to see my napkin nicely folded for me when returning from the bathroom.  Also, best creme brulee I ever had, another great recommendation.  I will definitely be coming back here with friends and spreading the word how great this place is.  Thank you for such a wonderful experience!
