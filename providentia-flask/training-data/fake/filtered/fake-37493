I was ready to come back to the Good Fork while I was still in the middle of my meal. We came here after seeing the dumpling throwdown with Bobby Flay.  The dumplings were definitely good, as were the drinks, but the real highlight was the tile fish.  Oh man oh man oh man.  It was perfectly cooked, with a nice crisp on the top, and it was complemented with pea shoots, meyer lemon, and some minty something or other.  I'm pretty sure they put a generous dash of heaven in the mix as well. The one (minor) complaint I would have had is that the service was a little slow.  This wasn't an issue because a) I was enjoying myself and the cuteness of the place, so I didn't care, and b) because they felt so guilty about making us wait that they decided to "make it up to us".  I was expecting maybe a free dessert.  I got just that.  Plus two more.  Yes, that's right, they brought the two of us THREE free desserts because the kitchen had been a little backed up.   Holy hell, I'm in love.
