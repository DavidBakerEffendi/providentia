I thought the food here was excellant...it was my first time going on a recomondation from my sister and brother n law who also came with us, we were a party of 5 and we had apps, drinks, and dinner and our bill was $80...and we did not leave hungry....the service was superb, food hot and the atmosphere wonderful.....thanks Michael for a great time...can not wait to come back.....5 star in my book!!!
