Big Wong is legendary. Best wonton noodle soup and congee in Manhattan. It's where I go whenever I want comfort food. Food is cheap and incredibly fast. Like order to table in less than 3 minutes. Food is consistently good. Roasted meats like the roast duck and roasted port over rice and soy sauce is another favorite of mine. Goal is to try out their entire menu (which is huge).
