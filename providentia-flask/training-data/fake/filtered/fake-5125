1. I loved the environment especially on the outdoor patio. Nice space, airy, with a cool tiki bar, plenty of plants, and situated between two very cool murals that make it really unique. 2. We had the margaritas and they were spot on, and I think they used a dash of OJ, which I like. 3. We had the pork sandwich, which was awesome. Also the mac n cheese was a pleasant surprise. The field green salad was nice as well. No complaints on the food at all and the price was less than what i expected. 4. The ownership is very friendly, granted it wasn't packed when we got there, so we got extra attention, but you get the feel that they are really invested in the place and genuinely care. 5. Finally, I see huge potential for this place, not too many cozy outdoor spaces, and they plan to have live music as well, I'll be back there for sure! Ryan
