Living in Bushwick, and infrequently dining in Bushwick, I was pleasantly surprised with Roberta's.  I saw the chalkboard sandwich sign outside what looked like a vacant building and checked it out (impressed at first peek) and promised myself to return in the near future.   A few friends and I went on a recent evening.  Very thin pies with thick crusts, a nice array of toppings, specials and even a nice vegan pizza option!  They also had a specials that looked mighty tasty.  My only complaint was the service.  They were friendly enough, but just didn't seem to have it together that night.   There wasn't any flatware at the table (or napkins) so after our food was delivered and we waited for a bit, my boyfriend got up and found some for the table.  Waitress seemed to be off the vibe that we were putting her out... food was good, its BYOB! we'll definitely give it another shot.
