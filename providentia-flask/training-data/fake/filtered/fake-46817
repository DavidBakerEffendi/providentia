We just had our daughters wedding in early July at the Park Ave Club Â and the service throughout the evening was outstanding. This difference is "Character", which the Park Ave Club offers in appearance and service. The cocktail hour during the evening was fanatastic, the guests were very impressed with the presenation and selection. The food during the wedding was great. I had the Chiliean Sea Bass which was outstanding. If you're looking for a great place to have a wedding or special event the Park Ave Club offers everything top shelf from beginning to end. John B
