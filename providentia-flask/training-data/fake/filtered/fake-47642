We visited Grimaldi 's back in June on a Wednesday night. We arrived  around 6:00 pm after walking across the Brooklyn Bridge. This was our first trip to NYC and were super excited to try "Real NYC" pizza!  We were expecting a long line after reading all the reviews, but to our surprise our party of 3 was able to be seated right away. It was a very small dining room and the tables were very close. Our waiter came right over and took our order which was a large Margherita Pizza.  Our pizza arrived very quickly and was definitely the best pizza we had ever eaten! The best part about Grimaldi's was the price. It was by far our cheapest meal in NYC, and one of the best.  We will definitely be back on our next trip to the city. Oh, and when we left there was probably about 20 people in line...so definitely go early.
