The food at this place was great! I had the spaghetti and meatballs and it was so tasty and creamy! The bread was delicious as well as the chickpeas drenched in olive oil that went with the bread. Wine was also very good. Then why only 2 stars?? The customer service was terrible!  A friend of mine decided to have dinner there to celebrate her 30th birthday.  When she made the reservation for 7:00 p.m., she told them that one of her guests (me) would be running about a half hour late.  They said that would be fine but that I needed to be there at 7:30 on the nose.  Of course I wasn't but the rest of the party was there at 7:00 and were seated.  When I got off the train at 7:50 my phone rang.  It was my friend wanting to know where I was because they had to put in an order.  I told her that I was right around the corner but to go ahead and order without me.  I would put mine in as soon as I got there.  She said the waittress needed the whole party had to be seated to place the order.  SINCE WHEN?! I've heard of waiting for a whole party to be present to be seated but not to order.  Once I got there and was settled in, I quickly scanned the menu but not without the waittress hovering over me and placed my order.  After that she ignored us for most of the time we were there.  Considering how she was sweating my friend about me not being there you would think she wold have been more attentive.  Then after a delicious meal, a cake was brought out and we sang happy birthday.   Shortly after that we got the check.  After we figured out how much each of us owed we handed it back to the waitress.  The money in the billfold wasn't even cold before the maitre'd was asking us to vacate the table! We had just spent over $400 on dinner and they couldn't let us chill for a minute?! That was some bullshit!
