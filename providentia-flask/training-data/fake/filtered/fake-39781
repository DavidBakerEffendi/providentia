Since eating several mediocre dinners at London Grille, it is never my first pick when going out to eat in the neighborhood. My husband and I decided to eat brunch here this morning and while he was simply unimpressed I was disgusted by the terrible food. Cons: Small portions Tasteless, cold, yet overcooked unappetizing food Very expensive coffee Pros: Bloody Mary Bar Friendly staff Good beer selection Aside from grabbing a beer in the future, we will not be eating here again.
