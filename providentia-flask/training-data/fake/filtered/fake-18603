Absolutely recommended!!  My husband turned me on to Gramercy Tavern, he said it was one of his favorite restaurants. I couldn't agree more!  Friendly, professional, attentive, knowledgeable staff.  I filled out a comment card the first time I was there... every time we go back, they know EXACTLY what I like.  We went for my mother's birthday and upon ordering our server said "I know you aren't a fan of seafood, but this is a must try"  he couldn't have been more right!  From a card I filled out years before, they know on the spot my likes and dislikes what wine we've ordered what we like what they recommend.... We are both foodies, we have been to French Laundry, LeCirque, The Striphouse, Butter, Lambs Club, Aureole, etc.  Gramercy Tavern takes the cake!  Awesome place, can't say enough great things about this establishment.  Except this... I received an email from the Head Chef thanking me for the spectacular reviews I gave him and his staff on my comment card.  It makes you feel good when someone acknowledges you giving them accolades.
