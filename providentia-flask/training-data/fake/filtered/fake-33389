I love Edo Sushi. Their cold noodles in sesame sauce with hot chili sauce on top is something to die for. I lived in Asia for a decade and returned to NJ a few weeks ago. My wife and I went to Edo as a special treat and got their cold noodles. I fell on it like a Jackal on fresh meat! It was just as delicious as the last time I had it many years ago. I highly recommend Ed Sushi! We live all the way in Burlington, so it is quite a drive, but worth it!
