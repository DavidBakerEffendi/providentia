I thought this place was a BUST! First off they sat us in the worst seat in the entire place! No view of the park!  The menu is extremely confusing and hard to navigate. Most of the dishes are written in Italian with no good description in English. There were about 10 different people that came over to our table they all had about as much personality as a stick. The artichoke dish was overcooked. The lettuce of the salad I ordered had not been washed! So I bit into a huge chunk of dirt. The sandwich I got was not what I expected so I had to send it back. My friend ordered lamb and it tasted ok but was filled with fat. The wine was good that's about it! As well as the free mints in the bathroom. Overall this place was overpriced and not worth the money. A lot of hype and nothing special I left with a headache and a stomachache.  On top of that the chairs aren't sturdy and fall over when you stand up. Surprisingly this placed is packed and popular I just don't get it. My friend left a huge tip, which I thought was totally unnecessary! If I was there alone I would of stormed out after the dirt in the salad.  Like many people stated the desert was the best part aside from the wine.
