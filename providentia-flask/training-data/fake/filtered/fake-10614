My family recently visited this restaurant for our son's birthday and we absolutely loved it! This was a great place to celebrate as a family, and it seems like a nice environment for a date as well. The kids loved grabbing the different sushi plates off of the belt, and the rolls ranged from the most simple and traditional to unique and complex. I recommend the Umi Roll and the Geisha Roll if you would like to try some of the chef's specialities. We also ordered the chicken teriyaki bowl, which we all shared. The service was exceptional  -  even though we waited about 8 minutes for our booth, we were immediately attended to and were able to order drinks right away. We'll be back, Umi!
