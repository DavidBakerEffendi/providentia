Honestly, this place was pretty disappointing.  I had heard many good things about Tia Pol, and was excited to go, but the food was just Eh, and the wait was quite long.  We had Sangria to start, which was pretty delicious, but after that it was all downhill.  Highlights were the blue cheese croquettas, which were extremely miniature, but good.  The bread with three sauce dish didn't make sense.  The bread already had a garlic tomato sauce on it, so who wants to put another dip on top of that?  In all, the food was nothing to write home about, and the portions were very little, even for tapas.   With that said, the place had a very nice ambiance and would have been great if we had been going for drinks and not dinner.
