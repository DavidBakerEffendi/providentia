The place has a well deserved reputation and maintains it well.  Our office is close so on occasion we have business lunches as well as dinners here. It is odd but in many of the times we've been here rarely have we had someone greet us as we enter.  In addition the coat check, or lack of thereof, is a disappointment especially in bad weather and winter.   Breads and appetizers have always been good.  I've particularly enjoyed their carpaccio appetizer..  The portion size for both lunches and dinners are quite ample.  The Chicken Sausage has been a favorite for years and I still recommend it.  I am not a big dessert person, but I have to say through the years I have tried several and found them to be very good. I find the Lunch service more enjoyable than dinner since the crowd is often not as full, and with the open floor plan, allows you to talk reasonably.  I have also been one of the last to finish a few times and they never make you feel rushed to leave. Dinner service, particularly at peak time, can be very difficult to talk especially if you have a larger group.  At certain times of the year, particularly the Holidays, I would lower my rating  since the the combination of noise level and parties which include children makes conversation very difficult. The bar configuration an orientation I find a bit strange but the selection and service have always been good.
