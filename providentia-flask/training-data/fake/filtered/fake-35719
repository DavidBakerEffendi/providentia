The staff was incompetent.  First closing out our drink purchases when they knew we would be eating at the bar.  Lost our credit card..waitress found it behind the bar..then while we're eating our tasteless Pasta e Fagioli..waitress is behind my husband saying he didn't sign the merchant copy ..and where is it...WTF...It's probably on the floor behind the bar.  Needless to say we didn't finish our meal and promptly left, never to be back.  If you want a dinner that's tasteless with ditzy and incompetent staff go to Panevino in Livingston, N.J.  Two thumbs down. ( Couldn't find my merchant copy...hmmmm..funny when I checked credit card transactions an hour after I left guess what...the charge was there.  Relaxing........NOT!!!!!
