I used to live right near Govinda's, so I went there all the time for a while, and I still love the chicken cheesesteak, but I want to vent a specific frustration. The service is really pretty bad, but you can tell there's a lot of turnover there, so there's always new people trying to figure things out, and that's completely fine. But.. On more than one occasion, I have called in an order and, being polite like my momma taught me, I said "Could I please have... "  or "I'd like to order..." and the person on the other end snapped at me with, "Can you hurry up and order! we're really busy."   What is that?! So the time it took for them to be a jerk wasted more time than my extra few words of courtesy.
