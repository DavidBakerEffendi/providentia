More proper name: The Sh** Hole: So the waitress, who calls herself the "owner" was the most rude person I have ever run into. When I asked for my check, I had to ask 3 times before I got it. Waited 20 minutes after my drink was empty for someone to ask me if I needed another... The guy next to me asked for his and she put both of us on the same check. When I explained to her that we were on separate checks she copped an attitude. I also explained that my burger was well done when I asked for medium and she said it was my fault as I should had alerted her right away. I was a waitress, before I went to college and that was part of the job... Couldn't have been more than 4 people in there but she was too busy to check in. After she handed the check back to me she said "have a nice weekend, even with the stick up your a**." This b** calls herself the owner of a business???? How long is that going to last?? WORST SERVICE EVER. Don't call her out if she makes a mistake, she will show you the real meaning of the word C***
