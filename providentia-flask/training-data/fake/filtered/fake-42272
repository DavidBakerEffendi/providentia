The perfect definition of "hole in the wall". Cant beat freshness or prices. Dont expect a receipt and pay in cash. There isnt a lot of space to eat there (6 stools...3 inside, 3 outside...weather permitting). Most people come by for take out. I prefer the fresh dumplings over the frozen ones....but that is up to you. When possible...I head... I've had a lot of dumplings from a number of dumpling shops throughout NYC and other areas Prosperity Dumplings gives you a lot of food for your buck. I bought a bunch of dumplings cooked in a variety of ways, plus two large soups for just over $10.00. It is your normal Chinatown take out shop.What this shop lacks in. OVER ALL IT WAS GOOD EXPERIMENT.
