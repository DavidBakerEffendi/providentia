I enjoy eating here, though I try to go during off-peak times as it can get very loud. the reason for 3 stars is that while I enjoy eating at the restaurant and have never had problems with my food - takeout here is never as good as it is from local chinese delivery places. Mainly I find that maybe the sauces don't hold up as well as they could, and the portions seem to be way smaller than they are eating in the restaurant.
