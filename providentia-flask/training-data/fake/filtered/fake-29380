I went to Rogues Gallery recently and was really impressed with the overhaul to the old TA Flanneries especially the menu.  Trust me, you will not be disappointed with the amazing buffalo wings, burgers, or Mac and cheese I promise.  Great neighbor joint to watch the Phillies.   Also, cozy atmosphere, great location, and fun Friday/Saturday night crowd with a DJ.
