Discovered the new sushi place in a small shopping center on Clarksville Rd. Decor is simple and clean. Starter salad with ginger dressing was good. We found the miso soup to be much better than most places around - not too salty. Scallop ceviche was excellent - generous portion with the chef's special concoction of sauces finished off with fresh lime slices between each piece. Sushi sashimi for 2 was excellent as well - the fish was very fresh and nicely cut, includes a special roll and a california roll. We also tried one of their Bento Box options - Chicken teriyaki box. Had a variety of foods typical of bento boxes - tempura, shumai, a cali roll. The teriyaki was quite good, not too sweet with excellent flavor. Staff was very friendly and attentive. The sushi chef is very experienced and answered all our questions. Definately recommend this place to all sushi lovers and for good Japanese fare.
