Been there at least 4 times and every time you must be prepared that the waiting time is about 30 mins to 1 hour, I am not kidding, just that long wait so the food will never disappoint you as well, the akedashi modern ramen and pork bun are my favorite, fare price and great food, super awesome atmosphere and you will feel like you are in Japan Ramen place, there's nothing to complaint except for the long wait.
