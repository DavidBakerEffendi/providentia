I have read many of the comments and agree with most of them.  I guess no one who wrote a review has been to the Polish National Home lately.  They have done renovations to the room downstairs and it has drastically changed the atmosphere for the better and they will be continuing with the renovation of other areas.  As far as the food, it speaks for itself.  It is great.  Try this place.  It definitely is a hidden treasure.
