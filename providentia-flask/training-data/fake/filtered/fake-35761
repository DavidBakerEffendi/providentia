What an excellent find! I went with the wife on a sunday afternoon, we shared some savory and some sweet crepes. The atmosphere is cozy but cute, the food is AMAZING. It can be a quite a wait as the chef prepares each crepe personally, but the comfortable atmosphere was fine by us on a laid back Sunday.
