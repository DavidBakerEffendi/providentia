Rude service. Poor value. Over-hyped - only thing it has going for it is the convenient location. You're far better off going down to Mott St - Â the Manhattan mecca of banh-mi sandwiches for $4-5. I ordered a duroc pulled pork sandwich. Bread to meat ratio was too low. Bread was hard and created the squeezing of meat out the other end effect. Pork was also bland. Nothing special - not worth the price. And to add insult to injury - the woman who was taking orders is the banh-mi version of the Soup Nazi - she is the Sandwich Nazi.
