Great place - a lunchtime mainstay for me. Quiant shop, great service, and plenty of funny signs (ie, "Pepe Rosso is too small and intimate for phone calls. Texting is ok.") Â Pasta is amazing! Be aware there is slightly limited seating so you may be best off bringing your goodies to Washington Square Park to eat.
