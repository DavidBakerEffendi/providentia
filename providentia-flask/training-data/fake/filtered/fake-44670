The Lava, a great coffee shop by day just decided to become a BYOB by night, so I went to check it out. Food and service were great. I had the Rib Eye steak with home made chimichurri which was done exactly right and was delicious. For starters, I recommand the MAZOT, which is basicaly a selection of home made salads and pickles served with Pita bread. All in all, a great experiance, looking forward to going back and check out the other items on the menu.
