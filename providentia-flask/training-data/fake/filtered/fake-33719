Food deserves a million stars! BUT I wish they would be more expensive so the wait wouldn't be so massive! I'd rather pay more seriously. sometimes the wait is more than 2 hours wtf?? Anyways the way they season their fajita beef is beyond amazing. I always get the beef and shrimp fajitas they are insane!
