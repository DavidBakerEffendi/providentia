Overall, I enjoyed this place.  A simple, straightforward approach to brunch.  Great service (food came quickly, very friendly staff) and not overly crowded (I arrived on Saturday at noon, seated within 10 minutes).  Plus it has the comfy feel of a "neighborhoody" place, unlike Marathon or Morning Glory. Food-wise, I can recommend the eggs benedict and sweet potato fries, but didn't enjoy the creme brulee french toast or bacon scramble.   Would surely go back, especially since it is conveniently located in my neighborhood!
