Spinach Artichoke dip is one of my Wife and I's favorite anywhere we go. This was one of the best we've tasted! The rest of the food was pretty good as well! Service was a little slow, but we enjoyed our experience. Chili's or Applebee's are our usual dining out joints, but this was nice for a change.
