Admittedly we tried Ninja for the first time on Valentines day 2014. When we arrived parking was not adequate with people double parked everywhere. When we arrived inside although we had reservations our table was not ready and had to wait about 30 mins to be seated. Once we were seated and placed our orders the appetizers (Miso Soup, Seaweed Salad Â and Gyoza) came out slowly over the course of an hour. Then the real test, after waiting a hour our Sashimi Deluxe platter, along with a Dancing Ell Roll and an American Dream Roll. The Sashimi Deluxe was very small with the fish was still frozen in the center. The quality of the fish was acceptable but not great lacking the subtle flavors and textures that make sushi great. The rolls were good they were creative and large and used allot of dressings to cover up the sub par fish. There are better options: I am comparing this to Wasabi House on 18 and my favorite Sushi-O on route 1. They both offered far better service even on valentines day and exceptional grade sushi.
