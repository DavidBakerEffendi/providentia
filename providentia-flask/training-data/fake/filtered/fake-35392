Oh the well missed Halal cart! This is one Halal cart I'd have to say it' has reputation! My friends and I enjoy late night snacks or 'dine outs'. At every chance we have to grab a bite, I'd say at least 5 out of 6 times we mention this cart. If you can imagine grabbing a bite in your parked car in middle on NYC or even eating right on the street, this is a must try for all who are craving for some awesome Halal meal!! Must try!!!
