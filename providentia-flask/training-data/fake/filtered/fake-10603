OK! START THE PRESS!!!  I have officially found my Favorite Restaurant in New Haven! So, I walked into this restaurant and order one of my all-time favorites.  Fried Catfish, Black Eyed Peas and Rice and and Collard Greens! Haven't had it in a long time and the first bite brought back sure memories.  The restaurant had sweet smells of sweet potato pie streaming through the air and the owners were the sweetest things walking. Offering me samples with smiles! I called back after I finished my meal to tell them how pleased I was and will return in the near future. (Which ended up being the next day, lol) Anyhow, A must visit!
