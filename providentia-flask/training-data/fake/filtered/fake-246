This was a little expensive but well worth it. Â I told my Mexican/American friend that I would pay for all her drinks and dinner that night if she would just order her Geno's sandwich in Spanish. I'm lame and only speak English. She almost didn't do it but trust me it was hilarious. These guys are so racist it shouldn't be that funny, but it was. At first they just looked at each other and acting like they didn't hear her so she repeated herself. After that came the yelling and get off the sidewalk. Yeah we couldn't even be on the sidewalk in front of their store. Yo I don't know if you think this is your kind of entertainment but if you are in Philly and want to experience true modern day racism don't use English while ordering at Geno's oh and call them french fries they just love that too. Peace!
