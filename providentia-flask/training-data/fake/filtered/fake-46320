Was not ramen fan, but am one now. I was never a big ramen fan, but came here because my friend suggested ramen on a cool rainy night.  She and I really enjoyed it here.  The food was simply delicious.  The Pork Buns were moist and full of flavor.  The ramen noodles were nice and tender, and don't get me started on the flavor.  And to my surprise, after an hour and fifteen minutes wait, the service was quite on point. This place is worth the wait. Will definitely return.
