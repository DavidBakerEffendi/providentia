I've never witnessed anything quite like this but tonight me and two of my girlfriends were looking to bar hop and found ourselves here at Ear Inn where some random old guy offered to buy first round. When carded by the bartender we all pulled out our NJ, NY, and FL state issued IDs. With our ages ranging from 25 to 27 we expected all to be well - however two of us were very rudely turned away. When asked what the problem was the tender said my ID was fine but pointed to my two friends saying their ID's were obviously fake, threatening to call the police. When we said "please do" he said "just leave, we don't want them here." Me being the only white person - "them" very clearly referred to my two black companions. Please do not patronize this place. No one should be treated this way.
