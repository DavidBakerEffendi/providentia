I was very excited about eating at their new restaurant in Montpelier as I really enjoy Asian food.  However, this was the worst meal of my life!  There were 8 of us.  2 of us had the Korean Rib Eye and one had the Beef Teriyaki.  All tree entrees had to be returned....the meat was sooooo tough you could hardly chew it.  The Chicken Satay was barely edible.  The Coconut Shrimp didn't look fresh....more like something you would buy in a package at Costco. My friends Beef Negi was burned.  The dipping sauces were pretty horrible too.  Some of the folks liked the Lobster Maki and the Dragon Maki.  We won't be going back...ever.   Try the Koto's Hibachi in Burlington ...you won't be disappointed. Misty Mountain Food Critic...over and out.
