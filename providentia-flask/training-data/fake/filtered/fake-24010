My how things have changed! I used to go out to eat here frequently under the old ownership, when they bought all local fresh foods and made their own home-made pancakes.  I tried it twice this year.  The first time, it was so gross I thought I must just be feeling sick.  The second time I went back optimistic and hungry, but the food was horrible. Beware of the eggs, both times they were despicable. The pancakes are definitely made from a box now, and taste like cardboard. Not to mention the hair found in my food. The coffee mugs had smudge in them from not being washed properly.  Hopefully they fix things, but I won't be going back, ever.
