The Shalimaar is popular on Oak Tree road with many restaurants, this place is the newest one and biggest one. This place brings something new too! It's the first one to make the food when you order. This guarantees the food is freshly prepared and not heated from frozen. That is a rarity in Indian/Pakistani restaurants. Their BBQ items specially kababs are great. You got to try the Chicken Cheese kabab you won't be disappointed. I love food and I don't usually dine out to Indian restaurants due to the fact that most of them serve same stale curry. This place has become my family's first choice. And rightly so. Keep up the quality.
