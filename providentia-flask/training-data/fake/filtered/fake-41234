I was really pleased to have chosen Totto Ramen as a diner option while on vacation in NY, the ramen was delicious, the pork was very moist and rich in taste and the brooth was great, I had the regular while my husband had the Miso, both was great, the line wasnt so bad, we waited around 25 minutes, but this is a normal waiting line in restaurant, the space is small and very cozy. I tried Ippudo also but I liked Totto better!
