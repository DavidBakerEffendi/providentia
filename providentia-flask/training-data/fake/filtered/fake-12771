Look at an old black and white photo from a 1920s restaurant and then jump inside it and you'll find yourself in Moto. A live Jazz trio crammed in the corner adds to the ambiance. The food is tastefully done and portions are a little on the small side begging for desert to be added to the list. Overall a great experience. I love going to this place.
