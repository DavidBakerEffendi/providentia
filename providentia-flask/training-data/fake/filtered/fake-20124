It's gone downhill since the owners split up.  Michael is doing a great job of running it, but the food quality and ambience just isn't the same!  The waffles are soggy now and prices for things like "toasts" have gone up.  I'm glad that the menu standards are still there, but I think this business needs some invigorating.
