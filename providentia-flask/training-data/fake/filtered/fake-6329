This place is truly unique in every way. From the music to the people to the decor...it is one of a kind! Besides getting the opportunity to hang out in Philly ' s oldest tavern...the prices are what makes it a repeat for us. There is nowhere in Philly that you can get out the door with most of your money left! The food was quite good and the beer selection, mostly local, is fantastic. This is a fun place...so if you're not in the mood then maybe come back another time!
