I'm not sure what went wrong with some of the other people reviewing this place, but I love it. Granted, I'm a life-long Vermonter and haven't had a ton of experience with Mexican food, but Mexicali does it for me. I pretty much always get the Flauta's (?) I pretty much always eat too much and walk out feeling like a fat pig. I only do that because it tastes so good. They have the best salsa fresca I've eaten. Servers are great, food is even better.
