We went for the weekday buffet but upon paying, we found out that the restaurant is now charging the adult price for children of all ages. Only babies and toddlers charged at children price. We all know how much babies and toddlers eat, and to charge any money at all is a RIPOFF. This restaurant is scamming families with children with maximum possible pricing for all guests. Even 5 year olds are being charged the adult rate. If you value your money, DO NOT SUPPORT THIS GREEDY RESTAURANT.
