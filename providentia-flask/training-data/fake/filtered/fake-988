Best dim sum in the city! Loved the pork soup dumplings and the chicken dumplings were delicious as well!  Would return again to try more from the menu.  The restaurant is very large (quite bigger than I had expected) and was packed for the time of day we went.  The prices were affordable and the waitstaff was attentive.
