Hands down the best restaurant in TriBeCa. The food is mouth watering and the staff is on point. I had my best friends 30th birthday party there and it was a hit. Stephen our event planner did an amazing job. Everyone at the party always had a drink in their hand and food on the table. The waitstaff were amazing and very polite. It was the best party because of the restaurant and their staff. Highly recommend this place for a party or just a nigh out.
