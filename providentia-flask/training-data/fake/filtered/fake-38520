Excellent service and food. The chef creates some really amazing flavor combinations. The kitchen is open. The dishes are really well prepared and take skill to make. I had a duck breast and musroom risotto. Both were sublime. They also have a good wine list. The staff is helpful with both the food and the wine. I'll definitely go again.
