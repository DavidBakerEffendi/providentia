Disappointing for dinner. My husband had the salmon which was dry. Waitress said if he didn't like it that way, he could ask for it medium or rare next time. My opinion, for twenty bucks, it should not come out dry. I had the pasta putenesca and it was just bleh. Lacking in flavors. For eighteen dollars, I expected a lot more. Neither dish came with salad. Our meal came to $60 for two salads and two entrees plus iced tea. Way overpriced for what we got.
