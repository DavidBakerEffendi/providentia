First, a disclaimer: It was the cook's first day. Now that we have established that, allow me to continue. We arrived just as they were opening, and there was already a group of approximately 15 people waiting to get in. The dining area is perhaps the smallest I have ever seen, and we ate our food standing, huddled in a corner. As for the food itself- My cheese burger was terribly under-cooked. As I said, it was the cook's first day. Aside from the raw meat, there was really nothing special about the burger itself. It was served on plain white bread, with onion and tomato. As you will find from other posts, there was no ketchup, no lettuce, no mustard. I am glad I got to experience eating in a historical place, but the food was sub-par. I will not be returning
