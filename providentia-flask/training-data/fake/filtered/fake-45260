We were there just yesterday. A recommendation from the hotel concierge staff. We are vegetarians. Had the bruschetta as an appetizers. Awesome. Even my 6 year old son loved it. We then had the pesto pasta and the risotto. The Risotto tasted very good but was very buttery. The pesto was awesome. The concierge staff had specifically recommended pesto and it was awesome. Great restaurant. Great food.
