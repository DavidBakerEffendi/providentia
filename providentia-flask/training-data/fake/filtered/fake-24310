Found a wonderful lunch spot today. A group of us ordered the lunch specials for $8 each which included pad thai, a soup, and a wonton snack. Everything was well made and tasted great... only minor quibble was the soda, which i thought was a bit high at $3 a pop... but notheless it was a nice experience for a group. The decor was interesting and the open kitchen is a nice touch. Definitely will go back when craving thai food.
