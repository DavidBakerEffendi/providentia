Unsanitary and awful food. We ate there this evening.  I ordered a burger medium rare, and my wife had a grilled chicken dinner.  Her dinner was just ok, looked lifeless but passable. My burger was visibly burnt, well done and the bun was really charred.  Nothing like what I ordered. When I went into the mens room one of the employees left the stall and headed right out to the food area without washing his hands.  My wife saw a bug in the lady's room.   To top it off, we wanted to get out of there, and she had a dessert with her meal, so she opted to take home a container of rice pudding.  When we got home she found a large piece of what looked like an old carrot in the pudding. Eat there at your own risk.
