A few months ago, I ordered from here for the first time, for pickup. I ordered the eggplant parm for myself and the ravioli, spinach & sausage for my father. Â Overall, the eggplant parmigiana was an excellent meal. I should know; I've tried this dish in a number of Bayonne pizzerias and diners. The eggplant was good (not oily as it can sometimes be). The tomato sauce that came with the eggplant parm was very fresh and delicious. The vegetables were excellent too - cooked until soft but not mushy. My father raved about his dinner and told me that we need to order from here on a regular basis. We have ordered from Goodfella's since, and everything we've tried so far has been great. It isn't the cheapest place out there, but it is one of the best! Looking forward to my next meal there.. this time I think I'll ask for delivery.
