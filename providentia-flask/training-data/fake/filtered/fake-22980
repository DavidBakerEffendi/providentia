I was introduced to Verlaine by a good friend of mine. The days and hours are a BOMB! The price is even better! Happy hour ends at 10pm on weekdays and the $5 Lychee Martini is probably one of the better deals you'll find in the city. Also, the place doesn't close until 4am on Thurs - Sat which is great if you had a horrible week! The food is alright, nothing fantastic, nothing horrible. It's food that goes well with your drinks. No complaints there. I highly recommend this place.
