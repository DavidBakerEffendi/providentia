I am writing in follow-up to my prior review of 7/20/13. Since that date, I received a concerned call from the proprietor/manager who seemed legitimately concerned about the subject matter of my dissatisfaction. He explained that he was cooking in the back while everything had transpired and, unfortunately, he was not apprised of my complaint until he saw it on Yelp. From the outset, I was pleased that he reached out. While I do not back down from my prior review, and my experience should have never happened, I will credit him with making efforts to salvage the customer relationship. In fact, I WILL now return because he simply did the right thing. I don't expect every restaurant experience to be perfect, but when its not, all I ask is for some acknowledgment. Once again, food is good, and I will give it another shot. For that reason, I have added another star to my prior review.
