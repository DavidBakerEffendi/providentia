I just ate here a week ago.. My friend and I were supposed to go to Yaffa's Cafe (which I've never been to) but then my friend got confused and we ended up at Orlins. It is a very cute place, with pretty outdoor-dining and good, fast service. My friend was complaining about her allergies, and we ended up meeting this lovely Kiwi lady who turned out to specialize remedies and gave my friend a cure for her allergies, so the crowd is not too bad either. I ordered the falafel sandwich and I was very disappointed that I shelled out $11 for that- it tasted like it had been marinated in fresh grass, which is not really my taste. They give you an option of fries or a house salad, so I chose the salad and the dressing was pretty good. However, the Kiwi lady was sitting next to me and got what looked like a lovely steak, which also smelled good, so I will definitely be heading back to try that! Overall, it was a very good place, but needless to say, do not order the falafel (I know what good falafel tastes like- half of my family is Mediterranean). You're much better off going down the street to Mamoun's and paying for their much cheaper and tastier, authentic falafel sandwhich.
