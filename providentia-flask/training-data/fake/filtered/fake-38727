I would have given them 2 stars since my husband and I like their brunch but after attending a recent holiday lunch I don't think we'll be back.  Two of my colleagues had the open faced brisket sandwich....fatty.  Two other colleagues had the mushroom pasta.....the mushrooms were griddy and the sauce was watery - one didn't even finish his meal.  Two other colleagues had the chicken with salad/string fries, they thought it was ok but the chicken was the size of a grown man's foot!  We didn't stay for dessert....and I always want dessert.  Sorry.
