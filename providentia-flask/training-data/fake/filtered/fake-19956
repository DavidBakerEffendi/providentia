In love with this place! I was in Philadelphia vacationing and heard good things about it. I started my meal off with a mojito and my husband had a margarita - both were outstanding! Great flavor, not weak drinks. We're both gluten free, and they had a ton of items for us to choose from. Their salsa and chips were delicous (2 types of salsa, a hot and a mild). For our main course I ordered the Molcajete de Pollo (grilled chicken in a lava bowl with peppers and amazing seasoning, fall apart good, with tortillas, beans and rice) and my husband got the Molcajete de Carne (basically the same thing but with beef instead) and we were both blown away by the flavor, and the freshness. It was so fresh-tasting! Very highly recommend it!
