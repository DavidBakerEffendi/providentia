Honestly, my girlfriend and I were leaning more towards chipotle but we wanted to try something new. We go in there and already the service was terrible. We were seated and the person had a lot of attitude. The food took a long time. We ordered one roll and a soup and it took over 30 minutes. The waiter gave us a look and sigh when asking for things. I expected better for such a popular restaurant.
