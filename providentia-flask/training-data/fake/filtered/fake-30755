Been there twice and very happy both times. One big plus is you can actually have a conversation as the noise level remains muted. Food is new American as advertised, the menu probably not for those seeking fusion cuisine. Otherwise great menu choices. Had the blue point oysters which did disappoint a bit, too cold and no briney taste but the add-on dressing was good enough to offset. Being allergic to tree nuts was a somewhat show stopper on the bread basket as they could not confirm whether there was or was not any in the bread. They emphasized not made in the kitchen, but really should be able to handle food allergy completely. We had a party of 6 each with different food, one being a real foodie, and everyone was complemetary. Roof deck is a great for a pre dinner drink but clearly is intended for the 25-39 demographic as the evening wears on.
