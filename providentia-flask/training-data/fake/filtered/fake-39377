Tiny little place---more of a dining 'cove' in South Williamsburg right near the bridge on Broadway. So small and quaint, tables close together, packed room, totally European vibe, French inspired menu (think pots of mussels and red wine and creme brulee) and even a waify blonde with a high soprano voice singing in French and playing an accordion.  I had this yummy fondue and a glass of pinot noir... heaven!  Totally romantical. Perfect for a date night or a small group of people. May have to wait a bit since it seems like its always packed but the hostess was laid back and genuinely friendly-- very refreshing, non-pretentious atmosphere. Usually 2-3 specials per night. Glanced around at others dishes, all seemed yummy! Eclectic menu, good wine list, very reasonably priced! Do not wait for a special occasion to check this place out. Do not even wait till you are crazy hungry! Even better, take that special someone and make your way over for a light meal or dessert- wine or cappuccino.  Probably the best place I've found- for price, service, atmosphere, vibe--- in all of Williamsburg. Definitely will be back. Cheers!
