OH MY GOODNESS. This place is so adorable and accommodating. My husband and I come here every weekend. We just die for the atmosphere and friendly staff. I wish it was open earlier during the week so my little one and I could get lunch there more often. Try the french toast, you will NOT be sorry. It's the best french toast in the entire world, don't tell my Belgian grandmother.
