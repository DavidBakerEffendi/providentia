The experience sums up to TEN on all fronts. One thing I really loved about this place was the precision and details. From the chopped sticks propped up on a stone to the cylinder shadow emanating from the table candle to the unique dishes/clay pots. We chose to partake in the tasting menu simply yet succinctly presented in a diverse succulent 6 course serve out. The first was cold veggies w/ an insanely tasty anchovie cream fondue. Immediately (and I mean not an unpleasant wait at all between courses) after was a delicious sea urchin croquette, delish! Afterwards was the beef sashimi w/ wasabi and a delectable garlic assortment. Then the prize of the night, branzino served w/ oil roasted veggies (cauliflower, olives, brussel sprouts, mushrooms) all of which were salivating. The theres a choice between kobe beer burger or a caviar rice bowl. I tasted both and they do not disappoint. Last a wonderful palate cleanser via sour custard. The service is great and they chat with you as well and brandish a positive vibe, which is a crucial yet subtle underlying necessity for a positive dining experience. Finding a way into the place, getting there, enjoying the ambiance, devouring the wonderfully prepared food...the whole experience really makes you feel privy to another world of dining out in NYC. Will be back very soon, I hope!
