The food was overpriced and the servings were small.  The service was terrible, waited for our order for an hour and the place wasn't even busy.  Also they charge 40 dollars for basically a pitcher of margarita and bring out little cups to make it seem like you are getting some type of deal... it's a total rip off! basically, their business module is to make the food look all pretty and gourmet but to give you small portions and charge ridiculous prices.  I'm not saying the food was bad, but it wasn't worth the price at all.  And when we complained about the service the waiter didn't hook us up whatsoever.  Overall it was a bad experience, and I expected a lot better.  Will not be going back there.
