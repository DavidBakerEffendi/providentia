Food was great. Staff friendly but inexperienced. I thought the prices on the high side. Â Fair, but a lot to pay when you consider the location wedged between a gym and an IHOP. It's a good space and convenient location, but can't help but think the prices will be hard to maintain. Would be a good brunch spot.
