This is by far the best butcher in town.  The owner, Matthew, is as nice and genuine as they come and it percolates down through whole culture of the whole staff.  Sure you pay a little more for your cuts of meat but you get a story with it.  They post the farms the animals come from right on the chalkboard.  The food is always fresh, never frozen (don't even own a freezer).  The staff will not hesitate to give you a full run down of all the meat they have and accomodate any requests you make.  I once bought a few sausages and the owner threw in a 1/2 lb of fresh pork belly which kind of changed my world.  Who knew buying meat could be so fun!   In summary, Butcher Bar has the best quality meat in town and the right people running the show!
