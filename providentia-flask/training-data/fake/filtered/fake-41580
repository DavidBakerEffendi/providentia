My favorite seafood place in NYC!!! I come here whenever I get a chance. They food is always excellent and super fresh. The red, white and blue is an incredible deal. The oyters are very tasty and I love to mix the sauces up...esp the white and cocktail sauce. The lobsters when in season is also a must try. I think I just love the casual no nonsense feel of this place. Simply a notch above the rest.
