We were here for a baby shower in the covered back yard E: Very friendly and attentive wait staff.   D: Portions were generous and who doesn't love homemade pasta! E: Breaded veal was a bit oily, but the broccoli rabe and fennel dishes made up for it D: I could've eaten that fennel for days! E: But didn't you have a rumbly stomach afterwards? D: Yeah, but that was from the awesome EXTREMELY strong coffee they served. E: Oh...that's, right, that's how you get.   D: Until next eats!
