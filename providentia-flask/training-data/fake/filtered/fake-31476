I love this place. I go here all the time. The staff is so friendly and the food is so fresh and delicious. I usually get the bi bim bop. I love the brown rice all veggies and either chicken or tofu with teriyaki and hot sauce. Beware the spicy chicken is really spicy. If you are eating in, the stone bowl is the way to go. We also love the chicken wings for the kids and have never been disappointed.
