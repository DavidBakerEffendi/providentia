I am originally from Bayonne, and every time I visit, I have to make a stop at San Vito's. San Vito's is the best Italian food you will ever have anywhere, from the chicken parmigiana to the fettuccine alfredo, you can never go wrong ordering from their menu. Portions are very generous for the price!
