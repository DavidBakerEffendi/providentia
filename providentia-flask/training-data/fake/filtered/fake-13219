I had brunch here last Saturday and will tell you the following. I had the avocado omelette and it was runny , the avocado in the center was mashed and mushy and cold. The bacon was also cold and overall tasteless and gross. The homefries were raw and not cooked. My boyfriend ordered the tomato, cheese and spinach omelette and his was also runny and cold. The service was adequate but she seemed very stressed out and was complaining about the owner over and over again to her co worker. I mean do we really need to hear this?? For a place as busy as this gets I am convinced that people do not know or understand what good food is, that is why they come here. Go to a diner...the food is much better and there is a bigger selection for brunch. Dont waste your time waiting in line to eat garbage. Oh and the manager or owner...tall woman...not friendly at all almost with air that she is better than everyone. Please.....learn to be grateful and learn to look happy. A shame..
