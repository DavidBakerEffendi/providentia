Went here with my wife and daughter.  What a nice experience we had.  My daughter and I started out with the Rude Little Pig.  To eat we had the pork belly, sautéed broccoli rabe, and seared scallops.  With this we drank a bottle of viura/verdejo.  To top it off we had the bacon donuts.   The food was good, tasty and well presented.  The wine accompanied the food well.  And the nicest surprise is we spent less than $100 for 3 people.  Definitely a place to go to again.
