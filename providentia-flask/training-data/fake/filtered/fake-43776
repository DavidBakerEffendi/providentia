Alta has tasty little bites, but it's not always worth the wait. Unless you call ahead you will be waiting for ages at the bar for a table. You can eat at the bar, but I don't recommend it because the bar gets crowded and it's not a pleasant dining experience. If you are lucky enough to get a table, you will have a lovely, memorable meal. The bacon wrapped dates and the Brussels sprouts are my favorite dishes. Followed closely by the honey fried goat cheese and the coca. I would not recommend the avocado relleno. The desserts are delicious. Overall I would say Alta is consistently yummy and the ambience is very nice and romantic. Great place for a date!
