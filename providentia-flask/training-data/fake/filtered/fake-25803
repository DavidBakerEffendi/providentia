Delicious food, great price.  We loved the cozy atmosphere.  Server was delightful and told us we had ordered too much!   Thanks heavens she did because she was right.  The kids will love eating with their fingers.  Grab your friends and bring a bottle of wine and enjoy a delicious (and economical!) night out.
