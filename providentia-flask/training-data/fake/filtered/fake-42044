This is without question one of THE BEST Chinese BBQ joints in Chinatown. It is NOT fancy, romantic, or chic. BUT what you will get in this small crowded gem is some of the best Chinese BBQ around. Try the duck roast pork, and soy sauce chicken they rock! The noodle dishes are excellent, and the baby bok choy is the bomb! One of my daughter's all time favorite restaurants. Whenever we celebrate any special occasion she will always say with a big smile, "I see Noodle Town in  our near future!"  Great place great food at a great price says it all!
