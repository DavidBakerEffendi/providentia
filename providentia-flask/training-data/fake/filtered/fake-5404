I would give this place 2 stars if they served me frozen pizza bagels just based on how friendly the owner is!  My favorite item by far is the balsamic chicken.  I'm not a huge fan of brick oven pizza, but it is flavorful and well done. The down side - people know about this place, and it can get crowded and tight.  Fortunately, Nutley's a great town with nice people, so it usually isn't a problem!
