The Pickled Heron is a brave idea done with extreme care and personal effort.  The food is heavenly -- whether it's the on premise baked bread and salted, churned butter or the lamb with imaginative fried pave and greens or the Meyers lemon upside down cake -- each flavor joins to create a clean, clear and powerful set of tastes.  If you don't like extremely well prepared dishes with complexity, don't come here -- you'll be overwhelmed!  And the place is beautifully yet simply appointed with pumpkin walls, an intriguing black ceiling and beautiful hand laid tile in the entry and bath.  When you reach for the cast heron door handle at the front door, you know you're entering someplace special.  Bring your own and pay by cash.
