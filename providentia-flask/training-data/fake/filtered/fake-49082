I dined here with a friend recently and am very impressed.  I am a big fan of raw fish and had a hard time deciding what to order.  I went with the fluke, himachi, and salmon.  The razor clams were awesome...as well as the grilled mushrooms!  Once I tasted the mushrooms..I did not want to share anymore.  There was not a morsel left. We ordered one of the "toasts" as an appetizer. i didn't know what to expect from a cauliflower toast..but it was really, really good. The cocktails are unique and strong...and there are many to choose from.  I went with the Agave Orchard (a tequila cocktail. strong!).  Atmosphere is cozy and I enjoyed the background music.  I will definitely go back again soon.
