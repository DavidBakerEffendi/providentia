My daughter raved about Cuban Pete's and decided to take me there as a post Mother's Day treat.  The chicken lollipops she was raving about came out cold, the server got her order wrong, they ran out of the Sangria mix that she raved about, and they ran out of plantains and substituted them with yucca instead of telling us they just served us what they had.  I ordered my steak to come out medium rare, it came out well done, I was going to eat it if they would have least gave me some sauce for it, the server than said they couldn't give me extra sauce, so as I flipped it over to cut it so that my daughter could taste it, they're was a long strand of hair underneath..I was done by then, pissed, and the server asked should I get the manager?...like what?  I've been a kitchen manager over ten years and my daughter is a server, and this would not have happened on our watch, obviously the staff is not properly trained.  For a Tuesday night, they were crowded and probably in over their heads.  The manager came, took the plate and said, "make sure he doesn't charge you for this"....REALLY....had it been myself, I would have properly had a fresh meal prepared, served it myself, and took it off the bill, but that's just me, my customers are number one at all times...we did end up getting the traditional sangria which I liked, my son had beef stew which he seemed to like, I loved the atmosphere, and the noise didn't bother me, I enjoy upbeat restaurants especially when I dine with kids, so for this reason, I will try it again.
