Kansai? More like RUDE_AI! Â I ordered the Chicken Udon Soup....first of all-it smelled like sweat socks and was the size of an elephants head. I did not touch the soup. The smell of it alone was enough for me to say no thank you. I kindly explained to the waitress that I did not care for this. Instead of asking me if I wanted something else, she offered me a to go carrier. No thank you-I would like this to be removed from my check. We cannot remove this from your check since you ordered. Once you ordered there is "nothing we can do". Really? Good to know. She ever so kindly asked the manager who took 3 dollars off. I would've rather had ran around the block 7 times and did 5 jumping jacks and ate a 10 year old bag of doritos than this soup. I paid 15 bucks for edamame and a soda.
