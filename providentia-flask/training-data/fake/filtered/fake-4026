Can I give minus 3 stars? Went there with a friend. I had fish and chips you supposedly can't go wrong with. They could. Tasted like nothing. My friend had the lobster roll, also terrible. The service was very friendly albeit slow, but good service can't make up for crappy food. The icing on the cake was the pricing. Dramatically over priced. Neeeeeeeevurrr go back there.
