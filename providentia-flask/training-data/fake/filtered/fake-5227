What started out as a humble mom-and-pop Italian deli has evolved into a first-rate restaurant where pride of family shows the moment you walk through the door. Everything about this place speaks to excellence, starting with impeccable cleanliness and beautifully displayed homemade Italian classics in the deli from broccoli rabe to eggplant parm that tempt the eye and deliver a home-run on the taste. The restaurant 's cozy and delightful environment blends Old World charm with contemporary flair. The staff is unfailingly pleasant, the service excellent and the food superior. The menu is dazzling with incredible variety that makes it hard to choose. Portions are very generous (is it possible to have too much of a good thing?) so bring your appetite... and also your favorite alcoholic beverage as it's BYOB. Don't leave without trying one of their incredible desserts - even if you do takeout because you don't have room to eat another mouthful. The Italian cheesecake is a thing of beauty, thick and creamy. The cannoli are made fresh with a generous amount of filling that's got just the right amount of sweetness. And the variety of biscotti is impressive (don't miss the almond-pistachio!) with the perfect size and texture that stands up to dunking in a hot cup of coffee. I'm a Montclair High grad (Class of '73) who moved out of town many years ago. But every time we pass through, we always stop at this wonderful family-owned and operated business for a taste of authentic Italian cuisine. Montclair has an abundance of restaurants. This one is worth a return visit every time.
