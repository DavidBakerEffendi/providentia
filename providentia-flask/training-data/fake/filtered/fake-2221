Personally, I've had better pancakes, I've had better service, I've had better. Just an FYI: the 2 tablespoons of maple butter syrup you get? NOT ENOUGH. Ask for more and they'll gladly give you 2 more tablespoons, but won't tell you they are charging you $2 for every extra request. And for the price/wait ratio? I'll go back to Balthazar, with better everything. Sorry to say, as a resident of the nabe, this one is only for the tourists...
