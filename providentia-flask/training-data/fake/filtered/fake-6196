Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful. About as close as you can get to a genuine Neapolitcan trattoria and pizzeria without spring for the airfare. Very authentic, especially the pizza. Among the best pizza I have had outside or Naples or Caserta Â and I have ranged all over North Jersey, Brooklyn, Manhattan and Bronx. the pizza here is excellent. If you like Anthony's coal fired pizza - that is, American style pizza - then you might not like this. If you like true Neapolitan pizza, you will love this, The cuisine is outstanding throughout and the pastries come from the equally wonderful pastry shop next door. The Nutella pizza for dessert is a rare and guilty pleasure. So simple yet so marvelous. They use authentic Italian Nutella (which is different from American Nutella, believe it or not). The service is warm, casual and very Italian. The host, Pasquale, is a wonder and makes everyone feel welcome. The decor is very casual but again, very Italian. Needless to say it is very busy so if you want a long leisurely meal, go early (by 6) or late (after 9), especially on Saturday. I think but am not sure reservations are required on weekends. As I have written in reviews of other outstanding Italian restaurants, f you like the Olive Garden, then you probably won't appreciate Queen Margherita. But if you enjoy authentic Campanian cooking then you will enjoy this. I have been to Italy many times, including the Campania region, and you cannot do better than this place here in the NY area.
