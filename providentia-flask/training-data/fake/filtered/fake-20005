I took my fiance here and we had an amazing experience. I got the edamame dumplings for apetizer, and she had the tuna pizza. one word: AMAZING. those two dishes were one of the best things I've ever gotten. For entrees, she had the sea bass, and I had tea smoked spare ribs. the sea bas was a bit too salty, but the spare ribs were a bit too rich, but when I ordered a side of rice with them then it all balanced out and tasted phenomenal. For dessert, get the Dip Sum donuts. They're DELICIOUS.
