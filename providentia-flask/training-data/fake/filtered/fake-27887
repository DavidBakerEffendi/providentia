this place is pure sex but i might be biased because this was the first date my fiancee and i had. after we met at a loud bar in williamsburg, we met in my hood for our first date almost two years ago and i suggested lucali because my friends raved about the food. i pretty much fell in love with the pizza and over the pizza. bottom line, i've been back probably 12million times and never had a problem waiting. let's grow up people, if you want the amazingness that is lucali, shut up and wait.
