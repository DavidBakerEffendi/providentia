We found this place thanks to YELP. It had 40+ reviews and a score of 5. That was attention enough to give it a try. The place is small, but you won't feel yourself in a box, you have your room to eat. We arrived one saturday at 15pm and it was complete so we waited a few minutes and had a seat on the bar. The owner was very kind and gentle and explained to us the menus (we're from Spain and we were a bit lost about what to eat). My GF and I had an excellent service and food. The owner took care of us perfectly. Sadly there was no cake avaiable at that moment but that makes a good excuse to come back again! 10/10 will repeat and taste the chicken wings!
