The food is ok.  Some were not hot enough when servered.  One of the waitresses was very rude.  She asked how many bowls of rice we wanted to order.  I was asking how big the bowl is so I could decide how many to order.  She ironically said many things to tease me "Don't you use bowl at home?"  I yelled her back so she realized she wasn't supposed to have the bad manner.  I did not accept her apology because it was sincere at all.  She said "I'm sorry.  Sorry! OK?"  If you expect to see a restaurant service like this, you may go ahead.  I'll never go back there again and I shared this terrible service with my friends near Parsippany.
