A friend and I stopped in for a glass of wine on the way home and walked out with an $80 bar bill. I asked for a recommendation and the bartender served us a glass costing $17. After tending bar for six years, I learned you NEVER serve the most expensive glass on the menu from the reserve list when a patron asks for a recommendation. I will NEVER return after being treated so poorly. I leave this place to those with expense accounts who want to seem trendy by dining in the East Village. I'll stick to Brooklyn.
