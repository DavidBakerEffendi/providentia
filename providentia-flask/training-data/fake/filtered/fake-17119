This past weekend my parents and 4 siblings were visiting me from out of state. I knew I had to show the best of Manhattan. I have been to Benjamin's plenty of times and wanted to try something a bit new myself. The ambiance was fabulous to say the least. The food absolutely impeccable, and as my parent are self proclaimed wine connoisseurs they were very impressed by the wide range of selection that The Sea Fire Grill had to offer, especially from Argentina. The staff was also incredibly welcoming, as what we thought would be a quick hour and half dinner turned into three hours of incredible food, wine, and great laughs. I am MORE than happy with my choice of The Sea Fire Grill, and would recommend to anyone looking for that special gem in Manhattan. They will not disappoint.
