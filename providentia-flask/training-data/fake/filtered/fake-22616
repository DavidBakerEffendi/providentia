I hate Hamilton Township/Lawrenceville because the local idiots who always say delarenzo's is the best pizza. They don't know what they are talking about! Red Moon, hands down, is the best place in the area.  Everything is quality. I moved away from the area and I come back to just get their pizza!  I always use these guys for catering parties/social events/businees luncheons. I asked them to make Italian food that wasn't even on their MENU for my parties, they run out, get the stuff, and make it! They are absolutely the best! Pizza is excellent is the best in the area. The people are friendly, it's a small family business that cares about their customers. For many years, I think  this place kept that shopping mall in business!
