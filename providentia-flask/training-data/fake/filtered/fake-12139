We stopped at this place on a whim on a Saturday afternoon. It was full and we had to wait, which we expected and was fine. The hostess asked "Do you want to put your name?" "In what?" my companion asked. It was ten minute or so. After sitting down at the table where the hosted just pointed to, we were given our water and menus, after a short time our order was taken and then we waited......... and waited..... and waited......When our meal finally arrived it looked fine. My friend's The Hamilton sandwich looked good until we noticed the American sliced cheese (ew) was not even melted. He said it was fine anyway. I had ordered a cheese quesadilla with roasted veggies. The vegetables were not roasted at all, they seemed to have been microwaved as was the shell, it was mushy and chewy. We were going to say something to the host but she didn't seem to care and off we went never to return. I am afraid they are riding on their cool Surfer Dude Atmosphere. The food just wasn't worth it.
