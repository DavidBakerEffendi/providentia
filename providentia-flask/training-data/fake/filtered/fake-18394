Awesome food!!! Starting with the appetizers, thru the desserts, everything tastes so good. They serve the best  mango lassie ever, nattu kozhi curry(s.indian chicken curry) tasted just like home made...mouth watering yummy!  Meen pollichathu(Baked fish made in wrapped banana leaf marinated in Indian spices) was also good. Try the  Gulab Jamun(dessert)  for your sweet tooth!  A good combination of south and north Indian food if you crave Indian food.
