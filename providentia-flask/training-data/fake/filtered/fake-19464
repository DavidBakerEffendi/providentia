Went to order Prahok kateeh. Very disappointed. Where's was the Prahok. It was so sweet. Nothing Cambodian about that. Tasted like sugar with mince pork. I was excited with the yelp review and that it was close to home. But next time I get a craving I'm calling my mother up. Zero stars if I didn't have to put a star up for the reviews.
