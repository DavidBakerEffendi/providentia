I visited Sally's Apizza last week and got the worse service I have ever gotten in any resturant and I've been to alot believe me.  We waited line for at least and hour or so then we were seated and were told by this rude person he would be  back in a minuted or so.  We waited for about 25 minutes as we were talking to a cousin who is in from Florida, that was the reason we went there in the first place.  We finally put a time on this waiter because he hadn't eaten all day so we waited another 20 minutes and still this man never came back, finally the cousin that we were with went up to the counter and asked if he could please take our drink order he said, in a minute, we decided to wait another 15 minutes, we did, he finally came over and told us he will be right back, at that point we said , no take our drink order and if he could tell us how long it would take for the pizza he said, another 40 minutes to an hour at that point we decided to leave and he has the audacity t o  said, WHAT EVER FLOATS YOUR BOAT, what kind of a person is that.    Rude, arrogant and nasty.  By the way there were at least 4 empty booths and people waiting out side theyv'e got to be stupid to wait for that kind of service.  I will never partronize that Pizza Parlor again and I will make sure my friends don't either.  Oh by the way I am not the first person who has said this, someone on Facebook already wrote about the ser vice.  Sally's hope you survive with that kind of service.
