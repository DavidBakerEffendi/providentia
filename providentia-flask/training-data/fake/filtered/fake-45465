A few weeks ago, my wife and I went to Terre a Terre for Brunch on a Sunday. I wasn't excited about going out for Brunch, I just wanted to stay home, relax and not go out on my day off. Thank goodness my wife talk me into it, or I would have missed out on what was one of the best meal I've had in a very long time. I had the steak and eggs. I order the steak medium rare...and the NY strip was cooked PERFECTLY. It practically melted in my mouth. The dish was fantastic. But yet, there was another dish I had that was even better than the steak and eggs. And that dish was the Chesapeake Bay Crab Cakes with Alfalfa Sprouts over Slow Poached Eggs with a Jalapeno Aioli. I've had crab dishes before,,,,in Maine, Boston, Maryland, New York, New Jersey...and in other states as well. And I can honestly say that this crab dish at Terre a Terre was, hands-down, the best crab dish I've ever had. When I watch cooking shows, and the judges talk about how different textures and flavors can elevate a dish, I usually tune them out. I'm a guy with simple tastes...either a dish is good or bad. But after eating the Brunch crab cakes, I now understand how flavors and textures can merge together and make a dish incredible. The crab, egg and aioli....worked together so well, I blown away by the dish. I was so impressed with the dish, I ordered another one, only to learn that the kitchen had closed. But Chef Todd went out of his way, went back into the kitchen, and made me another Crab dish. And the second crab dish was just as good as the first. From the charm of the rustic decor, to the artistry and professionalism of Chef Todd, to the fantastic food......you add all three together....and it adds up to one of the best dining experiences I've had in years. 5 stars across the board for Terre a Terre. I would recommend this restaurant to everyone I know.
