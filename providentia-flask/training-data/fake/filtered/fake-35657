i really wanted to like this place as i read the positive reviews and several friends suggested it.  unfortunately it is awful.  i think this is a case of people desperately wanting a "cool" middle eastern place in town rather than good food and service.  the worst thing about the place is the service.  the guy at the front desk does not speak, period.  not that he doesnt speak English, he just doesnt speak!  we had to ask for everything two or three times.  the service is so slow and bad they seem to actually take pride in it!  and the food is not much better.  considering this is supposed to be healthy food, nothing tasted fresh.  the hummus was thick and pasty, the ouzi was mostly rice and over spiced, the bread was tasteless and they have nothing to drink other than some awful tea.  bottom line is that with all the great restaurants in town there's absolutely no reason to go to this place.
