Ive been here multiple times and every time I come I wonder why I came again. The wine is the Â only saving grace of this place ~ the food is ok at best and grossly under delivering for what you would expect but the worst part is the service. Every waiter and bartender is too cool for school and cant be bothered with any opinions other than their own. I thought a place that was driven by a love for food and wine would be open to a dialougue that allows place for hearing what their customers prefer. Apparently here its eithere their way or the high way. This wil definitely be my last time at any terroir locaction.
