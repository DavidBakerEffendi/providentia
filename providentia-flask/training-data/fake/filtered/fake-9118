You gotta be kidding me, this isn't what you find in Spain nor is Boqueria a tapas place, it's a restaurant, a restaurant serving mediocre dishes at high prices.  Nothing jumped out in particular and ordering as many dishes as possible, there were no dishes that I'd want to go back for.  I've been to Spain several times and was excited to hear of this new Spanish tapas place opening up, but was completely dissatisfied and disappointed.  And I really wanted Boqueria to impress me but it didn't.  No soul or personality in this high-end restaurant.
