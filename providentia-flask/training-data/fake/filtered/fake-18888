Walter Foods, a recently opened restaurant on a stretch of land in Billyburg with no offerings for gastronomic splendor.  A dead beat neighborhood joint, a pub, a bistro - call it what you'd like - its a lesson in aligning confusion and dishonesty with food and service in an uncomfortable and not-so well-dressed space. Blending the diarrhea-tones of an Irish gastropub with a menu of I dunno what classics, Walter Foods delivers for a marked Billyburg sans attitude.  A cocktail list featuring copycat drinks, boring.  At the table, dishes that fatten you up such as french dip, pigs in a blanket (not sure its seemingly en vogue on restaurant menus), fried 1/2 chicken with caper honey, and a lobster club on pumpernickel bread (something terribly wrong with this at $16) are not a must for the table as are the two  unspoken desserts.  On the nights I was there it was a painfully bad chocolate banana bread pudding and dry apple crisp.  The small box kitchen with Mr. Ernsberger at the heelm further enhances the lack of charm of the space, and I hate the forest green leather banquette.  There is a distinct impression of good riddens meets boring Billyburg.
