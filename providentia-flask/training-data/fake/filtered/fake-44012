Wow....I returned tonight because I had such a good experience here 2 months ago, and WOW things had changed!  First of all while walking through the second door I noticed way down at the bottom of the glass the restaurant rating...a "B".  Obviously, they were trying to hide it by putting it on the second entry door AND way down at the very bottom of the glass.  The last time I was here they displayed their "A" right in thr front window!  Ok....I decided to stick with them and give them the benefit of the doubt.  So I ordered my arepas along with my 3 friends who accompanied me.  When the arepas came they were just lukewarm.  When I go to a restaurant I kind of expect my food to arrive either very lukewarm or hot!  These felt like they had been sitting around.  They still tasted ok but it could have been better.  I don't know what has gone on in the past 2 months since I've been but it seems like the service has gone downhill.  I'm very disappointed, especially to see that they've received a "B" rating.  It doesn't take too much effort to keep a place clean and get an "A".  They had an "A" in the past and I hope they get their act together and get an "A" again.  Otherwise, I will not be returning :(
