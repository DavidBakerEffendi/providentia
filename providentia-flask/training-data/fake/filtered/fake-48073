I have been to The Smith 3 times and each time they have been very accomadating and friendly. This past weekend was my friends birthday and they made it very special. The staff has great customer service and followed my opentable requests to a T. The food is also delicious I highly recommend the blue cheese fondue potato chips! Also there is barely a wait for the food, and they do not hurry you out once you are done. I have only ever been for brunch but I can imagine any meal there would be wonderful! My favorite spot to eat in the East Village.
