Leone's--what a FABULOUS place!!! Last night was the first time that I had the pleasure of eating there, as I'm new to Montclair. I was first attracted to the place by the outdoor seating that they have, which I was told is brand new after the construction of a beautiful, wide walkway out front. I sat outside, which was delightful...and was immediately brought a basket of bread with olive oil...yummm. I ordered the lasagne, which was delivered prompty by my waitress, who was friendly, attentive, and just downright pleasant. The manager even came over to my table to check how I was doing! Nice people. The lasagne was DELICIOUS. I would definitely order it again. Â Overall, a great experience! I plan on going back really soon. Great people, great location, great ambiance, great food--what more could you want?
