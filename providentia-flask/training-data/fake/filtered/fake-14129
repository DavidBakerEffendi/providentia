I've been here at least 3 times including just last night!  It's a great place to go for a nice leisurely Spanish meal. The food here is very good and the prices aren't bad either.  The generous portions make for a nice lunch the next day, and the service is exceptional. You  never have to worry about being rushed out. I would highly recommend this place :)
