Went out to dinner last Thursday with my wife and found our new favorite restaurant!  I'm a very picky person when it comes to calamari and let me tell you, whatever batter they use to fry up their crispy calamari is the best I ever had.  The calamari came out perfectly crispy and had a great garlic and herb zing.  For an entrée I had the half chicken with lemon caper vinaigrette *Outstanding sauce, kind of salivating just remembering it.  Usually, I go for a quarter chicken when dining out because I'm hesitant that on larger pieces of chicken that the middle would be dry. Not this place. It was still moist even to the last bite.  Chicken came with their leeky mashed potatoes with gravy, the fried leeks on top really made this side dish full of flavor.   I finished off the night with a delicious Shock Top pumpkin beer that they had on tap at the bar in the front.  Red Stone Tavern has all around great vibe, eats and atmosphere.  We definitely will be back.
