If I were a Valley Girl, I would say, "Gag me with a spoon!"  Really, the sandwich I ordered was very poor and overpriced.  My wife and daughter did not like their pizza.  The staff was unfriendly.  I felt like they threw the dishes on our table like the slabs of garbage they impressed us as.  There was no sense that the appreciated our business, so we will not be coming back, despite the fact that we live down the street and frequently shop in the same plaza.
