I went in a few months ago and ordered the buffalo chicken on a wrap and I got it back to my office and it was on some thick bread which made it nasty.  So today hoping to give them another chance I ordered the meatball sandwich.  I asked her what bread do they have and she only gave me one option.  I got back to the office and sure enough I was told I could have gotten it on a wrap and not that disgusting thick bread again.  Last chance.  Never going back there again.  They are all brain dead there.  Also pretentious vibe there.
