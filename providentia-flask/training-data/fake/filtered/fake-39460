speedy service, awesome tacos, loads of chips, big drink menu! Stopped into loco on a recent Thursday with a friend.  The atmosphere is extremely relaxed and family friendly. The menu at loco is simple - starters, salads, quesadillas and tacos. We had some straightforward queso & salsa with chips.  No complaints about it and additional baskets of chips are free.  I order a grilled fish tacos and a shrimp taco and would order both of them again.  Typically $3 tacos at places like loco are a little wimpy, but there's were robust and delicious. My friend had a chicken taco that I was rather jealous of.
