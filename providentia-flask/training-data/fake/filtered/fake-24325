GF and I had the traditional and the chicken viet sandwiches. They were both very tasty but the juiciness of the chicken really stood out. Â The owner told me the secret of the sandwich is the bread and the pickled carrots...did not know that! A delicious take on the traditional viet sandwich and very unique combination of flavor and texture. The bread was crunchy and thin, perfect for stuffing extra meat and pickled carrots...and these ppl. did not skimp out on those. The contrast in the temperature of the meat and the veggies was interesting and refreshing. This meal made my visit to Brooklyn very enjoyable. A must try if you are in the neighborhood.
