Very impressed! For a new restaurant (which usually I avoid), I was quite impressed by the quality of the food and the service. The chef has an awesome little menu that balances trendy new ideas with at-home favorites. And the portion and pricing is very fair. The decor and atmosphere of the outdoor and indoor areas are a bit quirky but I suppose any place called Llama's Tooth would be expected to be a little odd. I'll be back again for sure!
