This was our second visit to Mambo Tea House. Our first was delightful. The Ropa Viejo was tender, succlent, delicious, as was the appetizer, the shrimp in garlic sauce. However, returning tonight, with great expectations, we enjoyed the beef in tomato sauce in Paintain cups, but were terribly disappointed in the fried Red Snapper, which was overcooked, perhaps twice cooked (it came out of the kitchen dry and brittle). Once we got inside the area below the head was charred. The waitress, whose unbridled enthusiasm and good will was not met by management's refusal to speak with us about the dish, Â took the dish back to the kitchen to show the chef. "It is not supposed to be cooked like that," she quoted the chef as saying. However, we were disappointed that no one from management cared enough to speak with us about this. In all, a VERY disapointing meal, and our sweet waitress' ministrations were little help. Paying $29 for a burnt fish will be difficult to forget. WATCH OUT...and send back what you don't like on the first tasting. You should expect no less...especially for $27. We were too kind.
