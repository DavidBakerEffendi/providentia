This place is CRAZY! But sort of in a good way. They don't take reservations, so we showed up and it was over an hour wait.... what? But you can just go into the bar upstairs and sit anywhere and get the full menu... ok? So up the stairs we went, first we got lost and ended up in the minature golf course, no, really. Anyway, we found a seat at the bar, view was better there than the so called resteraunt. We got our food. Only disappointment was the clam chower, not so great. Two friends chipped away at a dozen crabs, too much work, not my thing. I had fried basket, yummy fries and good seasoning. Had probably too much to drink, bar staff is quick.
