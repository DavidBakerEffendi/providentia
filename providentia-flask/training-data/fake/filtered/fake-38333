I have a love/hate relationship with this restaurant. Love, love, love the food. Excellent apps, salad, pizza and entrees. Seriously have enjoyed everything I tried and, if this review was simply about food, I would easily grant it four stars. However, I HATE the service and management. They make it nearly impossible for me to enjoy their delicious food! Typically when I eat in, I find myself begging and pleading for a server to get to me. It's troubling since it's rarely slammed when I head into eat. Since the restaurant hosts many large, private parties I have often been left to feel forgotten when I simply go in as a regular patron. Because of this I made the decision to try take out instead. I did this only to find that the management does not allow for take out orders over the phone. I truly thought I mis heard the woman on the other end, but NO the impossible was true. Instead you have to go in and place the order and wait while the food is prepared. It's insane. Bottom line, I would be a frequent repeat customer, but I care equally about my service experience. Because of this I won't be returning again.
