I'm writing this review an hour into my seating and they are so understaffed we didn't even get water for an hour. We had a reservation and had to wait 30 minutes to even sit, followed by an hour with no food still. Hilariously, I waited for an hour for a beer too and was told the bar was backed up. But when it came, my "draft" beer was in a bottle and warm. Apparently it takes an hour to pull a beer out of a case on the floor and walk it 30 feet. I don't fault the staff per se, they appear to be working hard. But they are so understaffed and overbooked they are doing themselves no favors. And oh, to top it off, someone at our table asked if they could add cheese to a panini and they refused citing a backed up kitchen. Seriously? Slapping a slice of cheese on? So the server had to get the manager to finally agree to add the cheese. That extra 5 minutes could have been used to, ya know, serve us?
