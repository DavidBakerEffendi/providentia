I went to this establishment one time with a close group of friends. The food was great, though it came out all on one tray (family style), creating mass confusion. The NIGHTMARE came after the eating experience. We had a group of 7, and it seemed like Bartaco's billing operation could not handle what we were asking of it. Of course we asked for separate checks. At first the check came out on one bill, when at the beginning we asked for separate checks. Then, when it was separated, the bills did not even add up correctly on the check itself. Another couple's bill had a duplicate charge on it of one of the separated bills. Mind you we are in the middle of the restaurant, finished with our food, constantly flagging down our waiter to give us the right bill, frankly embarrassing. Finally the manager came up and tried to correct the situation, but, as he explained, the billing system was "confused". In the end we thought we had it corrected and paid the bill including a 21% tip overall. But a few days later my bill was over charged by $5 after we signed the check, another friend had a duplicate charge on his card, and the other friend is too pissed off to deal with it. The start of our evening of fun turned in to a math lecture, and sucked the energy out if the whole evening moving forward. If you go to Bartaco bring cash (DON'T LET THEM TOUCH YOUR CARD), an abacus, and patience. Again, the food was great, just the rest was very unprofessional, and not what I expected from the owners of Barcelona.
