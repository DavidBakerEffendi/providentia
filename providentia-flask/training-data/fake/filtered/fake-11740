I am so excited this place opened up. I was looking for a good all you can eat sushi place in the princeton area. This place is unlike any other all you can eat places because sushi is made fresh as you order. I already went back 3 times since it opened. The owner and all are very friendly and food is very fresh. Service is quick for made to order sushi. Here is link: sushipalace.us
