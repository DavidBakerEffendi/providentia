Want to eat a a "C" rated pizza shop with over rated, over priced pizza? with nasty, mean, rude guy taking your cash for the food? Then this is for you. Here is what i experienced. Walked in for my first time ever was standing trying to decide what to get....after all i was staring at 3 types of pizza and 2 types of Sicilians with no labels as to what they were whatsoever. ok, i can overlook that. so i asked the guy behind the counter, he told us what they were. so not 3 seconds later he is saying "cmon you decided or what?" i knew what i wanted, but my son was still trying to decide. so i ordered the margarita for myself and the sicilian for my son. He plops the sliced in front of me, it was behind the counter so i asked him to please heat it up for me, to which he said"what? it should be good for you. it should be warm." it was not at all, so i insisted on him heating it up for me. after all i am paying over $4 for this slice, right? i should be able to get a nice hot slice. He gave me the nastiest look ever as he threw it into the oven. then the sicilian. He was cutting a piece that was all burnt even on the top. well, i asked him to please give me one of the nicer looking pieces. he gave me a nastier look as he complied. ok. new york attitude i get. i understand. i am a new yorker after all. but you don't do this if you want people to come back ever again. and especially for over priced pizza. which was only a decent i had better at other lesser known pizza shops. my advise. stay away from arti-jerk pizza.
