My fiancee and I had plans to dine at Mac Attack tonight, however I suddenly fell ill. We discovered you could order online and pick up! My fiancee drove down and picked up our order without any problems. I had the white truffle mac n' cheese and my fiancee ordered the hamburger mac n' cheese. I LOVED the white truffle, my fiancee liked his dinner but said he was definitely ordering the white truffle next time. We both LOVE pasta and will make repeat visits to Mac Attack
