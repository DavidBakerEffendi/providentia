PYT has the best burgers on the planet. They also have a great atmosphere for good music and socializing. I was there on a thursday and caught DJ Brendam Bring'em spinning a really nice Hip Hop, R&B and Reggae set. The drink prices are awesome!!!!! Even got to meet the owner Tommy Up and he was very welcoming. The crowd was very friendly and cool. Look forward to going again!!
