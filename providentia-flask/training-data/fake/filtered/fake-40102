Heard about this place from a few friends of mine that frequent pizza spots around the city.  The first time i went the line was out the door and i could not figure out why all these people could be waiting so patiently for pizza.  the second time i went the line was actually inside the store so i decided to wait. Though the wait was still about 45 min for 2 slices it was worth it.  The pizza is made right in front of you to the point you can easily believe that you can go home and make it yourself.  Not the case, When i bit into this pizza it has such a unique and delightful taste.  You can easily taste the freshness in all the ingredients used to make this masterpiece.  My only problem is i should've ordered a pie to devour on my own.  i only took a star away because of the wait. you cant go there on your lunch hour with any expectations of being served.  it like rolling dice.
