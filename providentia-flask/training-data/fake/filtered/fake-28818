We've been living in Brooklyn for seven years now and have never had such a horrible experience anywhere in the city so far.  It didn't look too bad first when we saw how many nice Italian wines by the glass they had on the menu.  But their drunk bartender Meagan gave us the worst attitude the whole time we were there, give us looks and threw nasty comments like how much she hated all things foreign (us not being from the States originally) or how little she cared whether we enjoyed our wine or not.  Although there were a lot of people there besides us, Meagan kept saying she had to close the bar and how late it was -- it was not even midnight....    A new customer walked in, she did serve him a drink but kept saying she was doing him a favor.   We felt extremely uncomfortable and unwelcome there.  And on top of that we saw a big well-fed roach searching the counter for leftover food.  Spend your money elsewhere!!!
