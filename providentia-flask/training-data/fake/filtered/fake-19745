I think the most upsetting part is the high prices for DECENT food. I will say that the portions are very large, but that just means you're getting a large portion of "OK" food. The service could definitely improve in speed, we ordered a very simple salad and ceviche and it seemed to take forever, we had to check up with our waitress a couple of times to get an update. The decor is nothing to write home about,old fashioned at best, out dated. The severs seemed a little overwhelmed so I'll give them a break there, they were working hard and to the best of their ability. The food is simply ok so I'd go back if it were my only resort I guess, hopefully these reviews will help them improve their service and quality of food a bit.
