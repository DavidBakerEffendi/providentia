What a fantastic meal I just had at Seasons 52! Nacir was our server and he was fantastic.  I plan on asking for him in the future.   My decadent meal consisted of the lobster flatbread, a spinach/pear salad, filet mignon....and then topped off with a wonderful dessert (just the right size after that meal).  I am so happy that this restaurant opened up in Princeton.  I plan on going there often and trying the entire menu.   :)
