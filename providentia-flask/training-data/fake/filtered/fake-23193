Great Find!  Three of us just had a great breakfast here.  It's not your regular breakfast joint, try the baked eggs or nova lox & eggs.  Each breakfast came with mixed greens on the plate along with hash browns. Delicious Italian sausage too! Reasonably priced for the quality of food along with a very pleasant wait staff.  Can't wait to visit again.
