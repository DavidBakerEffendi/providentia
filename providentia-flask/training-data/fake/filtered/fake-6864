I'm a recent transplant to New York and I have to say Fat Buddha is easily one of my favorite food,drink,lounge spots thus far. I originally stumbled upon FB while attending a party, but soon discovered they have a full kitchen and the menu is offered late night. Pork buns & Wings are on point! The staff is always friendly and very accomodating. I'm a die hard whisky gal and they do not skimp on the pours. I always leave Fat Buddha feeling full and happy! It's also a great place for happy hours or a place to conduct any celebrations, such as your bday. I like the fact that they switch up their DJ's and provide a spacious area for you to dance if you should be so inclined to do so. Infact, it get's pretty rowdy on the weekends. Props to Fat Buddha! I'm a fan.
