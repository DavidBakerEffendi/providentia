Went to this restaurant 1st time and ordered mild Pad Thai. It was great. It did not taste like ANY hot spice was added AT ALL which was good because it was my first time eating Thai. Went 2nd time and decided to order Medium. Wrong Wrong Wrong. It was SO hot I had to force myself to eat 3 bites. When hostess came around and ask how it was I said WAY TOO HOT. Instead of apologizing and offering another dish or something!...She asked if I would like it wrapped and suggested to microwave it the next day and it would be less spicy. $50 and no food in my stomach. Then upon entering they graciously ask if you would like your wine opened before you are even seated or look at the menu. Then I was charged a $5 bottling fee. When I questioned the fee they said it was 'for opening my wine and the glasses' they gave me to use. As if I wasnt already unhappy about the food I couldnt eat... They did however offer me free sticky rice for dessert. It was literally a scoop! If a similiar experience happens to you...DO NOT ACCEPT THE FREE RICE. Then ended up throwing that in my face. When I complained about not being warned how spicy medium was (after us they warned the guest seated after us and we overheard) and complained about the bottling fee they threw at us how they gave us a free scoop of sticky rice. Geez thanks....We had to eat something didnt we??? Unfortunate because Boonton Main St in such a quaint area. This place does not understand true customer service. WIll never recommend this restaurant again based soley on this last evening here.
