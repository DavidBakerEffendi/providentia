We have been going to B's for years.  Good homestyle cooking for very reasonable prices.  The menu will change based on what's in season or what the kitchen decides is best.  I once went when they had shrimp cocktails, and it was so delicious and so much I went back every night until they ran out! LOL. Yes, some days it's hit or miss knowing if it's open, but I live so close it's worth a try when you are missing your mom's cooking! Some of my friends are put off by the sassitude of some of the staff, but I tell them that it's all part of the whole experience!  I have a devil relative who cooks like an angel, and all you need do is plug up your ears, put on a smile, and open your mouth to eat the great food.  Same advice when your at B's, because the scrumpdelish food is worth the price of admission.
