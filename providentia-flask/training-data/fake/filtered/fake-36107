Don't let some of the positive reviews here fool you.   I'm from Vernon and I recently moved down to New Haven and I tried this place for the first time today and I have to say the food is mediocre and the staff is rude. Maybe I'm spoiled from having lived near Rein's Deli, but if you had breakfast there, and then went down to this place, you'd know what I mean.   I could excuse the food, which isn't great, only so-so, but the waitresses were SOOOOO rude and they only gave preferential treatment to the "regulars"  (or maybe they were their friends), while everyone else was ignored and given attitude.  In summary, this was both my first and last visit, I'll be trying some other breakfast spots in New Haven out soon.
