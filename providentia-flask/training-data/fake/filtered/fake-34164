At the behest of my coworkers I ordered a burger from Teddy's several years ago and when I bite into it only one word came to mind... "meh".  For years they would go on and on about how good Teddy's was and I would laugh at them.  Last week they suggested Teddy's yet again and I once again shared my nothing to write home about burger story.  They persuaded me to order a Gyro, which I did. The Gyro arrived at 1:45 pm EST.  That time will forever be etched into my mind as the moment life began for me.  Nothing before that Gyro even matters anymore and I'm struggling to find a purpose in life that doesnt involve that delicious gyro by my side. If Jesus was into Gyro's and went to gyro cooking school for 4 years and got a masters degree in Gyro making he still couldnt make a better gyro. This day now ranks as the greatest day in my life right above my son being born and the xmas I got a Nintendo 64.
