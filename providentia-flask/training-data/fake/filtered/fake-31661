The ambiance is absolutely perfect for the transition into fall. My two girlfriends and I stopped by and were immediately in love with the colonial American touches and prominence of classic wooden beams, bar, and tables. The size was just right, not too large or small. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable without being pushy. I recommend the friend chick pea appetizer, and the artichoke was exquisite. For dinner I went with a good old American burger which apparently was made from good chuck from a farm in PA. Deelish. Monument Lane is now in my regular rotation of neighborhood restaurants, and I hear that they are about to make both the menu and wine list a bit more exciting in the coming weeks.
