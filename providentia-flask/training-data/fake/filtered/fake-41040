Hands down best pizza I've ever eaten. If you want the absolute best NYC style pizza, go here. Great sauce, amazing cheese, and the crust is to die for. The location is great (the building is historic, and you can feel it just being there) and the service is friendly and fast. A bit on the expensive side, but the pies are well worth the money. Make sure you bring cash though, they don't take credit cards!
