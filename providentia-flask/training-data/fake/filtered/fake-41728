I stopped in here recently for drinks on a Sunday night with my boyfriend after checking out the Denny Gallery on Broome Street. This place is amazing. The services was friendly, the music was delightful and I had an awesome cocktail called the Seven Year Itch with tequila, honey, strawberries and an IPA. I definitely plan to go back for the food, which looked and smelled delicious. I'd say get in there quick before it becomes impossible to get a seat because this place is best spot in the neighborhood.
