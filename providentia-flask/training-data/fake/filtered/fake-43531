Horrible Service!  The good reviews must be friends of the owners.  We did the 25/person dollar tasting menu.   What a waste of money!  1shrimp here 1 dumpling here... We had 10 people at the table  9 dumplings showed up and the waiter said sorry we ran out. Overheard our waiter say "f... them" to another waiter about a table who said the food was not enough.  Would never eat there again.
