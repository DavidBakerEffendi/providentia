Was in for lunch about three days go. I was really taken back by how fantastic the place looked. It was very clean. Before I even ordered I went to the restroom to wash my hands and noticed how clean the restrooms were. I ordered the calamari. The squid was fried to perfection. Not chewy or over cooked. Crispy even after they sat on my table for 15 minute or so. The red sauce was sweet and tangy. You can really see the quality of tomatoes they use there. Then I had two slices. Eggplant slice and margarita. Both were excellent. The brick oven is very beautiful. Â I will be back every week to try more of their menu and I'm telling all my friends. A+
