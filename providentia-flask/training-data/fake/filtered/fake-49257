My friend and I went there last Saturday at 10 p.m. because this other restaurant we wanted to eat at was already closed... good thing though, since we loved Delicias! Service was fast and the 2 waitress' were super friendly. I speak Spanish so at first I thought that might've been why, but then I noticed they were very friendly to the people on other tables too, even though they didn't speak Spanish. Food isn't too cheap, but they made me want to tip extra. As far as food goes, we tried the empanadas and they were good, but the sauce was even better. We then got 2 different plates and shared, and we both loved both plates. I recommend the "A La Playa"; got it with Tilapia fish and it was AMAZING. The only thing though was that since they only give you 3 arepas, we had to finish the (delicious) fillings with utensils. Would definitely recommend to anyone!!
