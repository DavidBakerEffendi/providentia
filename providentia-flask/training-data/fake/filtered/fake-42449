I was looking forward to having dinner with my son and his girlfriend last week.  The suggestion was made to go to Palma.  The place was lovely when we first entered and was seated at a nice table in the back.  The food was a bit disappointing, the calamari was very tough, almost inedible, the eggplant parmigiana was OK.  Our main dishes less than expected, the sauce was bitter to say the least.  What we didn't expect were MICE scurrying around the table while we sat.  We brought this to the attention of the waiter who shrugged it off and claimed this is the city.  We did not make a fuss, did not finish our meal and asked for the check.  While I understand this is the city, seeing mice scurrying around a busy restaurant during their peak dinner hour only leads me to believe they have a HUGE problem.  I would caution anyone thinking about dining at this establishment to be prepared and make sure they keep their belongings off the floor.  We could have made a huge fuss but chose not to do so.  I truly believe it could have been handled differently.  We will never return to this restaurant and will caution others not to do so as well.  If that many mice were running around at the time we were dining and much activity was happening,  they have a huge rodent problem.
