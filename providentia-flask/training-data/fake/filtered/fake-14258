I came to Lee's on a Friday night with my husband and my daughter. The service was great and so was the food. I didn't know they had karaoke. The karaoke girl Linda was so nice and energetic and patient and got my daughter up to sing. This meant everything to me and my husband because shes a special needs child. I went back and had a great time again. I highly recommend this restaurant and the karaoke on Friday with Linda. I will be back soon!
