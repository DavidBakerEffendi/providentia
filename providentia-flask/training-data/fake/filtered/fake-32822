This place is one in a million, "gourmet" is something that come to my mind right away, every time that I go I enjoy every single thing that I taste, I love also to watch the chef cooking, is amazing how he can handle a nice conversation and cook at the same time for almost 20 people, last thing to say, you must try the rissoto Â to know what I'm talking about
