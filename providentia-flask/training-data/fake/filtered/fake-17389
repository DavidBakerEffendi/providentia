Stony's has been open for about 6 months and I've been hooked on their chicken sandwich with gorgonzola.  I get it with the works and it is gloriously messy and delicious.  I know it's supposed to be a burger place, but I just can't tear myself away from that chicken...until tonight.  We had a birthday party at the house and we all ordered Bomber Burgers with grilled onions and tomatoes.  20 minutes later the order was delivered to our door by Joel, the friendly delivery man.  OMG, the burger was fantastic!  I know Stony is a trained chef and his attention to his craft comes through loud and clear in his hamburger.  For beginners, the bun is probably the best I ever had.  Follow that up with a lean, yet juicy beef patty and succulent grilled onions and you have yourself a masterpiece!
