I have been to the Grill 4 times in the past year. Each time I was so very happy.Good help and Â very pleasant decor. Check out the rest rooms...lovely. Food was always good and service attentive. Last visit I had their crab cake , no filler pure large chunks of crab. Best I have had in this area. Will go again and again. Only complaint too long a wait for a drink. Would like my cocktail before my meal...
