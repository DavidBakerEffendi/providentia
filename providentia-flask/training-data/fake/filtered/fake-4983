Go to this teeny bar/cafe in Williamsburg.  The food is amazing - try the vegetarian sandwich (whole grain wheat bread with a swipe of pesto tapenade on each side, sauteed zucchini and roasted red pepper inside that is covered in a delicous blanket of Brazilian cheese).  Um, to die for...and only $7!!  This place has amazing service (hard to find in the Billyburg) and the food is stand out...really delicious - FRESH.  Go to the bar for a cold beer or a whiskey and coconut and end off the night with a bite.  Ambiance is perfect.  Go to Beco.
