The ambience is nice and the staff is friendly. The food is ok, not great. We shared the special of the day Ravioli for starters, and we had way better Ravioli before. For the main course we had the Filet Mignon and the Saltimbocca. For both dishes the meat was good, the sides were ok. You would expect something more creative, extraordinaire, special for almost $40 (with a Risotto on the side) per plate... For the desert we had the home made melting chocolate cake, which was good. After the meal we were especially disappointed, bc my wife got a certain stomache ache that she gets when the food contained too much glute/ preservatives/ etc. You would expect a restaurant like this using only high quality ingredients... We would recommend going somewhere else, where you get more value for your money.
