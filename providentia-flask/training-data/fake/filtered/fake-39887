Sorry for the language people out there but this is the f..place i have ever been to first of all this freakin skinny monkey ass dude with beard on had some kinda racist attitude i have ever seen they made us wait like almost an hour and not even had out food ready to eat and there were a people behind us with made stuff ordered n they had it ready but not ours and when we decided to leave he said that once we ordered we cant walk out without getting it or else they wanted us to pay for it which i don think thats appropriate customer service on top of that i Â asked for bottle of water which took him 20 min to bring it on our table now u guys decide if it was really good thing .
