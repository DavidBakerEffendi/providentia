I've never been to Malaysia, but if the food there tastes anything like they do at Nyonya, than I have nothing to worry about. The food is flavorful and comes in large portions. The staff is quick and loud. The decor is nothing to brag about, but you're not going there for atmosphere. The evenings are always packed, so expect a wait. But it'll be worth it.
