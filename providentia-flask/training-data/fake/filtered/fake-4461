I have never experienced a more difficult  night than this one at Los Caballitos. A 30 minute wait for a table was actually 2.5 hours . The music was so loud and intrusive that we all had a pounding headache by the time we got to our table. The food took forever to arrive and then was not what we had ordered. The waiter apologized and offered free dessert from the chef but the aloof manager wandering back and forth never addressed any concerns. He appeared more interested in maintaining a cool appearance than in actually managing this mess of a restaurant.  Shame on you Los Caballitos! Food was cold, lacking any condiments, and in one case missing key components! Free dessert??? Why torture ourselves?? Never again!!
