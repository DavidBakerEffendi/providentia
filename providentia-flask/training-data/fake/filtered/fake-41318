Our experience was absolutely horrible! My husband won a gift certificate to Bella Anthony's Â from a local radio station. We thought it would be a nice treat and use it to take our kids out to dinner. We arrived at 5:00 on Sunday evening right when they opened. First of all, it really isn't a restaurant but more like a bar that serves food. The room for dining had a pool table and a fooseball table in it and no windows. It is poorly decorated. I wanted to start off with a glass of red wine and the waitress brought me white. It took awhile for the waitress to come and take our food order and subsequently took evein longer for the food to arrive after we finally did ordered. My son wanted ravioli and they didn't have any so he substituted with another dish. My husband had stuffed eggplant that was barely luke warm. The salad that I ordered for my meal never came and the waitress never checked on us after she brought our food.I had share meals with the others. My husband was disappointed because he wanted to order a beer during dinner but didn't get the chance because our waitress was not around. The food that the rest of the family ordered was average. While we we're eating our dinner another party was waiting to be seated and after standing at the entrance of the dining area for a long time and no one spoke to them, they left. We were there for an hour and forty minutes and waited quite awhile for our bill so I finally got up and walked to the kitchen area to find our waitress. She was in there ringing up our bill and as I approached her she apologized for not getting my salad to me and blamed it on the cooks. At that point I told her I didn't want the salad and to take it off our bill, which she did. Needless to say that was our first and last visit there and we will not recommend it to anyone!
