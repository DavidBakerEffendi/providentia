I'm baffled by the ratings. We just went there to try a new place, as it was my son's birthday and chinese buffets are his favorite.  Great place. You could tell the crab legs are a huge hit by the large plates people were carrying.  I'm a novice to the crab leg world, and while I had difficulty cracking them open - from what I was able to extract they were quite good.  Atmosphere is very nice here - we found the place clean, the service attentive, the food varied. I enjoyed all of the seafood.  I would say the sushi was a little dried out, but other than that, I thought everything was hot and delicious.  We'd definitely go again.
