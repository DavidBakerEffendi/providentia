We spotted it as we were walking down 9th ave looking for a nice dinner out, and we were drawn in by the cute Brooklynish atmosphere and very appealing menu. Â Food was kind of gross though and the water was warm. Come on man, get some ice cubes! We had pulled pork that was bland and expensive. The salad with crab tasted ok but looked like a plop of canned crab on top of basic lettuce. Quinoa was buttery and delicious. Servers were sweet and attentive. I guess it's more of a cute place to grab a drink...and maybe some quinoa.
