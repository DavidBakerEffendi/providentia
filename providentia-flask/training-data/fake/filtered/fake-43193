The homemade chicken fingers were out-of-control good!! Not just good for being chicken fingers, but just plain delicious - for ANY food. The honey mustard was to die for. I don't even really like honey mustard but this was amazing! If you're looking for a quick but delicious lunch, go to Liberty Chicken!! They also serve other things that also look amazing, but if you're looking for chicken fingers, they've got the best!
