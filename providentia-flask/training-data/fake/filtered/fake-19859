Sugar Freak is an extremely cute spot, with delicious food and friendly staff. My faves are the Mac n Cheese and the iced tea cocktail; you cannot go wrong with those! Not counting all the amazing desserts... yummy!! Not just that, the d√©cor is so welcoming and cute! I feel like I am on a movie set sometimes lol Great place for a date or to try something different ;)
