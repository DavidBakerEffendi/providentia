This place is awesome!!! I have never written a review but they do deserve it. I been going to this establishment for a while, and I always leave satisfied. The design is amazing, authentic Japanese style. I usually order the chicken buns as an appetizer and for the main I take the soba (da!)v great restaurant, Im not surprise that they have over than 6k reviews on yelp.
