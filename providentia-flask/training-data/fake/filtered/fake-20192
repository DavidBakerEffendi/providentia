This was my first time eating Austrian food, and I will definitely be going back for more! The restaurant has a great ambiance: very intimate, cozy, and dimly lit. The staff is extremely friendly; the owner introduced himself to us, and upon learning that my friend is Austrian, stayed to chat. Even though we had to wait to get a table (15-20 minutes), we were able to get seats at the bar, and were encouraged to order our meal there so that it would be ready once we got a table. My friend and I shared our main courses: we ordered trout mullerin and cheese spatzle. I am still dreaming about them: the trout has a delicious crust of toasted almonds, is sitting on a bed of spinach with potatoes on the side, and it is covered in a buttery sauce that beautifully brings the dish together. The cheese spatzle I also highly recommend-- it is like an upscale comfort food; they use an excellent cheese! The food is also reasonably priced for its quality. Enjoy!
