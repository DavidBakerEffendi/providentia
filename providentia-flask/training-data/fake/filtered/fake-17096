They say your favorite restaurant is where they know you. We had never been to Seafire Grill previously. We were treated very special by Aron, the GM, and Besfort, our waiter, and his team. Upon arrival, we were immediately greeted by Aaron who is full of energy and enthusiasm. He asked us to wait in the bar for 15 minutes and he would get us a fabulous table. In 15 minutes, he arrived to seat us at a fabulous table.  The service team was probably the best and most efficient of any restaurant we dined in NYC. The service was exceptional. I would give the food 4.5 stars. Very good food, although I always complain about NYC portions being too small. The atmosphere was very nice although adding individual lights to each piece of artwork on the wall would make the place more elegant. I had the salmon and my wife had the halibut. Both were excellent. The prawns were excellent as well. I was so impressed by how well we were treated, we will definitely go back to the Seafire Grill. We did not try the steaks, but a friend told us they are exceptional at this restaurant.  I highly recommend the Seafire Grill.
