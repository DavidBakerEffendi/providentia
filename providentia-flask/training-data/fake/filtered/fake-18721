We had a fabulous lunch at the Gramercy Tavern on Tuesday before Thanksgiving.  The restaurant was decked out in its holiday best, creating a warm, welcoming and sensuous environment. Service is always exceptional there.  For example, our server gave me a small pour of a wine by the glass I was interested in and when it was clear I wasn't wowed by it she suggested an alternative that was perfect for me, that day, and with everything I ordered. The food there continues to remind you that "you feast with your eyes first," appearing thoughtfully arranged on simple plates that allow the food to quietly show you everything it has to offer: various textures, complimentary and engaging colors, depth, and a general sense of harmony and balance. We also love that this is a place where New Yorkers and visitors go, making it an ideal place to linger over a great meal in a lovely place because the food, service, wine list, and people watching are always wonderful.
