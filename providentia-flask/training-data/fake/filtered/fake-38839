Well.  This was interesting and ultimately did not live up to my expectations, after reviewing all stellar reviews online.  Definitely not the most memorable meal I have had.  I didn't mind paying $50 for a five course meal - knowing each plate was going to only be a bite or two.  That didn't concern me at all.  The problem with it was that the food just didn't wow me.  The flavors were not there at all, and for a place that puts so much effort into the preparation of the elements (one chef was meticulously taking the little white strands off of mandarin segments with tweezers upon our arrival) you would expect better flavors that make you drool and leave you wanting more.  None of the plates left us wanting more.  I was actually very underwhelmed, much to my dismay.   The wait staff were also lacking knowledge on the limited wine selection.  8-10 white wines ranging from $45 per bottle to $900 per bottle? and they call themselves a wine & tasting bar??  Oye.   I will say one thing on the positive side - and I say this with absolute conviction.  The dessert - Torija - was absolutely unbelievable.  Brioche, soaked in condensed or sweetened milk and then crisp brown sugar on top.  Divine.   I would stop by here for a late glass of wine and dessert and leave it at that.
