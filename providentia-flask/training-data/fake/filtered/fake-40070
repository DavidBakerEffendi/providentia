First off the only people who go to this giant health code violation are the non new yorker hipster doofus types. they see it in zagats or hear about it from one of their other non new yorke born park slope, williamsburg, green pointer squatters and flock to the place. thats why it's always crowded and takes an hour to get a pie. don't bother calling in an order to pick up. the old man doesn't pick the phone up. this place was ok back in the late 80's early 90's when i used to go and like it a lot. now the old man can't keep up with the demands and makes an "oily and burnt" pie hard to do but he does it.
