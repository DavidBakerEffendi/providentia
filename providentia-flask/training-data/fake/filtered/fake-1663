I really can't figure out why people keep coming here. Is it the allure of late night food poisoning from the lingering bar-side raw bar? Or, perhaps the expansive seeming brasserie menu? Potentially the charming if not sometimes clueless service? Maybe.       All things considered Blue Ribbon has expanded well beyond its reach and the long time Soho home should surely close its doors if it can't offer a hamburger cooked to the proper temperature. Any cook knows an order for a medium well burger means kill it . Cook the living shit out of it.  When a burger , the least expensive entree, comes back to the kitchen underdone on a medium well ticket the grill/broiler man should immediately walk out of the kitchen and have a smoke or reconsider his career choice entirely. But, if that same cook lacks the integrity to slap a new patty on the salamander rack, grill, flat top or whatever, he should seriously consider blowing his meager brains out.  Why do we offer reheated garbage, why would anyone assume no one would notice the newly broiled blue cheese and tomato previously place atop an undercooked beef swell. I would. She did. Luckily the MGMT took it off the bill. But surely don't come here if you want to eat.
