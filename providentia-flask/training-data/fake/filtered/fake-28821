Bar Tano stands out in an otherwise dreary industrial neighborhood; it's an elegant and charming space with a comfortable bar and impressive decor. It offers a good range of drinks and friendly service, and if it were to stand alone simply as a neighborhood bar, it would have merited a far better rating than two stars. Unfortunately, the food, at least when I went there with my fiancee, was extremely mediocre. Mixed fried seafood as an appetizer was OK, though the white fish was a little soggy and did not taste fresh; the pizza with ricotta was completely bland, the dough seemingly made with neither salt nor oil. The papardelle with short rib ragu was equally unimpressive; though the pasta was perfectly cooked, the sauce was watery and, again, bland in the extreme. Good short rib ragu should be beefy and robust; this was not. In fact, it was difficult to tell whether meat had indeed been used in the sauce or not. It's a shame, because it's a great space and has a lot of potential. We went just before New Year, so it's possible the kitchen was short-handed (the staff certainly appeared to be having trouble keeping up on a busy night). Judging by the other reviews there appear to be some winners on the food menu, so maybe given time they'll be able to bring the food up to the level the interior would seem to demand.
