We are actually still sitting at this place at this time. Personally I have been to many sushi buffet places and have never seen one this bad. I mean, we are doing all you can eat and expect the rice of the sushi will not come in too small, but the rice in this place is so big and the fish is paper thin, we just couldn't eat all the rice. But we ended getting a second plate with another 6 piece sushis anyway, And then this lady brought over the sushi and said make sure you eat with rice too. Excuse me? My husband flipped out and said their sushi proportion of rice and fish is imbalance and the lady kept saying no its not. Unbelievable customer service and we certainly will not come back to this horrible place. I can spend $22 on ayce somewhere else and is 10 times better!!!
