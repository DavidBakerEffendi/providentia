i used to like this place b/c it served Murphy's and had sawdust on the floor of the bar. I should have known better b/c that is the first sign of redneck Irish behaviour and b/c i was a person of colour i was told that i had to leave the bar even though i was just drinking water.  SO i asked the man who claimed to be the owner why would he throw me out and he said to me "because I want to" at which point i said to him that you are no better than Mr. Zimmerman in FL.   That hit a bone and he really wanted me out but b/c of my peaceful Gandhi-esque approach he could not force me.   I WILL NEVER FREQUENT THIS BAR AGAIN BECAUSE THE OWNER IS A RACIST!!!
