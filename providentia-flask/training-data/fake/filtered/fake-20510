We went here last night on the recommendation from a friend.  This place is brand new and a really cool moonshine themed place with oak barrels lining the walls. Had the braised short ribs which were some of the best I've ever had.  The Olde City fries were good too and they had truffle salt on them (I did not even know truffle salt existed).  My wife had a burger that was so huge I had to help her eat and that was really good too.  The prices were very reasonable for an Olde City spot. My wife had 2 of the moonshine drinks and I tasted them and they were good.  Not weak or watered down either.  They have Troeg's Perpetual IPA on tap and happened to be running a $3 draft special on a Saturday night!  Yes, you read that right Troeg's full pints for $3!!!  Now you understand why I didn't want to leave. We split a bread pudding which was awesome.  It had a little mint thing going on with it...  We almost ordered a second one. I will definitely be back at this place again soon.
