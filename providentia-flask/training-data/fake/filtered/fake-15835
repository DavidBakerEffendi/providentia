I've been going to Juniors for a little over a year now and I love it. Yes its a bit pricey, but for Times Square, what does anyone expect? My only complaint is the way some of the staff is treated, not just by the customers, but by what I assume are managers. I witness one very sweet young lady get chewed out by a customer for no reason then watched a manager passively aggressively say she did something wrong. For such a nice place I would think the staff would have a little more support from their managers.
