I'm picking when it comes to places to eat sushi, but when I went to Manus Â with friends, I really enjoyed it. The place itself, was welcoming, nice and you can be as comfortable as much as you without worrying about other people bothering. The employees were very nice, they had great suggestions when it came to the food. Overall I would say that this sushi restaurant is a good, fun place to go and have good sushi. The food is really fresh, the appetizers are good, but the sushi itself is really good. I would keep going there for sushi :)
