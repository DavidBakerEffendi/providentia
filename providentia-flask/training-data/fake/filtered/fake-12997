While walking home in the Village my wife and I stopped for dinner at Il Corallo  located on Prince Street in SOHO. When ordering pre-dinner drinks I inquired if they had sugar free Cranberry Juice (my wife is diabetic and cannot tolerate sugar or alcohol).  The server checked and said it was not available.  I ordered wine for myself and a liter of sparking water for her.  I told him I had brought sugar-free juice for her (which I add to her glass with the sparkling water).   We eat out most nights at a wide variety of restaurants and no restaurant has ever objected to this practice.   When the hostess at Il Corallo became aware of the Cranberry juice, however, she became very loud and agitated and exclaimed that patrons would have to make do with the menu offerings regardless of medical or dietary requirements. She became louder and quite obnoxious, referring to us as "dumb", and seemed to be getting out of control, so I paid for our appetizers and we  left. Incredibly bad experience and amazingly poor attitude from the hostess
