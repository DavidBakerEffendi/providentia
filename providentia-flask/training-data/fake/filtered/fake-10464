WAOW i love this place so much. I work in the area and the food in midtown is just the worst....except for the halal guys...cheap..Im sorry VERY cheap and you get full with that only meal no need for another snack later. I had the chicken with rice and it was fantastic. I go there almost 2-3 times each months and just love it. The only bad thing: THE LINE which is insane but you get what you wait for.
