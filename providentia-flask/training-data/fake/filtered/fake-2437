this review is for the second hipcityveg location, the one in university city. the items i've tried on the university city menu (the fajita wrap & crispy hipcity ranch) seem identical to the ones in rittenhouse. and by jesus, i hope they continue this trend and become the vegan answer to mcdonalds, with hipcity consistency around the globe. can you imagine, 30,000 hipcityveg's around the world, on every corner, in every podunk town - just like the golden arches? i can. yes i can. you know why? because i dream big. and because HCV is GOOD. i want to see them get so big they're able to offer a vegan dollar menu. i want to see hipcityveg in the hood. i wanna see 30 hipcityveg's in midtown manhattan. i want to know that i can get a groothie should i ever find myself in dubai. back to this location: they have not one, but TWO restrooms, and tons of seating, which more than makes up for the lack of either at the rittenhouse square park location. but speaking of parks, you have an equally pleasant park right across the street from this outpost - locust walk. plenty of benches, trees, grass, people, pigeons, dogs... just like rittenhouse. and here's a tip when ordering: add smoked tempeh to your crispy hipcity ranch for even more gluttonous (but plant-based) awesomeness. maybe someday they'll name it after me, and i can share in the spotlight of the hipcity dynasty.
