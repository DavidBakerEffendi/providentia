This place is a bit too modern. It has an old fashioned looking brick oven but the decor is a bit sterile.  They also have logo with a big M that doesn't look any thing like a classic New  Haven pizza place. We got a medium pie..1/2 broccoli, sausage and cheese and 1/2 just cheese.  I am sorry to report that it was not particularly flavorful and the crust was soggy.  The service was also slow..we arrived at 4 p.m. In an attempt to beat the crowd...it was not very busy but it seemed to take forever to get our food.
