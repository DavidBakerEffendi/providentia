The white pizza is awesome. The atmosphere is casual and the staff / service is excellent. Pretty good beers on draft and theres an outside patio area to eat (weather permitting). Generally speaking, the pizza is good if you like well done pies that are relatively thin crusted. I don't get all the hype over their famous chicken wings - I think they're dry. Nothing will blow your mind on the menu but it's a fun place and the prices are fair.
