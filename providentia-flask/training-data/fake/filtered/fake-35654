The place was empty when I went there. I should've taken it as a sign not to go in. waiter was rude, manager was rude. Their idea of a poached egg was one fully cooked. Their excuse when we confronted them was thar most people don't complain the poached egg is runny. last time I checked that's what it's supposed to be. go to Toast it's better.
