Had a spectacular meal. The food was excellent as well as the waitstaff. The manager was a bit obnoxious. We arrived 15 min before our reservation and asked if there were a possibly of being seated earlier.  Instead of being politely told no, the manager widened her eyes and began speaking through her teeth with an exaggerated false smile and spoke to a member of our party like a psychotic children's clown. I don't know what the manager's problem was that day but it was incredibly offensive to have this woman speak to a paying customer as if she were begging for a handout.  Will come back for the food any time will probably bring a camera next time in expectation of catching the clown in action.
