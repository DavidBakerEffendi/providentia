I have had the No. 1 sandwich.  It is amazing.  The crunch of the pork combined with the clean, crisp flavors from pickled carrots and cucumber, throw in some fresh cilantro and plenty of hot sauce; then the fat from the thin slice of pate just brings it all together. This is hands down the best sandwich that I have ever eaten and it is only 3.75
