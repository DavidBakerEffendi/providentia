Awesome food... I love the tawa rotis... they do not get any better.. love the karela-okra fry... the mutton curries... the chicken curries... and kababs... I prefer eating fish the way it is made in Mangalore.. but after eating the amritsari fish curry at Punjabi Rasoi... it was finger licking good. Punjabi rasoi is the place to head to if you are looking for home-made punjabi food.
