We found this wonderful restaurant quite by accident.  Our rental car broke down right in front of the restaurant so we stopped in for something to eat.  The food was great, the drinks were free flowing and everyone was very friendly and helpful for two old, out-of-town tourists.  Philly truly is the city of brotherly love.  We loved the patio and the murals.  If my rental car ever breaks down again I hope it's in front of this lovely restaurant.
