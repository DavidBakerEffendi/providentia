Had reservations tonight with my wife and a close friend who has been raving about this place for months.  We weren't seated until 45 minutes after our reservation, which was certainly not a good start.  However, while we waited, their wine was reasonably priced and crisp, and they comped us their cheese plate app, so that allowed me to look past their tardiness. Our first course was tasty.  My wife had the burrata salad, our friend the polenta special and I had the watermelon gazpacho. It all went wrong from there. I ordered the lamb chop special.  I don't use this word lightly, but it was gross.  It literally was a one inch piece of meat attached to fat, and lots of it.  The rice it was served with tasted good, and the snap peas were a treat, but the lamb fat chop was such a horrific disappointment--quite literally the worst piece of meat I have ever seen in a restaurant.  It is scary that a chef at a place of this supposed quality would plate a piece of meat like this.  And so that I'm clear, I'm greek, so I know my lamb. Really a 2.5 for the wine and first course, and the place had a good vibe, but that lamb was truly disgusting.
