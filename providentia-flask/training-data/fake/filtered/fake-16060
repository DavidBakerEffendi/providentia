I've never been so disappointed in my life!  I will never ever think about eating at Cafeteria again.  I went at 4am on Friday.  The outside felt like an entrance to a club.  The bouncer who was very nice and did his job respectfully told my party of four that we would have to wait outside until he got the ok from the hostess.  No problem I get it, I too work in the hospitality industry.  However once we were seated it took a good 10 minutes before a waiter came and asked if we wanted something to drink.  So, finally we ordered.  I ordered the bacon, egg & cheese sandwich, another person from my party ordered meatloaf, and the last two ordered chicken & waffles.  15min. after we sat down another table comes to sit down next us.  15min. later that same table that sat down AFTER us got there food, not to mention chicken & waffles (the same food we had ordered).  Now it's going on 45min! We complain to the waiter that our food still had not arrived and that the people next to us received there food before us.  He says "Your food is coming, they are making it with love".  With love?!?! Please there isn't enough love in the world to take that long! 10 more min. go by and we finally ask the busboy to please check on our food.  He goes to check and says it will be 5 min.  5min. later we see another group that came in after us receive their food. At this point, my entire party felt Disrespected, Ignored, Ultimately like 2nd class citizens.   We all agreed to leave without even receiving the food.  On our way out we complained to the nice bouncer outside and he said we were the third party that night that had complained about the TERRIBLE SERVICE.  If I could save anyone who even inquirers about Cafeteria any trouble,  Don't Waist your time or breath on Cafeteria unless you have a thing for poor service and rude people!
