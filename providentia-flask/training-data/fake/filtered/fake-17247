Mona Lisa "USED TO BE GOOD."  Pizza SUCKS now (always delivered cold and burnt), LARGE  antipasta consists of 3 pieces of ham, 2 pieces of  salami, and 1/2 piece of cheese slapped on top of lettjuce (not even rolled like it should be).  Since the opening of the Davinci Room, Mona Lisa has been terrible!
