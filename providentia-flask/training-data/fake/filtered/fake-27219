It was pretty good. Went down to the Italian Market on a saturday, got some produce, and had lunch and some cannolis. Good day altogether. It was a pain to find seating in the place, however. I had never had much experience with Italian sandwiches. These were pretty good, but I'm not a big fan of sandwiches anyways. Decently priced, and very large. My girlfriend and I could have shared one and we would have been content.
