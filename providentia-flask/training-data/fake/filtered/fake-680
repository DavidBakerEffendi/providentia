This place just opened recently a couple of blocks from where friends of mine live...they were dying to show the place off and it was worth the trip. I'm a big fan of SPTR so I'm happy to see them expand. The place is beautiful, rustic and inviting. The food was great but I was really hoping for fresh sardines on the menu! Instead we had soup (sooo good), grilled cheese, onion rings and falafel. The falafel was especially good. Beer selection is great and what you expect in Philly anymore. I'll be back!
