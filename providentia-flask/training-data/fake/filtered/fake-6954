This restaurant doesn't even deserve 1 star.  Our first time there was horrible.  There were 8 people in our group.  The service was very slow,  the waitress didn't have a strong knowledge of the menu and the food was tasteless.  To make matters worse, when we told the managers (too many of them to begin with) they began arguing with us telling us we were crazy and cheap.  We will NEVER EVER go there again.  I'm surprised they are still open.
