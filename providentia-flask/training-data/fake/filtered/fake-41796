Not good at all ... Called and ordered a pizza they told me1 hr called after an hour and 15 min they told me it would be another 45 min... The third time I called the told me it would take another half hour ... 3 hrs for a pizza ??? And it's not even good pizza or food... Just don't bother with them... Too many good pizza places in south Philadelphia ...
