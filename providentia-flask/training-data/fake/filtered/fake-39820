I came here on a limb with friends because we were craving Thai food. At first glance, the decor was absolutely beautiful. The crystal chandelier and posh mirrors were an added touch to its cozy and intimate feel. With that being said, seating felt slightly cramped and while the staff were very friendly, my friends and I felt like we were rushed through our courses. I had the Room Service Pad Thai, which was seafood pad thai wrapped around an egg crepe. Definitely a twist on pad thai, which has always been my favorite dish. Very happy to come across this place and definitely will return again!
