First off let me just say there are not enough positive adjectives to use to describe the service my best friends received from the Cafeteria for her bday!!! We just left there and Getty was an awesome server, and Ahmed was the best manager in the whole Universe! The hospitality, smiles, personalization, they both along with Jenny epitomize what customer service is all about! We felt like celebrities, and everything was so personable. A plus plus plus service, recommend anyone to ask for these 3! Made my best friends bday so much more memorable!
