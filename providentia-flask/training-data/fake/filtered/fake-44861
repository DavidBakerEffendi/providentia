I came here with a friend and the quality of the food was embarrassingly poor. We waited a long time for it, only to have our appetizers arrive cold and my friend's pasta plate was clearly rushed - sloppy, badly oversalted, and very bland. She barely touched it. My pizza was overcooked and the quality of the ingredients was low. Come on guys, there are a million places in New York to get mediocre pizza, at least make an effort. On the positive side, the atmosphere was nice, our waiter did his best, and the dessert was good. But overall, this was a very poor experience and I won't be back. Also, $20 corking fee? Really? As another reviewer noted, it's not our fault you guys messed up on your wine license. Shamelessly gouging your customers to make up for your own mistakes is no way to make friends, Emporio! There are many better options for good Italian food in Nyc, at far more reasonable prices.
