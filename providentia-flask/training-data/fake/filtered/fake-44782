It took 20 min for the pizza to arrive. The pizza was super greasy and feel apart easily. For people that eat healthy I recommend another pizza place. After eating this pizza I got sick 10 after. If you are looking for really good pizza don't go there.. The quality of the pizza is not the price it should be... It's not bad, but i don't and won't recommend it.
