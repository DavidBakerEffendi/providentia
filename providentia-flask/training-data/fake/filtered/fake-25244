Champs is the best thing this neighborhood has going for it. The food is mind-blowing (whether you're vegan or vegetarian or omnivorous, you'll be impressed), the servers are super-friendly, and did I mention: it's affordable. Also, the atmosphere is reminiscent of a 50s diner with hipster frills. Pure class. If you're eating here for the first time, GET THE REUBEN. If you're in the mood for breakfast, the Monte Cristo is where it's at, but honestly, it's all good, really good. And don't shy away from the Dominator (chef's choice); they've got it down to a science. Oh yeah, and they're delivering now, so if you live anywhere between the waterfront and broadway, they'll probably accommodate you.  I even hear they deliver out in parts of Greenpoint. Seriously, this place is awesome.  Even if you just want to sip coffee and stare at your Facebook page, this is the place to do it.
