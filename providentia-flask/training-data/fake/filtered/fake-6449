We've not only been dinner patrons for decades, we also had our wedding reception and many family parties here. We defy anyone to beat the quality and quantity of the food. The service is outstanding, courteous, and attentive. The manager bends over backwards to make every celebration the best that it can possibly be. No restaurant successfully stays in business as long as this one without possessing a special added touch. It's absolutely our favorite!
