What an insult to Vermonters. They don't even use real Vermont maple syrup. They have chalkboards up to make it seem homey, but the food was over priced, low quality, and the servers were rude. Go to Radiobean or someplace authentic when in Burlington. If it weren't for the UVM crowd, the locals would have put this place out of business a long time ago. I looked at the 5 star reviews for this place and they are totally disingenuous and obviously written by the owner.
