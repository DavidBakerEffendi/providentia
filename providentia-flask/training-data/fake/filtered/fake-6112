Great place for groups, but definitely make a reservation! The staff really knows their stuff. They were out of nearly every beer on the menu, but our waitress(sarah) and the bartender brought us samples of what they did have and what things on the menu would go with which. They also helped us save a couple bucks by recommending Sweethearts and combos for everyone to share. DEFINITELY try the fried green tomatoes and the chicken is superb.
