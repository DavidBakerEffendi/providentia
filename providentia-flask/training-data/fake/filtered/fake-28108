This is of my favorite spots for a quick drink or snack after work and on weekends. The space feels warm and welcoming with the big wooden bar and tables with assorted color cushions. The walls feature ever-changing art from local artists, so you're always discovering something new. The menu is simple, but there's something for everyone, carnivores and vegans alike. My favorite path is to select from the local cheeses which change frequently by season and availability and are clearly chosen with care to match/pair with their wine and beer offerings. I've been coming here for years, but in the last 6 months my visits have become regular due to the fantastic staff. The waiter/bartender, in particular, always makes sure to find out what I'm looking for to ensure I get the right drink or snack. It's always the first place I bring visitors because I know they will be impressed with the service, which is contrary to what they expect of NY. And they all love it. There are always new places popping up, but he makes me and my friends feel relaxed and at home no matter how busy.
