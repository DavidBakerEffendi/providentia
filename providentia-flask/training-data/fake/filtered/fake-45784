The only part of the evening that was even remotely worth while was our server and the drinks.   The food was badly prepared and, at it's best, mundane.  Two other nearby tables sent back food as well.  When I see prices in the high 20's for entrees, I expect well prepared and innovative. I will not eat here again.
