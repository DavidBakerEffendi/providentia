I live on Long Island and visit Five Leaves every couple of months when I'm in Brooklyn. I love this place. I've had their regular burger, and the roast organic chicken, and they're both very good, but my favorite sandwich is the Blat (avocado and bacon). It's absolutely delicious. The servers are very friendly and attentive, not snooty at all. The space itself is warm and cozy. I only wish I lived closer, so I could visit more often.
