I've heard wonderful things about this place, but didn't experience the same!!  Was there for lunch today, delayed waitstaff n sandwich order took 30+ minutes to arrive, oh and waitress delivered two of the sandwiches without fries....said they were on there way, LOL!!  Rec'd the original bill with a discount but when they ran CC the bill didn't have a discount...no time to dispute it due to delays!!  I will say the 1/2 sandwich that I was to able to inhale was fairly decent!! Not sure I'll go back!!
