Although I not yet been able to dine at Witherspoon Grill, I recently tried to plan a dinner party for come clients and partners of a prominent business in the area. After a negative description of the semi-private space they have available, I was made to feel like a fool for trying to make a reservation for my group three weeks in advance. I was told they are a restaurant and not a banquet facility. Although we would love to treat our clients to a new hot-spot, I could risk the possibility of subjecting them to the same poor service and attitude that I experienced.
