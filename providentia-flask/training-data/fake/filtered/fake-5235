Can't wait till they put the tables outside, I love eating at Marzullo's and watching the people walk by or the baseball games in the park across the street.  It's a wonderful way to spend an afternoon. The menu has so many delicious things to choose from I can't even begin to describe all of the choices.   I am sure once you try Marzullo's you will definitely find a favorite dish and be sure to come back for more.
