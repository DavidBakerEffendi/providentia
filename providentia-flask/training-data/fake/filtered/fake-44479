I go here just about every Saturday or Sunday in football season with my friends and their boyfriends. Â We have the same waitress every weekend who knows some of us by name! The service is great- even when its crowded we never have to wait long to get our order taken. I can't even believe how many different beers there are to choose from. Really is the best place in town for bar food and football!
