I have several Chinese restaurants in my neighborhood but Luen Hop is my favorite.  Delicious Mu Shu, boneless ribs, egg foo young, chicken wings.  There are very few seats, it's a tiny place that is pretty plain.  Most people get the food to go.   The people that run it are very efficient and pleasant, and the food is consistently very good.  The prices are very good; you get a lot of food for your money.
