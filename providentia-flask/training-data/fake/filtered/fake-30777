wonderful gem of a restaurant - contemporary casual seating facing the East river, friendly staff.  The dining area is not that large but the place is very comfortable.  There is parking downstairs. There was confusion in the order, I had my appetizer duplicated and the entree forgotten but the server was very friendly and my entree was the lamb salad.  There were many many choices for restaurant week. Colecchio's staff has prepared an excellent creative menu for restaurant week.  The beer choices are many. Thoroughly enjoyed the experience and the variety of breads and menu choices. The seating is comfortable - not on top of each other but not as spacious as places in hotels. I enjoy  the variety and creativity of Collechio's casual Riverpark and Tap room restaurants much better than Keller's casual Bouchon and Ad Hoc restaurants.   No one rushed us out but we had an odd experience of someone following us to the restroom when we exited and complaining  to us when we departed that they didn't mean to be rude but were waiting for our table for ten minutes.. We had better manners than to respond..  No one at the restaurant pushed us to leave or even suggested that there was any rush - they were asking us if we wanted more coffee and our order was only slightly delayed because of the forgotten salad entree.  Now I don't know how or why this New Yorker was targeting our table for themselves and we were only dining there for 1.5 hours and I believe that all upscale restaurants space bookings 1.5-2 hours apart.    But I will leave this to frentic hyperactive  rat race life of New York City vs. California.  It didn't make sense as in a public environment next to the hospital who knows who you are speaking to?  We still thoroughly enjoyed the meal and would return again as the menu is extensive.
