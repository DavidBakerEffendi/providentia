Great place to go! Everyone there is really nice. The Sunday brunch is amazing. Tasty and inexpensive with a friendly staff, you cant go wrong with that combo. The Robin Banks show is hilarious and entertaining. I recommend this bar for any a good time and some good food. I also heard the $5 all you can eat BBQ is amazing but I haven't had the chance to go yet.
