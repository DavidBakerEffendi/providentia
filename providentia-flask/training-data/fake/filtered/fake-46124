I have been here at least 7 times already. Consistently great food and service! Sandwiches are large and really filling. My friend and I always get one and split it in two and it is enough for us both (which is hard to say of vegetarian sandwiches from other places where you have two pieces of bread an a zucchini in between...) The food is delicious! I would only eat there for lunch had it been closer to my office. Service is always nice, too.
