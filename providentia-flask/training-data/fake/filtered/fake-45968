This is a great neighborhood pizza place. Great for kids, family's or just for one person. Their Pizza is the absolute best I have ever had from the classic cheese slice or pie to the not so classic Philly cheese steak slice of pie and many more . Every Single slice or pie is hot out of the oven and ready in mins. The prices are reasonable and the food is the best Italian food and best pizza I have ever had. All in all I would 100% recommend this pizzeria if you're looking for great tasting and affordable Italian pizza and Italian food in Nutley, NJ One more thing be shore to try their new Nutella Pizza I had it on a recent visit and let me tell you the Nutella pizza is a must try.
