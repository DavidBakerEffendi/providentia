We just tried it after reading web and other reports. We LOVED it . We got the flame roasted chicken (tasty and perfectly cooked), the creamy mashed potatoes (OMG), grilled zucchini (OMG) and a delicious, fresh salad that was lightly and so perfectly dressed. How great that they deliver to our South Slope block!
