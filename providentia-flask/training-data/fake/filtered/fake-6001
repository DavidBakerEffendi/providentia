Beautifully decorated interior and patio.  The restaurant was empty at 12 noon on a Friday, when 9 of us arrived. Upon arrival to the restaurant that has 'BEST LUNCH SPECIAL $9.95" on a banner above the door, we were told that groups over 5 people could not get the lunch special.  We would have to order off the dinner menu, with basically the same offer as the lunch special but pay $19.95 PER PERSON.  After the 9 of us had arrived, the restaurant was still empty.  The owner continues to inform us that we cannot get the lunch special because we have 9 people.  In a rude, and condescending tone he reminded us that we could order off the dinner menu which starts at $16.95. The reason we asked a few times about our options is because we were actually perplexed.  Is it possible that an empty restaurant is going to refuse to give us the lunch special because we have TOO MANY people?  Does he not want our business?  Very confusing.  We decided that the combination of false advertising and rude response from the owner was not worthy of our business so we went elsewhere.  For all I know the food may be ok, but I won't find out.  There are too many other good restaurants in Montclair that treat their customers with respect.
