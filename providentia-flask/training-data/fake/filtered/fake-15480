I went here over Labor Day weekend and I loved it! I am a huge Sunny fan so I came here just because it was Mac's bar but I was really impressed. I loved the food-you must get the cheese fries. The food was great and the prices were reasonable. They had a huge selection of beer on tap as well. It is a really laid back, unpretentious, fun bar. I will definitely go back the next time I am in Philly!
