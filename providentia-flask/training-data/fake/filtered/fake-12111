All I have to say is TRY the bacon donuts...seriously incredible.  Also had the tuna tartar and the strawberry cinnamon ribs, which were both good but lacked a little something.  Maybe the moral of the story is don't START with the bacon donuts because then the rest pales in comparison.  Overall great experience, chill place to bring friends and share plates or a cool date spot.  I'll be back for more!
