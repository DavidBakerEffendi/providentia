This is only my second review ever.  Only signed up tonight cause i found a really good hair salon on yelp this morning, and was talking to the very friendly salon owner who asked that we put in a review for the place.  Got done with that and figured that in the years I've used yelp and never wrote a thing, I probably still won't after tonight ever again, and if I were going to look up a place right now to do a review on, it would be Oyster House.   I freaking love this place!!!  Anytime I'm asked where I wanna go out to eat for something special (graduation, birthday, anniversary), the answer over the past year and a half since Ive discovered this place has been "that oyster place"; cause to us, there's only one!!   Love the ambiance, love how they've decorated with walls with all sorts of age old oyster/clam plates.  Love they oysters.  Love that every waiter/waitress there can tell you everything about the oysters.  I love the big and briney, Chris loves the small and not at all briney.  So we say what we're looking for, and they'll give detailed explanations of the different options they have.  Pair it with the Philadelphia Oyster Stout beer; heaven.  The side dishes are all amazing too. My mouth is watering just thinking about this place....gonna plan another visit there soon now.
