I have now been to La Fourno a number of times. The staff are polite, friendly and attentive. However, they do not rush you, or stand over you. The dress code is casual, but you can walk in wearing dress pants and a tie and not feel overdressed. The restaurant is tidy and clean, and without the over the top, stereotypical "Italian restaurant" decor. The food is wonderful. It is all well cooked Italian food, just as mama would make at home. The portions are not overly large or out of control, so you have room for dessert or an antipasto. That being said, you definitely won't starve at this place... Absolutely love this place, and it is a gem in that area. You will walk right past La Fourno if you aren't looking for it. Â Great place, and will absolutely be back!
