I give this place a soild five stars because both the food and the staff was incredible. right down to the very last pan friend dumpling the sauce was perfect brings out the natural flavors of the steamed chicken dumplings with lemongrass. I absolutely love this place. The only bad thing is that I can never seem to find a decent spot to park on fridays in china town so I haven't been avle to go as much as I would like to.
