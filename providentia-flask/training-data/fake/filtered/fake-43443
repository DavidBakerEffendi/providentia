Great Pizza! Â Staff friendly, It's a family place. I don't understand calling it a Dive, They been in business over 30 years,Dive don't last long!! As for Greasy Pizza , Ask for light meat & cheese, They aren't cheap with the ingredients. One of the few place,you don't have to ask for extra cheese!!!!
