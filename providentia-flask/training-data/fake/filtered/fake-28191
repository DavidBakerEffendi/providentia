Very disappointed. We got take out and thought the portions were very meager for the high price. But worse of all they really skimped on the cheese. Couldn't even find it on the fries! Less than a teaspoon???? No exaggeration. Hard to even taste in the M&C too. Mostly pasta. When we asked the person taking our order over the phone if the cheddar was sharp, he said " Awww, don't know. It's yellow..." Should have been a clue. Sorry. Great idea, but very blahhhh.
