I used to work at this establishment, so I am no longer biased. Its a great place with great owner(s), they have excellent food, I highly recommend the Lobster Mac n Cheese or any of the sandwiches. Some say they are pricey, but they are HUGE and worth it. Also, great for a drink(s) in the indoor bar or outdoor patio. Fun to catch live music there. Cheers, Keith
