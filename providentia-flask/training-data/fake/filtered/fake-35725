Haven't visited this place in a couple years but I'm glad I came back. The food was really good.  The soup was a little bland but the small plate appetizers were excellent (eggplant, shrimp and cauliflower choices).  The salads were also really nice - light, fresh and flavorful. Our waiter, Mustafa, did an excellent job!  Thank you.
