After reading an article in the newspaper about Funnibonz we decided to try in out. I was not impressed. The meat was cold, the brisket was not tender, they were out of ribs on a Friday night(which I thought was shocking for a BBQ restaurant)& the service was slow which is somewhat understandable since it has not yet been open a month yet. The BBQ sauce is good, but there was not even an aroma of smoking meat or BBQ which was very disappointing. It was just OK but not worth the wait, not sure if I would return.
