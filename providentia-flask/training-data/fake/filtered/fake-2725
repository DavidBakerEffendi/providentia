It's OK.  I mean, the portions are kinda small and the food is not amazing at all.  It's fun for socializing.  Hey, speaking of socializing ...   The one guy who works there is so hot.  The whole time I was eating there with my parents I couldn't take my eyes off the one humpty guy who took our order.  I wanted to go down on him in the bathroom so bad, but I couldn't figure out a way to signal him with my stupid parents noticing something was going on.  I must go there this week by myself when they are slow.  I gotta have him.   I highly recomend this place on so many levels.
