On 14th February 2011, I had a meal at Wild Edibles, New York City, the bill for the meal was $117.01 - when I paid the bill with my debit card I was asked to sign a merchant slip for the amount of $130 - I refused as this amount did not tally with the bill, which was $117.  I was then presented with a merchant copy debit receipt for the $117.01 total which I duly signed, in the area on the bill where I could, if I wished, add a service tip, I wrote in words -  Z E R O - as the service was below standard. Upon checking my statement online today I notice that the merchant has claimed $137.01 from my account, I did not sign for this amount - so beware - Wild Edibles are obviously not shy about committing fraud. My bank has been asked to conduct an investigation - I await a reaction from Wild Edibles !!
