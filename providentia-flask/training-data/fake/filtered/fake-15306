Had my first meal here recently and I have to say, I was impressed! The food was quite good, though a little pricey for my taste (but we were aware of that going in). Someone suggested that we try out the Guac, and they weren't kidding, it was delicious! The atmosphere was nice, not trying too hard. Overall we really enjoyed ourselves and are glad we decided to try Lolita out of the strip of restaurants on the same block. Would probably go back again for a special occasion dinner!
