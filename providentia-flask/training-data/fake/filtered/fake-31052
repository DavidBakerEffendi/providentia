I love this place. My husband and I visit Prime 16 in Orange at least once a week. Everyone is very friendly and helpful from Jason our server to Lauren bartender extraordinaire. Our burgers are always cooked the way we ordered and the fries are tasty. The specialty desserts are excellent like the lemon blueberry cheesecake, yum! Give it try you will be glad and you did - I know your taste buds will thank you!!
