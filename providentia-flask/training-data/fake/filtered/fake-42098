Luzzos was/is good, nothing that I have not tasted before  Pizza was better than your average pizza shop We had the fresh Mozzarella pie .A little pricy though if you ask me, and the portions were kinda small, I mean $9.00 for 4 Rice balls that were the size of golf balls ?? WOW !! I  ordered Pasta Fazool, and they said that they were out of it ? How could you be out of it ?? You just make it like that it takes about 10 minutes to make , so I had the Ministrone  Soup which was kinda odd. I never had Ministrone like this before, im not saying that it wasnt good, just different. Service was pretty good though The interior of Luzzos is very nice , had a kinda authentic Italian feel to it. Would I come back ? ,,,,,, probably . I wanted to try it as I saw that they were featured on the show Brindiamo on ch 25 NYCTV .
