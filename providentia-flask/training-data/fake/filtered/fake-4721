We dine out frequently throughout the city and this is one of the best dining experiences we've had in years. From the best grilled octopus appetizer I've ever had to the excellent mixed grill of lamb chops, scallops, sausage and lobster tails among a wide selection of dinners and appetizers everything was cooked perfectly and tasted just as well. Add a creative wine list and excellent service with moderate pricing this charming, eclectic spot on the water is our new favorite place.
