This place is too trendy and overpriced for me. I also didn't like that the eating area was so close to where I was trying to order. The food was ok, but not worth the price or the wait.. I wouldn't go so far as to discourage others from going there, but bring your wallet and don't go if your in a hurry. And wear your armour, the cashier that was working the day I was there all but bit my head off because I didn't have my money ready. We will not be returning.
