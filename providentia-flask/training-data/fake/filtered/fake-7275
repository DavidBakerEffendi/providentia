A group of four of us were recommended. We all had steaks, one pepper steak, two steak frittes and one bar steak. The meat was poorly cooked, and tasteless. To their credit, they did not charge for the steaks. Cocktails were okay, but we had to send a Negroni back. lemon instead of orange. The Crete brûlée was superb. The goat cheese and caramelised onions tarte was beautiful. Would we come back. Yes, to look at the ceiling and toilets. To eat, no.
