Excellent pizza.  Don't do the tourist thing and get it piled with toppings.  Keep it simple.  At the most either pepperoni or mushrooms.  Don't over do it, or the flavor of the pizza itself gets lots in all these ingredients.  If you go during lunch time on weekday, line is shorter.  Usually 10-15min wait.  Oh, and don't rush it.  Enjoy every moment of this fine pizza when eating.  And ONLY EAT IN.  It just doesn't taste the same when you get it to go.
