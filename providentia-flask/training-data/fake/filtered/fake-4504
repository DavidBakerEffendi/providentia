Ive been to Cantina a few times and I cant stop going back. The crowd is always awesome and lively. Food is decent and service is great. Bartenders and servers are very sociable and there is always people there and never a dull moment. Also the location is great right on the heart of Passyunk. I definitely recommend the margarita pitchers and tacos.
