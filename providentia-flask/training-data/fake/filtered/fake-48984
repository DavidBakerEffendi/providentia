I can't. I can't. Eating here changed my life. I got the daily special chicken (spicy honey drizzled!) with Rosemary and mushroom waffles... And they served it with 3 different types of butter. And the food was HEAVEN. One of my favorite meals I've ever had in NY. Also the Lemon Meringue pie in a jar killed me. It was quite possibly the best dessert I've ever eaten. Go here. EAT HERE. Such a fun energy, a very friendly staff (Jair was our waiter and he was SO helpful and personable). I'm definitely going to become a regular here!
