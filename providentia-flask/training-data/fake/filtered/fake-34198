Maitre D refused to believe I had a reservation for lunchtime -- and kept interrupting me as I tried to give the name of the party I was there to meet. He and his asstant tried to get me to leave twice and would not let me finish my sentence to say who I was there to meet. They then asked me if "I were sure" I had a reservation. I was in business attire and there for a late lunch business meeting. It was busy but not over-run. I have never had such a rude interaction in a restaurant in my entire life. The sushi was fresh, portions small and the slew of wait staff, while much better than maitre d, were intrusive and did constantly interrupt the flow of conversation. I am from the West Coast and used to fresh sushi, so am not willing to put up with this attitude for some fresh fish. I was wondering if they are chauvinistic towards women. There were two women behind me without reservations who only got slightly better treatment. When the Maitre D finally looked up my reservation, I was only able to say my party's first name -- then I got cut off and was then told there was no reservation under that name. I finally blurted out my party's last name, had to spell it for them, and they finally found the reservation. When I was finally shown to the table, they did not hang my coat, even though most of the other patrons were offered this option. As I said, I was there for a business meeting and had such a bad reception by the Maitre D and his assistant who was there to "greet" guests and look up reservations that I will never return again.
