Bluebird is consistently wonderful. We come here pretty regularly and have never had an issue with service or our food. Dishes are consistently delicious and I love the seasonal menu changes. The Thursday night $1.50 oysters are a great deal and prepared expertly - best oysters in town in my opinion.
