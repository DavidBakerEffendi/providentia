What not to like? only maybe that they don`t deliver? Otherwise, as a vegetarian i rarely get satisfied with food at the places which are not vegetarian orientated, but here i found my fav veggie burger, it is juicy, it is a little spicy, just enough plus Yuca fries, yummy! I love even the buns that they use while i usually prefer not to eat buns at all. Desert section, tried it all, but of course, chocolate souffle is a winner. The salad with pomegranate seeds is delicious, we always order bacon on the side, so i can share it with my bf.
