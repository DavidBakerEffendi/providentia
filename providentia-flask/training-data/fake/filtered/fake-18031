I went there and I was impressed with the welcoming staff and intimate decor. To emphasize the brindle theme the walls were adorned with great photos of... You guessed it brindle dogs, but I digress. They had a cool selection of tunes. My date almost broke off into her own karaoke to Lisa Lisa & The Cult Jam's "Head 2 Toe"... To the food... The baked oysters were the best appetizers I've eaten in quite a while The potted shrimp were surprisingly succulent, because on initial inspection they looked a little well-done. The seared cod was a winner. But the best deal of the night were the $10 pitchers of "sparkling" sangria. Â  The only dish that kept this place from 5 stars was the chicken fried steak... It was tougher than the LSAT
