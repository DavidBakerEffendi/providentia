We dined last eventing at your steakhouse.  We were very pleased and happy with our server, Monique.  She was most attentive and pleasant.  However, your Manager, Helen, went well beyond her duties.  She came over several times to our table, was most attentive and really was a pleasure to meet.  It was our 47th Anniversary and she made it extra special for us.  Also upon exiting the waitress at the doors wished us a Happy Anniversary.  It made our special day, even more special.  We will certainly be coming back.  The food was outstanding and delicious.  We will be certainly telling all of our friends and family what a great experience we had at your restaurant. Please pass this along to headquarters.  I tried to do the survey, but was unable since I did not have the code from the bill.  In this day of busy lives, it was great to have you share in this special day with us.  Your company is lucky to have such a great staff.....Helen, you were the best. Tony and Eileen
