The atmosphere is very pleasant from the cafe's coffee bar, through the eating area, right on outside to the side patio for outdoor eating. Â The omelette's are absolutely delicious and filling.. The absolute stand alone for me is the coffee, as it is the best coffee i have tasted in a long time..Dinner Specials every night except Sundays and Mondays. Immaculate and well organized. Free Wifi awesome for studies or business, all around awesome place...BYOB
