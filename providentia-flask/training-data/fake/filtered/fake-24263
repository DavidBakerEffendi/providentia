For the past couple of months, the delivery service of Ngam has consistently been appalling - waiting for over an hour and a half for an order that arrives cold is just unacceptable when using a delivery website service. Obviously, Ngam can't keep up with orders, and doesn't intend to expand on their staff to meet demand. On top of that, they lie when called about orders, which is also totally unacceptable. When I order my dinner at 8:30, I expect to have finished eating before 10:00 (especially when told at time of order, that it would take 20mn...). Except that with Ngam, at 10:00 you still haven't received your dinner. Just lame, and I will never order from them again. Really disappointing, and too expensive for cold food I don't really feel like eating anymore anyway when it finally arrives! This is just sad - the food is excellent, and service used to be great. I guess they are being a victim of their own success, but in a city where good food and great service abound, this is just not ok. Especially when this happens EVERY time one orders, over a period of a few weeks.
