I am very particular about the food I eat and do not frequent bbq resterants so I was a bit sceptical at first but  I have to say that I really enjoyed it!  The ribs were delicious- I had baby back ribs and the three cheese macaroni was very good.   A few things need to be finished as far as decor goes- ie painting and the bathrooms-  but I guess this is not a fine dining resterant either and I may be being critical here.   However the decor is really fun and there are some unusual things in the resterant that is worth a visit- the building is old and had been done up nicely without losing it;s feel.
