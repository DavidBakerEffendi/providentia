Atmosphere is nice, and CHurch Street is always interesting, but I have a problem with paying premium prices for "French" pastries that ARE NOT EVEN MADE IN HOUSE!  Petit Parisien has all of its pastries, macroons, etc. shipped in from an outside source.  Although the food isn't awful, you can definitely tell that some of the pastries are not as fresh as they could be/should be if they were baked in-house.
