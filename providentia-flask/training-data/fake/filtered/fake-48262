My husband and I were visiting around the area and stumbled upon a long line outside this place.  Whenever there's a line, you know the place won't disappoint! and we were right!  the pomme frites were yummy, especially when dipped in their variety of sauces.  we had such a wonderful experience trying out a bunch of different sauces along with a generous amount of fries for free.  We couldn't even finish half of our order because we got full from the free ones!  The mango sauce as well as the curry one were our favorites.  we would definitely love to come back again whenever we're in NY.
