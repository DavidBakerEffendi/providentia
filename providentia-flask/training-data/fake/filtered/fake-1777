I went last night to celebrate a special birthday. The food is amazing! It is so terrific that the servers are so knowledgeable about the items on the menu, how they are prepared, and even where they are from. The service was great and casual and friendly which I love. Everyone seemed concerned about our dining experience. I was impressed that in a busy restaurant, we could hear that there were people next to us, but not what they were saying. Even the large table seated near us I didn't hear. Â Usually, that evokes a groan from me. Thank you Talula's for a special birthday night.
