This place is excellent - the food was superb, and much of it locally sourced which is great.  They have some unique items on the drink menu and a decent beer selection as well.  Our server was great, very knowledgeable about the menu and attentive.  We had some drinks, the duck and the salmon, all of which were amazing.  I will definitely be going back, especially to try and catch one of their bluegrass nights on Sundays.
