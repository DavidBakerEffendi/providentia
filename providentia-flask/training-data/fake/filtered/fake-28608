Solid local non-touristy hangout at the Seaport. Food is always good, especially the burgers, ribs and wings. Last time I was there, I tried the oysters and they were very fresh and tasty. Great service and relaxed atmosphere, and significantly less expensive than the other bars/restaurants in the area. You can also watch any NFL game on Sundays (a big draw for me).
