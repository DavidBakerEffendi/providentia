I went for restaurant week last year. Did the pre-fixed menu, with the add an extra course for $10 or so. It was so good! I loved the sampler they started with, as I love bread and love dipping bread into everything possible. Then we had some meatballs, goats milk ravioli, some other pasta and I had a lamb shank. Everything was pretty good and love that we sat downstairs in the basement because it was away from everyone waiting around in random places upstairs. I skimmed through the regular menu while we were waiting for service (which was slow to start but I think it was because it was RW) and the prices looked decent and there were dozens of things I wouldn't mind trying if we weren't already involved in this intense 5 course meal! Had a great experience. Would have been better if it was just my friend and I but we invited another, so we could order all three choices on the pre-fix and be able to try everything they had to order. I guess that's kind of fat of us to do but hey, we didn't want to miss out!! I will def be going back next time I'm in the area!
