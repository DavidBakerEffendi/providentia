This place gets two stars for the decor, but the food was awful. I grew up on baccala-this was some scary version of it. A lot of potato, some garlic and almost no fish. You could call it cod-flavored mashed potatoes. yuck. Beans were underwhelming, bread tasted stale, coffee was undrinkable(and why?! I just love the java at milk bar). Plus .50 for refills is just tacky. EIther serve normal size coffee and charge for each cup, or offer different sizes. Every new place needs to work out the kinks. Lets hope these guys are paying attention. I will check back.
