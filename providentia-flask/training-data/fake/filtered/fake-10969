I have to completely disagree with the last review. I had to go to a week long seminar at 300 George Street and found the most wonderful eatery tucked inside.  The staff is very nice, and helpful with suggestions. The food was AMAZING to say the least. My first order was for a Taco Bowl Salad, which was made from the finest ingredients, the savory flavor and aroma are still fresh in my mind.  I was so happy with my first days choice, I was eager to go back the next day. This time I ordered Breakfast & Lunch. I certainly cannot agree that anything tasted GROSS but the exact opposite, everything was hot and extremly fresh tasting. If downtown you must try the pancakes topped w/ fresh fruit, or one of the special sandwiches posted on the chalk boards upfront, there are many to choose from so making a choice isnt always easy. But I bet your going to like them all. They even have vegetarian choices. So I say stop on by Cafe George downtown New Haven, I know I will!!!
