Just another ersatz Brooklyn restaurant, right down to the fake distressed exposed brick wall with a faded sign for a business that never existed, olde-timey lights and reclaimed wood. 30 beers on tap means nothing when more than half are mass market swill. And even though they've been open for maybe a few weeks they really need to clean their tap lines, because my Sweet Action (another quibble: they're inconsistent on their beer menu, some are identified by brewer, some by beer name, but never both. That alone speaks volumes about how much they know about what they're doing.)  tasted so terribly skunked that I couldn't even finish it. And then, after everything else, the beer is overpriced. Then there's the food. Pouring more oil and butter won't fix uninspired food. I split  "poutine" (it's not poutine if there's anything more than gravy and cheese curds on the fries) and a burger with my other and if not for the lead weight in my stomach, I would've forgotten that I ate it by the time I finished. And again, overpirced. The vibe is all over the place. The owner (I think?) kept hovering around the restaurant and for a little while was trying to drag customers in from the street, which was... weird. The crowd skews old and B&T. The gigantic tv was set to the weather channel. Go anywhere else.
