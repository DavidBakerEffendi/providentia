Was visiting from NYC and had a pretty good time here even though our first impressions of the place were NOT good. First off, the tall blonde hostess in the front is a BITCH and she's rude to customers. We were not the only people she was nasty too because we heard other people talking about how nasty her attitude is. It started when she asked us if we wanted to sit in the very front of the restaurant and we said yes but then quickly changed our minds when we saw that it was probably the worst seat in the house. So she was mad she had to re-enter our telephone number in her computer and I suppose we are not allowed to change our minds at all because punching in 10 numbers into a computer screen really is a hard task for her. She also made us wait and sat everyone who came in after us first I guess to "teach us a lesson" for changing our minds about not wanted to sit up front in the worst seat in the house. After dealing with her awkward bitchy attitude we had a great experience. The short latina girl who seated us was very nice & our waiter was great! The food and drinks were pretty good as well. It was my first time in Philly and while we were there this was the only place we went to where we were treated rudely(by the blonde hostess). Might be back but I'm sure there are better restaurants around the city that I would like to explore if I ever make it back.
