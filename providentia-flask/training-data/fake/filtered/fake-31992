Great ribs and pulled pork and decent brisket.  Probably the best ribs I've eaten in a restaurant.  Service is good.  Wine list is as poor as the food is good.  They're missing a trick on that one.  We would have drunk much more wine if we'd been able to find a decent bottle.   Homemade pies for dessert were also very good. I'd definitely go back - as would every member of our party of seven. David G
