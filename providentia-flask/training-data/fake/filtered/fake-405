Planned a trip with my family in July because I wanted to taste an authentic Philly cheesesteak.  8 of us split up between Geno's & Pat's.  I was at Geno's and the guy accused me of being a "napkin stealer" because he saw me get napkins from his place and I was wiping off my brother-in-laws leg who had just come from Pat's.  So I said to the guy I with them meaning the rest of our group who was a Geno's and he just gave me a look.  Their steaks were alright could have used more meat on them.  I've had better in Jersey!!
