BLUEBERRY PANCAKES! Hands down, best from a restaurant ever! I have a friend that makes better ones, but you can't just walk up to her everyday and ask her to make them on demand! Don't get a sandwich, don't get their overpriced slices of pies, get the BLUEBERRY PANCAKES. Comes with this maple, butter syrup. I'm salivating just thinking of this goodness. If you don't want to wait 2 hours, forget coming on the weekend, and don't bring a large party to this limited seating establishment. Come on a non-holiday weekday, bring cash (no credit accepted) and make sure your entire party is present to be seated. Oh, want their recipe for these amazing BLUEBERRY PANCAKES? They have a freaking recipe book! Here's the recipe (the secret is folding in egg whites and milk!): leitesculinaria.com/6916â€¦ Yummers! Get the BLUEBERRY PANCAKES!!!!
