I was hoping to be wowed.... sadly I was not!! The first time we had the lunch special which seemed a decent value for 10$. I ordered the Goan Fish dish and it was clear that the chef has never eaten Goan food, the curry was so far off it would make Chef Cardoz cringe. The food is very heavily laden with spice and fat and perhaps to some, is what exemplifies (British) Indian food. The second time I ordered a mildly spiced Chicken Dhansak for dinner. This dish priced at a whopping18$ consisted of 6 pieces of chicken breast boiled in the lentil dish (that I ate the previous visit) called Dhal Tadka. Unbelievable that they think this would go unnoticed. Jahangir Mehta- HELP!!! The Chicken tikka masala tasted like it was made with Campbells tomato soup. Why is it so hard to find decent indian food??? This place may stay in business for the only reason that the other Indian restaurants around are just so poorly run.
