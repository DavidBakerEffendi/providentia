I just finished a family meal at Cafe Mulino.  The meal was the best I've had!  The owners made it a point to come to our table to welcome us and do did the chef! I had a hard time selecting from the three specials, but finally decided on the lobster ravioli. It was delicious! The fireplace was roaring, the wine was flowing, and the place was packed. I recommend Cafe Mulino for dates, families, and anyone looking for a good meal at a good price.
