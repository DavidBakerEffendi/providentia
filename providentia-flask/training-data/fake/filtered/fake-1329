It's refreshing to be able to go to a sandwich shop free from the corporate feel of a Subway or Au Bon Pain. The sandwich that I ate, the Italian Stallion, was incredible. The size of the sandwich was perfect at just over 9 inches. The bread was fresh. Their homemade spicy mayo sauce that they had was such a great compliment, and the meat itself was fresh and tasted as it would in an Italian Trattoria in Rome. Outside of how delicious the sandwich was, I was pleasantly surprised by how affordable it was. The shop was clean, the tables were original and the staff were very nice. Â You could really tell that everyone there was invested in the happiness of the customers and the success of the establishment, unlike corporate sandwich shops I know. I hope Matt & Marie's franchises in New York!
