In a town where there seems to be a pizza restaurant every 20 feet, Vinnie's stands alone.  This place has by far the best Margerita pizza in the area, and each day offers a variety of specials. The decor is nice, and they always seem to deliver in a timely fashion.  Best meatballs and sauce in Boonton!  Give them a shot, and I can guarantee you that you won't be disappointed with anything you order.
