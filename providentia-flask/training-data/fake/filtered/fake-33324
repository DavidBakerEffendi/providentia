For years my mom and I have searched for the best Vietnamese restaurant in Chinatown and after coming here, it's safe to say we found it. No matter what you order it is always delicious and the service is super fast! I highly recommend the Shrimp with Ginger and Scallion- absolutely delicious!! The Pho is incredible as well! The restaurant itself is also super clean and beautifully decorated, which definitely adds to the experience. The waitstaff is very friendly and quick to help you when needed. What's more? You feel good after eating the food! If you're ever in town, I highly recommend Pho Vietnam!
