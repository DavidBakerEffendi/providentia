I was online going through the menu.  I called for takeout using the menu online. Ordering three salads became a real problem.  The website says that they have pita with the salads.  Fine.  When I was told I would need to pay additional for pita, I said that is not what the website says.  The manager didn't care what it says online.  They don't care to honor what they write.  Too bad.  I can't be bothered with businesses that don't stand behind their own statements.
