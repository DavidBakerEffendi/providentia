Go there for the pizza. Obviously. This is the best pizza I've ever had and as an Italian girl who has been eating New York pizza for decades, it beats every other one. Yes, the service is slow and there is a substantial wait, however when was the last time you went to a pizza parlor for exceptional service? That's mind-numbing. You frequent the pizza place deemed best in New York for one reason: the pizza. AND THIS PLACE DOESN'T DISAPPOINT! The crust is slightly chewy with pockets of crisp. The cheese is melted so it's stringy, but not rubbery and the toppings are fresh. We ordered sundried tomato and basil and were floored with how every bite was better than the last. The real secret is the sauce. I'm not sure why it's so good, but it's not too salty, not too acidic yet leaves a perfect balanced taste in your mouth. Unfortunately, there is a wait so I'm not visiting Grimaldi's often, but I'll be craving it every day until the next time I do. Clearly, anyone who knows good pizza and has eaten at Grimaldi's knows it's the best they'll have in NYC.
