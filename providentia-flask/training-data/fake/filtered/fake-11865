Definitely one of the best food trucks that I have had.  The main thing about food trucks is the price point, and then you are left thinking what kind of quality of food you could be getting for the price.   This is not your typical Chicken/Gyro Combo and rice truck/stand.  For $6 I got the Combo platter.  The chicken is not butchered like other street meat carts. The pieces of chicken were actually identifiable as chicken and not just scrap meat. You could taste the quality in the marinade as well. Next the judgement on the yogurt/cucumber sauce.  This is LEGIT sauce.  You can taste the freshness and quality of ingredients that went into making this sauce.  It's all about the tartness and the consistency that has me giving this place two thumbs up.  As with any sauce, it should not overpower or mask the flavor of the food, but provide and complimentary flavor enhancing profile to the main star of the show.  No complaints on the rice either.  This place is a must go.
