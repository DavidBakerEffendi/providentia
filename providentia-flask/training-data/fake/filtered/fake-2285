i would come back and get it if they line is reasonable and the weather is good. their white sauce is definitely different from the other place i've tried. i think i taste creme cheese in addition to mayo. the red sauce is HOT!!! everyone already mentioned the portion size being big enough to split with another friend. lemonade stand nearby when we went. definitely needed to counteract the spicy red sauce.
