I am kind of obsessed with this place.  They started out a little shaky at first interior-wise and food-wise... things always seemed to be changing like they weren't sure what they wanted it to be.  But I believe that they've really gotten into their stride.  The menu is awesome with great meat, seafood and vegetarian options, the flavors of the food are bright and explosive and satisfying, and it's so adorable and pleasant in there.  The service is always nice and not overbearing.  And oh man their desserts are amazing.  I recommend this place to everyone.
