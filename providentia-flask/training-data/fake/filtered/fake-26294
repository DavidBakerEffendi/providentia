Joe's is the best restaurant in New Jersey.  The deli is equally outstanding, and the catered food is awesome.  It's my favorite place to eat.  The food is only surpassed by the outstanding level of service provided by the owners and all who work there.  It's the best place ever.  Try it and you will agree :)
