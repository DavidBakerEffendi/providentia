It actually pains me to write this review and only give it 3 stars because this actually is one of my favorite places in the city and i constantly find myself recommending it to people. The Cons -- Number 1 is the service. The waiters (on like 5 out of the 6 times I have been) either make you feel stupid or are just rude, and some forgetful. I really don't know where they get these people from because it is no secret that they have bad service. The fact that it has been over a yr and half (why I still go I dont know) and this is still a problem is beyond me.......... FYI they only accept cash and amex and to me that is a bit of a con. Also watch yourself bc the bill will add up pretty fast! The Pros -- Number 1 is the atmosphere...what a CUTE place!! Its at the bottom of a town home and with dim lights, relaxed. yet trendy feel. Great ambiance..great place for a date or for a small group. Â My favorite table is the one in the back of the restaurant in front of the fire. Also of course the food is delicious...every now and then you get a tapa that is OK but for the most part they are great! My favorite (like many others) is the brussel sprouts...LOVE the apples. I also liked this salad with arugula and dill which they used to have but i think too off the menu.... (bring it back!!). My friend really enjoyed her lamb meatballs, other friend loved the gnocchi and said it tasted homemade. They changed up the bruschetta (fig) and i don't really like it...it also has a burnt taste to it (which is not a fluke..its supposed to be like that). Boyfriend enjoyed the steak and it was a decent amount for a tapa... They are famous for their sangria ..which clearly has liqueur in it... be warned..one glass can do you in. I prefer the red to the white but both are good (not my favorite though...that would have to be Barmarche ...best sangria hands down!)
