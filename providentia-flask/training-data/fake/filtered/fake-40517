AMAZING Paris Inn THE 'BEST" !! I can't say enough great things about Paris Inn for my husband 50TH birthday. Starting off with the planning process, they are so attentive and helpful (and patient) I drove myself crazy cannot imagine how they dealt with me! Stephanie helped me plan everything from the food to the floor plan to the overall flow of my day. The day of the party went so smooth with Tony and his father making sure that everything was falling into place and that we were relaxed and having the fun. Now onto the food...INCREDIBLE!! I really wanted to provide our guests with a delicious culinary experience and Paris Inn delivered that above and beyond. We got countless compliments on the food AND service staff. Everything was perfect. I don't know how they did it, but they did. So impressed and happy, Paris family, Pepe and I have been your happy customers for long time and plan to be with you 4EVER Thank you!!! Aleksandra and Pepe Chico Sept 2013
