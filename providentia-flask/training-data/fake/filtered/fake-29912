I grew up going to Wilson's. Over time the quality of food and service has decreased significantly. My grandmother, mom and I sat down to eat a small cheese, steak grinder, french fries and wings. My mom went to the bathroom and noticed that it was not clean and very untidy. When our food was ready, my mom asked for a flimsy big paper plate so she did not have to eat all her food on a small paper plate that they had given. The guy at the front told her that she could not have a larger PAPER PLATE (mind you the plate that was given to her couldn't even fit a slice of pizza securely on the plate) My mom was very disappointed that they would not give her a paper plate to comfortably eat her dinner that she graciously paid for. Â Back in the day, this would of never happened. What ever happened to that nice lady that would take your order? They also do not take credit cards, only cash....I think it is time to find another establishment that caters to its customers and gives them a large paper plate to eat their food. The food was ok
