As many have said before, the food is great but the service is really awful. Went for dinner tonight - our 5th time there - the waiter was far more interested in interacting with his coworkers than with us. It was rather early so there was not a lot of competition for attention from the waiter. Still I had to holler at him to get refills on wine several times. Then we ordered desert and coffee from a young woman who seemed a lot more attentive. But we waited...and we waited...and we waited...after about 20 minutes during which our waiter never even looked in our direction, she came by and said there was a mix up in the kitchen and the desert we ordered was no longer available...at about 6:30 pm. How can you be out of a desert that's on the menu at 6:30 pm??? So we ordered a different desert and she said it would be on the house. The desert was great as was the dinner. After I had to run down the waiter to get the check, we discovered that the desert was not comped but instead one glass of wine was. We were not interested in getting into an argument so we just paid the check with a low ball tip and left. Whoever manages this place, if there even is a manager, ought to take a long hard look at the waitstaff and make some decisions. Are they there to entertain themselves or to provide a pleasant experience to the paying customers.
