I was supposed to meet a friend here for brunch but ultimately she couldn't make it and since I was already in the neighborhood I decided to give this place a try anyway because my friend had been raving about it. Overall, Meh. I guess my expectations were too high. Got the Arepas Benedictos with Salmon. Boy I really had to look for that salmon in these benedicts. The hollandaise sauce wasn't creamy and I found the home fries to be a bit bland. But I did get churros for desert and these churros ohh these churros were probably the best damn churros I've ever had. Will definitely go back for churros but will probably skip the brunch menu.
