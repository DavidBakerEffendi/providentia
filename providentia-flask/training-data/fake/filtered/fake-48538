I'm not sure how much I would love this place if I ate there when I was sober (I'd probably love it even more than I do now), but I stumbled over to this place after seeing my friend in a play, then getting some drinks together. I got a "wiz wit" and it was simply phenomenal. He got the pizza fries which were flavorful as well. Pats is a great place, the service may poke fun at you in the wee hours of the morning, don't take it personally. If you play along with them and laugh with them, they will love you forever. And isn't that classic Philadelphian? No culture lost here, and thank God. Prices were a bit high ($8.15 for a half wiz wit) but altogether worth every penny.
