Because of its convenient location off Rt 46, I used to visit this restaurant about a dozen times a year with family or co-workers.  I often struggled with the mediocre food, but kept going back anyway.  It wasn't until my experience a few weeks ago that I decided I will take my dozen visits elsewhere. My wife and I went in for dinner late on a Friday evening.  There were was no wait and there were several open tables.  Neither my wife or I was sure what we were in the mood for.  Rather than limit ourselves to an entree, we decided to order several appetizers.  We asked the waitress if she thought it was enough food for us and she said "plenty".  We decided we would simply order another if we were still hungry. A few minutes later, the waitress returned and said that "they" had informed her that we must order an entree.  Are you kidding me?  This is how you treat your frequent patrons...even when you have open tables?  We were shocked and the waitress was mortified (rightly so).  Although we were dying to order the cheapest pasta dishes on the menu just to prove a point, we simply changed to a standard order.  As anticipated....the entrees were mediocre.   Despite the convenient location, we will never go back to Nicola's.    While we can put up with average food, we can not tolerate poor customer service.  Oh..and..by the way...the grand total difference between our revised order and the original...a whopping $9.00.  You have to question an establishment that is willing to lose frequent patrons by trying to squeeze another couple of bucks out of them!   My advice....go up the street to Porcini.  They understand how to treat their customers and the food is excellent!
