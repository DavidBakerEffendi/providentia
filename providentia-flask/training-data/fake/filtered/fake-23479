Good food, great pizza, and moderate prices keep Lui Lui a true favorite in the Upper Valley.  I'm generally tired of pizze, but Lui Lui's  pizza from the wood-fired oven reminds me how good pizza can be!  If you come at mealtime, you are likely to wait, which is the only reason I didn't give this long-time favorite five stars.  Fun with a group, good choices of food for families.  A bright, fairly noisy atmosphere.
