Had my birthday dinner here Tuesday night with my daughter  - thank you for opeing in time!!!  Eryn and the entire staff were amazing - as was the food and decor and atmosphere and wine list - just a perfect dning experience.  Every bite was delicious and full of the best flavors - the sliders were our favorite - along with the gigante beans - and the octopus  - and the paella  - and the tahini ice cream - get the idea?  Can't wait to go back.  great job Chef!
