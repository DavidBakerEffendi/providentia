This place is one of my favs and the atmosphere is cozy. My boyfriend and I think it has the best hamburger in the neighborhood. I really enjoy the french toast here as well. It's a bit difficult to eat brunch here on a weekend though if you are looking for that because it tends to get packed around noon. However, they tend to open earlier for brunch than other places in the neighborhood so if you go early should be ok. My boyfriend likes the croque de madame, but I haven't had it. The crepes are excellent and that's kind of what they are known for.
