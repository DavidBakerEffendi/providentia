Having had brunch here a few times I felt I should try Sunshine for dinner and see how things are after dark! First off the space looks amazing. The wooden slats above the bar make for a nice glow. The music was perfect for the environment. We had the lamb belly, carrots and clams to share. For mains we had the skirt steak, duck and sea bass. Great quality dishes! At a glance plate sizes seem small yet upon finishing we all seem perfectly satisfied. Through in a few cocktails from behind the bar and I have to say it was a great first dinner experience! Brunch or dinner I recommend sunshine to all!
