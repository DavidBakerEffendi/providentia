I love this place!  I come here every time when I'm in the city.  The food is superb and prices are unmatched.  Here, you don't have to sacrifice quality for quantity - you can have both.  I get the pork and chive dumpling (5 for $1) and the duck sesame pancake (so much better than the regular sesame pancake - $1.75, I think).  The pork and chive dumplings are made fresh daily and are stuffed with perfectly seasoned pork.  They're crispy and warm and probably the best dumpling anywhere; even better than China (since Chinese food products these days are so questionable, at least you know that the ingredients come from a safe source).  The duck sesame pancake is stuffed with duck meat and picked carrots and daikon - great contrast of flavors.   This place is wonderful.  The only thing missing is great service.  The cashier guy's English is incredibly difficult to understand (I guess it's part of the charm, or whatever) and sometimes you have to repeat your order several times.  There's like four seats in the restaurant and always a long line outside.  Sometimes, a simple order can take 20+ minutes.  Or if you're luck, can take 20 seconds.   The positives, however, completely outweigh the negatives.   Everyone should eat here at least once.
