i've read some good reviews but for those loooking for a true culinary experience WATCH OUT! a caesar salad made from pre-cut, bagged romaine for $12 then a "pork" parmigiano made with processed ham for $22! smothered in canned tomato. maybe if you're with a bunch of good friends and already drunk but Â a serious offense to those looking for a good meal you've got thousands of better options. i forgot the wine. they've got got an impressive wine list (if true) but the wines by the glass are strictly olive garden. actually everything is except the reputation
