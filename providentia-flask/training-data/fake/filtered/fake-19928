I held my husband's 40th birthday dinner here.  The co-owner worked with me to come up with the perfect menu.  They were flexible and accommodating and the prices were more than fair.  The night of the party the staff was wonderful, the food delicious - - they did everything in their power to make it the perfect evening.  This is a popular restaurant and they don't need to go above-and-beyond to fill their seats -   the fact that they do makes them even better.  I'm sure we'll be back soon and often - I'm already craving the schnitzel.
