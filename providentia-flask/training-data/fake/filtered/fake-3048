Saw this was one of the diners visited by Guy Fieri on DDD, and must admit, I was disappointed. I ordered a black jack burger (Cajun spice rub + jack cheese + onions), and it was completely flavorless. I honestly think they forgot to season the burger completely. On the plus side, we ordered a short stack of pancakes for my son, and they were awesome. Also, the wife had onion soup, which was also good, as were my onion rings. Â The service was fine, but not special. To the diners' advantage, the place was nearly empty, so it's not like they were occupied. --E Overall, I don't think I'll be coming here again.
