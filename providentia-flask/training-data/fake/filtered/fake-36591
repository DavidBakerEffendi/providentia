HORRIBLE. The waitress was very friendly but smelled like she hadn't brushed her teeth in months which isnt very good while you are eating. They are way too expensive for a diner. My husband and I had onion rings Half of them were frozen onion rings the other half were real onion rings but you couldn't even bite through them. The staff hovers over you like you are going to rob them. Definitely will not be going back.
