I had a steak burrito a few days ago. It was kind of bland, probably because I didn't have hot sauce in it. So I'll have to try it again and then write another review. BUT the steak was well cooked and completely amazingly tasteful. The price is close to Chipotle's. The burrito was $8. Even if you go there immensely hungry, you are sure to feel not full but satisfied. I personally favor Chipotle's. But the steak at Dos Torros is really good. My friend who hates burritos really loved Dos Torros, so I think it's really up to the individual. *The staff are very friendly and nice to you. There are always a line there, especially at night so be ready to wait at least 12-15 minutes in line. I wish I had given them a tip or something, but it was late and I was trying to get to my apartment.
