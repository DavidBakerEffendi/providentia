This was my first visit to a Brazilian Steakhouse, and I have one word to describe it - PHENOMENAL. The selection and quality of the meats are first class, the service is amazing, the wine selection top notch, and the surroundings impeccable. It's a hoot watching all the waiters running around to get the meat to your plate hot and juicy, and no request goes unheaded. Best to just pick at the salad bar, forget about dessert, and come hungry! It really is a great dining experience.
