I just moved here from Seattle and was having a lot of anxiety about finding a good pho spot since I had about 10 solid options within a 15 walk back home. This was only my third spot to try in Philly, but was seriously way above the other two, one being Pho Xe Lua Viet Thai. They were pretty good as far as what they put in their seafood pho, but not their broth. Nam Phuong's broth was hearty and and sweet and they had shrimp, mussels, fake crab and squid. I would Â have been super stoked if they would put some veggies in their seafood pho as well. My friend got the vegetarian pho which was great as well. It has an actual veggie pho (which is often difficult to find) and was full of yummy vieggies. The broth was light and healthy. Service was great as well, very friendly and got us in immediately on a busy Friday night. I'll be trying other places in Philly, but for now, this is definitely going to be my pho home away from home!
