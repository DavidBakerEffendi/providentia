Greater than 20 visits over ten years.  Once our pizzeria of choice, then something happened 2 to 3 years ago.  No more buffalo mozzarella, prices rising, unbelievable lines, decor changes with giant portraits of the (former?) owner -- seems like they had shifted or changed ownership.  We stopped going.  The double decker buses point it out as an original, but as many know this is a contentious topic in pizza hungry New York!
