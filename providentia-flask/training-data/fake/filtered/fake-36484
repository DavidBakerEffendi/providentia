Great atmosphere, good wines. The dish that standed out was the raw snapper in a ceviche style. So refined! The other dishes: the goat cheese croquetas, the bone marrow, the architchoke with mint were good like a B+. The deserts were nice: we took the creme brulee & the orange bread pudding. Also the great thing about this place is that the kitchen closes late. 12 am on Friday night. Also very convenient, their Â "Bar jamon". Just next door, you can go have a glass of wine while you are waiting to be seated (we waited 20 minutes.) Good wine selection and a cosy atmosphere also. Good place to bring a date.
