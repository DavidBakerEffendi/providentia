-Onion Soup Gratinee (Great) -Balthazar Salad (Excellent) -Steak Frites (Great) -Pumpkin Ravioli (Good) -Breakfast (Okay) Balthazar never, ever disappoints.  It's not the food, but the atmosphere that brings me back each time.  A great place to bring friends visiting the city, or just to eat casually at the bar.  I always feel so energized leaving Balthazar, and every experience is memorable.
