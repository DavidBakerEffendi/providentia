Absolutely outstanding. Truly what any restaurant should aspire to be like. The cuisine is so unique, unlike anything in the area. All dishes are made with the freshest ingredients and full of mouth-watering flavors. The service is really what won me over though. They provide a gluten-free and paleo menu with full knowledge and understanding of the lifestyle, and truly cater specifically to your needs. Everything on the g-free menu is made with different cookware and fresh ingredients. The woman/owner truly knows what she's talking about, and was so kind, friendly, and helpful. She truly provided such a unique experience. Not to mention, GUILT FREE, HOMEMADE DESSERTS. They left me drooling. Fantastic people, great environment, delicious food. You really can't go wrong.
