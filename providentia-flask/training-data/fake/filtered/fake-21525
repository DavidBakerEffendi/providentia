IN the past 35 years I have had more meals in France than Brooklyn. So what a great pleasure when daughter, Brooklyn resident of 15 years took us there last week, to satisfy our need for French food, esp after 2 weeks in Brittany this summer. Great French bistro, authentic country SW France , not over fancy. Good service relaxing atmosphere and the prices most reasonable. Value for price super high. And we are from a foodie town, Portland Maine w/ some v good French spots. A jewel as another reviewer said
