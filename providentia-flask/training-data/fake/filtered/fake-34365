Totally amazing food and a VERY welcome addition to the neighborhood. We went early tonight with our kids and the service couldn't have been better - friendly and casual, not too noisy. The combination platters allowed us to try all the vegetarian options, all of which are very tasty and unlike anything else you can get nearby. And while the prices might look a tad high, the quantity of food is large. We came home with enough leftovers for lunch for a couple days. Shake off the winter blues and get out and try it out!
