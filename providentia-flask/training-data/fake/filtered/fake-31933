Super brunch!!! Delicious eggs benedict with amazing hollandaise sauce. Also terrific Â eggs and bruchetta dish. The chef kicks the flavor with all of the dishes. We usually go for dinner which is always amazing, especially the crispy tuna appetizer, an all time favorite. The chefs do a great job here because the cuisine has so much flavor, and the food is consistently terrific, which is not an easy thing to achieve in the restaurant business. Always enjoy the mushroom risotto and the steak and seafood dishes too. We will be going back soon! Highly recommend it for diners who want to try cuisine with delicious flavor and variety....and the cool music always creates a great ambiance. Can't wait to take visiting friends and family to Ponty!
