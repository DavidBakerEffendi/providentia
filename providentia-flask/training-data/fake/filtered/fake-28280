I went to this establishment two days ago after yelping it. I went with a female friend of mine and was seated without incident. I will start with the food. The food is definitely 4 star worthy. We had the grilled octupus, which was grilled perfectly. The greek salad is huge and more than good enough as a salad choice. We also ordered the stuffed shrimp, because they were out of the stuffed sole. The crab stuffed shrimp were amazing. The food here is pretty good. On the other hand, the service leaves a lot to be desired. To be fair, the hostess was great, but there were two guys who I guess were waiters that basically stood 3-5 feet away from us pretty much the entire time we were there. They didn't say anything and just kept watching us as if they were fascinated or something. At first, I thought they were just looking to see if we enjoyed our food, but after about a hour, I was certain that was not the case. No other table had two waiters orbiting them the whole night either. It would have been great if they were both bringing us food, but it was another waiter that brought us the food- pretty weird. All in all, the food is 4 easy and the service is a two only because of the hostess' hospitality.
