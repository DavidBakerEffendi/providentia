Great ambiance--fairly romantic with the dim lighting and candles. They add a nice touch with posters of all of these different Broadway flops throughout the decades. They print their menus every day apparently and have varying specials. My friend had the meatloaf and I had the atlantic cod. My fish was fantastic--very buttery and flakey and light. My friend pretty much had nothing bad to say about their meatloaf. For dessert, I had the chocolate pudding cake and my friend had the apple crumble pie. First of all, the portions were huge! The pudding cake was incredibly moist and rich but most importantly, not too sweet. My friend couldn't finish her pie but it wasn't very syrupy, which is a plus in my book. The service was fantastic--she was attentive but not overly so, and she definitely understood that we were taking our time instead of rushing us out as fast as possible.
