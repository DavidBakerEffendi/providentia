I am a huge foodie and have lived and dined in NYC my whole life...when it comes to food, bars, or nightlife I really know my stuff. What else is there to do in NYC?? What do I have to say about Forno? WOW!!! This place is a pizzeria...but the food is better than 5 stars. They make their own bread, pasta, and cheese.... do I even have to continue? I have ate there so many times and have even used them to cater some events, and the ingredients are nothing but the freshest. The foccacia robeola pizza is something truly unique and out of this world....and their daily specials are to die for! I live in Brooklyn...the home of famous pizza, and I travel 20 minutes out of my way to eat at this place! Its great ingredients mixed with passion and love that makes every pizza and every dish so special. If you cant get your ass to italy... this is by far the closest you will get!
