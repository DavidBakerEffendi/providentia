Stumbled upon this restaurant on my way to home, and I must say it was the best decision. Delicious food, awesome service, clean place - A "rare" combo these days, especially if you visit an Indian Restaurant. A server was too nice to explain each and every dish and recommended Veg Kati Roll and Vada Pao on my first visit. Both the items were so tasty and fresh and that made me visit this place on a regular basis. A must visit place for Indian fast food lovers.
