Zahav- the zenith of delicious middle eastern food! My boyfriend and I did not make reservations in time, but we were able to get seats at the bar. The bartender (Luke) was delightful and gave good food recommendations when asked. Even when I had a drink spilled all over me, he was very accommodating-giving towels and making another drink for me. I think this was the first meal where we both pretty much polished off every plate for each course. The turkish hummus is the best, warm and served in a separate dish. The haloumi cheese mezze was delicious as usual, and we also enjoyed the mushroom konafi dish. As a vegetarian, I was pleased that the entree had more than one choice; per the bartender's recommendation I got the spiked eggplant which was amazing! My boyfriend had the merguez lamb and he loved it. For dessert we had the spiced peanut basboosa- the semolina cake was a bit dry, but the turkish coffee and praline peanut was amazing! My only complaint would be that it is a bit difficult to find parking. A must eat place for anyone who is visiting the Philadelphia area!
