The atmosphere and servers were very nice, however the food was not great, especially when you consider the prices. I ordered the fish and chips and it was very oily and tasteless. The Orecchiette's pesto sauce didn't have much taste either. I gave it a try, and I love supporting local restaurant and businesses, but unfortunately I won't be back here.
