Ok so this is my first YELP review and I have to say that I am so impressed with this place. A friend of mine introduced me when I came back into town after having moved to Arizona last year. I had this cravable drink that I have been searching for our here in AZ and contacted The Guild to ask for the recipe. Sean got back to me right away with the recipe (and the correct name...Maximilian Affair for anyone who likes habanero infused drinks!) and I just have to say that the combination of a cravable drink and impeccable service will lead me to their door every time I am in town!!
