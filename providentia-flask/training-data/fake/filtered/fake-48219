Frites just as I remember them in street stands in Bruxelles. Quick and to the point.. There are benches in back with slits into which one inserts the Frites Cones. I confess to a fascination with their machinery. I station myself in the back so I can hear the deskining machine and the chopper and see parts of them through the door. AS for the FRITURE, it goes without saying that its good. A regular cone is more than adequate.
