This place is the best! They give you top quality, huge rolls you can and you can eat as much as you want. You would never believe the quality of food! I have been to some of the best sushi places around and this place is right up there. You would never believe it's an all-you-can-eat restaurant! Everything is made to order, fresh and delicious! It is by far my favorite sushi restaurant in the world!!
