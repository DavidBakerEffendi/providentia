Went here for the Superbowl. The deal was $65 for all you can drink and appetizers during the game. While the beer selection was good, the staff attentive and good environment but here's the problems and why it gets 2 stars: - Appetizers were not that great. 2 pieces of grilled chicken on a stick, 2 TINY spring rolls, 2 wings, 2 coconut shrimp. With 6 guys at the table a plate was devoured in 2 seconds. - We only got 2 appetizer plates in first quarter of the game! After we complained they stepped it up and brought out more. - Every single appetizer plate was exactly the same and was NOT all samples of the food they normally make which is what I was under the impression it would be. - Why didn't they just let us order from the menu? I would have traded in all 10 or whatever of the app plates that we got for a burger and would probably have given them a good review. - Since we needed to get there a bit early start the deal a little early. We have pay additionally for beers before kick off because the $65 didn't start until then. I have no problem paying $65 at this place but I would have much rather gotten some food off the menu like a normal person than getting forced into having some lousy appetizer plate that we had to sit around and wait for. It would have been better for them too since they wouldnt have to make food thats normally on the menu, its just another busy night and people would get to try the food and give them good reviews. It's too bad because the place was nice, the waitress was great and the beer selection was good. Apparently the food is too but I wouldnt know. Probably a good idea to avoid this place during any special events and stay away from any "deals". Not sure if they got caught off guard or what but they really dropped the ball this time.
