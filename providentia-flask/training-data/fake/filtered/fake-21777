Reading Terminal is a Philly icon for a good reason. Come hungry, because you'll probably leave full. If, by some crazy chance, you have room for dessert after a freshly prepared lunch or dinner, there are plenty of places for dessert, including the oldest ice cream company in the US, Bassetts. It will be loud and crowded inside, but that offers a new adventure on every visit.
