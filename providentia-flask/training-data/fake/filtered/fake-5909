Great bar, great vibe. I always try to force my friends to come uptown to this place instead of our normal LES Thursday hangouts, and it's definitely worth it. The rock and roll music, the friendly bartenders and waitresses, and the great beer and drinks make it a must-go. My friend tried the sangria and said it was randomly one of the best she's ever had, so that's got to say something. It's super casual and has some spacious outside seating, which is prime for late-night people watching.
