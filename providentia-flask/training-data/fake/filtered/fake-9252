the pits. pizza ok,  food gross, owners have no clue, overpriced, no specials, poor service, yelling and screaming ignorant owner, needs experienced owner to make it. will not last long!!  you have to be "pazzo" to go there.  try hollywood or puzio's, they are long established pros. when this place goes out, i hope good food goes in. the deli next store blows them away.  run far away from this mess!!!!
