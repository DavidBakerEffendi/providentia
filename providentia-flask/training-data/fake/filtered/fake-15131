I almost don't want to write this review because I don't want the world to know about this place, I'll never get in!  It's super small, only like 10 tables, but the food is amazing.  Their pizza is the crispy thin crust kind, crunchy all the way to the center, which is really rare.  I've tried a whole bunch of their risottos, each one was excellent.  The portions are a perfect size, not too big, not to small.  My only wish would be for them to offer some "non gluten-free" desserts for those of us who just come for the good food!  I used to go to Beard Papas after for dessert (so sad they closed by the way!)
