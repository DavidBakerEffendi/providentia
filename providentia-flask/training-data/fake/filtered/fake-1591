Just ate Gandhi for the first time last night.  Ordered in, so didn't get to peep the vibe, but the food was awesome.  Seriously.  Defintely compares to some of my favorite places in the city.  I'll have to order a couple more times and check for consistency before it becomes my fav (and try eating it in a non-intoxicated state) in NY.  I had Lamb Vindaloo, Naan, some Spinach soup, Mulligatawny, and it was all good.  I especially liked the sauces and the friendliness of the delivery dude.
