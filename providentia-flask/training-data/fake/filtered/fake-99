The cheesesteaks here are okay, very fat and greasy but bland flavor. I've had better cheesesteaks in South Korea. This place's decorations is too flashy and tries way too hard to be like Las Vegas but is more like a thrift shop light bulb fail. The cheese steaks aren't that good. Also, the policy is also kind of racist. This place should fix up there place and there cheesesteaks. I shouldn't and went and I won't come back. The cheesesteak is also over priced. I live in a condo in Philly and I hate passing by Geno's. It makes me sick and I won't come back.
