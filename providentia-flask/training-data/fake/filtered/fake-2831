the owner, dominic, is a rude, arrogant asshole who disrespected my mother for asking a question about seating! if you are setting out to have a good day with some good food, i would advise not to go to this establishment because he will ruin it! the owner gives priority to the individuals that he knows and will give his ass to kiss to the others! will not be returning there as long as he is the "brains" of that place!
