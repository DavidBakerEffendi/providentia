Always loved this spot but won't return for dinner - maybe a drink at the bar but there are too many other great places to choose from.  Early reservation for two on a Thurs night, restaurant was 1/3 full and they seated us next to the very busy service station.  My fault for not asking to move immediately - but I found it really offensive.   Would let that go but the whole experience was bad - waitress was distant and rushed - we ordered multiple courses + cocktails but they hustled us out of there in no time -  skate was drenched in too much butter, steak frites very blah and what happened to their frites, closest comparison is McDonald's.  Felt like a factory, next time I'll go with a smaller, warmer spot when I want bistro fare.
