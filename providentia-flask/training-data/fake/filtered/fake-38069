It is very clear to me that here nobody knows anything about Brazilian food. Im Brazilian and I can tell that their menu have nothing to do with a real Brazilian food. Even the service is no the good service of real Brazilian restaurant. If you guys want to eat real Brazilian food, there is Brazilian Grill restaurant, Boa brasa, Casa nova. They really offer a good food and a good family service. All of them in irounbound, Newark NJ
