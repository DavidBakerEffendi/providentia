Just went to Café Matisse for the first eime on recommendation of a friend.  Boy was she right; I took my wife for our anniversary; we both really enjoyed the excellent service and super elegant, well prepared food!  Wanted to sit out in the garden, but was getting chilly this time of year; got to return late next spring.  Portions weren't as big as I might have liked; but what we ate we sure enjoyed. Baked desserts were nicely done up, but didn't taste any better than the fresh baked at my local diner.  Brought our own special bottle of Italian primativo, and they were happy to open and serve it to us; even asked us questions about what we liked about it, and if we'd recommend it to others.  Will definitely return to Café Matisse; but only if I'm not so very hungry !
