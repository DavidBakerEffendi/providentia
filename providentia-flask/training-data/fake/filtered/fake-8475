The ambiance of this place is nice, quiet and welcoming, however the food is terrible and tasteless.  My husband and I tried this place for the first time and we will not be back.  We waited half hour for a soda refill and the food was overcooked, bland and dry.  We had to ask for bread after being seated for 20 minutes and our waiter never came over to us while we waited over an hour for our food to apologize, make small talk or offer us anything for the long  wait.  Very disappointing.
