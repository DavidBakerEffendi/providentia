The Ear Inn is my favorite bar and restaurant in the city. Great food and welcoming atmosphere. The cornerstone of this historic establishment, Mickey, always has a kind word to say to, and about, everyone who is fortunate enough to met him. Credit cards are no issue and he loves to make complex, delicious drinks, no matter how busy the bar is. His margaritas and martinis are incredible! Further, you can sit outside and drink, and Mickey doesn't even make you leave a card! If I ever have a son, I will certainly ask Mickey to be his godfather.
