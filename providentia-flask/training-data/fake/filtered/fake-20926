First off, I need to review this place in context.  They have tasty sandwiches, but in comparison of what Banh Mi should be like, I found the sandwiches somewhat lacking.  That said, the sandwiches are certainly cheap eats and are worth it if you are on a budget.  If you are looking for a great sandwhich I think you can do better.  Why?  First off, both of our sandwiches came on baguettes that were stale.  To be fair, we picked up our sandwiches after 4pm, so perhaps they've gone bad?  But other reviewers have referenced stale bread, and that worries me.  Secondly, I've had numerous Vietnamese sandwiches from San Jose, CA and Orange County, CA.  Many times I've had them late in the afternoon, and the baguettes had that fresh, crusty outside and that wonderful, soft chewy inside, so reminiscent of a French bakery.  Perhaps this is how folks in NY like their bread?  Thirdly, we did order the BBQ pork sandwich.  The pork came in a manner similar to how you would have it in a BBQ bun (char siu bau, if you will).  That was strange for me, again, perhaps how folks in NY like their sandwiches?  In CA, the BBQ pork tends to come finely julienned, not minced.  Because the meat was more like the meat you get in a bun, it tasted ok (but different than the sandwiches in CA) but is was a different taste than I"m used to.  So, I'm not sure if I'm just used to a different style of sandwich, which is the reason for the lower rating.  Still, the taste was ok, just different.  If you're used to CA-style, then be forewarned.
