False advertising with Groupon I purchased a Groupon for this establishment for $17 which included 20 wings, 1/2 slab of ribs and 1 whole chicken on 9/13 and went to use it on  9/14/2012. I though that it was a great deal, I mean I always purchase deal from Groupons, and I have NEVER had a problem.   When I went to use my Groupon I  was told that the Groupon deal would not start until Tuesday. If all of the stipulations were noted, that would have given me the opportunity to choose if I wanted to purchase this deal or not.  I was not given that opportunity, because the owner failed to list that in the notes, in which vendors do, and if it fits my need i would buy it.. Basically I wasted time and gas (which is $4.05 a gallon) going to this establishment, I had to make other dinner plans because I was unable to use my groupon, on a deal that did not state that it had to be used on certain days of the week. What really angers me is that the owner did not care.  I spoke to the waitress/cashier and she said "the owner said that this deal starts on Tuesday, he's right there."  Not once did he come over to resolve the issue.  He kept his head down and left that poor girl there to defend his establishment.  I didn't address him, because 1.)  I was very angry and did not want to cause a scene, 2.) if he cared he would have came over to explain 3. Actions speak louder than words!  Why should I spend my money in his store?   I try new establishments using Groupons and I continue frequenting these places in most cases, because I was pleased with their services.  I will NEVER go to this store again, and I will tell everyone that I know not to go to this place because they practice FALSE advertising. I did nothing wrong, they did.
