We have been to this restaurant approximately 4 times over the last 6 months. We keep giving it another chance because the pizza is actually good. The problem with this place is not the food, but the waitstaff and others that run the restaurant. If you are trying to ward off loyal customers, you are succeeding. They are extremely rude and this is not isolated to one visit. They don't greet you when you walk in even when it is empty. The waitstaff take forever to come to your table, even when it is empty. After they serve your food, they rarely come back to ask you how everything is. We always end up having to grab them to come back over if we need anything else. The last straw occurred a few days ago when we ordered for pick-up. My husband went into the restaurant, which again was not busy and they directed him towards the bar. He asked the person behind the bar who claims his name was "Ron" and his response was "we'll get to you when we are ready". And he walked away without even asking what my husband needed and when confronted about it he ignored him and didn't bother apologizing. The owner of this restaurant should take notice, because as I have said earlier, this was not an isolated incident. You should want to keep customers, not turn them away from your poor customer service and rudeness. Time for Ron to get another job and wake up.
