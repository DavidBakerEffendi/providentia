You know I was tempted to drop a star because I really felt the like I was being herded a little too aggressively the second I was done with my meal. Like a revolving door that you're being pushed out of to make way for the line of other diners standing at the front waiting for a table. I get it, it's good, you need to make room for other people but take it easy a little, a minute or two isn't too much to ask.
