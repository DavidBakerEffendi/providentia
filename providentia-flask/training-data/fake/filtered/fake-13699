Hope with hope and a let down. My so-called patsy soup seemed to have a taste more akin to water with flavoring. My pizza pie didn't have that up and go I would find at another pizza restaurant in the city. It was just bland, bland. Maybe it was our choice or something. Our server could have helped but it was just take the order and drop the food. And when done drop the check with no smiles. Listen folks got news for you. In the restaurant world it's okay to smile and draw up a conversation with the crowd. Mr. Manager tell the staff it's okay to talk to the customer. And tell that old guy don't smoke the cigar. I DON'T enjoy eating with cigar smoke in the air.
