Last night me and my boyfreind went to sushi california for the first time, honeslty i would have never known it was there but my boss said it was the best suhi around so we gave it a shot. i was so suprised at the excellenct food and service we got. it was a wram inviting environment to sit down and relax while haveing an incredible meal. our waitress jessica was super freindly and had great suggestion for us. the food was perfectally presented and tasted AMAZING!!1. we left full and happy and will definatly come back, and with a bottle of wine since the restuant is BYOB. also we were able to get my boss a gift card for christmas.
