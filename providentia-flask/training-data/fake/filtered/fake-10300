I am a big fan here! My 'authentic' Uzbek friend brought me here for the first time and I've been hooked ever since. The grilled items are always ultra fresh and delicious, with just the right amount of seasoning. I highly recommend the traditional dishes. The owner of the restaurant has been there on every occasion and will remember you the first time you go there.
