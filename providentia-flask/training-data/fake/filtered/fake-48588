The Powerhouse is "historical landmark" mall, which is a great thing. While it does not have a huge food court, or ladies spraying you with cologne. It does have the most important thing, local stores and small town character. This mall is free of large crowds, pushy sales persons, teens, or judgmental security guards and cameras. and is less than 1 mile from the VT border in tax free NH The mall is conveniently located just 2 mins off Highway 89 off exit 20. look for the big L.L. Bean signage and you cant miss it. Easy access too and from Hanover or Lebanon via HWY 12A. Â It has plenty of parking and multiple entrances and exits, so one could park anywhere. Power House Mall also shares its property with a few great restaurants, great for apres shopping hours, holidays, or meeting up with friends. The old fashion appeal continues with the 2nd floor mezzanine walkway (accessed via stairs or elevator) which hosts a number of small and interesting boutiques, restrooms, and cafe seating areas which are quaint and away from the hustle and bustle of the rest of the mall, my favorite aspect of the mall, and located just above the EMS store, my favorite store in the mall.
