Best bar food in Philly! The beers change like the seasons all yummy! PBC local brewed. Cozy place, great people! The atmosphere is very interesting with toys from the owners childhood. Everyone is always welcome. So take a trip to the Green Rock and see for yourself! You will certainly enjoy and want to come back for more. It is not in Kensington it's Port Richmond!
