Where do I begin, well to start with I eat their 3 times a week with family. The food is authentic and has such great flavor, my daughter can't get enough of the homemade hummus. The environment is friendly and there is excellent wait service. I personally recommend the mixed grill entree to anyone who's open minded and likes to try new things.
