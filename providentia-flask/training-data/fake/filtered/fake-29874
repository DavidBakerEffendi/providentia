Sloppy Preparation. Cheap short-cuts. chicken noodle soup was missing it's tofu. chicken basil was rubbery and scraps in one order, and sparse in the other. The spring-rolls weren't crisp. Come to found out the restaurant didn't cook the rolls thoroughly. Had a nice white lining of uncooked gooey flour casing to bite into inside. The experience when I first dined here in 2012 was well. Now since 2014 the tables are packed with foreigners and the service has gotten sloppy to anyone that doesn't come in with a suit on or from CIGNA. Watch out especially for pick-up. This restaurant has a tendency of throwing in last-minute servings/scraps in a bag and stapling it so you have a surprise when you get home. Was good service in the beginning. Now has gotten cheap with short-cuts and scraps. Might Try the Blue Elephant Trial instead. The menu is $2 more but the service and food is exceptionally well.
