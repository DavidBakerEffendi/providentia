I expected much more based on the recomendations for Palma. I'll start with the good. The atmosphere is great. They even have a little garden in the back. The service was ok. But the reason I visited was for good food and I was very disappointed. My meal was very bland and only ended up taking a couple bites before sending it away. I wouldn't recommend going to palma for dinner. But if you just want a nice place to go for a glass of wine in a nice setting then its great for that.
