Was there last night for dinner. Service was horrendous. Fried chicken was just OK. Mashed potatoes tasted like they were from a box. Server brought us wrong pie for dessert and then lied about the availability of the pie that was actually ordered. Â And the pie that he tired to serve us was VERY dry, over cooked w/ a burnt crust. Disgusting. We didn't even eat it. Place was a huge disappointment and not worth the hype at all. Not going back.
