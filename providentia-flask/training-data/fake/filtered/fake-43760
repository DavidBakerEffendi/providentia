After living in Spain for two years and traveling throughout Europe and the Mediterranean it has been almost impossible to find a tapa style restaurant here in the U.S.  We were determined to find such an establishment during our latest visit to NYC.  We decided on Alta.  What a find!!  It was as if we were dining in our favorite Venta along the southern Spanish coast.  Superb food, presentation and service.  Sit upstairs to enjoy a total view of the festivities below.  Our favorites were the fried goat cheese, the pork belly & braised short ribs.  A must is the potent Sangria!  Ask for Steven as your waiter and you will be well taken care of.  Our only suggestion is to serve the top notch Manzanilla Sherry in a larger fino glass, even if the cost is more.  Thanks to the entire staff for permitting us to relive some of our Spanish days!!!
