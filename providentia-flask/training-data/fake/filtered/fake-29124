I have had dinner a few times and it is okay ... nothing to rave about ... there is much better food quality at other restaurants in Newark. I recently had a very bad experience there. I came in with 8 other people on a Wednesday afternoon (4:30). My friends and I had to go over to the law school to pick up our books for the fall semester. So, we decided to park at Don Pepes, head over and then come back for dinner and drinks. They charged us $9 (not like it is a large amount, but it is the point) because we had to go to the law school to pick up our books first. The parking attendant was just doing his job, but he told me that I could talk to the Manager. So, when we got back, which wasn't any longer than 20 minutes, I went inside with everyone and asked that we not be charged since we planned on having dinner and drinks. The Manager refused. So, I wasn't going to argue, but who turns down over $200 in business? I will never go there again ... it is the point that we were going to spend a lot of money there and they wouldn't even consider giving us back our $9. So, we went down the street to Spain ... great place.. very friendly .. they have EXCELLENT service! Spain is on Market street and the food is fabulous! I will never go to Don Pepes again and will advise my fellow law students not even to stop there for drinks. Unbelievable.
