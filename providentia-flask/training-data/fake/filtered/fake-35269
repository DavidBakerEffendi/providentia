This cafe opened recently and offered free coffee. My friends and I went in and loved it. We loved so much that we went back excitedly the next day and ended up spending three hours (and under eight dollars) there. We had coffee and gnocchi and several other delicacies that I can't remember the names of. Gaia cafe is so good that we've decided to make our lunch date weekly affair. Also, the proprietress is a wonderful woman, happy to chat and tell about her native Tuscany.
