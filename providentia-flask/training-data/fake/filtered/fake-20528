Five stars doesn't do this amazing restaurant justice! My husband and I were visiting Philadelphia and stumbled onto this place. The food was delicious! We had the "Tayim" which is essentially a 4-course pre-fix menu for $39 per person, except you get to choose what you want to eat. The salatim came with six little salads each of which was pretty wonderful. My favorites were the roasted beets (had this smoky flavor that was surprising and perfect), the eggplant and a little cucumber salad. For the small plates, we ordered crispy halumi which was PERFECT! I didn't know what halumi was when I ordered it (turns out it's cheese! can't go wrong with that), so my husband and I were very pleasantly surprised. We also had the mushroom dish (so creative and delicious), the cauliflower (never thought it can taste so good) and the sweetbreads (my least favorite). By the time the main course arrived, we didn't think it could get any better and yet it did! We ordered Merguez (lamb meatballs) and Hanger Steak. Yum and yum. For desert we had Konafi - ricotta, apples and ice cream, and Malabi (white chocolate and rhubarb). Cafe Botz - turkish coffee - to finish. The service was as amazing as the food. The waiters were so attentive. We really appreciated the fact that they all work together and help each other out. The attention was constant without being obvious or overwhelming. Our waiter was busy taking another table's order, so a different waiter who noticed that we had closed our menus came to take our order. When my husband left the table to go to the restroom, someone ran up and folded his napkin. The atmosphere was really pretty cool with good music playing in the background. Hopefully the owner decides to open another restaurant in San Francisco so we can go there more often!
