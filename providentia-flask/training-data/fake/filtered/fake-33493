First time. Food is delicious. Love the ginger dressing. I use it on everything and not all restaurants have the right taste and consistency. This restaurant does. In addition, the people there are so nice and accommodating. While I waited for my take out order, I was served a delicious hot cup of green tea. Nice touch. I will definitely go back. And the lunch special is a great deal!
