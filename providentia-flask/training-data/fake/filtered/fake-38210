Greek Lady in University City is a gem of a restaurant. The Greek cuisine is authentic and superbly prepared. The Greek Lady salad, especially, is the best I've ever had. The chicken is perfectly moist and seasoned. Also can't get enough of their gyros--french fries INSIDE! Service is every bit as good as the food. The staff is warm and friendly. You get the feeling that they really enjoy their work. Delivery is quick and easy, they're very reliable. We used Greek Lady to host a private event, and our guests raved about the food and the service. Everyone had a blast! Greek Lady is definitely a favorite among University of Pennsylvania students!
