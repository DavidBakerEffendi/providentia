Checked it out on Saturday after a show. I immediately had a nice feeling about it. Like the dark interior. It makes the food, the flowers and the people pops out! Food and wine are good but not superb. However everything was decent. I checked out their web site. Everything is well designed and shows thoughtfulness and efficiency. Conclusion: will come back!
