First off, I would like to be upfront and say that the food is quote good and full of flavor. However the biggest thing that irked me was the size of their platters. The are in that awkward place between the size/price of an appetizer and the size/price of a normal main dish platter. In a regular restaurant I would maybe spend $10 on an appetizer and $20 on a main dish, and this is if I am feeling particularly hungry. Here I literally had to get two "main dishes" which amounted to about $35 and still left fairly hungry. If you just want an expensive but flavorful snack, this place is good. But if you are looking for a place to eat this may not be the best value. The interior is also a bit strange. It tried to pull off the ambiance of a restaurant with candles and a darkly lit setting, but the white plastic bar tables are strangely positioned and are cold in nature. Bottom line, the chef is great and the ideas behind the dishes are wonderful. But unless this place changes its value proposition it will not last long. Suggestion - keep the prices, double the size of the portions. People will flock. Good luck. Siana
