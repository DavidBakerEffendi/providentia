One of the best Pizzeria's not in Italy. If your search is for an authentic Italian pizza made with organic and fresh ingredients, served by a helpful staff, then your spot is Osteria. My wife and I have brought tons of friends and family, most of which have traveled extensively to and throughout Italy, and they all agree that Osteria has the taste and, arguably more important, the feel of Italy.  This is no doubt due to the love and care that the Procaccinis (that's right...family owned and run just like in Italy!) put into their fare and their guests.  You will love the pizza, but there is nothing better than good food with good people.  Tino Sr. and Tino Jr. know this, and so expect to feel welcome while you're enjoying the meal.   The owners welcome suggestions and criticism.  I've seen them receive it, and they are prompt to address and correct any issues brought forward.  Sadly, the negative reviews here are not useful for criticism or suggestion.  Some have given negative comments about this pizzeria that are either so medically inaccurate, brazenly misinformed about Italian cuisine, obviously self-centered/self-absorbed/self-self, or generally obtuse that you ponder who they are and whether they can find happiness in a dining experience and/or life at all.  Complaints about limited tables and a wait for good food?  Unheard of (sarcasm)! Look...if you can't learn to wait a few minutes for good food, go eat somewhere with bad food.  Do your research about Kingston historical building codes, and you'll understand the limited seating.  Granted, every restaurant has their "off" nights.  Yet, after numerous visits, We have not experienced it.  In general, if your main complaint is about this Pizzeria's food, service, or atmosphere, let me save you the time and money of going to Italy, as you will experience the same at the Pizzerias there.   In conclusion, hope you get the chance to enjoy the good people and pizza of Osteria...and we hope to see you there.
