Amazing sandwiches, catfish and steak sammys are my fave.. the corn is delicious and their custom fruit salad is off the hook- NOTE: usually a line outside, during the day service is great and friendly, at night however the cashier is very unfriendly not helpful, waited for my food while it sat in front of her and had to ask her to see if it was mine and it was, got it cold :( not appreciated.
