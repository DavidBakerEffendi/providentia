This is my favorite restaurant!  It's always clean, the food is always amazing, the waitstaff is there for your every need, and it is so peaceful inside.  I love the tea and noodles that are placed at your table upon arrival.  I've never ordered anything I haven't liked.  Wonton soup, subgum wonton soup, and hot and sour soup are all delicious.  Some things I've tried that were wonderful are- chicken and shrimp combination, chicken with broccoli, prawn and chicken Hunan style, Beef and shrimp stir fry, shrimp with black bean sauce, triple delight, and tung ting shrimp.  Those are only a few!  Always a winner!!!
