The food is good BUT THE SERVICE CAN BE VERY RUDE! Called to place a to-go order on Sunday and was treated as if I was annoying the staff! I had no idea they were closing in a half hour and the woman who took my order made sure I knew that I was ordering too close to closing time. So sorry to bother you with my business! I did not leave with a good feeling.
