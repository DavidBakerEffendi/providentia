I went here with my girlfriend the other day because we wanted to try something new. We were very impressed. The venue is very trendy and we were able to sit at an open window on a nice sunny day. The food was really interesting and delicious as well. We tried a bunch of different things on the menu to see if they were all consistent with the quality of the other foods and we weren't let down. If you want to have some great food, go here.
