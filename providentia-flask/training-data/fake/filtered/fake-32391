Honestly, I have no idea how the pizza tastes, I just know how awful their service and customer treatment is. I ordered a pizza from them to be delivered and was told it would arrive in an hour. After an hour and a half, I called to inquire about my order and after waiting on hold for 5 minutes, I get a cavalier story about how I had cancelled my order. Instead of being gracious in the face of a mistake, they came up with an elaborate lie about how it was my fault. There is no reason for this type of customer treatment and I hope others learn from my mistake in choosing Rustica.
