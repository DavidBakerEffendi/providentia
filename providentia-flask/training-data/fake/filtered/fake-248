I want to Genos this weekend after hearing how good these cheesesteake were. I was so dissapointed. I ordered the cheesestake with wiz. It tastes ike dry roast beef with cheese. The roll tasted like it was from Wawa. I could've made this sandwich at home. The people taking my order was nasty!! I asked my boyfriend when we got to the window what he wanted and the nasty woman thought thinking for 3 seconds took too long so she said in a nasty voice to the people behind us "next" I felt like going to Genos inconviced her because she  had to do her job. We then had to go on another line to order fries and drinks. The woman at this window wasn't a ray of sunshine but not as  nasty. Overall I would not come back here because of the terrible cheesesteak and unfriendly help. This place is too hyped up. The next day I went to Tony Luke's. O.M.G the cheesesteak was so juicy and the meat was tender. I ordered it with wiz. It looked about a foot long and cost 7.25. Genos was maybe 6 iinches and and was 7.75. Tony's was amazing no wonder I had to wait 1 hour. Genos I waited 1 min in line. If your looking for the best philly cheesesteake go to Tony Lukes you will not be dissapointed.
