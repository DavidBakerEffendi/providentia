Don't let the outside fool you, the exterior doesn't do the food justice. We live nearby and decided to give it a try as it's a fairly new restaurant. We now go at least every two weeks. We haven't eaten in yet, only take-out and delivery. Haven't been disappointed with a single dish yet. Everything is fresh and clearly homemade. They are also always very nice and friendly. The prices are also very reasonable. Highly recommend Surrender Cafe!
