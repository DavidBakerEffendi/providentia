We frequent many restaurants in Philly, NYC and anywhere we travel. We'll do everything from upscale joints to greasy spoons (if recommended to us.) My #1 Mexican beyond compare has been Rosa Mexicano in NYC but I think I've found one here in Philly in the same league. Xochitl was one we rolled the dice on and that roll came up "7." My better half loved the guacamole and I thought the mole chicken drumettes were fantastic. The highlight for me was the "takes three days to prepare" Pollo Fito. It had to be one of the tastiest, succulent, good to the bone chicken dishes I've ever had. This was NOT what I expected when I entered (and I mean that in the best possible way.) We will definitely be back to enjoy "So-cheet" again!
