Incredibly Poor Service! We made a reservation for 4 at Eno Terra well in advance of the date. Eno Terra called to confirm the reservation the day before. We arrived on time to be told that they were busy and it would be 15 minutes to clear a table. After that time no one had come to get us in the bar area so we went back to reception. At that point they told us they were still trying to clear tables and it would be (another) 15 minutes. After over 45 minutes of waiting past the reservation time we decided to leave. At no time was an apology given; instead, we were made to feel that we were asking for them to inappropriately hurry them up. To be clear I understand restaurants sometimes become busy beyond expectation. However, after extending a wait over 30 minutes I expect a good restaurant to at least apologize for the delay and offer a complementary drink or appetizer. Since we left I have no idea if Eno's food is any good or not but what I know is that I would not go back nor would I recommend that anyone patronize a restaurant that behaves in this manner.
