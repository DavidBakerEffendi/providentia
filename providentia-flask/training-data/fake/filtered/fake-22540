I went to Rotisseur on a Wednesday night at 7:30 and was told they were out of chicken and that they would have more in about 45 minutes to an hour.  The wait was too long so I went back the next night at 5:30.  This time, they had chicken, but they were out of cornbread and the three sides I ordered were not ready -- another 30 minutes.  I left empty handed, again.  Maybe the next time I'll stop in when they open; that might be the only chance you have to try the food.
