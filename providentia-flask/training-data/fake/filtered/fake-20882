Pretension defined, and featuring a peevish kid with neck tattoos telling everyone who goes in or out to "SHHHHHH you be quiet!". Who cares how good the food is when the level of self-delusion on the part of the staff is this bad. No one in there was having any fun at all. You could practically hear the thoughts of "Well I got a table after 58 minutes at a crushed bar and I have been told the food is great so I'm gonna enjoy it dammit". I'd rather eat roadkill while being kicked in the groin in front of my parents than be subjected to this again.
