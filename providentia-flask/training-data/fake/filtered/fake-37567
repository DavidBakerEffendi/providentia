My girlfriend and I went to a concert over the summer at Newark Symphony Hall. We wanted a quick bite to eat before the show. A few blocks west of the theatre was Soul Food Chess House. The establishment was not fancy, its set up more for take-out orders more than dining in.  The owner took our orders, he was very friendly and helpful to answer any question we had about the menu items as well as portion sizes. We both ordered fried tilapia sandwiches on whole wheat bread. My friend and I decided to dine in b/c no food was allowed inside the theatre. Once seated, the owner introduced us to his wife, she told us she did all the cooking. The sandwiches were prepared in a timely manner; the fish was served crispy golden brown, nicely seasoned (not salty) and piping hot. The owner insisted we sample some of their side dishes as well. They then served us both nice size  samples of collard greens, candied yams, mac & cheese and potato salad. Everything was delicious and portions were worth the money! In my opinion quality supersedes quantity but at Soul Food Chess House you receive both. I will definitely patronize this establishment again. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was due to the high traffic area of the location.
