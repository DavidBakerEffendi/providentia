Beer selection was alright but the staff was terrible. Despite my best efforts I couldnt get a drink at the bar to save my life, the bartender walked by us and our empty glasses on multiple occasions. When it came time to pay our tab, just flagging down anyone who worked there proved difficult, we finally got the attention of one of the bartenders who asked my name and promptly left. She came back 15 minutes later only to ask my name again. The bar was not packed, I dont understand why everything was so difficult. The final nail in the coffin came as we were leaving, the bartender spilled an entire beer on my helmet and cell phone. I didnt get an apology, she just tossed me a dirty bar towel. I had to ride home with a helmet that reeked of beer, I dont know if I'll be able to get the smell out. There are too many other bars to waste your time at this one.
