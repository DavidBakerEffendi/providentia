I love this place. Open early for breakfast, the best french press coffee in town, or tea, a relaxed place to work throughout the day, with excellent teas, Turkish coffee, snacks and food, and open until Midnight for the same. The environment is cozy, friendly, and aesthetically beautiful, and the owners are welcoming and are happy to have customers sit for hours, even with just a cup of tea. But its such a great place, and the food is simple and delicious, that I always end up buying more throughout the time I'm here. Free Internet and outlets everywhere make it a great place to work, and the crowd it attracts makes it a fun place to meet for conversation and fun. They also sell bulk teas and spices and a whole host of gift items--everything from great cups and tea pots, to scarves, bags, and music. Even though I love that it is the best kept secret in Princeton, I want everyone to discover it so that these kind folks do well and their business thrives. Its my favorite place in town.
