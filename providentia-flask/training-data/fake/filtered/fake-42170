traif. meaning unkosher (as ingrained by the server upon seating.) preface: there is nothing "unkosher" about traif (in the grand sense of the word.) firstly, the food is alarming delicious. superb product choices and a marrying flavors in ways that affordable food in this city has yet to reproduce. (primarily the sweetbread/shrimp special and the pork belly/artichoke starter) BUT the service consists of a poor script, painstakingly devised and enforced by a gestapo management. "welcome, have you been to traif before? (NO, you just opened) you MUST sample our delicious..." intrusive and poorly rehearsed at that. a reading from the torah has more original appeal. secondly, the decor is anything but TRAIF. you are surrounded and consumed by an extremely kosher upchuck of tried and (not so true) ikea concept design. shot glasses filled with pottery barn pebbles 'decorate' the bathroom alongside a receptacle 'aptly' labeled a sanitary disposal via a label gun sticker. not to mention the urban outfitters' decals on the wall which exude a not so thoroughly devised aesthetic for an over-saturated williamsburg restaurant scene. i pity the talented chef (formerly of the limited LA fine dining scene) that must find a way to coexist within this environment. the disconnect could be its inevitable demise. if you can ignore your remaining three senses, the taste (and smell) of this chef's approachable cuisine is worth the trek. -a p-heights resident (still without williamsburg-envy.)
