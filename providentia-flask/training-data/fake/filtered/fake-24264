I cannot believe anyone goes here. Very seldom do I have a genuinely angry reaction to a restaurant, but I guess I hadn't been to an establishment like Ngam in a while. Basic cooking skills weren't even evident. Â For example, the chefs cooked the pad Thai at way too high of a temperature, so they burnt the oil and the dish smelled and tasted like a wet poodle. The spring rolls were uniquely aweful as well -- way, way too oily. The brussel sprouts were also uninventive, but the green papaya salad was solid. My wife's mussels were few in number. The only redeeming part of the meal was the spicy brownie, though the Thai tea float was OKish but very one note. On top of that, they added 20% in gratuity for two people. I usually leave at least 20%, but the service was slow and the bussboy was constantly checking his iPhone in the stairwell with the several other of the staff. If you're looking for overpriced, mediocre Thai food served by a staff that's half paying attention in an atmosphere that's reminiscent of the 1980s (i.e., a disco ball is a prominent piece of the decore), then you can have this place to yourself.
