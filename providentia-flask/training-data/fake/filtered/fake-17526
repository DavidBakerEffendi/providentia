My wife, friend, 12 year old, and I ate at Tink's Restaurant last night and all four of us loved the meal. I had an awesome Grouper Oscar with crab meat, it was lightly breaded and very tasty. My wife had Tuna, friend had snapper with a butter sauce, and 12 year old had a small Ceaser Salad, which was great, and fettuccine Alfredo and ate it all. Prices are a little high but in line for the quality and choices of food. I was able to take a taste of all 4 meals and all of them were outstanding. First time ever that we all agreed that our meals were great and we all would get the same thing again.
