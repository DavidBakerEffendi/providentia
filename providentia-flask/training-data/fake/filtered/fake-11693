I want to give it zero star because of the treatment our family experience (but this is not an option in this site): discrimination! We are a group of 3 Chinese who were there before the two groups of non-Chinese people: a group of 2 and a group of 5. We were holding the card #1. We saw the waitress lead the 2 people to a table of 4 (even there were just 2 people). They came later than us. We had been waiting there for 40 minutes! The group of 5 just arrived for less than 5 minutes (meaning we waited 35 minutes more than them). Â they threaten to leave, the waitress immediately told them the table was ready for them. The waitress did not even looked at us! I showed her our card with # 1, she just smile. If the previous group of 2 could sit at a table for 4. Why did she give us the table of 5 even we were 3 people? the only conclusion was discrimination! The placed is run by Chinese, but they took advantages of it and discriminate against their own people!! We were hungry and tired. My daughter just drove 8 hours home. I call all Chinese: do not go there! We drove to Ya Ya noodles in Montgomery instead. Sat down right away, food came in less than 10 minutes. Tasty Chinese food and yummy sushi. Relax and happy. Who want to go to that crowded and rude Sushi Palace again? I won't!
