Dined this past saturday night with 7 other friends.  Found the bread to be mediocre.  We would have expected a hearty crusty italian bread;rather we were served triangles of some kind of doughy bread.  Six of us ordered a dish of some kind of whitefish that was to be deboned tableside, served with what was supposed to be a lemon butter garlic sauce.  The sauce was bland, infused with capers, tomatoes and eggplant.  By the time 2 servers deboned the fish, it was lukewarm.  The server NEVER checked back, so we ate warm to cold food.  And this was for an entree that cost $31.00 The fried calamari was good, although the marinara sauce was not enough to satisfy 2 orders. The restaurant is noisy, overcrowded, and understaffed. I ate there on a previous occasion, and found it ok.   Of course this was on a weekday. It is a byob,  and after the first bottles of wine were opened by the staff, I was forced to return to my car to retrieve a corkscrew to open the rest of our wine bottles. We had 18 percent added to the check.  We normally tip in the 20 to 25 percent range (I am in the food service business), but this staff deserved about 15 percent.
