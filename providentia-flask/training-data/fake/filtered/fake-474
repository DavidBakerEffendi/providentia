When i heard about this place I got very excited. I spent a lot of time in Tony Goes when it was on Olden Ave and Casino in the Burg on Anderson St. So I went in with high expectations. I ordered 2 Hot Dogs with only potatoes. A very simple order. When I got out to the car with my order I opened one right away to give it s try. What do I get? a Dog loaded with Mustard. Not bad for many people but I can not stand mustard. I went back into the store and mentioned to the kid behind the counter that my order was wrong. He asked what I ordered and I told him 2 dogs with ONLY potatoes. When he came back with my new Hot Dogs he told me I should be more clear when I order. He said all dogs some with Mustard unless you say you don't want it on the hot dog. I said I ONLY wanted Potatoes. The word ONLY should have been KEY word. He still insisted that I did not order it right. Look bud i just spent $10 on 2 Hot Dogs and a Soda. You should not be making me feel in the wrong. I did enjoy the hot dogs after they were made the right way I ordered but it was not as good as I remember Tony Goes or Casino being. And for the prices I don;t need to be Â scolded by a 17 year old on my ordering skills.
