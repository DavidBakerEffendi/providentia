They have a small seating area. I assume most people order to go. I'll have to see if it gets crowded when they're busy. I went at about 3:30pm and I was the only one there. Based off of other yelpers I had to get the buffalo chicken cheesesteak, extra buffalo sauce on the side, with the salt and vinegar fries. I always order extra sauce because all the buffalo chicken cheesesteaks I've had were dry for my taste. Not the case at all with this place. Mmmm it was dripping with sauce and cheese, in a good way! I used the extra sauce to dip my fries in. I've never had salt and vinegar fries before today so I'll admit I don't have much to go off of. I thought the fries could use more vinegar but this could just be my preference. The speed of the service more than made up for the slight french fry disappointment. I kid you not, my 11" cheesesteak and fries were ready to go in 4 minutes. This won't be the last time I visit so I'll add more info on what the service is like when it's busier. I'm editing my review because after more visits I've found myself disappointed. I've tried other hoagies and also went with other people who were also disappointed. I would say the quality depends on who is making your food at the time. The first time I went the Buffalo chicken cheesesteak was stuffed with meat and sauce but the last 4 times it was extremely lacking in both areas. Very disappointed.
