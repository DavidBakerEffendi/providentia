This is without a doubt the best pho place in Philly. But beyond that, it's my absolute favorite pho restaurant anywhere, and I've been to a lot of them. Pho Ha simply make the best pho. Their broth is rich is flavorful. Their noodles are never overcooked. They are generous with meat and with portion sizes. The herbs are always fresh. Their pho is consistently delicious and has been for years. I recommend a #8.
