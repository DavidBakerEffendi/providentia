Without a doubt, this is one of my favorite spots on Church Street.  Great good, and a good selection of liquors and beers.  One of the few places in the area that knows how to correctly pour a Guinness and black and tans.  My new favorite drink to get is Switchblack, which is half Switchback, finished with Guinness.  The burgers here are also delicious, stop by on a Wednesday and you are getting them at half price.  My favorite aspect is the decor, I love the antique Irish feeling one gets as they enter.  Also, the exterior of the building, an old bank, is one of my favorite buildings on church street.  To wrap up, if I am looking for bar food and a few drinks, this is my go to spot.
