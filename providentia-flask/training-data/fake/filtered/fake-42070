Delivery review: It seems Luzzos has a different menu in the restaurant compared to their website. So when you ask for a pizza over the phone (based on what you see online) they'll send you something else. I understand this is a minor mistake but I'm not going to return mi pizza and wait for the "correction" when I'm starving. Sorry guys..good pizza but lacking customer service!!
