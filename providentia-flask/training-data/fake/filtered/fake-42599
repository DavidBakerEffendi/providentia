I am a big fan of steak and this place does not dissapoint. Their food is amazing. I had the Shrimp Iza and Ceviche Mixto appetizers, followed by the Churrasco Steak -simply fantastic. The staff was extremely courteous and attentive and the owner of the restaurant was very hospitable, walking to each table and greeting everyone. Â The restaurant is very clean, which is very important to me. I would definitely recommend that you try Churrasco Grill. One thing I would sugget though, is to make a reservation in advance. It fills very quickly.
