Guacamole Mex-Grill is amazing! The chicken mole enchiladas are the best you will find in Philadelphia. Everything on the menu is excellent, but the enchiladas are always my go to. The atmosphere is cozy and welcoming, with fun decor and a vibrant color scheme to put you in the right mood for eating some delicious Mexican food. The owners are wonderful people. They will always treat you like a friend, and if you go there often enough, like part of the family. They are very generous in their portions and in the attentiveness they show to each customer. So go, become part of the family!
