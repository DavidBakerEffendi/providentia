I utterly fell in love with this intimate and romantic restaurant yesterday evening. The food is great, all local and organic. It is very important to know where the food you are eating comes from, and for this ABC knows it well. The chef Dan knows how to make a simple vegetable look and taste irresistible. The restaurant is quite big but you feel very welcomed, not too much noise. Just next to the home store, you should have a walk around the shop after dinner. Loved the crab toast and the free range crispy chicken, but I still want to discover all the menu! Great job guys!
