Very disappointed after having really enjoyed previous visits. The first couple of months Peony Pavilion was open, my husband, myself and our friend got dim sum here several weekends almost consecutively. After almost two months of not visiting, some of the dim sum dishes this morning was almost unrecognizable. The turnip cake was overly salty, falling apart, and almost burned on the upper surface. We couldn't finish it. The soup dumplings were previously a bit too flimsy wrapper-wise; today they were also more or less tasteless. The lowered quality of the rice rolls also suggested that the restaurant is cutting corners on the quality of the meat being used, or overcooking (as with the turnip cake). The pork buns were also very poorly put together and also wrong on the salty/sweet ratio. There were also some service issues, but one waiter really was trying hard to make it right so one star at least just for him -- thank you! It seems that the restaurant is shifting focus away from dim sum and continuing to concentrate on fancy sushi rolls. A few months ago, lunch time on a Saturday everyone was getting dim sum. Today, it was mostly sushi rolls.
