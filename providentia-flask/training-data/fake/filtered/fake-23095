Our first time there, do not go there-big disappointment. Service was terrible and food was bad, too. I had to hunt down waitress to get the bill and when we told her how bad it was, she left with the bill to get it adjusted, but...it took quite a while for her to come back with it and there were no apologies and no manager stopped by to apologize either. Will not go back there.
