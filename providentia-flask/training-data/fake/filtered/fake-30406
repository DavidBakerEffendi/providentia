This experience was the worst I have ever had at a restaurant!  The server/ possible manager was extremely awkward..it appeared they may have been understaffed, or maybe this guy had no clue about restaurant work.   We did come for restaurant week, however, his was not a good showing for them.  He brought our entrees about a minute after our appetizers, so they sat at the edge of the table till we finished.  Im sorry, but this is inexcusable in any restaurant.  And he was not even apologetic!!   And, on top of this, a guy in a chefs coat came ou, saw our entrees sitting their on the table, and did nothing!  Perhaps everyone in there does not know how food service works, but I was quite stumped.  If it comes up too early, its better to leave it in the kitchen under the heat lamps than bring it out.  Or refire it..they have more chicken.  The bread was of a strange consistency, but the appetizers were fine (pumpkin soup/ beet salad).  The chicken was served over oversalted kale and beans with undercooked fingerling potatoes.  The desserts were pretty horrible.  The flourless cake was more of a torte, and way too bitter and dry.  The pumpkin cheesecake was the wrong consistency, too fluffy.  The best part of this meal was the glass of wine I got, but the food/ experience was not worth it.  Not to mention they seated us in an awkward alcove in the front, with a larger party next to us, and no view of the nice interior of the restaurant.  Sorry guy who served us, Ive never yelped, but this experience was something I would not even expect in a diner but paid $45.
