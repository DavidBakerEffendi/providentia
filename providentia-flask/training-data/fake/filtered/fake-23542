I haven't started eating yet, but I figured I might as well write a review while I'm waiting. We arrived about 45 minutes ago, and we have ordered, but we're still waiting for the food. So, as far as the service is concerned, I'm going to give it a one. I'm pretty cheap, so I didn't want anything to drink. If the water is just standard. I can't taste the fluoride, which is a good thing. "This better be the best damn taco of all time," says my friend. I share his wish, but keep my expectations low. The food has come and gone. It was good. I mean, it was just tacos, guys. No big deal. They promised dessert to make up for the delay, but we're still waiting ... Why did we say yes?!
