Everything was delicious! Given our indecisiveness, we ordered a bunch of appetizers rather than meals. Get the melted cheese dish, the lemon potatoes, and the parmesan potatoes. They were fantastic! The bean dishes were good, but less notable than the others we ordered. The whole restaurant experience was fantastic--the ceiling was fun and different and the service was wonderful. Thumbs up.
