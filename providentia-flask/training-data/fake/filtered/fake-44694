Ew. Really gross. The creepy guys at the door were SO RUDE and REALLY AGRESSIVE  while myself and 2 friends were on the sidewalk as soon as we left.  The way he talked to us made me never want to go to another steven starr place EVER again. I am not one of those people who is easily thrown off by others, but these guys were so agressive I thought about calling the cops. Also, while the beer wasn't bad and was an ok price, the food was too little for too much money and was OK at best. Also, I don't care how many oz. the pretzel is, I still don't want to pay 8$ for it.
