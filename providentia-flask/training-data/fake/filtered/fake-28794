Came in late so there was no waiting and the food was amazing. So tasty I couldn't stop eating even though I was very full! I don't know what they put in the salad dressing but I would love the recipe. I also had the chicken vegi soup and believe me you've never tasted anything so fresh and flavorful! Great experience. Thank you!
