In Philly for the weekend.  While at Reading Terminal, I discovered the Wursthaus booth, which is affiliated or owned by Brauhaus Schmitz.  Currywurst for lunch put me in the mood for a German dinner and atmosphere. The German beer selection is extensive, and they claim the most German-specific beers on tap anywhere.  I was unfamiliar with most, but my waiter sensed my uncertainty and brought a sampler to try. For dinner I had two sausages: Bauernwurst and Speckwurst with the spatzle and another side I can't remember.  All were authentic and delicious. Atomsphere was also great.  Tables are close, and the place has an energetic vibe.  One table was taking jager shots while our close by neighbors were drinking beer from das boot.  We struck up a conversation with them, much as you would in a German brauhouse.   I wish we had a place like this locally.  Would suggest to anyone interested in visiting Germany for dinner, while in Philly.
