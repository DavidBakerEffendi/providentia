i went to kabab paradise today 9/10/14 and i was a normal custmer their. i order a gyro platter and the owner tried upping the price on me and taking my money. I really cant believe that a business would try to hustle someone for 2 dollars when they get a gyro every week from that business. i would never do business with kabab paradise EVVVVERRR AGAIN and for any one who goes their watch the prices they charge you because they will try steal your money. The worst business i have ever done business with by FAR. I would recommend for future custmers to not do business with kabab paradise. Their is a million more businesses better than kabab paradise.
