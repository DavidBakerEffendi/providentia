Love the burger, love the trout, and most of the appetizers. It is tough to go wrong with your selection in this place. Rosewater Pavlova is my choice of desert. It usually gets crowded and you can tell by the hipster crowd piling up on each other in the front. Try to come in early and linger around. Time for expansion Five Leaves owner Mr. Australian, we need more tables!
