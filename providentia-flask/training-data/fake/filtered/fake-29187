Steve C-  if you were a good chef you would be able to tell that the mushrooms are not canned, they are fresh. They make everything fresh their daily. Moving on:   Hands down Annabella's is the BEST Italian deli around!  The " mozz" is unbelievably the best I have ever had!  It's perfectly seasoned and so creamy.  My fav sandwich is the Italian Sub with toasted bread and thinly slices fresh mozz. so delicious!!   The owner is really nice too. He makes you feel like part of the family and if you're unsure as to what to order tell him and he will whip something for you and your sure to be blown away!  Greta place!  Great food!!
