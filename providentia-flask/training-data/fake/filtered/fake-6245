Waiter thought he was cool, was like "Sup dudes?" I was there with a girlfriend of mine, not a dude. Anyway, agree with everything others are saying about the service. the food is wonderful but the chubbier waiter is a complete failure. He took at least 20 mins to notice us even though he saw us sit down, 20 more minutes to get our drinks, then 20 more minutes to take our food order. we got there at 730 and didn't get our food until 845. then we wanted another beer but he passed by me waiving to grab his attention at least three times before i went to the bar and asked for the check, which i then had to return to the bar myself to pay. really stupid if you ask me because I am a flat 20% tipper but this waiter prompted me to feel ripped off by tipping him at all. I love the flyers and i love food so thought i couldn't lose with this place. I was wrong. I will go back to give it another chance just because the food was great but if the service hasn't improved I will not be going back.
