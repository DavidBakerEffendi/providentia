We really enjoyed our experience at Gibsons. Our only complaint was feeling very rushed. We had a 5:30 reservation and felt the waiters were hovering a bit too much. We probably would have ordered more wine (benefiting Gibson's and our waiter) and lingered over the courses more. I must say it was probably the best steak that I have eaten in a while.
