I've been here maybe 8-10 times over the past few years and love the place. It is pricy, so I don't go frequently, but I believe you get what you pay for, because I find their food delicious. Service has been good to excellent every time. The Fedua (?) (crispy noodle with shellfish) is my favorite.
