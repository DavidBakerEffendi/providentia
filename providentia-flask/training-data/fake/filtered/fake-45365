I have been to this place so many times on different days, seasons with different people and sat in different places. They are a great place for groups, dates and are kid friendly. They have a dj on the weekend and the after work bar scene and atmosphere is great. I like the food but have tasted better. I had to order different things to see what I liked and although it is popular I dont like the chicken and waffles. the drinks re really good and the waiters and bartenders are really nice. Even the Manager came to speak to me when H saw me waiting to make sure I was ok. it is a branch off from Negrils, one of my faves from yrs ago.
