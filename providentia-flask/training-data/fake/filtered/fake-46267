Food:  Great!  Pork buns are very flavorful; definitely better than the pork buns at Totto Ramen.  The duck sukiyaki was pretty amazing as well, especially the noodles used with it.  The akamaru ramen was pretty awesome, you can definitely taste the miso throughout the broth; though you could also couple the broth with the noodle from the sukiyaki -- that would be the way to go!  Would definitely come back for the food. Service:  Excellent!  The wait staff are attentive, and they keep our water full periodically.   This was a fantastic restaurant and am happy to have my first review on yelp be on this restaurant!
