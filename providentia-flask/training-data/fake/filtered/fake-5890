the place is lovely at night - esp if you get a seat on the terrace. but the food last night lacked any subtlety - greasy does not begin to describe it. green beans and spinach drenched in not-too-good oil, and soggy polenta sticks. some bizarre acidy taste to the dips... drinks are delightful and so is the service tho. and great location by the highline. but if you want a decent meal... go elsewhere
