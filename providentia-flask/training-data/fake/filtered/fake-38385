I was told that this bar was a fun place to hang out due to the ship theme... however, upon attending I was rudely bumped in to by the wait staff then taunted to leave when voicing a complaint.  the waitress actually said to out large table of 8 "see ya later."  Now I don't know about anyone else but I worked as a waitress for 6 years and I would have been fired for chasing away the profits from a 8 person table.  When we asked to speak to a manager as a result of our mistreatment we were referred to speak to a bus buy while the disrespectful waitress stood by and laughed.  Their menu appeared to have potential however I do not believe  the wait staff is capable or respectful enough to bring you anything.  I would recommend a million other places before settling on this awful bar
