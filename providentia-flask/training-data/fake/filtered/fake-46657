The only thing Beyoglu has going for it is its corner location.  The food was bland, and the portions were TINY!  We had:  humus (flavorless), eggplant with tomatoes (so heavy with oil), caviar spread (caviar mixed with mayonnaise?  Needed something else), the gyro meat with yogurt sauce (not good at all).  They say they're Turkish, but I think they're Turkish-wanna-be.  Next time you're in the mood for Turkish, go to Peri Ela instead!
