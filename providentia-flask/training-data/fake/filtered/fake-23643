I went with 3 old friends for some beers and the "best burger" in NYC.  It was a really good burger and the fries were really skinny very well done ( i like them that way).  1st the only burger they make has blue cheese. I like blue cheese, but don't love it. I would have preferred cheddar or something else. Blue cheese is a bit stron and you can't taste the quality of the meat. The service, once you get passed waiting for 45 minutes was lackluster, but it is a burger joint for yuppies. By the way did I say it was pretty expensive and the game wasn't on TV (world series)
