Me and a friend stopped there on the way to a play at the Papermill Playhouse. The service was horrible (very slow and unattentive).  The food was horrible as well. I had eggplant parm which was totally burnt  with a side of Linguini which was total mush. My friend had baked ravioli which was also total mush. Will defintely not be stopping back there!
