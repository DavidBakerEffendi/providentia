I love this place!!!  Such a fun atmosphere and really nice interior. The chicken wings were so big and juicy and stayed crispy even with the buffalo sauce on them. Not sure how they do that?!  Had the special pizza of the day called a LakeMonster, and it was amazing...roasted garlic, thick bacon, candied onions....soo yummy. Our server was really personable and nice, and was attentive without being a distraction. Lots of people have been talking about how great this restaurant is, and I couldn't agree more. So glad I tried it, and I will definitely be back!
