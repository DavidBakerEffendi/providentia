We visited Smithfield last weekend and had an incredible experience. This is a truly special place. The service and decor are exceptional, the Vanilla Bean Pancakes are to die for, not to forget the Chicken Paillard with Belgian Waffle and Maple Syrup, excellent staff, very well appointed but it is the friendly caring service that is the star. This neighborhood needed a great bar and it has arrived.
