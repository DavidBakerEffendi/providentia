So, I only had one dish (from the counter, not packaged), but it happened to be the worst tapa I've had in my entire life- migas. What is supposed to be Spanish ham and cured meat mixed with fresh bread and garlic ended up tasting like rubbery bacon bits and croutons.   They must have made this concoction in the AM. The worst part?  They reheated it in the MICROWAVE- right in front of me. There was a toaster oven right next to it too! I could not believe what I saw.  I can't believe I almost finished it. Any true catalan should steer clear of migas at Despana.
