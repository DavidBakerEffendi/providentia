A friend and I (both who have worked in the restaurant service industry) went here for  apps and drinks at the bar, The bartender was some high strung wingnut who seemed to hate his job, he walked around the bar like it had 70 people in it,( there were only 2 other people at the bar) and after finally ordering a draft that kicked as he poured it told us it was gonna be quite a wait for him to tap another keg. We ordered a bottled beer and watched him stomp around acting like a 4 YO  making huge banging noises with the keg right in front of us. After this "show" we only had one mediocre app and not another drink. Get a bartender who likes his job guys!
