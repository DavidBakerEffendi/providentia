Although the food was great, the place is trendy, service was disorganized. At their prices, all of the entrees should come out at the same time, not 25 minutes apart!!!  The waiter apologized and gave an explanation, but only after we asked what was going on.  Also, the wait staff had to be reminded twice that 2 sides were missing ... for a table of 4.  The sides came out at the end of my meal, but before the 4th person got his entree.  Some of the drink orders were wrong at various points before and during dinner.  It was surprising considering how hard the staff was working to provide good service such as frequent water refills, folded napkins if you left to go to the bathroom, pushing in chairs, etc.  Although mistakes happen, no apology or recognition from management.
