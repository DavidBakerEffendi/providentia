HOW does this place not have a five star rating?!!  I'm a HUGE fan of breakfast places and this place is the best I've ever been to.  Do yourself a favor and bring pajamas eat yourself into a coma and when you wake up you'll pick up right where you left off.  The staff works like a well oiled machine.  Just watch those guys weave in and out of each others way carrying all that delicious food!  I've only had lunch here once and it was still great.  Just make sure you do breakfast so you haven't left Montclair without experiencing euphoria.  The only thing I'd give a negative is that I couldn't fit the restaurant in my car when I moved.
