To be fair, this used to be one of my favorite Chinese takeouts. We used to order at least once a week. But the last 2 times, I don't know, something has changed. It might be the economy, forcing them to cut corners, but the food isn't what it used to be. We loved the appetizers and usually just ordered a bunch of them. Now it feels like they changed the oil or something, but the lightness isn't there in the fried stuff anymore. On the plus side, they will make anything you request, if possible, even if its not on the menu. And, they make the homemade hot mustard you used to get in Chinese restaurants in the past! Just ask for it!
