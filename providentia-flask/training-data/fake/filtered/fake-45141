I love Mr.Subs especially how close they are to my job and I don't spend much time ordering on my lunch break. But I do have to say the Customer service at Mr.Sub sucks there lately. There's this really heavy set guy that claims he's the manager but yet shows no manager personality skills to the customers. He's always seems to be in a bad mood when I come in and he stays rolling his eyes when you come in the store while he's talking to someone else. If you don't like your job get another one! It would be nice to see more of the two funny guys working together again. They always made my lunch break pleasant to stay at Mr.Sub. Come on Mr.Sub you have great food but horrible choice in your employees!!!
