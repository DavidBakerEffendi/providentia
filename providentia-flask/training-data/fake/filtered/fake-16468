Went to this restaurant because of Jason's input on the 25th of June and found it satisfying.  I am not a fan of the buffet lunch, but was pleased that the offerings here were well selected and within a range so that they tasted fresh rather than reheated.  The wait staff was conscientious about maintaining the buffet and tending to patrons.  The dining room was busy! I did purchase a Taste of India gift certificate for a discerning friend as I am optimistic that dinner will be a welcome experience... and spiced to our liking.
