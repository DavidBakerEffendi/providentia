Went with another couple the first weekend it opened not knowing what to expect, and it way surpassed our expectations. For starters, the service was great and super friendly. The cocktails and wine list are a lovely compliment to the menu, and every plate that came out was better than the last (which often is not at all the case). DEFINITELY try the bacon tater tots with peas and perfectly pillowy ricotta gnocchi - we ended up ordering 2 plates of each, they were so delicious! My husband also loved the lamb loin and neck as his main. While desserts are often an afterthought at spots like this, even the panna cotta with cardamom, sea salt and rhubarb ice was wonderfully refreshing and the perfect way to top off a meal. We're thinking of going back again this weekend, we enjoyed it so much.
