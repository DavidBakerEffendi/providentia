Well, I haven't been but I am going tonight. My review is based upon a phone call. I called to see if SoCo has a corkage fee. It was very apparent the person on the other end of the phone did not know what term meant - so after 5 mins on hold, she says "no". I could have ran with that response but I wanted to educate her on what a corkage fee was, so I said, "Great I can bring my own wine and you will open and serve it ???" After the short pause, she puts me on hold again. Two mins later, "I checked with my manger and we don't do that. here". She made it seem like I needed to drink my Thunderbird from its paper bag prior to entering their establishment. We will see how the food taste..... -k
