My friends and I went on a Saturday night to check the place out. I like it! It's new, so it's still working out some kinks, but the prices were good for the amount and quality of food (I recommend the grilled romaine salad) and the drink choices were excellent. It was very hot though. So hot that my group asked to be re-seated. Fortunately, our request was granted immediately and without any problems. Would definitely return again, as I can see this quickly becoming a local favorite.
