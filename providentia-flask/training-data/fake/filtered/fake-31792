biggest pieces of shits in mercer county! these scums will rob you of your money. ordered online and i come in for my order to be $5 more than it was online when i placed my order, they made me wait an extra 20 minutes, and when the pice came out it wasnt the same one theyve been making for this past year. just a shitty soggy pizaa that looks like it was waiting in the back for a week.
