This is where the young working crowd goes for a drink after work in downtown Philadelphia.  The lounge/bar area was packed and loud on a Wednesday evening.  It is a great casual and hip atmosphere.  The retro tex-mex throwback decor is fun and inviting.  If you are not in the mood for drinks, the menu is a made up of traditional and casual mexcana dishes which are upgraded and somewhat pricier.  This means that you are not sitting in taco bell and you do not get 3 large beef tacos for 3 dollars.  But rather, you get 3 tiny steak tacos (cooked to your preference) for $13.  For an appetizer, the guacamole is great, but a little on the steep side for a bowl of guac and a basket of chips.
