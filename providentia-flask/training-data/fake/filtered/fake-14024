The worst service I've ever had. A party of 4, we came to celebrate my mom's birthday. The waiter spilled half-a-bottle of red wine on me and my friend by brushing his hand over the bottle. Our outfits were ruined-we tried to wash off the wine-the clothes were soaking wet. The waiter seemed not to care, mumbled "sorry" and did not offer a replacement bottle, or any sort of compensation. The food took FOREVER to arrive. The appetizer cheese plate featured 4 little pieces of cheese for, oh, $13? I did leave a normal tip, as usual, didn't make any fuss about spilled wine and now think I should have...That birthday dinner was memorable for all the wrong reasons.
