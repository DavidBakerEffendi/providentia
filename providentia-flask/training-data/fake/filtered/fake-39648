Finally made it out to Queens with a friend the other night and Sriphaphai was worth it.  I only wish I had come out here sooner.  It's the closest to Bangkok that I have found in New York and a lot cheaper to get to.  Notable dishes were the raw shrimp with garlic, chili, and lime juice and the sauteed crispy pork with chili, garlic, and basil leaves.  Will definitely be back.  Check out more of my thoughts at itssooveritscommon.wordp….
