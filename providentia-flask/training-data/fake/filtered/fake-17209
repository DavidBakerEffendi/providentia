their customer service says it all.  during the october snow storm, the owner himself delivered to my home.  there had been a tree down on my block and the power was out.  he walked half a block in the storm to deliver out pizza.  after all that - the pizza was good and he refused the tip!!!  what a trooper!!!  we continue to order from them because of the service and the quality of their pizzas.
