This is the real deal.  A comfortable, unpretentious neighborhood bar and restaurant with good beer on tap, creative cocktails, and great food!  The burgers are 8 oz and don't come pre made from a local restaurant food supply source, if you get my drift.  Grilled just the way you like them.  I've had the black angus and the bison.  Both great.  The best wings in the Upper Valley, especially the maple chipotle sauce.  We go here often with friends.  It's a little tricky to find.  Turn left at the top of Main St. by the Dirt Cowboy and go down the alley and down the stairs.  Did I mention the frfench onion soup? Awesome!
