Stopped by for lunch here this Saturday and was not disappointed. I ordered the breakfast burrito.  Couple of things: 1) They should serve more salsa with the burrito. They also served fries with the burrito, which I thought was a bit strange.  I'm a fan of fries, though, so it worked for me.  The homefries that came with the omelettes looked delish, I think I may ask for those next time.  The breakfast burrito itself was pretty great, it wasn't obnoxiously large but the perfect size and the tortillas were solid.  Tortillas MAKE a burrito, let's be real, so that is important.  I'm also skeptical of black beans in a burrito but they tasted like home-cooked beans so it worked for me. 2) the bread basket that came immediately as we sat down was good but nothing spectacular.  One person I was with raved about the butter that came with the bread, but I didn't find anything to be great about it OR the accompanying fruit bread. 3) The mimosas were light on the alcohol, but good.  It's pretty darn hard to mess up a mimosa. 4) Undecided if I will go back.  The ambiance was nice, the decor lacked a bit of character.  There's so many great places and I can't say that the burrito was something I probably couldn't get at another brunch joints, so no, probably won't go back until I've eaten everywhere in this city.
