Emporio has not taken time to create good dishes, the restaurant is very nice too look at, but at the end, it is food that really matters! I am recently arrived in New York from Italia and would have to say I would never eat here again. It is all trendy hipster-types, and very loud. And, serving such low-grades olive oil in an Italian restaurant is a very disgrace! One would be dragged out in the streets and shot for serving such a poor oil, at such an expensive restaurant, back home.
