Elaine who? What an amazing new place in the 'hood. Food is delicious and the owners and staff totally "get it". Â Cozy vibe with incredible take on creative comfort food. Already thinking about what I will order the next time we go back. Inventive spinach salad, salmon was delicious and veal meatloaf hit the spot with an interesting take with sweet potato mash. Wine we had with dinner (Pouilly Fume and Montepulciano) was fantastic.
