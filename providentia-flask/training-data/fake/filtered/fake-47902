I have been here 3 times already in the short time they've been open. Everything is consistently fresh and delicious. The service is attentive, the ambiance is relaxing. The prices are quite reasonable and the portions ample.This restaurant is a wonderful addition to Caldwell and I wish them a long and successful run here.
