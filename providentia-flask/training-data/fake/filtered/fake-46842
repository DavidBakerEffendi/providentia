A warm and intimate space of just the right size to hold a small party comfortably. Ordered the Garden Vegetable Korma and savored its buttery texture and aromatic spices. Also ordered a side of Bombay Aloo, simply small cubed potatoes with cooked in spicy goodness. The plate was completed with rice and Nan bread and a small tub of yogurt sauce. Everything delicious! Washed everything down with a glass of Malbec -- one of just several superb wines in stock I am sure. Hoping for a return visit soon.
