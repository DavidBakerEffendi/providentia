I remember growing up in Northwest Iowa just South of Sioux City. I remember in the mid to late 50's going to the "beginning" of the Tastee Inn & Out and buying a Loose Meat Sandwich, fries, and a malt/shake for 99 cents. How times change. Another great sandwich; I don't know whether it's Iowa based or not, but it's pork so maybe it is; is a pounded extra thin pork tenderloin sandwich where the pork extends an inch or two outside the bun. I found these more in Southeast Iowa than Northwest Iowa. Off the subject, but I also remember my parents going to Nebraska to "smuggle" margarine in blocks like butter because it was illegal in Iowa.
