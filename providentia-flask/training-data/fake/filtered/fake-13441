Yuck.  It looked like a great place and had good reviews by other Yelp contributors.  Despite the nice atmosphere and great waitresses, the place is a no-go.  The tilapia and chicken were very over-cooked, potatoes with no flavor and... the baby rat running around the floor was... well you know, totally gross.  It was willing to overlook it all - a generous mood I guess? - until the manager came out of the back room to "smooth" it over by telling me that 1. they had been inspected and I could look it up (thanks - what does that mean for my food tonight?) and 2. to stop drawing attention to the rat (now hiding behind a barrel by the bathroom door) because I risked, "upsetting other customers".  Wow.  I lost all sympathy for the establishment right then.  And then the check came at full price - despite the "managements" full attention to the problem. You bet we didn't pay full price , but to even have to  ask for a 10% compensation after watching the rat prance around all during our very mediocre and over-priced dinner.... I was insulted and left sick!  Yuck!
