I went to Fuel Center City yesterday for the first time. Their menu does have a lot of options, and most dishes come as a salad, sandwich or panini. I had the South Philly panini: chicken, spinach, roasted red peppers, provolone cheese and a garlic spread. My girlfriend had a Roasted Turkey panini. I thought they were both pretty good, and we decided before we were done eating that we'd probably be back. The decor of the place is very strange, though. My girlfriend summed it when she said, "they're trying to cater to juiceheads when they should be trying to target yogis." The plasma tvs are playing "fuel television" which from what I saw is just shitty house music videos. The rest of the dining area has a sterile, industrial type look, I guess fitting for the gym look they're shooting for. So the food that we had was decent, tasted pretty good, came out hot and was a reasonable portion size. The ambiance leaves a lot to be desired, but I don't really think that's why people are coming to Fuel. One last cool side note, at the end of our meal our server handed us a scratch ticket to bring back next time.. apparently all tickets are winners and only redeemable if you scratch them in front of an employee... I thought it was a clever marketing tactic and I'll be back to see what I "won".
