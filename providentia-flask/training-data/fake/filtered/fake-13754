After reading the reviews I decided to try this place, mainly because the fish is made to order.  I thought this restaurant would be a really nice place to eat, I was wrong!!! First off the restaurant looked dingy.  Being that it was in Montclair, I was expecting the restaurant to look more like the environment that it was in.  It looked more like one of those dirty restaurant you will find  in Newark or Irvington.  The lady comes from the kitchen and yells to me can I help you ....Ghetto.  The fish she gave me was not FRESH AT ALL!!!.  It was not seasoned, and tasted as if it was cooked from yesterday.  The meat was hard and sticking to the fish bone.  Anyone who eats real eschovitch fish knows that fish doesn't stick to the bone unless it is old.  I payed $12.00 for it which is standard for fish.  I had better fish from Golden Krust in Orange off of main street.  I will never eat their again, not trying to be harsh, but do not give out stale fish.... CHA!!!.......
