I can deal with having to wait for a table, but having to put up with waiters and waitresses that care more about whether you are SHARING food, rather than giving you good service, is something that I cannot put up with.  I have eaten here on several occasions, and though the prices have crept up steadily, the service has headed in the opposite direction.  Its not necessary to tell the customer over and over again that sharing is not allowed.  Telling them once is enough.  Staff at this restaurant (ours was a lady named Chen) should spend less time harassing their customers, and worry more about other things - like getting a customers food order correct, and cooking a customers food properly.
