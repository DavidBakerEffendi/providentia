TINY place. Intimate by design I suppose. Seating can occasionally be absurd. As in sitting on a stool in the corner of an already meager table, having little room to elbow. Worth it though: Food is spectacular, staff is attentive but not intrusive. Have dined here numerous times and am always surprised by the food. Staff very knowledgeable. Drinks tend to be overly sweet, but of 60 possible things to say to criticize a place, this is like 57th. Superb, superb restaurant. Go there!
