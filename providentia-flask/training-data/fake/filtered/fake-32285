If you are looking for excellent food at a great price, this is your place. Came into the city from out of town and after reading reviews we decided to give this place a shot. If you are looking for great ambiance this won't be your place but if you like great food stop by. Ramon was a terrific waiter who remembered our names and greeted us with a smile. The mushroom cigars are unreal. I got the filet which was huge and came with 2 sides and was cooked to perfection. My gf got the lamb which was packed with flavor. Couple all of this with byob and u can't beat this place. A must go
