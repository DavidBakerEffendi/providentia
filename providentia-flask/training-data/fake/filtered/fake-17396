This is a great new addition to the neighborhood. So far everything I've had is delicious. Great brunch! The eggs florentine were perfectly done and the french toast was superb. La Gigogne is also nice for dinner. Salads are fresh and flavorful, spatzle terrific. I haven't tried the tartes flambees yet but they look pretty tasty. The atmosphere is welcoming and the service is friendly and attentive. Eat here!
