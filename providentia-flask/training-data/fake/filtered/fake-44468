I tried going to this 'bakery' on Bastille Day but it was closed (because it was on a Monday). But I went back this week and was pleasantly rewarded. I decided to have the sandwich du jour, which was brie on a baguette. It was just what a French sandwich should taste like, and I lived in France for several years, so I know. If only I could have had a ballon de rouge it would have been perfect.
