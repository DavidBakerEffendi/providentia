Im sorry...not worth the hype..Food is not as good as it once was and the portions are tiny, which is fine if its supier quality, but its not. Â The Jamon Spicy Bruschetta and the lamb both were very good..I find the SB Salad to not even be all that good compared to home made ones I have sampled..Now, its not bad, its just not at the level of hype it gets..
