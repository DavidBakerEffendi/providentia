First day in New York on holiday with our 2 Daughters from the UK.We were recommended this place by a friend of our eldest Daughter.We had to wait 30 minutes for a table but that's nothing unusual so we put our names down and bided our time wandering in a rain soaked park(now that is something us Brits are used to).We placed our order and in fact this should have been a relatively easy order as we all had the same dish.We waited 45 minutes for our food which i feel is too long and so when we came to pay we tipped accordingly.Now you have to understand that tipping in the Uk is not an expectation and i had been warned by friends of the New Yorkers expectation of 20% but surely only if deserved ,my god i am shocked at the abuse we received and to be honest we are now considering cooking at our apartment for the next week as it has left a very sour taste in my mouth.
