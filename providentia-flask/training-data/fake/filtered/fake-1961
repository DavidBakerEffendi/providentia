My friends and I were involved in a meeting nearby and saw Brooklyn Crab as we passed.  After our meeting the five of us decided to go there to eat.  We were met with a wonderful, friendly staff.  The food was good and the drinks too.  We went back two weeks later and met with the same response.  I had had the delicious crab cakes the first time, but decided to join my friends and have the shrimp basket.  WOW, the shrimps were amazing --- large and tended , fried, but not overly done.  I would recommend this place in a heart beat.  It was a nice evening and the windows were up, giving us a wonderful view of the Manhattan Skyline.
