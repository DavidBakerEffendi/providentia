Came by a couple of weeks back got some really rough service off the lady, just wanted a couple of coffees after a massive day - got attitude and crap coffee, if she hadn't been as tall as me I'd have been a little more assertive, but as things stood I left defeated. So just strolling by and spot a sweet little thing through that window in I wander with a swagger got myself a coffee I didn't even want. Great coffee, Great service and the added bonus of a very sweet smile. I guess it's Luck of the draw, but my taste buds {and my manhood} is thanking me tonight.
