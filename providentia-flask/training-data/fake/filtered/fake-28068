Went to Amada for the first time and LOVED it!!!  I think it was the combination of the flavorful food and accomdating staff.  Everyone working was very friendly and helpful, I felt like a GUEST and not a customer!!   The food was great!! Went to spain this summer and ate at an authentic tapas restaurant and I felt like the food at amada was more authentic then the food we actually had in Spain.  Some of the more memorable dishes were the Manchego cheese with lavender truffle honey.  omg so good.  The little potatos were delish, ham croquette sauce awesome, and the flatbread with the short rib was cooked perfectly.  Goat cheese to me was just ok, but my husband loved it.  However, you could tell time and effort was put in the preparation of every dish.  We also ordered a pitcher of Sangria, for 32 dollars got like 3-4 glasses each out of it, you really cant beat that.   The restaruant itself is very cozy inside and as stated before felt elegant without being overdone.  We sat in the back room which was signtifcantly quieter then the front room.  I'm glad we did, might have been too noisy up front.   Def recommend reseravtions we made ours about a month in advance.   Really looking forward to going back soon!!
