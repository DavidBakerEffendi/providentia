This place is great!  I'm so glad to have an authentic middle eastern spot to eat at in Williamsburg.  Seriously, never a wait and the food is DELICIOUS!  I have been there twice now and the second time was just as good as the first.  I highly recommend their hummus, which is one of my favorites in the city, and also the Kafta Kebab platter.   The staff is also very friendly, definitely refreshing to experience that in Williamsburg.  They also get extra points from this Bronx native for serving Bronx Pale Ale on tap!
