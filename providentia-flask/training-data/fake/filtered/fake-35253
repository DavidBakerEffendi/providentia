This is a wonderful, genuine little Italian kitchen - something you might stumble upon in the Italian countryside. Delicious food, personally prepared by Gaia the owner/ chef, who is delightful. The prices are astronomically low, especially for the high culinary standard. Don't expect run of the mill treatment though. I think it is different every time and for every guest. We were treated like family - out first time there with a very picky 5 yr old who Gaia charmed into eating [and admitting enjoyment] something she would normally refuse. This gem has become one of my definite go-to places to eat in the City.
