I tried this new trendy Tapas restaurant and I was totally surprised by the quality and presentation of the food. The chef added a wonderful and special twist to the usual Mediterranean food. The balance between the different spices were wonderful and tasty. The presentation of the food is perfect, and the variety of dishes are great. If you are a vegetarian, there are plenty of dishes to chose from, and the drinks are original and unique. The ambiance is good, the waitresses are very attentive, and the service is wonderful. My favorite dishes were: Falafel buns, Skirt Steak, Jumbo Shrimps and Gnocchi.
