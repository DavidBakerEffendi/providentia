I'm suspicious. I have been frequenting this restaurant for at least 5 years. The food is great, the staff is great, the top manager is an example of gentleman and you can always find nice people there. The price is not that bad for the service, in fact, is quite cheap for the whole work. I do recommend this restaurant.
