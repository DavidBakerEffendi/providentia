My husband and I went to Cowgirl Sea Horse today for Sunday Brunch. My husband is a Chef and I cook all of the time so listen when I say this...Run, don't walk to Cowgirl Sea Horse and dine on this delicious food.   I had the Shrimp and Grits and my husband had some type of breakfast burrito. I was too busy eating and sighing and enjoying my food and he was doing the same. I live in the Financial District/Seaport  and I had never eaten at this restaurant but I'm now making a point to support my neighborhood as it comes back from Superstorm Sandy.  There are not a lot of places that we really dine at because we both cook but this had the delicious mid-west/southern spicy taste that I love (since I'm originally from Ohio).   They also serve Steve's Key Lime Pie - (Steve's pie shop is in Red Hook and was also devastated by Superstorm Sandy.)  Cowgirl Sea Horse will become our "go-to" place for comfort food on the weekends..  Remember, I said, "Run, don't Walk" Oh, very friendly and attentive staff.
