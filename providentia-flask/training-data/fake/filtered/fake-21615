Outstanding place for dinner. We have been there several times with a bunch of friends, averaging between 8-12 people each time. The owners always greet us with a smile and treat us like family. The food is always delicious no matter what we order. The cornbread is out of this world; by far the best I ever had. The servers were also the best. A great BYOB restaurant tucked into a small Hightsown corner building. Go try it out, you won't be disappointed.
