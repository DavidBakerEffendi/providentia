I'm from Denver and I've only had Haitian food one other time. The food here was amazing! I had mahi mahi, ox tails, fried bananas, and some sort of rice. The food had so much flavor packed into each bite and the different textures complimented each other nicely. Having never eaten ox tails before I had to figure out how to accomplish that but no troubles once I tried a couple of times. Needless to say, I ate my entire plate of food in one sitting. Aside from the food, the vibe is super cool too. One of those small gems of a mom and pop restaurant. Super small, great music in the background, and amazing food. I would recommend this to anyone and if I make it back to Jersey I'll make it a point to come back.
