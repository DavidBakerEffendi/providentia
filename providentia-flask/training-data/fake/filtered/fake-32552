The Wood Pit "Southern Style" BBQ is the best kept secret in Essex County. This BBQ ranks up there with Gates & Sons in Kansas City or Rendezvous in Memphis. I ordered a slab of pork ribs, a couple of beef brisket sandwiches and a couple of sides. The ribs were smoky and literally peeled off the bone. The brisket was melt-in-your mouth tender and full of flavor. I got all 3 sauces they offer on the side -- mild, hot and super hot. All were good, though I'd be hard pressed to tell the difference between the hot and super hot varieties. As for the sides -- my daughter, a Mac & Cheese connoisseur, thoroughly enjoyed the Mac & Cheese. Once I started eating the generous portions of cornbread they serve I couldn't stop! On my next trip I'm going to have to try out the BBQ Beans and Collard Greens I saw on the menu. There aren't many good BBQ joints in the North Jersey/NYC Metro area, but this place is one of the best you'll find North of the Mason-Dixon.
