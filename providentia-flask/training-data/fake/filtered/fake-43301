We go to poor henrys like once a week minimum, there prime rib (or any other steak) is as good as it gets, especially with a fat pile of mashed potatos. Burgers and appetizers are awesome as well. Good drinks, all the bar tenders Bob, mike , and Jesse are all really cool and they have some good live music on certain days. Family owned and operated so they take some pride in treating you good and making sure your happy. Id recomend to anyone that wants a good place to eat.
