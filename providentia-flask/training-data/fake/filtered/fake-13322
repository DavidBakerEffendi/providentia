This place is very close to my office so my coworkers and I go a lot due to the convenience.  But that is really the only reason why.  There are much better places for a quick lunch in the area and every one is more reasonably priced.  Sandwiches now cost just under $9 with tax which is outrageous, especially since you get no soup, chips, fries, or drink with it (prices used to be a bit better).   I also definitely agree with other reviewers - you never get what you expect.  I usually order the same thing and every time its missing one topping or another or they switch out the bread for a different one - never telling you that they are out of something, just hoping you dont notice. I was hoping things would have changed when the owner was busted as part of a drug ring (look it up), but the only thing they did was up the prices, perhaps to pay for lawyers. Lastly, you always come out of the place smelling like a deep fryer, even if youre in for just 5 minutes to pick up a sandwich.  So every time you catch a whiff of yourself, you can remember the overpriced, mediocre sandwich that probably wasnt exactly what you ordered anyway and the profits of which that likely went towards keeping a drug dealer out of jail.
