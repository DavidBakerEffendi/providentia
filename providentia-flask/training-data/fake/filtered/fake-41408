I stopped going to Patsy's in midtown (the high-priced sit down place in midtown, not the much better pizza place) because the quality has slipped so much. A client who has a table at Rao's brought me here and I discovered this fantastic treasure! Everything that Patsy's falls short on is done to perfection at Rao's. The sauce is as good as the homemade that my mother used to make. The veal cutlets, my favorite, are tender and fresh. The pasta is served hot, hot, hot and not lukewarm because I think they make it fresh to order. The atmosphere is home, not tacky and pretentious like Patsy's and a few other highfalutin' Italian restaurants in midtown are. If you ever have the chance get into Rao's. It's not easy but it's well worth the wait
