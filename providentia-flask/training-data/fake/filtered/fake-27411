Yes, the pizza is good and so are the heroes, but the experience is chaotic.  If you are eating outside the ordering lines are an ordeal and the ambience leaves much to be desired.  Still it's worth an occasional trip.  Inside eating is a totally different experience, but not unique and can be replicated throughout the city at far more convenient and attractive restaurants.
