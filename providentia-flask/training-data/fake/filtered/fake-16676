What an amazing find!!! Located next to Rita's and Oyster River, this great hideaway is a perfect place to grab a burger and cold beer. This place has the best view on Ocean ave as it faces the west haven shoreline. We were lucky enough to catch the gorgeous sunset last week which made our experience that much more enjoyable. As for food, I'm still craving their Mahi Bites and Motherload burger...YUMMY! By far the juiciest burger I've ever had. I was also quiet impressed at how the owner/chef himself went around and asked how everyone's meal and drinks were. Now you don't see that very often now a days! Overall, we had a great experience at the Dive Bar and Restaurant. It's one of those hidden gems which every burger and beer lover should check out. If you're a micro-brew connoisseur, you'll appreciate all their beers on tap. We'll definitely be supporting our local Dive Bar and Restaurant..And we think you should too!!!
