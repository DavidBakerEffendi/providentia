I used to be into this place. It's one of the few places in the neighborhood that regularly shows football. The food is decent, but pricey for the portions. If it weren't for tonight I'd give it 3.5 or 4 stars. However... So, tonight I go there after working all day til 10 pm. I just want to watch the game quietly and eat some food. I order a $13 cheeseburger and a $6 petri dish of beans and rice. Like, tiny portion, one can of beans equals at least four servings for them. My burger arrives and I ask for some ketchup, but unfortunately, no, I cannot have any ketchup. Why? Because the 'chef' of this bar has decided that ketchup would ruin the 'authentic cajun experience' of eating their burger. I then ask if mustard is part of the authentic cajun experience. Nope. No ketchup, no mustard. It's either hot sauce or a dry burger. And this is my beef. Not just with them, but with almost every spot in the neighborhood. I didn't come to Heavy Woods for an authentic Cajun experience. I just wanted to watch the game after a long day of work and eat a burger. A burger, not a po' boy, not jambalaya, not crawfish, a fucking burger. Last I checked burgers weren't invented by Cajuns. What do I want with my $13 cheeseburger? Some ketchup, maybe some mustard if I'm feeling saucy. But instead of providing these basic condiments, they serve up some insane snobbery about the authenticity of the Cajun experience in a bar in the middle of north BROOKLYN. Listen, you want to be creative about your food, great. So long as it's tasty, and not overpriced I'm all for it. But the moment you start putting on airs in a neighborhood spot... that, to me, is bullshit. This isn't Per Se. This is a corner bar. Buy some fucking ketchup.
