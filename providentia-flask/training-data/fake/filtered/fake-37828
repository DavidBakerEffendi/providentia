Had dinner there last night , sorry to say I was very disappointed. My wife and I both ordered the chicken dish which was nothing more then a piece of boiled chicken swimming in a Â loose lemon sauce . There is no excuse for this. The service was poor. The waiter forgot to bring us the desert we ordered and it took him ten minutes to bring us olive oil I had requested. You can do much better in NYC!
