Wow, the food is great here. The price seems normal, portions were good. The only bad thing is the wait. It's over a year, we moved here and we ate there only once ( during an off peak hour on a weekday). Being critical about food and service, the restaurant overall is good. The grilled stuff is the best tasting so far. Will go there again.
