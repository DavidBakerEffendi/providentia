Boy oh Boy!!! If you haven't had the opportunity to feast on one of these delicious dogs....then you surely are missing out! And let's not even mention the yummy fries and the out of this world dipping sauces....I am forever a fan of Underdogs...I ordered the Marrakesh and had the curry mayo dipping sauce with my fries, and I had no complaints at all. Â I can't wait for my next dog! If you like hot dogs or sausages....hurry....I said hurry!!! and get on down to Underdogs to satisfy your lunch craving you won't be disappointed.
