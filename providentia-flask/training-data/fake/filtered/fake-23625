People may have a different experience, but I left pretty dissatisfied. I came here with my girlfriend because she saw it on TV and we heard great things. We started off by waiting an hour which we expected given this place's popularity. The waitress came to take our order and to be honest was pretty rude, and the whole ordering experience was a bit awkward. We ordered the lamb, but they said it would take btwn 45 mins to an hour to cook. We were in a little rush, so we decided on the bugers instead. The burgers were...different. My gf nor I particularly liked them, but I'm not here to say their food was bad, just not our taste. My biggest problem was that the staff seemed rude and I felt burned after spending $20 on a burger and not liking it. Bottom line, I wouldn't reccomend or go there again.
