Amazing food. I was not a great fan of Chinese food but this restaurant changed it all. The restaurant is Â clean with great environment and great service. This is the best Chinese food that I ever ate. I recommended my friends and it changed their view similar to mine. If I go in that area, I make a point that I have dinner or lunch there. The food is reasonably priced, I have never been able to finish a single dish on my own.I just love this place and highly recommend.
