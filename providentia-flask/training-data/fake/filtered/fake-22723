Before I went to the Food market, I expected that I'll experience a variety of delicious food. but as soon as I arrived, I was very disappointed. You can choose a variety of food from Food vendors. but the prices are not reasonable. I ordered a "Steak Sandwich" from DORRIAN'S Winter Garden. The price was $7. It was just half a sandwich. Â It was really a rip-off !! and Eating outside is terrible. It was too cold and the food was quickly cooled. I 'll never again want to experience something like today.
