Over the years i passed by this beautifully landscaped hide away in a quiet area of wayne and wondered if this was a place i would enjoy ??.  A close friend suggested i go there for my (surprise) engagement diner. The paris's made it a memory we will never forget. The food quality was top notch, the service was warm and friendly and competent. the decore was very romantic.  After a very memorable diner, the executive chief Tony Paris surprised us with a chocolat souffle that was a nice touch, It was truly  the best we ever had. We enjoyed our selfs so much, we recently got married there. The event was enjoyed by all our family and friends.  Thanks and cudos to the management of the Pais Inn. We can't wait to come back for our next special event.
