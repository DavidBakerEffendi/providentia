We went to tre bar during their happy hour. the waiter told us that they have a special that day and all the wines are half priced and he gave us a happy hour menu and their regular menu (by mistake I guess). The problem was we could clearly see that the happy hour wines were not even close to half price, they were around 75%. at least they have to be a little smarter if they want to cheat. they have awesome burger though :-)
