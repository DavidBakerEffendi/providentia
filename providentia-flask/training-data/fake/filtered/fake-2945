Second time here, I was so excited to go again. I knew there was going to be a long wait which I had no problem. The restaurant does not take reservations, to find out only for friends. A slap in the face when the party arrives and says in front of. A crowd of waiting people at this point we were waiting 2 hours., WE HAVE A RESERVATION, they were seated immediately. I called twice during the week and explained it was my moms 60th birthday. She said no reservations. Friends make sure there not dum enough to announce they have reservations. When your establishment Does not take them. The owner tired to embarrass us by announcing our minutes after you we're confronted. Your guilty conscious ripped right out of you. Also tell your front desk girls to smile, they are the most miserable people I have every seen. The food is not worth it. Make sure you touch up on your business ethics. What a shame.
