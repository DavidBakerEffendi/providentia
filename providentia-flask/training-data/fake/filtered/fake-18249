Took a business group out to dinner. Huge plus points off the bat for a Montclair restaurant - easy parking and full bar! Very nicely redone inside with high ceilings, very nice modern decor. We were greeted and seated promptly. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the specials, the food and the wine. Food was just excellent both in presentation, taste and amount! I can highly recommend the pork cheek appetizer which was a special, and the arctic cod over black rice. Dessert was the salt/caramel/chocolate pie - excellent and rich - good to share since its quite a good size. The other desserts were served in little tiny pots ((you get to pick 2) and were a hit with the other guests; a nice touch indeed. Â Will definitely return!!
