Living on the upper east side 6 months out of the year (the other in Shanghai)because of work.I have had many different types of cocktails and dinner experiences.But Â I have to say that Yerba Buena has been consistent with my favorite cocktail the Poquito Picante the spicy jalapeno infused drink..I just can't drink 1. It is truly a pleasure to return to a place that honors hospitality.I pulled over the young mgr @the door as i arrived with my wife and told him please I need a table for 2 ...well i tell you he must have some memory because he asked me how my trip to Shanghai was and that meant something to me that he remembered. The food suckling pig hmm.. exquisite,cocktails superb...the music can be a bit loud but I can live with that energy! I will return again but I just have to convince the mgrs and owners to open up a Yerba in Shanghai like Jean-George did!
