I was in Philly this weekend and had a craving for some Indian food. I heard about an Indian restaurant called Karma on chestnut. I'm connoisseur for Indian food and didn't think Philly had any quality Indian restaurants but I was wrong. The food at Karma was delicious. I loved there butter chicken and saag paneer. Their garlic naan was soft, warm and yummy! I loved dipping every piece of it in the Indian yogurt and butter chicken curry. Â The service was excellent and they really went out of their way to make sure I was taken care of. The waiter approached me several times to fill my of glass of water, and ask me if I needed anything else. Their drinks were great too! I would definitely recommend this place anyone who wants authentic Indian food.
