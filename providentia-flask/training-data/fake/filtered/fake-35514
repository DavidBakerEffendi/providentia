I just went there today with my dad and it was amazing! I had the breakfast burger and it melts in your mouth with the bacon, the fried egg, and the burger all together. The decor is supposed to be old fashioned , as diners are suposed to be to bring out the child in you. I also had the hot chocolate, best thing to warm you up. The clam chowder was hot and fresh. My dad got the eggs with corned beef hash and it was awesome! A place I will go to again and again.
