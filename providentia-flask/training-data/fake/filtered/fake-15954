I only recently moved to west haven-read a few reviews of bao's and thought it seemed like a place to take a chance on-I must say it wasn't very good-crab rangoon and shrimp egg foo young were AWFUL, everything else was edible. I'm hoping that since it is a good size city I can find some chinese place that is good-if not I might have to travel the 25 mins back to Seymour for good food!
