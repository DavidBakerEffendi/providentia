This is actually a pretty good spot for a light lunch or just a need-an-afternoon-coffee midday break.  It's ironically located directly next to a Starbucks.  The food is fine but gets kind of expensive; best feature IMO is the iced-coffee on tap.  Note to tourists : we  typically don't tip for simple counter service (as opposed to waiter/waitress service) so you can hit "no tip" at the computerized credit-card process.
