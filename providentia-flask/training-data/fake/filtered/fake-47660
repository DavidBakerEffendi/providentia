great tasting pizza. best ones are fresh mozzarella and basil, or plain ol cheese, or pepperoni. but load on the toppings and you'll ruin the crust. question is... is it worth the 30-60 minute wait for a waiter with attitude? the take-out line is the SAME line as the dine-in line. go figure. it's a good place for special occasions, but i was just as happy to go to ignazio's right down the same block and around the corner. THE THINNEST crust you'll ever eat, but without the wait or the attitude. try ignazio's it if time is a factor or you just suffer from AADD and need to eat NOW! otherwise you can join the kool crowd, wait around with the tourists, and make a friend while in line for grimaldi's.
