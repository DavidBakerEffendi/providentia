Delicious. The atmosphere is very new york, its busy, vibrant, decadent, and delicious. having always heard good things but never been  I took two friends from out of town here tonight.  We were walk in's at 8:45 on a saturday night.  Initially told it would be an hour, we were seated in less than 20 minutes.  The waiter was quick and efficient,  and the corner booth we got was comfy and most importantly every one of us really enjoyed the food.  I personally had the trout over fennel and spinach. I wasn't overwhelmed at the amazing flavors and ingenuity, but the food was definitely well balanced and tasty.  The only thing I would like is to see some vegan options on the menu, and perhaps the prices could be a bit less, but they are within reason and it is a nice atmosphere in a cool neighborhood.  All in all, it was a good evening I would certainly go back.
