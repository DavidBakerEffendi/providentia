One of my favorite brunch spots in Brooklyn! There is rarely a wait to be seated because the place in rather big. Outside patio is very pretty, rustic and farm-y. Food is yummy. I especially love the humus/dips platter and the adult grilled cheese. Unfortunately there's no bottomless booze :(. Service is good, waiters are very attentive and always come around to see if they can bring us anything. Parking is not easy to find in the area, but on a nice day the walk from a far parking spot is definitely worth it.
