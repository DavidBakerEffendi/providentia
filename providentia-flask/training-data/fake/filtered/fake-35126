This place was exactly what we needed after a long day of doing the "tourist" thing! My husband and I were on vacation in New York and staying at the Millennium Hilton, we wanted to go out for a quick, quiet drink somewhere close. The security man at the Hilton told us to go a few blocks down the Murray and turn Right. That is where we found Dark Horse! What a pleasure. There were some patrons around the bar, but everyone was respectful. The prices were very very reasonable, but what REALLY made the place special was the staff! Eamon and Dana were behind the bar and both made sure to come talk to us and make us feel welcome. Eamon told us some AMAZING tourist ideas (such as a sail boat to view the statue, instead of waiting in lines on the taxis) and we are SO glad that we did these things. We came back the next night to show our buddy who lives in White Plains, and then we came back the day before we flew out just to see Eamon again! It really is a Great place. We never tried the food, but reading the menu will make your mouth water. I suggest it to anyone looking for great service, and a lovely atmosphere.
