Who wants to knock a business that's just trying to make a buck? I'll tell u who: a consumer who does NOT wanna be deceived and over charged! Â Beana's is NOT mexican food. PERIOD. They charge WWAAYY too much for items that are marginal at best. Please, folks, save your hard earned cash. You are better off going on a munchies run @ the quick chek.
