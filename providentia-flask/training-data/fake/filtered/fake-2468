This is not only the BEST pub downtown, it's been here forEVER! Great drinks, good food, and I liked the music. I always make a point of going to places like this off peak hours because I don't care for crowds. This place is never empty from what I can tell, but it's always been enjoyable. Just a short walk away from historic Penn's Landing, but it manages not to be a tourist trap, thankfully! I hope they're here a long, long time!
