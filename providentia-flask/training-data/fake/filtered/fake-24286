It's a cozy restaurant. I love the atmosphere, I think it is the best place in this area to hang out. The food was so-so. I like green curry rice with baby back ribs, but Thai-style hamburger is not that good. Think twice if you want authentic Thai food from here. Overall is good, I will come back for sure.
