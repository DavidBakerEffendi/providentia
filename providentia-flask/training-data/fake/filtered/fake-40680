I don't know why this place gets so many stars. It's nothing short of a standard pizza. So it has a little bit of history being the first pizzeria in NYC. great. But guess what, this isn't even the original location. It was originally a few shops down. Anyway, i digress. The pizza here is what i'm suppose to discuss. Its dry. dry dry dry. I also question the quality of the dough. I think i;ve had better pre-made frozen pizza from whole foods on Houston St.
