Very average street food (which is not a compliment).  I certainly wouldn't go out of my way for this place and the majority of my plate has ended up in the garbage the few times I have eaten here.  Expect a large plate of mediocre food over rice.  The white sauce is tasty and the red sauce is very spicy.  The man who prepares your pitas by hand also manages the finances (wearing the same dirty gloves for both).  There are plenty of vastly superior 24 hour Halal taxi stands in NYC I would consider before 53rd and 6th.
