Fantastic food, buck-a-shuck oyster specials for happy hour, and almost everything else we ate was superb!  (The only thing that wasn't fantastic there were the fries.  They were just good!)  Service was exceptional;  I have a food allergy and the waiter was by far the most competent waiter to deal with this ever in our experience.  Ask for Brion, he'll take great care of you!
