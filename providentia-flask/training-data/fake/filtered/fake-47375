After reading the other reviews, I have to wonder if we're talking about the same place. The food here is very good, IMO, especially for those who are a bit tired of the super-huge and greasy portions that usually pass for Chinese food in the US. The 'Authentic Chinese' menu is awesome, and I usually get some scallion pancakes to go with every order. The lunch menu is cheap but good, even though the portions are a bit smaller, and the hot and sour soup tastes, well, the way hot and sour soup ought to taste. I've always found the employees very nice and helpful as well, although I am Chinese and do speak Chinese pretty decently, so that might have had an effect; I can't say. In any case, I consider this one of the best Chinese restaurants in the area.
