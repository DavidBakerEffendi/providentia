Wonderful dining experience...Took advice of Yelp reviewers & ordered the Curry Puffs - Yummy.  Also Pla Muk Tord - fancy for the best Calamari I've eaten in a very long time.  Wonderfully crispy without being chewy.  Main entrees were Gaeng Kiew Warn w/ chicken. ( Semi spicy green curry) Delicious.  Nuea Yaan, grilled beef w/ Thai sauce - very tender & flavorful.  and Fried rice w/ crab meat.  Nice to see fried rice made the way it should - with egg. The crab made it special.  Portions were large. Presentation was excellent. Place BYOB, so i brought 2 Heinekens from corner store for $3.50. Restaurant put 2nd in fridge until ready to drink. Prices very reasonable.  Workers very helpful & attentive.  I will be going back.
