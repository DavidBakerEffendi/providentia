Chinese Food Heaven! Give these guys 6 stars!  Great, Fresh, Awesome and CLEAN!  I have eaten here since '92 and the food is always good.  The Ribs, the Wings, The Dumplings, the Chow Fun, the Kung Pow, the General Tso. Hey Mark Simone come get your fresh Egg Rolls and homemade hot Chinese mustard here!  They make all of the prepared stuff like Egg Rolls & "Sweet and Sour" at least two or three  twice a week to keep it fresh. You have to try the owners family recipe Chinese Beef Stew Soup Noodles.. YUM!   I use to eat in Chinatown 6 days a week but never again. My 5 year old takes the Sesame (w/all White Meat) Chicken to school for lunch every day and finishes his broccoli. in fact his teachers said his lunch smelled so good we had to send them a take out order. The White Rice is even special. It is a special type that tastes oh so good even plain.  If you like peanuts try the "Wonton Szechuan Style".just a little spicy..... and the curry is so good that the Indian restaurant staff orders their lunch here. This place is located behind the Best Buy cross the street from Woodbridge Center and next to Harbor Freight Tools.
