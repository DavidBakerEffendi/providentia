After reading such rave reviews about this vendor's falafel, I was excited to try it for myself. I was very disappointed after the first bite. The falafel were soggy and overly salty. The onion slices were very thick and any bite with it had an overpowering onion-y flavor to it. The white sauce had no taste to it. Also, I'm not a fan of pickles and was surprised to find them in my wrap. The pita was the best part of the wrap to be honest- it was soft but not chewy. The fact that I did not eat the wrap right away or the very hot weather might have played a role in my sub par eating experience, but I also suspect that the falafels I was served were not fresh (I was told to wait a few minutes for falafels and saw one worker putting more in the oil and just a second later, my wrap was ready, before the freshly dropped ones were fetched from the oil). Seeing that this vendor has so many followers, I may give it another shot in the future, but not any time soon.
