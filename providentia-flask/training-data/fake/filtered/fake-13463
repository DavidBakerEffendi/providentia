I went to Le Grainne on a monday around 7 with a friend. As soon as we entered a charming french musician bowed his head to greet us as he was singing and playing "la boheme", lovely! We shared a cheese plate, I had the risotto de Mario and my friend had the preciutto mozzarella pesto sandwich. The cheese plate was simply BEAUTIFUL! I'm already crazy for cheese but my eyes were also eating this generous collection of soft and strong cheeses. My risotto was simply delicious, my friend says his sandwich was a delight. The food, the wine, the music, all were agents to produce a wonderfull experience, a genuine french atmosphere, for a very reasonable price. My friend Â and I are coming again soon!
