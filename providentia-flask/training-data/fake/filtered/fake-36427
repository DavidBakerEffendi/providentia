We were looking forward to dining here but we too experienced "the hostess" (just read the yelp reviews, now a few weeks later, and not surprised to see others with the same issue) who turned us off so much we voted with our feet.  The good news is that we ended up having a perfectly delightful meal and stellar service at Gramercy Tavern.  While we were standing outside deciding where to go instead, we saw another couple come out mumbling similar...beware.
