I started going to La Va because it was convenient, but would definitely travel to keep going back.  Its homey decor with funky couches and tables big enough to spread out and work, as well as art by up and coming local artists on the wall, make it a comfortable place to hang out and chat or work.  The La Colombe coffee is excellent, as are the specialty drinks made by friendly and helpful baristas.  I have a hard time understanding the review where the woman complained because she spilled coffee on herself!  The menu has a wide selection of delicious Israeli specialties as well other types of food--the breakfast sandwiches and the shakshuka in particular are not to be missed.  This is not pre-packaged food we're talking about here; everything is prepared in the kitchen on the premises.  As well, it's open until 9 on weeknights and 11 on the weekend--most coffee shops around here close at 6, so this is a huge plus.  It has character, friendly service, great food, and free wi-fi.  I cannot recommend this coffee shop highly enough.
