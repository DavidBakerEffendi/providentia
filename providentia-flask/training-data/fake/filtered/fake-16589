We went here Friday late morning. It was busy! The seating is great and after ordering I found something considerably easy and comfy - the space and set up is brilliant and flows well. The banana bread was yummy and fresh and the almond croissant was good too. Their lattes are fantastic and creamy with a perfect balance. They even catered for my little lovely when I asked for a babyccino. Everyone is so so friendly, happy, considerate, warm and welcoming - especially while it was super busy with people coming and going non-stop. Highly recommend!
