OMG SERVICE IS AWFUL... 2nd time and SERVICE has not improved.   I decided to tried it again and I experienced the same problem. We sat at a table by the bar and and the waiter came in quickly got us a round of drinks, after that She never came back.  In fact I noticed her eating at the bar guess lunch break?? who allows their employees to seat at the bar during lunch???  I had to go to the bar I ask for refills.  we were there for 4 hours and we went to the bar 3 times to get drinks.   My coworker asked for a manager and he never showed.  Food is good but the service is AWFUL.  Is the owner aware of all of this service issues? so sad the place is great enough parking its safe, food quality is good, but they lack bus boys and waiters.  Never again
