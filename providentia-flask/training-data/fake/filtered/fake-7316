This one hurt, I was expecting so much more! The hush puppies were good but the rest of the meals was below average. Tuna tartare tasted like soy sauce, the onion rings were very greasy, the cod was so bland and they had the nerve to not put salt on the table, baked beet was cold and again super bland. Will never visit here again, the hush puppy got the second star for them. Oh yeah dessert a huge wash too
