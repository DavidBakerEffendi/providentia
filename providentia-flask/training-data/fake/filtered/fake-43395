I've had this place several times.... If you do not get a specialty pizza don't waste your time.  If you enjoy pizza sauce that combines the taste of grease and butter you will absolutely love their cheese pizza!  Some say the best pizza in the Art Museum area... This maybe true simply because they are competing vs Dominos and Fairmount Pizza which is like saying Mike Vick is a better QB than Matt Cassell and JP Losman.  I ordered a large pizza but could literally only stomach 1 slice before getting a stomach ache that told me to stop while your ahead.  My body hates me right now.  I will never disrepect my body like this again.  I am fairly certain the chef ran out of sauce and tried to improvise by using a stick of butter, water, ketchup and and olive oil for the sauce of the pie.  All of the pizza joints in Philly need to step up.  If you do order Pizza in the city order from Slice.  The only place I have had that has a little respect for itself.
