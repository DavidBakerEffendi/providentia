First I am a regular here and at other restaurants in the Queen Village area and other parts of Philly. The food has always been excellent and the service impeccable. My tip for first timers at any restaurant is to ask for the specials and I have never been disappointed. Tonight I had the braised pork cheek and polenta and priced at only $19 it is a fine deal. But most of the specials Â here are moderately priced like this. The Beer selection are all micro-brews locally produced and seasonal and I have never had a bad one . There are also bottled micro-brewed and wine.
