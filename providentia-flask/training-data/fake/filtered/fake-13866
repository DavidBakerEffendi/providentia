I was super excited I came across this place, combining cheese & bacon, my two favorite things.. how could things go wrong?! Sadly they did, I ordered the aged cheddar with glazed bacon, tots and a tomato soup. The sandwich wasn't that good, the bacon was too sweet and it just left a weird taste in my mouth. Â The tomato soup wasn't as smooth as I was hoping, and the tots were just OK...nothing special, they reminded me of the ones served in high school. The best thing about The Melt Shop was the homemade lemonade and the homemade Red Velvet Ice Cream Sandwich. Everything else I had was just, eh. I walked away wishing I ordered a classic grilled cheese with bacon and calling it a day.
