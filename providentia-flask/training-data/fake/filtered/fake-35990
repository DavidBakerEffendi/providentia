The food and atmosphere are great! On the other hand, the staff is quite RUDE! I work in a super busy restaurant myself but these people aren't just busy quick rude(which happens in busy places) but they are "I don't want to talk to you or serve you rude"especially the people who answer the phone. I keep going back because the pizza is amazing but the service never fails to be cold.
