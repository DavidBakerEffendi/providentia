Friend and I dined here recently and everything from start to finish was perfect. Waiter was friendly and well informed about the menu and preparation of food. We tried the dips with pita bread. Three different dips bursting with flavor and warm fresh pita bread. Also had the crawfish appetizer special, which was excellent as well. For entrees, we had the delicious stuffed peppers and baby chicken that was probably the best I've had, crispy skin and moist chicken. The lemonnana drink was refreshing. The French press coffee was also wonderful. For dessert, the assortment of Cypriot pastries were yummy. The sticky date and chocolate cake was an absolutely perfect dessert - I am salivating thinking about the moist cake, warm caramel sauce and cool ice cream. It is a rarity but this is one restaurant I actually look forward to visiting again. The food is outstanding and the flavors are bright, something you do not forget. I love that the chef uses many fresh herbs in his dishes. I always disliked dill but after eating here, I've been converted! He used it well, so now I love it and actually cook with it at home. It is obvious the chef truly cares about the quality and taste of the food he serves. He checked on our table and made sure we were enjoying our meal. The prices are also extremely reasonable for the high quality of food. I can't wait to go back for brunch next time I'm in philly.
