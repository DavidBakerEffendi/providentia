Veggie Heaven is awesome!  I echo what everybody else says... YOU MUST GET THE SCALLION PANCAKES!   I also really love the wonton soup, sizzling beef (assembled table-side so it's sizzling when served), orange chicken, pork fried rice, and cheesecake. We always over order to have leftovers for lunch.  :) The bubble tea is pretty great, too.
