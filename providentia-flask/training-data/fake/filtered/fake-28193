I came here with my daughter and we are both mac & cheese fiends.  I was expecting the place to be a bit gimmicky, and that didn't bother me, but to be honest the mac & cheese just wasn't that good.  My 5 year old didn't want to eat hers, which is definitely odd because she usually gobbles up mac & cheese.
