Great Peruvian Food! - Montclair We just ate at: Costanera Cocina Peruana in Montclair.  Here's the web link: costaneranj.com It was just wonderful! My wife had the Quina Crusted Oyster Po' Boy.  I had the Estofado de Pollo. Just absolutely first class food.  Fresh, flavorful, not overly seasoned, just right. And reasonably priced on top of that. Nice atmosphere, good service. Just a very pleasant dining experience.
