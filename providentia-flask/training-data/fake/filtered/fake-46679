Someone I know had had a really good time here and brought a small group of us for dinner and I was disappointed. The table was small but that actually made it easier for us to talk since it was noisy, so it created a sense of intimacy. The problem was the food was just not that great. The tarama was really bland, the calf liver meze was okay, the best thing was the spinach. My main was so so. I felt like the only thing I would ever go back for was the spinach. My group skipped dessert so I don't know how they are. Everyone went for Turkish wine and that was something new and quite good.
