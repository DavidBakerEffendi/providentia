I get my nails done downstairs from Mamma Mia. Shortly after opening, I stopped by thinking id just grab a quick slice. I was amazed by the food. The pizza combos and so interesting and original. Everything is freshly made and delicious. I don't even like arugula and the arugula pizza has now become my addiction. The staff is so friendly and nice. They always remember me and treat me kindly. Â The restaurant itself is clean with a nice atmosphere. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and family!
