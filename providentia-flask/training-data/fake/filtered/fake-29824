This place has been my favorite when it comes to Portuguese for the last 15 years. Normally I would give it 5 stars, but I finally had my first bad experience after 15 years the other day. I guess I can expect it, but I hate to see the regulars try other places because of this. The waiter we had never brought us water when asked. Then we told him we were going to start with the Pulpo or marinated octopus. Usually excellent, but this time had some raw pieces. And the price went from like 8.00 to 12.00 and went from the size of a salad plate down to about the size of a large coffee saucer. Has never been the norm here. They have always had great food and generous portions with everything! The waiter never brought a basket of bread to the table( very un normal). Usually bread lands in front of you as you ass hits the seat here. Then I asked him about an item on the menu and he assumed I wanted it and placed an order for it. Â He was clueless. Hopefully he moves on in order to preserve this great places reputation! I have been bringing a friend here for at least the last 10 years and we decided it might be time to try another place now for comparison.
