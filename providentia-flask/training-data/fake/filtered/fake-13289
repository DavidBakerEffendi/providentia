We went there for a family dinner - a table of 6. Service was okay. At first it was amazing but as the night grew on and the tables starting packing up, it service quality decreased. My main entree was the Chicken Adobo which is a thigh and drumstick (with the bone) and they forgot my knife. One of the staff also jammed by the aisle behind us and knocked all our chairs and my husband's camera fell to the floor - thank goodness for its well-padded bag. Decor was nothing special. But when the kitchen was roaring, the place was lacking much needed ventilation and overall air. The food was okay. The appetizers were amazing - we ordering the Sizzling dish which is an entree but we ate it as an appetizer for our table. The crispy pork belly and these rolls (forgot the name) - all very very very good!! YUMMY. However, the entrees were Â a HUGE disappointment for us. The garlic fried rice was excellent but the Bistec (my husband got it) had a herb medicine taste and my Chicken Adobo was all salt and soy. The rest of our party got the Chicken with Waffle - it was okay, nothing amazing and the Crispy Pork leg - which was good but again, nothing mouth-watering. The price was decent. We ordered 3 appetizers, 2 beers, 6 entrees and 1 order of the tri-flavor ice cream for dessert (which was interesting - cheese, yam and avocado flavored) - and tip was included for about $235. At the end of the day, I would only go back for the appetizers however, since the entrees were a disappointment, we probably won't be going back.
