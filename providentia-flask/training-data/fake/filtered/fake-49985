Worst experience in a long time at a restaurant that purports itself to be a fine-dining establishment - Although we had a reservation, it was more than an hour wait at the overcrowded bar area, horrific vegan pasta (with severely overcooked, dead vegetables), and a bill that charged for an extra wine bottle.  Best of all, no one in the front of the house even to offer an apology at the end of the night.  Crappy food for an overpriced, unimaginative (and quite salty) menu.
