food was excellent..........sat on the second floor in a corner booth.......our waitress was amazing and knew a ton about wine......she even comped our desert .......the only problem was that half way through my meal oscar nominated actor  james woods (casino)  walked over and started eating our appitizers like he was at a buffet .........security was helpful ........other than that and katie jones hogging the bathroom it was fantastic
