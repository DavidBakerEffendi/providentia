Really?? I've eaten at all the popular & non popular ramen spots in NYC (& elsewhere) & Ippudo is the worst of all. I was soooo excited to finally get in there since they always have a couple hour wait & they have rave reviews.... Well now I know the reviews are from people who have either never had ramen before & liked the whole experience/atmosphere... Or people without any taste buds! Come on guys, this place is subpar at best! Totally flavorless broth & I mean NO FLAVOR!!! Ramen is supposed to have depth & savory notes-Ippudo's was so disappointingly bland. Oh, & super thin angel hair pasta noodles! It was all pre made like McDonald's & run in a factory setting. Very loud also. The prices are the most expensive in the city-which we would be more than happy to pay for if it actually lived up to its reputation! Seriously, all 3 of my friends were SHOCKED at how bad this place was! Go to Ramen Misoya, Momofuku, Sushi lounge, Zen noodle cafe, Ramen house... Go anywhere but here for good ramen!
