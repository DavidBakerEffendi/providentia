Go early or be prepared to wait for a table in theis cozy little bistro.  Wild Edibles gets packed most evenings, but trust me, your patience will be rewarded. I haven't had a bad exprience here yet. The servers are friendly and (surprisingly) knowledgeable (and have helpful recommendations ready for the indecisive).  They usually have a pretty interesting beer selection, too. Items not to be missed: Steamed Mussels Mariniere Three Tartares Fish and Chips (easily the best this side of the pond)
