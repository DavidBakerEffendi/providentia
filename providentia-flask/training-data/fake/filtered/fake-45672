It's really a shame about this diner - it's been open only about a month or so as I write this, the staff is friendly and because it's new, the place is clean and generally inviting, not to mention that its location is right on Rte 130, making it a dynamite spot to grab a fast bite because of its easy access.  But what a major disappointment it turned out to be.  Food was cold and remained so even when it came back from being "renuked".  Condiments were cheap versions of the real thing (you can taste it) and corners were cut in spite of the large portions.  For a Saturday night, you can practically count on one hand the number of patrons who were in the place, and that was a tipoff right then and there.  But now I know why.  Unless the kitchen staff is either changed or better educated on how to deliver a good hot meal, I believe that the diner will (or should) close down.  A true disappointment.
