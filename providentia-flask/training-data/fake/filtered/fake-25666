My dinner at Vitae was nothing short of exquisite. My boyfriend and I were celebrating his graduation and decided to go all out and ordered the chef's tasting menu. We were not disappointed. Each dish was a celebration of the senses. We enjoyed ceviche, scallops, three different pasta dishes, lamb and sea bass. To top it all off, I had a chocolate soufflé, which was served with espresso and cream on the side. The chef suggested I break open the soufflé and pour the hot beverage into it, and so I did. This was, hands down, the best dessert I've ever had in my life. It actually made me want to cry! How often does food make you emotional?? The service was also excellent -- attentive, courteous but not overbearing. We were served dessert wine on the house, too! I cannot say enough about this wonderful new gem in Midtown. I plan to return regularly and am looking forward to sharing this find with friends and family. I wish the owner/chef all the best in this new endeavor. I expect it to be a huge success!
