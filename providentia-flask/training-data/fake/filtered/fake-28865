Being a HUGE fan of Austin, Texas's Tex-Mex scene and having had real Mexican food in its homeland, I am super excited this place has opened. This place is a true rarity on the east coast. From the small details of "Worm salt" with their oysters, to having real edible cactus on the menu!!!!! After my entree, which was the "La Rosa", I was so blown away by how they handled their fish that I had to order their "La Mano" scallops immediately after. Everything is so fresh and well prepared. The staff and service are extremely chill and relaxed, but very attentive. The atmosphere is definitely an eat and enjoy attitude instead of eat and hurry up one. Can't wait to try the rest of their menu. "To all fans of Guero's in Austin, Texas this place will be a no fail for you".
