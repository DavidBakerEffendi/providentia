**ATTENTION** FOR ALL OF THOSE DEBATING ON WHETHER OR NOT TO GO TO THIS PLACE, PLEASE READ FIRST*** I enjoy italian food, very, very much. As a person of italian heritege and native of South Philadelphia, I MUST say that this was the worst piece of sh*t i have ever eaten. antipasti was without a doubt too cold upon serving, and the servers were the most rude I have ever encountered. When I say this food was bad, i mean i would not serve it to a roach. Not to mention the short little mario brother look alike manager/owner who was so obnoxiously rude when we told him we were not satisfied with the meal. This man should be ashamed to own such a shit hole of a restraunt. I DISCOURAGE anyone who is having thoughts of attending this place. Please, your better off buying and popping in the microwave a Mama Leone's frozen pizza from your local grocery store, then subjecting yourself to this crap and sh*tty service you will find at Le Virtu. p.s. i think the owner/manager needs a major lesson in the service industry.
