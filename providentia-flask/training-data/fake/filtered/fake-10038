By far the WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE IN NYC! The host is beyond rude and incapable. He has no idea what he is doing, what customer service means, or how to run a restaurant. The restaurant was completely empty and yet he was still flustered. Then there was our waitress. She too was clueless. Â When we asked what she recommended from the menu she actually said "I don't know - it changes so frequently". When she noticed our puzzled faces (we were all thinking, "Did she really just say that?") she proceed to "recommend" everything off the entree menu. Really, Extra Virgin? These are the people you hire? Or perhaps it is your management. It is basically being run by a bunch of inexperienced Hospitality students. The food was good and the setting was cozy - however I do NOT recommend that you go there if you want to enjoy your dining experience and not leave angry like we did. There are PLENTY of equal or better restaurants in the West Village that actually know how to treat their customers and are knowledgeable about the menu. Things that seem pretty basic as far as running a restaurant go. Thanks for nothing, Extra Virgin.
