What a disappointment. I'm going to preface this review by noting that my wife and I have had a number of meals at Blue Ribbon; one or two wonderful dinners, a few very good ones, and one or two acceptable ones. So, it should stand to reason that we would revisit Blue Ribbon for our final meal before moving out of New York City/Brooklyn. The evening started fine. It was about 9 on Monday, and the restaurant was all but filled, with maybe only 10 tables. We were seated quickly, and attended to accordingly, at the get-go. Appetizer: Potato croquettes. These were fine. It was a surprisingly large serving of two-bite sized potato and cheese pieces with a nicely thin and crisp crust. Far from the quality of the best dishes we've had at Blue Ribbon, but an okay start. Meals: Skate with shrimp, potato, and bacon: This dish was decent, slightly oversalted, but not bad. Soft-shelled Crab: Very mediocre, fried but limp and not crisp at all. The presentation and quality was below that of any ordinary restaurant. This dish was surprisingly subpar, especially considering the price. Chicken and Barley soup: Best dish of the evening. Dessert: We were not offered dessert, a check, or attended to in any respect for the latter half of our meal. We did not see our server after receiving our food. As you might read, the meal deteriorated steadily over the hour and a half spent there, both in food and service quality. We are always appreciative and friendly diners, and there were no interactions which would account for our eventually having to literally get up and ask someone to find anyone who would even give us our check, let alone take it after we had placed our credit card. Overall, I can say that this was a surprisingly disappointing way to end our time in New York.
