Reading terminal market is a Philadelphia landmark food shopping emporium in the Market East (12th & Arch) area. You can visit nearby Chinatown by walking further down on Arch street as well as the National Constitution Center, Independence Visitor Center, and Benjamin Franklin's grave site in a historic graveyard among a host of other sights. It's just blocks from the PATCO 8th & Market & so near Regional Rail it feels like a stop. Parking is at the 12th street lot and vendors "validate" which gives you a discount, currently(July '10) up to 2 hrs for $4. A little bit of everything, well, almost everything. Great produce, including several vendors with organic produce, amazing--think artisanal--cheeses in 2 different stalls, fish that you wouldn't throw back, bookstores, souvenirs, herbalist, jewelry, flowers, eateries including seafood, sandwiches, sushi, Chinese food and a winery stall w/tasting(you know it's good if they want you to try it to buy it!). If, however, you are trying to spend the day buying gluten free you may find yourself hunting hard for offerings. They do have Boar's Head meats featured in a deli stand that has the most helpful friendly staff. Thankfully there are tables nearby and this was my second stop after buying GF rolls at Whole Foods. I made an impromptu sandwich with sliced Boar's Head ham accompanied by ash-rind goat cheese and delicious iced tea. I found cookies that were gf, casein free and raw at a produce stand. I asked every worker at every food place that was open on Sunday--not all are--and most seemed baffled by my asking for gluten free. It's a wheat allergy, people!(well, also rye, barley and maybe oats). From the lectures about diabetes and moderation I could tell most weren't listening. A food allergy means you can't have any, and it has nothing to do with calories. Would you ask someone with a peanut allergy how much Jif he eats a day?
