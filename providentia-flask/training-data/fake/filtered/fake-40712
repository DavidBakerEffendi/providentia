Happened on Lombardi's by accident but we are so glad we did.  We had a wait of about 20 minutes, even though the place was very crowded that evening.  We ordered the Margarita pizza with roasted red peppers, mushrooms, and Italian sausage and we thought it was delicious!  The cash only policy is a downside along with only two single bathrooms but the experience of eating at one of the oldest establishments in New York City trumped all of that.  Wonderful experience.h
