Bad Brunch!  For $6 per mimosa I should be served champagne with a splash of OJ, instead I got all juice.  Ordered the Crepe with goat cheese and mushrooms, it was terrible.  More like a goat cheese burrito instead of a crepe, even the salad that came with it was over dressed in some weird thousand island dressing.  My husband liked his eggs Benedict.  The french toast was brought out to us and it looked pretty but was undercooked.  I don't like eating raw eggs, even if it is covered in pretty fruit.  My bad dining experience was only made worse by the bad music.  Avoid!
