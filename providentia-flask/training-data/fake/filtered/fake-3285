Fantastic burger joint! The flavor of the meat was excellent, and the bacon jam brought it all together. Most everything is made in house, and you can certainly taste the difference from the chains. Loved the hand-cut fries as well. They were crispy, and not over salted. If you want a real treat, try the bacon jam fries:)
