I read all the reviews and I have to say-are you eating at the same place? We have eaten at this rest for many years and my family and I love the place. They make the chicken broccoli extra spicey for me as well. I love the place and reccomend it highly. The ladies who check you out are very pleasant as well-and they dont mind my kids hanging out while the food is made. Try this place. Bill
