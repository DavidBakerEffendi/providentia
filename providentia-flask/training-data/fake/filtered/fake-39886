This IS the worst place ever. I agree with the other post.the food is tasteless Â the staff kept looking at you and I found it rude and the staff talk with an attitude and had no patience. If this place wants to gets better hire better staff better cooks who know how to cook and add more space it was crowed and finally lower your prices the food is not that great to pay that much
