Unfortunately Luzzo lost much of the quality he was known for - the last 2 times I've been there I've been disappointed by the poor quality of the pizza and it seem that the owners are cashing in on their past fame. I wish they could regain their original dedication and passion and bring their pizza back to one of NYC's finest.
