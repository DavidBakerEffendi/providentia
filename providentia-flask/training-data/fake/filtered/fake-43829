This is my favorite restaurant!  Although I don't get to go here that often, but when I do go, I am HAPPY!!! This place is good for smaller groups, 4 or 5 max.  I tried to make a reservation for my birthday, but they told me my party of 12 had to be split up into two tables.  Of course, I didn't go cause I couldn't leave my friends behind, but believe me, I had to think twice about it because the food is THAT GOOD. The food is great and so is the service. I've only been here for dinner.   Appetizers: Calamari - good, not great.  Isn't in my top five places to get calamari Mussels - we tried both the shallots and white wine sauce, as well as the chorizo and onion.  I would have to give the upper hand to the shallots and white wine. Entrees: Grilled pork chop - OMG, it is to die for.  The first time I had it, I was in heaven.  However, the last time I had it, the pork chop was a bit overcooked (might have been by the size of my party - 6 and we were ordering up a storm, we didn't even have enough room on our table ;x so our entrees may have been on the grill longer since we took a while to finish our starters - calamari, mussels, fries) Linguine con vongole - was a bit spicy for my test, but that didn't stop me from finishing my plate Steaks - My go to steak at Landmarc is the strip or skirt.  I've tried the filet as well, but I prefer the other two.  Cooked and seasoned to perfection.  You get to choose a sauce, but I prefer not using any. Oh, I forgot to mention the fries.  The fries are so DELlCIOUS. Dessert: Ice cream cones - cute, but not worth it. I will definitely be coming back here soon.  Oh, forgot to mention, another plus is there's always parking in the area.  I normally go on Friday evenings and there's always parking, which is rare in the city.
