Didn't have a great experience here. The portions are teeny tiny- like $5 for a skewer the size of my finger. The waitress was rude to us and although our whole party hadn't arrived, we weren't allowed to be seated, and weren't even allowed to order food while we were sitting and waiting. I won't be returning
