Note: This review is for Friday's All You Can Eat Buffet and the Club only. Date of Visit: Sept. 12th, Time of Visit: 7:30, then stayed for the live band This was the first time I've stopped here since it has been Rho Ristorante Discoteca. Before I attended it when it was KatManDu.   The best way I can do this review is to compare it to my former experiences at KatManDu--just to see who (in my opinion) did it better.  When I did go to KatManDu, I would usually go on Fridays (because of the live band), with Saturdays being a close second. Overall design, I do like the look of Rho, particularly the outdoor area--more welcoming and conducive to live band play during the summer.  I do wish the seating were more comfortable, since I couldn't sit at the bar or table for long periods of time due to the lack of cushioning. Food wise, I prefer the KatManDu ambiance.  There used to be more selection with the All You Can Eat Buffet.  The price increased (from $5 when it was Kat to $10 with Rho) but the variety as well as the quality of the food didn't quite stand out.  The Riesling I had to drink was nice, and the bartender was friendly. The live band was terrific and they had a great rapport with the crowd.  Yet it wasn't particularly crowded like it was back in the KatManDu days.  By around 10:30, the crowd that was there started dwindling down. This spot has potential and I'm definitely opening to coming back to Rho.  Maybe next time I'll try it during normal hours to get the full spectrum of the food.
