Went for breakfast as I wanted an outdoor setting with wireless and great food. All I got was the outdoor setting (sorta'), POOR wireless connection, and the WORST was the food. Tried both the home fries and sweet potato home fries (which the cubes were hard as rocks); both were saturated with a TERRIBLE Lawrey/Paprika seasoning. My eggs were under cooked. Asked for the home fries to go and the server put an orange wedge in with them, so it ruined even the orange! Got up charges for both the sweet potato and multi-grain bread I ordered; except that I was never told about the additional costs. When I sat outdoors, there were 2 cats and was told that the restaurant is their home. I mentioned that I have allergies so please try to keep them away. But instead, the server said I should go inside. Finally, bring CASH as they only accept cards over $30. I can see $20 but $30 really? To say that I would NEVER recommend this place is an understatement. Â POOR SERVICE, INEDIBLE FOOD!
