Sit at the bar and watch the food being prepared, and then you can try some new dishes.  The Sweetbreads on grilled fennel are outstanding, razor clams OK, goat cheese croquettes very nice, and even tried those unusual cock's combs once but not much to recommend them. Overall a fine place with a good and unusual wine list and a knowledgable sommelier.  Service has always been attentive and friendly, but I always sit at the bar. A bit pricey perhaps but consistent even through the staff has turned over about 3 times since I started going there.  Fun to go early, sit at the bar and chat with the staff too; small otherwise, but in good weather it's open to the outside.
