In one word Amazing!!!!!. Starting from every small detail in the service down to the food and deserts eastwick has it all figured out. I went with a few friends last week and it was simply the best meal I had in a long time. Starting from our drinks, we has great red wine dwon to my main course the special lamb shank it was great. The meat was perfectly coocked tender & juicey not extra seasoned so the natural flavor of the lamb was very present. My desert was great warm appale pie that was not to sweet and havey like in some places. Service was great and manager came to talk to us and welcome us, seems like they know the regulars here. I will gladly come to eat at eastwick again the first chance I get great experiance
