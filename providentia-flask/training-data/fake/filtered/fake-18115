This is an awesome hidden gem! I took a chance on this place when I found a yelp deal and favorable reviews. My girlfriend and I went for a nice dinner and brought a bottle of wine. Fair warning, there is a $5 cork fee, but that's not bad. I started with the Miso Soup, which was melt-in-your-mouth good. Our favorite roll was the 'flaming dragon roll.' It was so fresh and satisfying to the taste buds! The ginger was really tasty too. We would definitely go back. The service was great too. Try to get seating in the back, because it adds to the experience.
