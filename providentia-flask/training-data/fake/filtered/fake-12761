For our anniversary we wanted to pick a nice restaurant for dinner. I wanted to make a reservation at Babbo, but couldn't get one. So I figured I'll settle for Lupa... Only to realize that Lupa is not a substitute, but a top-notch restaurant with excellent food and wine.  In our opinion we had a better experience here than we had at Babbo. First Impression - We had a reservation at 5:30PM but we arrived at 4:45PM and the hostess was happy to seat us... no fuss, just pleasant... the Ambience is nice and cosy.. usually the first time at any restuarant we like to order the tasting menu .. because we believe that the chef present their choice in the menu ... so it has to be the best :)  .. Food/Wine - we picked the tasting menu with wine pairing. There is no formal menu with the listing the tasting menu course...but it is picked by the chef for that day and the sommelier selects the wine to complement the food. .. We don't eat red meat and they were happy to provide alternates... After a couple of tasty tidbits our appetizer arrived.. it was "Verdure Miste" a sampler of antipasti...every bite was delicious .. I am not a huge fan of cold appetizer ... this certainly changed that ... the other 5 courses were also very flavorful and delicious .. The best pastas we have every had ... The final course was a selection of cheese .. they were so fresh that you could taste the freshness.. Service - Extremely good service, the waitress was very knowledgeable and polite. Bottomline - Surely a keeper .. would come back again ... we have recommended this place to a lot of friends...
