Honestly, I could write about this place all day. The baklava need I say more?! Perfection. Staff is superb and on point. Lamb dish is always so tender and delicious. The way they use their spice combinations is so fun for any pallet. Love love love and I must say thank god for the great service it's so hard to come by these days!
