This place is great! It can be a pain to get a reservation sometimes, and their staff aren't all up to par, and that's the reason I can't give it 5 stars! Other than that, this is such a unique experience. No where else can you get Shanghainese food and not this good! Try the Green Onion Pancakes for breakfast! - They are thinner and crispier than what you know as pancakes, but delicious!
