Okay, so aside from a slice of pizza being insanely expensive, the service was horrendous. I'll give it to the manager, who Â tried to reprimand his staff after they were incredibly RUDE to me and my party (hence the two stars) ....However, maybe he saw me pull out my Yelp app and wanted to try and stop me dead in my tracks... Either way, I won't be making another visit to this pizzeria/bar.
