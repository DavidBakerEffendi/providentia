This is by far the best mexican restaurant I have ever been at! The margaritas are the bomb! we came again the day after just for the margaritas! We had the margarita Roja, the repossado and the regular one, all were amazing! Guacamole was perfectly seasoned! Everyone who served on us was so nice! will defiantly come again!
