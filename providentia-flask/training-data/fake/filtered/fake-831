From the minute we walked through the front door of this restaurant, I knew I was in for a good time. The atmosphere is incredible...very Manhattan like decor...modern, sleek. We went to the bar and were fortunate enough to catch the last hour of happy hour. The deal is half off of ANYTHING behind the bar. Being a tequila drinker and only enjoying more top shelf liquors, this was incredible for us. Â Top Shelf Grand Marnier margarita's at half off...It doesn't get any better. My friend was drinking some crazy good single malt scotch at half price...The bartender Jon was awesome. He told us that on Wednesday nights all bottles of wine are half off all night long. So we got an incredible bottle of wine for dinner (Half off)...The dining room was pretty busy, energetic and fun. Our server was incredible. We both had the $50.00 chef's tasting. I am new to Indian flavors and spices but the dishes ranged from infusion type small plates to some traditional items in the final course. Truly the funnest dinner out night I've had in a long time. Bravo Tashan. We'll be back!
