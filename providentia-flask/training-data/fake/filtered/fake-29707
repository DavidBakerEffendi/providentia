great late night spot, I tried it this wknd and thoroughly enjoyed myself.  The burgers were incredible, the fact that they freshly grind the meat and smoke the bacon in-house really adds to the flavor.  This really beats coming home to a bowl of cereal, and the girl working there is very cute and nice.
