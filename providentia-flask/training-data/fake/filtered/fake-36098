It's an okay place to go. If you really like rare, red meat then it's your place. I was hoping for at least one chicken or seafood but when we were there it was all red meat and because of how it is cooked, if you don't like it medium rare then you are kinda out of luck. The atmosphere was nice and everyone was very friendly.
