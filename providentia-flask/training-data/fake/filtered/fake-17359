The food is very tasty, not too expensive, and always fresh. The staff is friendly. I've eaten there a lot, not much lately. However...I've been there enough to notice that at times the same person at the cash register also handles food. There was someone who worked there (physically resembled owner's younger brother) who had very bad food handling habits. Once while waiting for takeout, I watched him eat his lunch, take money and make change, pick food from his teeth, handle panini's then take a piece of cake for takeout. All with his bare hands. He is not the only one though. Â Gross gross gross.
