Yum, YUM, YUM! How many places would you wait on line for 20-30 mins?  NOT Many This is one of them...When ranking NYC Pizza its almost impossible to leave this one off your list.  Yes Difarra, LUCALI!, Joe and Pats, etc are all just as good if not a bit better BUT There is only ONE Artichoke slice and hands down its the best "specialty" slice around. Yes I'll take another slice please!
