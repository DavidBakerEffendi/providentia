OMG where do I start. Had made reservations 5 days in advance for a party of 20. Was told we would get a private room. I asked if there was a DJ available and was told yes. Celebrating my sons 16th birthday there with friends and family. Reservations were for 7pm. I got a call at 625 if they could push my reservations out to 745. stated I couldn't do that as I was traveling almost an hour away and was already on my way there as well as everyone else. They said they would handle it. Got to the restaurant manager said it would 20 minuets. Long story short we sat down just before 8pm and NOT in a private room. to top it off my sons girlfriend never got her food and I was told they forgot to put it into the kitchen. Show was so so. Even though we were comp drinks the whole night was just a disaster!!!! So I can guarantee that we will never come back!!!!
