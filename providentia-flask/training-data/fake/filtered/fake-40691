We had gone to Lombardi's after hearing so much about it and I am happy to say they lived up to their reputation. Since we went late in the day (close to closing time), we avoided the crazy lines we have heard about/seen for this place. They also had some live music going on at the time. We got both veg and chicken pizzas and they came out fresh and yummy! They are cash-only so make sure you have cash when you go there. Overall, yummy pizzas--definitely worth a visit.
