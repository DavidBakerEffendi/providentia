Terrible experience!! We will never go back there. The waitress was rude. After we finished eating we were relaxing  and having margaritas, this Asian lady we had have the nerve to say "you are my last table, do you mind paying?" I was in shock, disbelief, discontent with this type of low class service. Being the fact we were still having drinks after eating, and to top it all off she had the nerve to drop the check off at the table when we had the intention to order another round of drinks.  My friends and I were so turned off by this experience it would be our last.
