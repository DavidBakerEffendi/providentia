We ordered a Salsiccia and a Diavola pizza. They were decent, much better then you get at any standard late night pizza place, and priced well. We decided to try them because it said they accepted credit cards... though we found out not on delivery orders. Pros: * Inexpensive (relatively) * Fast delivery Cons: * Overall not as good as Gruppo or Posto (same basic area) * Credit cards not accepted for delivery orders
