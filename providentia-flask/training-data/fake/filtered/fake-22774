My husband and i have been to Trumbull Kitchen a few times before last night and have always had a wonderful time, food is great, staff and service always wonderful. So when i found out about a comedy show at Trumbull Kitchen for charity i was pretty excited to attend with my husband. $50 per ticket seemed pretty pricey for a comedy show there, but it went to charity so it really wasn't bad at all. But when we arrived, we were beyond disappointed. The show was supposed to start at 7, but it actually didn't begin till almost 40 minutes later. The sound was terrible, and we were sitting pretty closely, but there must have been trouble with the connection and mic because we could hardly hear anything. Drinks took a while and the apps that they were passing around took forever as well and it seemed like complete chaos. It was noisy and people kept yelling and talking loud while comedian was on stage. Even the manager (Jose?) was there, but he could not have been a worse guest to this show. He even got yelled at a few times by the comedian! He was loud and kept making a scene. It was pretty embarrassing to even watch the way some people were behaving. It was for a good cause and people were just incredibly rude and left their manners at the door. Our server was very sweet, but you could tell she felt overwhelmed, and i don't blame her. Dealing with everyone by yourself seemed a bit poorly planned on the managers part, but then again the manager was drunk the whole time, so what did he care?! And the comedians...thats a whole different story! I very rarely go out to dinner late on Sundays because of an early start to my work week on Monday and the only good thing that came out of last night was donating that money to charity. -Very disappointed.
