I went to Sea Fire Grill and I thought it was great! I had a great experience and enjoyed delicious food. I ordered the yellowfin tuna which was extremely fresh and had lots of flavor. The drink menu was extensive and was made to perfection. I had an amazing time and would definitely recommend to everyone who enjoys seafood and a good time!
