The food was very tasty.  But to be fair it wasn't something I new, which makes the price point a problem.  I'm new to the Philly area so maybe this style of food is hard to find, but I've had similar quality a lot less; it just isn't that unique. What makes this an even bigger disappointment is that you don't get enough to come close to filling up.  Hey, I get it, it's tapas style - I didn't expect to leave full.  But I went to jose garces place and got more food on the plate than I did here.  At $100+ in food I should not be walking down the street to find dinner afterward (yes we did this, why order more when you'll only get one meatball?). They recommend you get this big thing of salads to start.  I figured that was code for "if you want to feel at all full get this."  Big let down.  Like kimchi but when you go korean you don't pay $24 for the stuff.  The cauliflower is delicious, but there were 10 small springs on the plate.  I just don't get how you can charge me money for that. Service was off the charts, music was schizophrenic and kept me entertained. It's a good place that needs to increase portions or drop prices.  I will not go back and I wouldn't really recommend it to a friend.  There are better ways to blow your money
