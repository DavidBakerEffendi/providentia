My husband and I went to dinner on a Sat. night around 6:30. The place was packed, yet we only waited less than 5 minutes to be seated in the dining room. We brought our own wine, and tried 3 of the Specials offered that night. We were very satisfied with every we ordered.The stuffed Calamari appetizer was as tender and tasty as can be. The salad was offered with a home made white balsamic vinaigrette. We also ordered 2 entrees: the Halibut with artichokes, gaeta olives, tomatoes, and garlic over fresh baby spinach and the Sea Scallops & Shrimp with the home made macaroni. We were able to take our time eating, with ample time in between courses to digest. The atmosphere was as good as the food. I would definitely recommend this restaurant. The chef knows how to cook like home! During our visit, on occasion, the chef would walk around the dining room and engage in short conversation with the patrons to make sure everything was alright. Thank you Joe's for a great meal.
