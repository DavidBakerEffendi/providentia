Everything is so delicious here and randomly the yuca burger is one of the best I have ever had. Shrimp, avocado, and corn salsa on a burger?! Wow.The yuca fries are also awesome. Just like the waitress said- tastes like a mix between onion rings and french fries. Prices are amazing compared to portion size and shear deliciousness. So so so highly recommended!
