Came here for brunch on a Sunday, and the food was delicious. Ordered the Organic green eggs with quinoa hash browns and they were amazing! The waiter recommended a middle eastern hot sauce instead of ketchup, and it was the perfect complement to the dish. Definitely recommend trying this place out!
