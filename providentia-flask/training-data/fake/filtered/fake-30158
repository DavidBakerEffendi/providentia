This place went from being my "Casellula is too crowded" back-up to my first choice after I tried their homemade soft pretzels and super-sweet smores. Service has always been very friendly and helpful, good values on the wines, really delicious nibbles. Nice indoor atmosphere, but outdoor seating's only view is of the potholes on 52nd. I'm not complaining though. In any other location this place would be jam-packed at all hours.
