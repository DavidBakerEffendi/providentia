We placed our order online and was told 40-50 minutes, with a price of $37.20. When called to check on the order, we were told that they never received the order and would just be starting it now, 35 minutes after we originally ordered! When receiving the order finally an hour and a half later, we were asked to sign for $45.73. When questioned, the delivery man informed us that if we sign he will honor the $37.20 Â because that is what we originally signed for and were told the price would be. When calling the store, the lady was extremely rude and told me "Whatever," you signed for it already and you got your food. I told her this is no way to speak to a customer, and she repeated "whatever, bye." And hung up on me. I will never be ordering from this restaurant again. There customer service is terrible and they will charge you more than you originally are being asked to pay after you receive your food. Disgusting!
