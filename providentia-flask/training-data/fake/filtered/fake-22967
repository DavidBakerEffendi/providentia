It's hard to beat the five hour-long happy hour that's held every night.  The signature drink is the $5 lychee martini or the $3 Yuenling.  Rest assured that the bartenders are generous.  They will fill the glass up to the brim and drop a couple lychees in each and every drink.  No matter if you end up sitting down at a table, standing along the middle of the venue, or sitting in the designated seating area (that fits at least 30 or so people AND they take reservations for large parties!), the service is always responsive and efficient.   When I do make plans to be at Verlaine, I like being early and I don't plan on ever having a meal there.   Ladies, it's the perfect spot for you and a few girlfriends to hit up and have a good ol' chit-chat session before continuing on with the night to dinner or to another bar.   Gentlemen, it's the perfect bar to take your chances on a classy lady.  You will have to overcome your insecurities and intimidation though, because I guarantee you, she will be with a friend or two.   P.S. - No matter how crazy it gets in there, the bathrooms stay clean all night!  :)
