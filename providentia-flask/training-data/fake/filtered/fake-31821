The ivy is by miles the best Princeton has to offer in the area of non-yuppy, cheap drinks, and decent - easy to hang out with - people... Don't he suprised if you get roped into singing kaoroke, playing cornhole, or engaged in some all night conversation - it's the kind o place where most people know each other, and are always looking to include new folks. I hit it up whenever I get the chance... Be careful, though, because cops patrol at closing time around it... Anyway - gets my highest rec... Best place to cap off a night in p-town.
