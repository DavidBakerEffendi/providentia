We have eaten at the Vegan Tree a number of times and it is ALWAYS GREAT.  The food tastes really great and it tastes very fresh.  I always leave there feeling really happy that I went.  The people are really nice.  I just realized that I am putting the word "really" in front of everything, but it is to just drive home the point that the Vegan Tree REALLY is a GREAT restaurant.
