Legend has it that the original Frank was allergic to tomatoes, thus the white clam pie. Don't know if it's true, but it sure tastes good. You should know that there are two oven here now. The new oven does not taste nearly as good as the old oven, but at the time of this writing there is no way toa sk for them to cook your pie in the right oven. Good luck!!
