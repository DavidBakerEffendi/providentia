Slow service but good food. It's a little strange to be at a restaurant like this in Macy's as it is much nicer than you would expect a restaurant in a department store like Macy's to be. We aren't talking Barney's or Bergdorf's here, yet the Stella's could easily be in either. I was a little upset when it took 15 min to bring our drinks and then the entrees came out prior to the drinks. The point of a cocktail is to enjoy it, atleast in part, prior to getting your food. Don't bring out the dinner and then drinks after. The host realIzed my displeasure and sent over a complimentary appetizer which was a nice gesture. Is go back if I was shopping in macys, but wouldn't randomly go there as there are a lot of equivalent restaurants elsewhere in the city.
