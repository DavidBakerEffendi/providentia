First time there since the renovation...and I guess new owners. WOW...what a difference! Very upscale...the building is gorgeous! Great bar...cozy atmosphere with fireplaces. Menu has an Entrees section and Tavern section. Entrees section a little pricey. Food was great...very interesting dishes. Steak was above average...not great...but still good. Tried the fried deviled eggs...very interesting. Service was great...friendly staff and very attentive. I'll definitely go back...and looking forward to turning friends onto the place. Something different than the usual. A+
