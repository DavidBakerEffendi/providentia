This was perhaps one of the most pleasant dining experiences I have ever had. First and foremost, the food was delicious and authentic--something sometimes very difficult to find. Secondly, the service is honestly the best I have ever had at any restaurant. My friends and I walked into the restaurant about 1/2 hour before they closed and I was expecting the usual sassy remark to get us to leave, but they urged us to stay (in a very friendly way). The restaurant was clearly family-owned and had a nice atmosphere to it due to this. There were no smart ass kids working there that hated their job--these people loved it. Since it was our first time, they took the time to explain everything and even gave us multiple free appetizers and even a drink and dessert. Rarely do you find a restaurant that truly loves its customers and also has amazing food. This place does.
