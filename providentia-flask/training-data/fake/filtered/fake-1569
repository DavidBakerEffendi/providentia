This place is one of my all-time favorite restaurants.  The beef stew and ropa vieja are my favorites.  Delicious black beans, red beans and yellow rice.  Really good coffee and flan for dessert.  My Puerto Rican friend once told me to try the "morrir soñando" and it was AMAZING.  It was frothy and creamy and reminded me of a creamsicle.  It's also unbelievably cheap.  If you want some delicious, affordable food this is the place for it.
