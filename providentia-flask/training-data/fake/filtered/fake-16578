I don't know where to begin, from the horroble service to the awful chiken dish my daughter had.My family use to go quite often ,but have',t been ther in a few months.We were the only customers in the place and still couldn't get any service, had to actually walk around and find some one to get our check. The waitress was the worst I have ever seen. When I was leaving I asked if there was new owners, and someone asked me why I don't know if he was a owner or manager, and I told him because it use to be so good, and how awful my experience was and all he could do was tell me the server was new, didn't want to take responsibility for the problems. Also wanted to mention the very dirty wall we were seated next to it looks like soda was spilled all over so if they are not cleaning where customers are sitting have to wonder what the kitchen looks like. Will never go back unless someone else buys it.
