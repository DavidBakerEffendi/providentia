Why doesn't this place have more credit for their wings? Better than J-Tims (newington, ct) in my opinion for those of you who are appreciate a good wing and a pint The Tavern is for you. Good beer selection although i've seen better. Â Service is also prompt, I had the Blue Boy Burger that was mouthwatering and cooked perfectly. (5 outta 5) My girlfriend had the Tavern Salad with walmuts, cranberry and fetta, it was good but had WAY too much dressing. I'd ask for Sauce on Side. Defiantly a return
