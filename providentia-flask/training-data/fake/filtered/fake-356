Last review for a weekend of reviews: Took some out of town friends here for lunch today. Decent. Pats got a new sign across the street, that people in line in front of us were talking about. Now to the steak.......kind of fatty. Thought "the chewy fat" would be cut out while on the grill. The "wiz" sauce or actual cheese will have you craving more! Who cares what it is....wow! Will return for sure.
