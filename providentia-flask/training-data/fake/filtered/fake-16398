We ate here two times this weekend.. no kidding.. after the first meal we invited some friends to join us on Sunday night. The food is terrific and the wait staff is attentive. We ate in the garden both times. The inside space is long and arrow and there really is no decor. It is a difficult room Â to make cozy and welcoming. I so wish the owners luck but it would seem that they will need to have a fast turn over and a full room in the colder months when the spacious garden is not available.
