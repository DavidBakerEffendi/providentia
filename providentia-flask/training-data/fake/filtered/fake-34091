I LOVE this place! I go there often. Sometimes with friends for brunch or dinner and sometimes just with the company of my Ipad or a good book. This place reminds me of the cafe in the TV series Friends. It is SO cozy and beautifully decorated. Makes me feel I am somewhere in Europe. The staff is super friendly, the crepes delicious and the coffee superb. I have tried pretty much all the crepes here and can't figure out which one is my favorite. I like them all! I am addicted to the coconut gelato. Sometimes they get incredibly busy and the service can be a little slow, but that is to be expected in any restaurant, Dr.s appointment, etc, so I am not going to judge them on that. The prices are incredibly reasonable too!
