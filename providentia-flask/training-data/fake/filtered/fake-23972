We were a large group and during my phone call, I was told that we could not order anything off the menu -- we had to get Restaurant Week choices, served family-style. As soon as we got to the restaurant, the waiter encouraged us to get a couple of additional meat dishes. We did but there weren't enough pieces for our group, and this changed the anticipated price point. The restaurant week menu was unbalanced -- bread balls, a delicious but scant amount of bean soup, two pasta dishes with no additions to speak of -- one severely underdone. Portions would have been adequate for 4 less people than we had.
