This morning I ordered breakfast from Toms and wasn't disappointed! At first,my initial order was messed up, and the delivery man rang my bell despite instructions not to do so (he woke up my grand parents). One quick call to Toms, resulted in a new delivery, with additional items for my grandparents to make up for the earlier delivery. THE FOOD WAS DELICIOUS! ( Ham, steak and eggs. YUM!) Â And the customer service was as sweet as their hot chocolate! Thanks Toms! I'll be ordering again!
