Great place, just wandered in and had an amazing meal, from apps to entrees to wine. Three of us ate, had the tuna tartare with avocado, french onion soup, tomato soup, chicken, mussels, and white wine. Everything was great, they had no problem with the small substitutions we requested, and the staff was really friendly and helpful throughout, without being intrusive or overbearing. The atmosphere is simple but classy, relaxing, and not too loud. i'll definitely go back when i'm in the neighborhood!
