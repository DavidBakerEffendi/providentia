It was ok. Kind of expensive and our waiter ignored us for most of the time. Very long wait and I don't know if we just ordered the wrong things or what but the sword fish was chewy and the calamari was bland. The only thing I LOVED was the lemon potatoes. Now they were yummy! Won't be going back. If I'm spending money like that, I want to invest it not waste it.
