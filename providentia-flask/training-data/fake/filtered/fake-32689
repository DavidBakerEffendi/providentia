OK me and my wife enjoy sushi and we were looking to try something new. Found this little BYO in Nutley and tried it out. I gave the place 3 stars, 5 for the food and 1 for the atmosphere. There was only two people working there, the chef and what appeared to be his son so the service was poor at best. Also they have Â a TV blasting CNN or some other news network. It was very annoying. That being said the food was very good. The miso soup was delicious. My wife had the rainbow roll and I had the spider roll and moshi-moshi roll, all very good. If you are looking for great takeout this is the place. Just don't take your date there....
