As a once a weeker at Wazu, I feel like Norm at Cheers. Most of the time it's the usual Great Wazu sandwich. I have been eating them for 20+ years. On my Great Wazu off days, its the Tuna (which I never get anywhere else but the Wazu) always fresh and tasty. So, see ya next week guys and I'll be Yelping. I'm still debating whether or not East Hanover or Parsippany make a better Wazu, they both rule.
