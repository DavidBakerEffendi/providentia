I recently was on a business trip and was staying at the hotel nexts door, and My coworks and i decided to head over to Dragonfly and grab a bite to eat . And as we walked in the door the decor took our breath away, The host took a lillte a while to greet us but, After they sat us at booth. The server came and made sure our experience was nothing like any other resturant we went too. The sushi and food was amazing had my taste buds in a fenzy... Overall my coworkers and i really enjoyed the resturant .
