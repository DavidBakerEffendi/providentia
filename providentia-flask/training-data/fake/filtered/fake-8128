This is my absolute favorite lunch spot in New Haven.  The food is delicious - try it all.  Tapas for lunch are perfect, and no sandwich or pide will disappoint.  Service is wonderful and friendly, the atmosphere is cozy and quiet - a perfect spot to catch up.  The prices are wonderful at lunch time with an average of $8-10.  Add a few dollars and get Turkish coffee to finish your meal.  A gem!
