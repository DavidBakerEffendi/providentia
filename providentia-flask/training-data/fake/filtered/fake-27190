I was totally appalled today when we were given a hard time at lunch because my father was in a wheelchair. The manager was incredibly rude and actually said that he didn't want to waste a 4-top on only two people even though we live in the neighborhood and are regulars. He made a big deal about "blocking the aisle" when there were empty tables available. Luckily for us, the waitstaff recognized us went out of their way to rearrange a few things to accommodate the wheelchair. Â As for the food, it was fine. Nothing to rave about.
