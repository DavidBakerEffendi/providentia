The BEST pizza hands down! If you do not get the Sicilian you're missing out. After you eat about 3 of those (because they are so good) make sure you get their Spumoni. Their ice cream is great too. They have an outdoor patio which is packed during the summer. There is also a restaurant there which I haven't tried yet but I heard it's just as good. They have parking which is very limited but people are in and out of there so it's not so bad. Or you can just take public transportation.
