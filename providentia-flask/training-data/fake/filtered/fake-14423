This restaurant continues to surprise me.  They serve up good solid classic Thai-American food.  The dishes are rich and sweet. The red curry is excellent, as is the Pad Kee Mao.  Although, I wasn't very impressed with the Pad Thai.  The brown rice is different from the standard dry brown rice you get in restaurants -- and definitely worth a try. Spice is on the high side.  Order mild even if you like dishes a little spicy.  I am used to very spicy Mexican and Indian food and the medium is too spicy for me -- to the point where you can't enjoy the flavor. The one negative is that this restaurant is really overpriced.  If you order two dishes it is well over $30.  You can order lunch during the week.  The noodle dishes are the same size but the curries are half the size of dinner portions.  If they would lower their dinner prices I would order more (and eat in the restaurant more).  Honestly, at these prices I am sometimes tempted to drive to Origin Thai in Somerville where the food is a little more refined and the atmosphere is a little more intriguing.  That said, for Somerset/New Brunswick Thai food, this is the best.
