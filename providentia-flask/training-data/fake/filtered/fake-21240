A friend and I visited this restaurant last night. We found it very disappointing. We ordered their mixed grill, fries and borak. The borak was greasy and minuscule. The bread was lovely - the parts that were not burnt black. The salad must have been at least two days old. The grilled tomatoe was bravely turned upwards was burnt black underneath. Not a recommended restaurant
