Based on a few of the reviews, I found myself exercising more care than usual when meeting Gaia my first time at her cafe. However, I really think it was unnecessary. I agree with others that she is a sweetheart, and I think that what the negative reviewers are picking up on is a cultural gap in terms of what Americans are used to in the food industry, and Gaia being unwilling to conform to that expectation. I was polite and appreciative of her cooking, and no one should need a reason to do so - it is natural human decency, and not unreasonable for Gaia to expect it. The food was delicious and well-priced. My father, who has some dietary restrictions, at first asked Gaia whether she could alter a dish. She expressed a slight frustration with the very American request, before offering to make him something else. The young men working in the cafe were not rude at all - very kind! In addition, we were not charged for our drinks and some cookies I picked out! A wonderful experience for me, but I can understand that if you are the type of person who approves of the motto "the customer is always rights" and expects to place your order seated at your table, then you will dislike the way that Gaia runs her business.
