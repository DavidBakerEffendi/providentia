Chicken and waffles.  Fantastic.  Amazing syrup, and the hot sauce was pretty good.  Had a Cafeteria cosmo to drink (cosmo is not my usual drink, but it really was perfectly made).   Highly-recommended!  Only down-side is way-too-loud music, if that's a downside for you.  They turned it down when we asked.
