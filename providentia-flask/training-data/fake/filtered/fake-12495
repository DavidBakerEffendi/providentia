At first the place looked busy when I entered and I figured it might have been a bad idea to head here on a lunch break. But surprisingly I was sat right away and food took only a couple of minutes. I had a pulled pork sandwich. It was pretty good. No complaints from me. Great place for a quick bite. I will be back again.
