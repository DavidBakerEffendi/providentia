Best pizza in Brooklyn. Seriously. I grew up here and will grow old here. Get yourself a square slice and finish it off with a spumoni ice. NEVER waste your time with the 'fancy' indoor restaurant wing as that's just meh and over priced. Oh, also, this is one of the best people (guido) watching spots in Brooklyn. Always a good time. This place is a must to all Brooklyn visitors and to those who call yourself - be ashamed if you've never gone.
