Just ate at a great fast food restaurant in the Chelsea area that opened this week to raves from all the customers I sat next to.  I'm very impressed with their congenial staff and delicious reasonably priced food.  I highly recommend this unique eating experience and can only say if in its first week the lines were out the door this place is a homerun.  Can't wait to come back for lunch.
