Stumbled upon this place and was not dissapointed.  Great atmosphere with good music playing during the entire meal.  The beer selection was unique with some local brews.  My fiancee had their "Summer Sangria" which was delicious and had lots of fresh fruit in the beverage.  Our meals were equally delightful.  We both had cheesesteaks, her's vegetarian.
