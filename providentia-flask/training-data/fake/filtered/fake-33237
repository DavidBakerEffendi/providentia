Everything was awesome! I am a picky eater and so are the 2 friends that came with me.  Whenever we choose a restaurant someone isn't happy. All 3 of us easily found something on the menu and then thoroughly enjoyed what we picked.  The bruschetta was amazing!  Our server and the manager on duty were both fantastic, actually all the staff was extremely pleasant.  We will definitely be eating there again!
