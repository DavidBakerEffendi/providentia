the food here was pretty good overall. I don't ever try French food very often. But I though I would try something different for a change. I did like the crossants for the most part but they were just a tiny bit dry, sorry to admit! The service there was just okay,though some of the staff there were not as friendly as other plcaes I've been.. not rude, just not really friendly either. The 1 thing that makes this place not quite a 5 star would be the bathroom. It was kind of dirty and smelled when I went in there, and that's kind of a big issue for me. Clean enviroments, especially places serving food is an absolute MUST. It can sometimes be the difference between whether people come back or not, and based on that alone I dont know if I would.Between a 3 star and 4 stars, I guess I'll be generous and give 4 stars.. in light of the holidays season
