This place is obviously very good. All you need to know that is the 30 to 45 minute wait times on weekend evenings. Aside from Chavella's up the street, that's pretty much unheard of on Franklin Ave. The menu has not changed much in the year or so since they've opened. I can respect limited menus that concentrate on a few great items, but there's a fairly limited vegetarian selection. I'll not need another appetizer with the roasted peppers and burrata on the menu, and the white bean pesto is also excellent, but the pizzas on the menu, as well as every special they have, seem to be geared for the carnivore. Also, it's the best designed restaurant in the 'hood, by far. Unless there's a loudmouth sitting next to your table Â (not Barbie's fault, but it does attract its fair share for some reason), all sections of the restaurant are comfortable. They did an excellent job that justified the wait for its opening.
