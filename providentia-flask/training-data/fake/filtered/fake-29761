I've come to Ellary's Greens for dinner and brunch five or six times in the past few months and have been so impressed with the quality of food, service, and atmosphere, that it is fast becoming my new favorite restaurant.  While I'm not a vegetarian, many of my friends are.  This is a place where we can all meet hungry and leave happily satisfied.  There are so many marvelous choices of greens, grains, and protiens, imaginativly seasoned but with an emphasis on fresh, bright, straightforward flavors.  This is a great restaurant for ordering a bunch of little plates for the table to share. I love that I can order a snappy juice concotion (especially at daytime) that is as satisfying as a cocktail but much more healthy.  Though on my last visit there I discovered their utterly irresistable sangria (maybe a special that night?) and I may never go back to juice. The space is beautiful and airy, lovely during the day with natural light pouring in from either end of the room; intimate and romantic at night with flickering candles and exposed brick on the walls.  I get a sense that the staff enjoys working here because they are warm, welcoming, and smiling--happy to engage with customers, yet completely professional, never crossing the line into getting cheeky. A word of advice: save room for dessert.
