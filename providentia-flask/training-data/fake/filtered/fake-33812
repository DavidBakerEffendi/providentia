I ordered their food from delivery off GrubHub. (They conveniently got rid of their Leave a Review link so this will have to do). Basically, they have pretty decent food but ridiculously slowwww delivery. I'm at Rutgers-Newark which is pretty close to their restaurant and placed the order at 4:15PM (15 min after my class) and told them to deliver it at 5:30PM sharp (10 min after my class) thought things should go off without a hitch and I'd be eating sticky BBQ babyback ribs right after class but boy, was I wrong. I got a text soon after telling me they got my order and an ETA of 5:10-5:20PM) Huh, kinda weird...I thought. But I didn't think anything of it cause it would probably be a little late anyways. I got yet another text revising the ETA to 5:30-5:40PM which I again ignored...guess they saw that I asked for it at 5:30PM. My class ends. No food. They don't get to me until 6:10PM, and even then he went to the wrong side of the building. I got my food in hand at 6:15PM, exactly 2 HOURS after I ordered....I left a tip on my card but the whole time I'm thinking these ribs better be amazing. I went upstairs and opened it up, they're dry rub ribs which I was a little disappointed in but they did include extra sauce which was really really good. They include a TON of rice and (soggy) fries in every half order so really someone could split a half order, I would imagine the whole orders could feed a small family. All in all, the food was just what the doctor ordered but it just took too damn long to get it.
