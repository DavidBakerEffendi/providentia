Ashley was amazing. The service was excellent, the food and atmosphere were the same. I will DEFINITELY be back here. I ordered the hangar steak and my girlfriend had some sushi, both plates were great. I'm a server at a restaurant; I really appreciate a great dining experience and this was definitely one of them. Â Great job once again ASHLEY!
