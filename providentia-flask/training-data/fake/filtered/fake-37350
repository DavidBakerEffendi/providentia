I went to a small get together at a friend's house about a month ago and upon entering the house I was greeted with the most glorious smells and some truly tasty hors d'oeuvres. I asked my friend who had made the food and I was introduced to a really nice guy who mentioned that he worked in the kitchen at a French / Mediterranean cafe in Northern Liberties a bit north of Honey's on 4th. I'd never heard of Cafe La Maude before this, and his decision to describe the cafe by location rather than by name was a good one, because on a stroll home down 4th street this past Sunday I found myself walking by the cafe and remembering the wonderful hors d'oeuvres I had just a few weeks prior. The cafe has a wonderful atmosphere with a large window that opens up out onto the street and all the charm of a true French cafe. The food here is really unique and really delicious. I shared the Foul Moudamas Platter and a Halloumi Press sandwich with a friend and both were out of this world. The hummus on the Foul Moudamas Platter was spicy, garlic-y and delicious and had that texture you only get from the real home-made stuff. The sandwich was almost meaty in texture with the thick slices of grilled halloumi with a great fresh peppery flavor from the musculan greens, & arugula aioli. As reviewer Ettya F. mentions the food has "the perfect confluence of French, Mediterranean, Turkish and Portugese" influence. And it really does. I think the next time I'm in the area I may very well pass up brunch at Honey's for this hidden gem just down the block.
