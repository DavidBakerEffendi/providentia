I am stunned by any negative comments about this new neighborhood gem. First, the beautiful red head bartender was knowledgeable, accommodating and friendly...the food rocked, the vibe was completely fun. I am not a whiskey drinker but Ms. Redhead made me a delicious special drink with lots of lemon. Â I will so return to this place, over and over and over. The bacon dish was sublime, the beet salad was better than anywhere in the city...great food, warm reception, it doesn't get better than this. (Don't skip the pork nuggets.)
