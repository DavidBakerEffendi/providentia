Love this place!   Something for everyone, great drinks and plenty of menu choices.  My husband is a big fan of the beer selection.   Love the Happy Hour and even though I'm not a big sports fan, it's a great bar to watch a game.  Staff is friendly and I've always had good service here.  I've been several times and have never been disappointed.  Prices on food and drinks are very reasonable.  Love the Steak Salad and the burgers.
