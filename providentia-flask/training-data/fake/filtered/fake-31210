Food is great and excellent customer service is also great . We had a great time. We are also excited about Friday Karaoke !! We will be back. I'm Peruvian and my guy is Italian and we both loved it. We had been to a location in Montclair and both places are out of this world. We will be back. We are a fan of the ceviche as an app and we go from there. Lack of decor in actual dinning area but that wont stop us from returning. Loved the food!
