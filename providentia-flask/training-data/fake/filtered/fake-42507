Well I'm honestly very disappointed to be giving this review from what used to be one of my favorite places to have roast beef sandwiches and gravy fries.... the last time I was here (a couple months ago) with a friend.  As soon as we finished eating we saw several (and I mean several) huge cockroaches running up the wall.  I got startled as I was sitting closest to the wall and then other people at tables around us also noticed them.  I don't know if they stay to eat since we were already on the way out. This alone has made me not want to come back!  So long roast beef goodness!
