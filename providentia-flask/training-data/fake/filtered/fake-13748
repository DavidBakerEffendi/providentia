I am a pizza enthusiast so couldn't wait to try a pie at Juliana's.  I finally had a chance today and wasn't disappointed.  It was a fantastic meal, from start to finish.  The space was warm and inviting, as was the service.  We started with the arugula salad, which was fresh and crisp, and the delicious calamari, which wasn't greasy at all.  Four of us split a large margherita pizza with pepperoni and a large special pie (with broccoli rabe and sausage).  Both pies were hands down better than the pizza at Grimaldi's and each bite was better than the next.  The dough was light and airy and the ingredients are clearly top notch.  For desert, I'd definitely recommend the Brookie Bridge, which has a big scoop of ice cream from the Brooklyn Ice Cream Factory sandwiched between two brownie/cookies which are chocolate-y and gooey and downright delightful.  Juliana's exceeded my expectations (which were high to begin with) and I will definitely be back.
