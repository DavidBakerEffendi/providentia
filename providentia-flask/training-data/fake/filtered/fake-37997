I went to this seemingly charming place with my husband. We chose to sit at the bar, and boy what a mistake. We had the world's spaciest bartender who couldn't tell us much about the meal items I was curious about... I'm a pescatarian, and when I asked about their three different salmon options, the bartender seemed surprised and said "I didn't know we had that many salmon dishes, but the chicken is sooo good". This after I told her I didn't eat meat. She also took way too long to pour our beer, seemed confused and had to ask us several times about our order. Again, I get this place is new, but it wasn't that busy. She also went on about performing spells for the equinox and ended up giving my husband her "body work" card so she could massage him. Excuse me? My husband found the whole thing hilarious, but I am not impressed.
