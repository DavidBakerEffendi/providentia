Service was... strange. Food was good. Sangria- that I tasted but didn't order- was too sweet. I ordered a well vodka with soda, which cost $9. Congratulations to Calle Ocho for having the most expensive house vodka (regular pour) on the Upper West Side.  It's annoying. Feeling ripped of on cheap vodka is not a good thing. Usually I feel ripped off on salads and coffee. So this is a first. The black bean spread that came with the bread rolls is delicious. De.Lic.Ious.   My fish dish was great, the tilapia was perfectly cooked and very fresh tasting. Leather table cloths are a good idea... until some three-year-old writes on them in crayon, delivering permanent damage,  like the one I was sitting at. Horray for taking Discover.  I keep running into places that don't. All in all, a lovely experience, just annoyed at the well vodka price. When people say "well" they mean "cheap," so it should be cheap.
