like it but not for a repeat performance.  always a good place to take visitors not made for kids at all.  The most memorable spot that I actually can remember after walking out the door is a booth that sold pretzel dogs deep fried and dipped YES THE WHOLE THING DIPPED in butter.........the decadence is amazing.  Otherwise I don't think I can get beyond the coffee shop when you walk in the door.  I just don't remember any of the other shops.  but think about it DEEP FRIED HOT DOGS WRAPPED IN PRETZEL DOUGH DIPPED IN MELTED BUTTER
