I so wanted to like this place, but sadly I cannot being that my salad was littered with a MASSIVE BUG today!  As much as I love the idea of fresh farm grown greens, do they not wash the lettuce?!? And how can the chef miss a bug that size!?  Simply put, the menu's wording is more appetizing than the actual dishes.
