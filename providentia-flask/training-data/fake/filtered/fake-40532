The service was very poor, beginning with the cold hostess who has no idea how to manage the floor of a restaurant. We had a two hour wait until our table opened up--would have left except I was there with a group for a birthday. We sat down and then waited another 45 minutes for our food to come out which was cold. I've heard reviews about how good the burger is, and it could be, I was just served one that had been sitting under a heat lamp for 30 mins. Its just another overrated nyc burger bar that serves $15 burgers.
