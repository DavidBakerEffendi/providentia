Best Indian Restaurant for having the best atmosphere. Great decor and ambiance. The only bad thing is the price. Food taste is good. Not exactly authentic Indian Cuisine but was ok. Price is too high to feed yourself. overall was a good experience. I would come back with a beautiful girlfriend, otherwise I would wait for a handsome paycheck to have a meal there.
