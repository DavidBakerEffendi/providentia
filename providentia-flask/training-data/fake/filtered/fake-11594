El Rey is the real deal!  I went last week for lunch with my girlfriend.  $10 lunch special is a cheap way to fill up on awesome food in a really cool and well thought out space.  Chorizo nachos were bangin- you can tell that the chips were made in house.  I had braised short rib enchiladas and my girlfriend had chicken tostadas.  Both were spot-on texture and taste wise.  I will definitely go back.. probably in a couple of hours.
