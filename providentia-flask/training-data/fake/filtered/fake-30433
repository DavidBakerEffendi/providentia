REALLY GOOD!!!!!  Be ready to stand - no seating.  Their chili is excellent.  Cannot say enough good about their dogs - really nice snap to them.  Hits the palate just right,  bouquet and finish all superior - spicy!  I did not try their famous relish only because I don't like relish.  Directions on GPS are a little squirrely, but you'll find it.  Bon apatite!!!!!
