I discovered this place about 6 months ago on way to Costco and figured I'd try for lunch. Ordered the Dos Tacos and was disappointed that everything lacked flavor, even the refried beans tasted flat. Loved the complimentary chips and salsa, which they promptly replenished when the basket was empty. Gave them another try a couple weeks later and had the Mole de Pollo with a side of corn tortillas, which was a hit! The portion was huge, left overs came home, and the leftovers tasted even better! I've tried all their lunch specials and my top pick is the Camarones Mexicanos, which offers succulent shrimp, fresh crunchy onions and bell peppers, and great mushrooms in a flavorful sweet and tangy sauce on a bed of rice with a bit of cheese, and a side of avocado and sliced tomatoes. I went for dinner there last month and got the Camarones a la Plancha, excellent! The staff is very friendly and I've gotten to know a few of them over the months. The prices are very reasonable, especially for lunch. Love the Mexican decor and music. I'm from Southern California, and out of all the Mexican restaurants I've tried in the New Haven area, Puerto Vallarta is the best. I recommend going there for a late lunch or an early dinner to avoid the crowds.
