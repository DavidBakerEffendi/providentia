Although the lists of Indian restaurants in the US are endless, I found the flavors and spices of this Chettinad-South Indian style to be very intriguing.  I thoroughly enjoyed the combination of kurma with fresh and soft whole wheat roti.  This is a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  The owners were courteous, customer oriented and reasonable with prices - refreshing attitude.  Shall certainly return.
