This place has an exceptional lunch menu. I had the Grilled Blue Fish and it was delicious. The portion of fish was a good size and the citrus sauce that was added really gave it a unique flavor that was not over the top. My father went with me and started out with dozen Shibumi oysters that he loved and were gone in about 10 minutes. Â The Yard's Love Oyster Stout compliments nicely and is specially made for Oyster House. My father's main course was the Smoked Salmon Reuben which is a lot better than it sounds - the smokey flavoring of the fish works well for this dish. It came with a side of chips which seemed a little out of the ordinary for such a pricey menu. This was my first time going and I cannot wait to go back. The bar is very nice with the chefs shucking oysters right in front of you. Overall, great food, great atmosphere with friendly wait staff. I put this in the $31-60 range per person because you will definitely be spending at least $30 if you start out with a dozen oysters. But depending on what you get, you could probably eat for a reasonable price.
