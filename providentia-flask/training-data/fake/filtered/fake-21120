The Inn is by far my favorite restaurant in town. There isn't a single thing on the menu I've tried that I haven't absolutely loved. Two appetizers that are not to be missed: the calamari and the fried deviled eggs. The calamari is done two ways, sweet and spicy, like nothing you've ever tried before and so incredibly fresh every time. The fried deviled eggs are coated with a panko breadcrumb crust and have a hint of spice in the filling that's outrageous - a great twist on a classic dish. As for the entrees, I'm a huge fan of the lobster and shrimp fettucini. A light and creamy sauce with amazing quality lobster and shrimp and a mix of vegetables. Another favorite entree is the soft shell crabs. Every time I see them on the menu I simply can't resist them! To finish off the meal I'll usually split the bread pudding, which is the best I've ever had (seeing as its one of my favorite desserts to order anywhere I go that's saying a lot!). Â  Prices are definitely reasonable and with a list of great $25 bottles of wine it's the perfect date spot for me and my boyfriend. Also heard that they are planning on re-vamping the menu to include some new great Italian dishes and I can't wait to come back again and try them out! If you haven't been to the Inn yet now is definitely the time!
