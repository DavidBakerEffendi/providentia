Loved the food!The best pork stick and fries, tzatziki sauce and pita bread i ever had!Even now my mouth waters,just by writing about it.That reminds me that i haven't tried the rest of the menu,but i think i will.The best way to end this delicious dinner or lunch is coffee and zoumero, highly recommended dessert for the most fanatic choco-lovers as my self! Nice and cool environment.I had a good time!
