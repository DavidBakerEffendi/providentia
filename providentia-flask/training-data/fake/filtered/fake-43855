The food is below average....certainly not worth waiting for...the only reason we went there was because of the gluten free pancakes for my daughter.  My wife ordered the Mexican scrambled with pancakes...the mex scrambled were not very good...they had a different texture to them, and the pancakes were under cooked ...we sent that back and asked for two eggs over hard, and they came out a little runny.  The manager tried to make things right and talked her into trying a belgian waffle...he said, "sure, put whatever she wants on it".  The waffle came out ok, but by that point, we just weren't into it.  Then we get the bill, $13.00 for the waffle, and come to find out, nothing comes with a $13.00 waffle.  I proceeded to speak to the manager about the inconvenience we went thru, but he claimed "they made it right" by bringing us that oh so wonderful $13.00 waffle....good thing we didn't want a $3.00 side of sausage or anything.  I claimed our inconvenience was worth some kind of discount, but the manager flat out responded "Well, now, since your asking for it, I'm not going to give it to you."  So, overall, the food is below average and overpriced and certainly not worth waiting for, and the manager, that day, was not very good.
