This place is ok. I went and had the duck and it was delicious. But for the price they had on the menu it was such a small portion I was still hungry after I ate. It was just a let down because I love duck but it just wasn't filling and didn't do enough to satisfy my experience. Ok place, def not worth the hype. I'd rather go to Deltas in New Brunswick and pay those prices and end up with a more satisfying product. I dnt think I'll b trying duck here again anytime soon.
