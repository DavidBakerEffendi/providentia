Let me start off by the ambiance of restaurant. Small, cozy, but very noisy place. I almost could not hear colleagues across the table. Waiter well trained and top service. But foods was below average, maybe because my expectation was set higher by all the hypes in review. Plus, I Was the one to bring all my colleagues here for special occasion. Here are Pros Cons Recommendation Monkey Bread: Good 4/5 Barbecued Octopus: 1/5 Im open to new asian fusions, but taste did not blend! Scallops:  2/5 salty as rock salt Bucatini: 2/5 Ive had way better at local store Roasted Duck:  3/5 One of the best we tried. Recommendation: Do not come here for the foods. But just to try the new asian fusion. I would not recommend to friends. For 500$ for party of 4. Hm.. Waste of money, could have gone to somewhere nicer, better, and way fancier.
