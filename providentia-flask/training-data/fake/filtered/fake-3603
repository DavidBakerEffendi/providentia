our go to spot for sushi.  we've tried ki sushi which was good, but way more expensive.  iron chef is local, has a cute intimate atmosphere and friendly waitstaff, and the fish always tastes fresh.  we've tried a ton of different roles and the hard rock continues to be our favorite.  i so badly wish it were BYOB, and then it would be perfection.  regardless, we still go here about once a week.
