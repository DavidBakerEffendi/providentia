Came here for brunch. Yummy and charming.  The decor is so warm and inviting.  They have an open kitchen so you get to see the cooks move around in the kitchen when they get your order.  We came somewhat early so there weren't that many people around, the service was nice because they kind of left you alone which I really like, however others may take that as not being attentive. Liked it very much, great decor, cozy, would recommend to a friend.
