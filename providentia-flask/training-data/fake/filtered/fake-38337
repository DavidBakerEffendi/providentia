Stopped in to Ah'pizz for a quick early dinner the other night.  I was very excited being my family came to this country from Naples, to have what I thought was going to be a nostalgic experience.  Nope.  Fancy pizza oven, same ol pizza.  Nothing authentic about canned tomatoes and store bought cheese,  had the "fococcia" to start, it was a pizza with nothing on it, correct me if I'm wrong but isn't focaccia thick soft luscious bread with a crispy top of herbs and sea salt with good olive oil?  Next I tried the pizza Margherita, it was ok.  I was hoping for a nicer flavor from that wood oven, just didn't get it.  Had one other app and my wife had a pizza as well with mushrooms and goat cheese, very creative, total bill over $60.  Pricey for average pizza, I'll try one more time but I truly hope this was an off day.
