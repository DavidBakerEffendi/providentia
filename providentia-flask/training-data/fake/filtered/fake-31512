This was my first time at Blend. Overall, it was a wonderful experience. Our waitress Felicia was very knowledgable about the menu and made some great recommendations. She was pleasantly attentive and answered our many questions about dessert! : ) The food is delicious - and so are the drinks! I would definitely return. It was a busy night- a full house - and our food came out piping hot and quickly each time.
