Well, it is a nice vegan-cafe... I used to love their sandwiches, but now... They are ok, but really not much more. My favorite used to be Tuna Sandwich (vegan Tuna, obviously), but after having it a couple of times I've noticed that bread is often burnt. Grilled Vegetable Sandwich is ok, but really nothing special. However, I still looooooove their donuts! They are amazing! So, skip sandwiches and stuff, just take the donut! Better three!
