I visited The Smith on Saturday night after making the reservation based off reviews. After telling a few friends were my reservation was, they all had good things to say, and I agree. Although our reservation was for 9pm on a Saturday night, we didn't get sat until closer to 9:30, which could be a bit annoying, but they immediately brought us two appitizers to apologize for our wait, which we all greatly appreciated because we had planned to order a few of our own. The brought us bacon wrapped peaches & their chips with cheese. Both were delicious. Dinner was also great, I had the short rib with some awesome potatoes, similar to the patatas fritas they sell in Spain and loved my meal. Drinks were a bit pricey, but lets be honest, this is NY. Our waitress, Lynzie, was great, we constantly had our water and drinks refilled. Added bonus -- there is a photo booth in the basement which is a lot of fun, but takes 5-10 minutes to print your picture. Just a fun little thing to do if you are waiting though! I would reccommend this place and will probably be back for more!
