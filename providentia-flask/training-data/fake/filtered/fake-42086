I stayed (very well) at the refinery hotel so I tried P&Q restaurant many Times for breakfast and once for dinner. Breakfast was good but the service sometimes was poor and also slow.Some mornings waiting for a table you need a lot of patience and TIME. The evening staff's changing makes the service better and not so slow. I and my son have eaten some chicken, and I've drunk a beer. The food was good but nothing special. The prices are not Low but being in midtown anyway might be also more expensive!
