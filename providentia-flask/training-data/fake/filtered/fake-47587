Service: Came in to enjoy a meal with a friend. Ordered just a single pie with some toppings. Amazingly we were seated and eating within 10 minutes of entrance. Before the new restaurant, the line used to twist around the block, now its just a few feet next to the old place, which is also a pizzeria. No credit cards. ONLY CASH. $4.50 ATM FEE. No beer. Busy place, wrong orders can occur. Poor guest appreciation (old place had a brighter attitude), however, if compared to Totonno's, well then G's got best customer service. The servers are very respectful and attentive. Food: The food is good regardless of the customer service. This is why I am giving this place a 4 star rating. This place moves a lot of traffic so the circulation of fresh ingredients is accurate. Setting: Awesome romantic setting, while you sitting next to almost 50 people. Â  Old Rating: "One of the coolest and tastiest joints in Brooklyn. Limited seating but its worth the wait. A great place for a first date. I bake pizza and can vouch for their sauce and dough. Sometimes the pizza is slightly burnt but you can always ask to make sure that its not. Service is busy but precise. "
