The worst waitress iv ever had wait on us, we had a party of 10 and called ahead to tell them and they do not take call aheads. The hostess who was very sweet let us know it was an hour wait, we agreed to wait and went to the patio to have a drink, The bartenders were so rude on the patio, didn't even say hello. After waiting an hour for our table I checked in to the hostess who informed me they were waiting for the table to leave, finally after waiting for TWO hours for our table we finally got sat at 10:15. Our waitress was Lee Ann. She was rushing us to order the moment we took our jackets off, after telling her to give us a few mintues to get settled she came back again (looking annoyed) asking us again. We ordered about 7 appetizers of food and drinks. Don't get me wrong the food was amazing; I tried the hummus and lobster mac and cheese, I'd eat it everyday. A friend with us at the party wanted to buy a round of drinks off the tables tab, so he walked to the bar to get them. Lee Ann then yelled at him that "I have to tip them out them don't tip me, and if you need something so bad you can ask me!" After we finished eating and still ordering drinks from lee Ann who them seemed to have an eye rolling problem everytime we got another round, told us if we weren't ordering food we had to leave because other tables were waiting to sit down she had to make some kind of money tonight. So I informed her that we had to wait an extra hour for our table and you didn't kick the guests you had before us out. At this point we were all so disgusted in our experience we decided to leave.I have been a waitress for 7 years and I have never treated a table so rude in my life. She hardly deserved the 20%. you won't see us again in any of your restaurants Steven Starr.
