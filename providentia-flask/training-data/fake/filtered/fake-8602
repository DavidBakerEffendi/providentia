I only going to said one thing, IF YOU EXPECTING TO EAT YOUR FOOD AT 1.00 PM. PLACE YOUR ORDER AROUND 11.00 AM. SOOOO SLOW. I palce a order on Nov 5 at 1:34 pm by 2:18 the food never arrive. When I call then they said we STARTING to prepare the food now, you have to wait 15 to 20 MORE minutes for your food. It was alredy getting late for me to go work, I have no choice but cancel the order and go to work without lunch cause I have no time to order anywhere else. I HATE this people. I hope they go OUT of bussines SOON
