So loud you can't hear across the table.....if you get here early (or late) enough, you have a better chance of actually enjoying the cozy surroundings instead of screaming  yourself hoarse just to address your server.   The monk  fish special was laughably tiny, with two slices and some tiny potatoes for $20.  Pretentious and pricey....full of itself.....left me still hungry.   "Noise level:  average"  ??????
