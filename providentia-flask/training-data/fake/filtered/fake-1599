Decent food cute inside decoration. However I feel as though there are two downsides. The counter help is terrible! Everytime I venture in black n brew i'm always greeted rudely almost as though it is an inconvenience. The food is good. However the ingredients are not top notch quality. Overall, I avoid black n brew unless totally necessary anymore.
