Horrible service, the waitress was to busy talking instead of taking our order.. took literally 45 mins to get 2 eggs over easy and not only did our table get half the orders the food was cold.... i ate my food 1st then literally 3 mins later my husband got his 2nd. and toast was cold like a rock..... when you get the food yes its delis but the waitress need to focus on people instead of her friends
