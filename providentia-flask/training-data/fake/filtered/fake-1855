Disappointed to say I'm done with this place. I like to support local and small businesses, but if they forget to remember they are one then everything goes downhill from there. I ordered a sandwich once (and I will admit they have very fresh ingredients) and changed some of the items the cashier was a bit rude and said then that is not the "so and so sandwich," although I've made this order before. The sandwich was for a lesser value and he returned some of my money back, so I gave him the benefit of the doubt... Although I couldn't really shake off the feeling that he was trying to be smart... all while doing this in front of other customers. Sadly I've been back a few more times since it is really convenient. However today will probably the last time as they have this habit of coming up with different prices for the same orders. My friends have been experiencing the same thing. It's too bad because I did like the place but meh there are way too many options here in Alphabet City and I don't mind mind walking the extra block. However, if they have been good to you, continue supporting them. The sandwiches really are good and the serving is always generous.
