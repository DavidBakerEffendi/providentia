I am a native Manhattanite and have been coming to Cafeteria for many, many years (just to give you an idea of how long the place has been open) and tonight I was appalled by the behavior of the doorman. We had a group of 7 people and they treated us like dogs. We were a group of 7 professionals, and unlike the doorman, we had all earned degrees beyond GED's, but he treated us like shit. The funny thing is, I've been to the best hot-spots in NYC, and have never been treated with as much disrespect as I had at Cafeteria. And then to rub insult to injury, they let in 3 trashy girls while we were waiting. After that crude display, I realized how much the caliber of this place has declined. Citizens of NYC, don't waste your time here - the clientele here are trash (as are the employees) and there are other 24-hours places in the neighborhood that not only serve better food, but provide better service.
