I agree with the other negative reviewers on here and would not recommend Skappo to anyone. My husband and I were completely misled by the high/positive reviews, as I'm sure many others have been. I never like to judge a book by its cover, but in this case I wish we had. Initially we were happy to be given our own table and not be seated on the awkwardly large 'picnic' tables that take up most of the restaurant, however, our table was extremely sticky. My husband literally had to peel his cell phone off the table! It's not really what you expect in a restaurant and it gives a horrible first impression. The shabby menus were falling apart with pages missing and the menu choice is very limited. We also had a long wait for our food - we waited 30 minutes for just one serving of crostini, then we had another long wait for the rest of our food (chicken with broccoli and mushroom, & black risotto) both of them were terrible, the chicken was extremely dry and both meals lacked any real flavor or seasoning. Our waitress was also extremely moody and didn't bother checking up on us or clearing the table. Overall, it was a terrible experience and one that my husband and I would never like to repeat.
