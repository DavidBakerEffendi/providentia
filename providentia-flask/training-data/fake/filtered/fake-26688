This place is awesome! The food is great, it's inexpensive, and the employees are all extremely friendly and helpful. The felafel is fried to order, and the pitas are super fresh. Also, the best thing is that they are one of the few New Haven food establishments that stays open late. Way to go, Pitaziki!
