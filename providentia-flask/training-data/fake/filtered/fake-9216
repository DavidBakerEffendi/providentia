So underwhelming.  Had Bone-in Filet.  Asked for medium, came out really rare.  First bite?  Gristle.  Whatever you expect for $56, this ain't it. Also tried friends NY Strip.  Not that tender, with minimal flavor, other than the pool of butter it was sitting in.  Can honestly say the NY strip sold at Wegman's market is better.  What a shame
