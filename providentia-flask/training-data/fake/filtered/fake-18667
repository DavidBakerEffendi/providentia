We were in New York for my daughters 21st birthday. I made a reservation at the gramercy Tavern on recommends over the Internet.  It was well worth it. We had a wonderful evening. The staff were so nice and attentive without being over top. Nothing was too much trouble.  The food was excellent, sooooo good, we had the tasting menu, seven courses each one different, each one small but after five courses I was beginning to fill up. Wonderful will definitely return when next in New York.
