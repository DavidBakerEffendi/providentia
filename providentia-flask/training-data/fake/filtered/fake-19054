I have traveled some and I know you have heard this before and I know I am biased, but the best pizza in the world can be found in New York City.  Period.  But if you are looking for the best of the best, or something very different TRY THIS PIZZA. First of all, don't order more than one slice for starters.  The standard artichoke slices are very, very filling.  This helps compensate for the higher per-slice price. The crust is extraordinary and the creamy artichoke topping is like nothing you have ever had before.  It is amazing. The only small beef I have is that you normally have to wait on line.  But this only a small beef because what waits at the end of that line is fantastic.
