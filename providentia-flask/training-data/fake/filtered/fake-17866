My partner and I tried Pandang because we were really craving a good pad thai.  We opted for take-out.  We got our food home and started opening.  The first thing we opened was the Tom Kha Gai soup.  It was wonderful, with great flavor, even if the chicken pieces were too big for a soup. Next, we tried the spicy tuna roll.  We thought that it looked like something you could purchase at a gas station, though like another reviewer said, it had a lot of fish in it.  The shrimp pad thai wasn't any better, completely lacking in flavor and appearance. And the shrimp wasn't very good either.
