Anxiously awaited the opening of Agricola, was so disappointed!  They should have taken less reservations and done it well instead of trying to do it all and do it so poorly.  We waited 1 3/4 hours for our food, no one was interested in addressing the slow food until finally a woman seated near us with a young child complained, they finally left having fed their child but not having their own dinner.  The waited was left to handle unhappy diners, no this fault, no management in sight.  Our food was very average, pork chop was fatty and dry, pasta average, pizza, well it's flatbread pizza, good , but not all that.  It was very loud and crowded.  Expensiv for what is was.  Limited menu, no specials.   Decor was everything, trying to do it all, it felt felt fake farm not authentic.  Wall decor in our room from was a collection of faux ceiling medallions from Home depot, nothing to do with farm, my chair was so rough on the edge it tour my leggings, it was very MEH.  We will return to our favorites, Mediterra, Peacock, Witherspoon and anxiously awaited Scott Anderson's new place down the way.  Too bad, maybe with time, but what can you expect from the owners of Panera?  Bad service their too
