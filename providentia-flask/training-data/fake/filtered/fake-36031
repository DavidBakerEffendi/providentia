Roberta's is in my boyfriend and I's regular rotation, for sure. We love the food, service, aesthetic, and atmosphere. Admittedly, I usually stick with a marg or white and green pizza, and he goes for a calzone. So I can't really speak for the kitchen menu items. The beer selection is usually terrific. All of the servers we've had have been spot-on; nice flow and instinct about when/how often to come around to our table. Cassandra is a doll. I love the outdoor and indoor seating areas: lots of wood furniture, christmas-style string lights, and mix matched decor that just works in a weird way. Prices are certainly a little bit too much for most things, but I can't deny that I love how Roberta's uses ingredients that they grow themselves. They're a small business with a lot of passion, heart, and great taste, so I don't mind paying a little extra.
