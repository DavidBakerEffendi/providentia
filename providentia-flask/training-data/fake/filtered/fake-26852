These guys are the best in the business. I was so excited when they opened a cart on 30th Ave, as now they are the ONLY halal cart I go to. They are just as good as their cart on Broadway, the only unfortunate difference is they don't offer the beef kebab at the 30th Ave cart, only at their Broadway location. Every time I go, they are always very friendly and generous with their servings, and they'll always give you a sample falafel while you wait in line, which will settle any doubt about the quality of their cooking. The second you take that first bite of falafel, you'll skip home like a giddy school girl until you get to eat the rest of your food. I've tried just about everything they have on their menu, and I have never been disappointed. Great chicken, great shawarma... the true Kings of Falafel. All I ask, start serving your beef kebab!!
