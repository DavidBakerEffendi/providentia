Edi & the Wolf got it perfect.  The attention to detail is apparent from the second you walk through the door - the place is just damned cool - and continues with the wine and meticulously prepared Austrian fare.  The Wiener Schnitzel (veal) was phenomenal, but so was everything else, including the yummy desserts.  Nice selection of Austrian beer as well for those who don't want wine.  Well worth a trip to Avenue C .... or in my case ... welcome to the neighborhood Edi & the Wolf!
