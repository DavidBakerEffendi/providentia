Hurricane Irene turned out to not be that bad in the LES and on a lark, my roommate and I came here in search of their delicious Bloody Marys and fried calamari. Luckily Verlaine (mind you the owners were there bc they gave the staff a night off.. AWESOME!!!!) was open on that Saturday! They were welcoming and funny and the food was great!!! It made the storm go by so much more quickly and happily. Love Verlaine!!! It is in your best interest to go. Seriously might be the best bar in the LES, no joke, yo.
