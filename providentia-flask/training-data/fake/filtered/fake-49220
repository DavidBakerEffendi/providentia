Let me first begin by saying that I've been to the Dragonfly a couple of years ago, when the location in Linden first opened. It had and has a wonderful atmosphere, with decor that is both contemporary and somewhat traditional Asian, such as with the light fixtures. I particularly like the aquarium wall that parts the majority of the restaurant from the bar area. For an Asian fusion type of establishment the pricing is reasonable and thus not about to break your pocket. After something of a hiatus, I returned to the Dragonfly about a month ago with some friends for drinks. Let me tell you, the bar is where it's at! It is fun in a bottle, or in this case, a glass! My server, a young woman by the name of Kasia, was fun, knowledgeable and an overall delight to be around. In fact, I noticed all of your bartenders were just as friendly and knew what they were doing. But for some reason, our bartender stood out above the rest. Perhaps it's her fun loving personality behind the bar that brought it all together for me. Because I've already been back a few times since. Thank you Kasia, for always making my experience at the Dragonfly, a night to remember. I'll be back. Balmir J. Telis a.k.a. The shaved head that comes in on Fridays.
