Yesterday I hosted a small private party for my grandaughter's 16th birthday at Rats.  She is an artist and wanted to share the Grounds for Sculpture with her friends.  Chris, the catering manager, worked closely with me on the menu and, boy, did he deliver.  The sliders were superb, the macaron and cheese (small pasta in a decadent multiple cheese sauce) and the chicken fingers were great.  The bread was terrific as were the fancy desserts served tapas style.  The dessert plate for the birhday girl had Happy Birthday written in chocolate around the edge.  The wine room was perfect for a small group.  John, our waiter, went out of his way to make our experience special.  I would do this again for any special occasion.
