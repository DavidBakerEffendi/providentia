This place has definitely stepped up their food offering in the past few years. It always seemed like a neighborhood-only bar where everyone knew each other and outsiders were not welcome.  That has also changed. We had - the panzella salad, which was pretty good the fish tacos, which were great parpadelle bolognese, the pasta was cooked perfectly, and the sauce was good, however it had a citrus taste to it.  We couldn't figure out exactly what that flavor was.   Ambiance is really nice too in the restaurant, not so much in the bar.
