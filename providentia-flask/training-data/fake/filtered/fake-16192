I've been here a lot now and haven't had a misstep yet. Food has always been delicious; from the truffled mac & cheese (sinfully delicious) to their big, fresh salads. Cocktails are also yummy. Only downside: it's quite loud. Between music blasting from speakers positioned over the tables and other restaurant goers, you may need to shout to be heard.
