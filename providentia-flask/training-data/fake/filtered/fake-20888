I never had tried Japanese food before. But I regret now. I should have tried them many times ago. "TERIYAKI BALLS" with Shrimp filling was really good. Overall I had a good time there though had a bit confusion with my order at the beginning. Other than that Â they were really good. I will be back again for more Balls. Ha Ha.
