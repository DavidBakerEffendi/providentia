Chimirri's made my wedding cake and OMG it was sooooo good! All of my guests kept complementing me on the cake and asking where I got it from. It was strawberry mouse and they were not cheep on the filling it had 3 layers of filling with big chunks of strawberry. Absolute Heaven! Â Not to mention how beautiful it came out! Lorena captured my vision to a T. My wedding colors were dark purple, silver and burlap and she nailed it! Thank you Lorena for making my wedding cake something I will remember forever!
