Went here last night and it was perfect. I had the skirt steak and my girl friend had breaded chicken. We also had the avocado fries which were really good. If you eat meat, get the steak well worth it and not a bad price ($18). The only negative thing was how much ice was in pitcher of sangria, single glass is probably better value. Not worth taking a star off though. We'll be back here for sure.
