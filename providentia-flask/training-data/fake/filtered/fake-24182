The Corned Beef /Pastrami Rueben combo was out of this world.Food smackdown rightous. Our whole party was attending a convention accross the street and Hershel's came highly recomended by the people at the hotel and at the convention center. Boy were they right. The staff was incredibly friendly and everyone in our group gave it two thumbs up, A definite don't miss in Philly. Will without a doubt go back when we return.
