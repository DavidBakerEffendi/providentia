I have been craving a falafel sandwich ever since I went to Mama's for lunch last week. $6 gets you a huge falafel sandwich in delicious pita with hummus and tahini and hotsauce, cucumber and tomato and cabbage. It's amazing and such a great value. I am absolutely hooked and can't wait to go again.
