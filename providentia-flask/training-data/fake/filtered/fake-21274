I was disappointed in this place after reading all these great reviews.  First of all the food was BLAND. How that is possible at a Columbian place is beyond me...my husband pointed out that there were salt an pepper shakers on the tables...that is pretty unusual to find in any Latin restaurant b/c the food is supposed to have FLAVOR!  The service was incredibly slow and our drinks, appetizer and main dishes showed up almost at the same time even though we ordered pretty much as soon as we were seated hoping to speed things up a bit.  I do reccomend making a reservation, it was packed but we were seated in 15 min.  The only plus was that the drinks were pretty good. Definitely NOT going back...I'd sooner visit one of those hole in the wall Spanish restaurants b/c I know the food won't need salt and pepper.
