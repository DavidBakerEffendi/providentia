If you want to eat here....do NOT go for pre theater.....and if you do....MAKE A RESERVATION! This place is ALWAYS packed from 5-8pm....but for good reason. Who thought you could find good Italian in midtown? They have an AWEOME wine list on the back of the menu and every bottle is $25.00. I personally love to sit at the bar in the back, the service is always good. Get the pasta tasting....it's 3 unlimited pastas, but they are always AMAZING. I would consider living in that awful neighborhood just so I could have an excuse to eat at Becco more often!
