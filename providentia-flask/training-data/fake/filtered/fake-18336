Visited in Dec. 2009 w/ spouse to show him what was one of my favorite local restaurants. What I Â found was an overpriced non-quality lunch (spent 35.00 w/out tip for lunch with no alcohol). The waitress actually changed the channel on the flat Screen positioned directly over our table so that someone's child could watch a game that was playing on four other TV's in the place. Spouse was infuruiated, but did not complain to "keep the peace". The food has declined from five or ten years ago when this was the Rusty Scuffer in Burlington. Won't be back again for any of our scheduled trips to BTV in the next few years to see parents.
