Came here after seeing good reviews on yelp and nymag.com. Surprised to see a great place in midtown area. It was not pretensions or yuppy at all! very down to earth music (wu tang) and put good movies on.. nice environment all in all...food was awesome too. We have the beef tartar, pretzel, and babyback ribs.. all good however highly priced and still hungry.. This is a spot for you if you're willing to have a good time regardless of the price! umm the stool chairs were hard to sit on too.. Â kinda crowded but good food brings with good people!!
