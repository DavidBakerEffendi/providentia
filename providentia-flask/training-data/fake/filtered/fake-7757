I think to say that this place makes Breakfast would be a dramatic understatement. To make the assumption that I knew life before today would also not be anywhere close to true. I went in to this Mecca of the Diner Scene earlier today and I am still humming with the after effects. My sister had the SST and I have never seen anything so ground-breakingly delicious. I had Two Eggs and Corned Beef Hash and I went to heaven. The hash was perfect on every level. As a Massachusetts resident who lives three hours away, I will most certainly be back. Undoubtedly next week. I love this place more than anywhere else ever. Go here. Like, nowish.
