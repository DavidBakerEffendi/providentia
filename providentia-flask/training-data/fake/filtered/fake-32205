I was so excited to try this place out since it's only a few blocks away and looks packed whenever I walk by.  Holy schizza was I disapointed!  We went for brunch on a busy Sunday afternoon and couldn't wait to get our food since we were pretty hungry.   First off, my mimosa was lukewarm.  Second, my fries were lukewarm as well and tasted as if they were cooked 30 minutes ago.  The dining room was packed so I though the turnover would be decent and the food fresh.  The egg on my omelette was so thick and the egg:filling ratio was 3 to 1.  I had about 10 thinly sliced mushrooms in my entire omelette and a half inch pancake concoction of egg.   Now onto the service.  We lingered after meal over coffee and both eventually finished our cups.  I see the waiter walking by with a fresh pot of coffee and I'm already thinking in my head, "thanks but no thanks".  I didn't even get a chance to kindly pass a refill of coffee because he walked right by us to fill a lady's cup and went right back to put the pot away.   Maybe Le Parisien caught me on a bad day but mediocre food and below average service don't belong in NY.   On a good note, it's really cute inside and the decor seems tres french.
