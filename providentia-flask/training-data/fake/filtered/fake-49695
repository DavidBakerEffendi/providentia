what an amazing restaurant! last week was my first time going to rats and when i arrived i was amazed of how beautiful everything was from outside to inside. my hopes were already set high just from the look of the place but when i tried the food my hopes went through the roof... all i can say is wow. my huusband and i both indulged in the same entree ( filet mignon with cauliflower gratin on the side) and it was the Â best i have ever had. overall an amxing expierience and will definetely be going back soon!
