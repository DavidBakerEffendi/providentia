This is an excellent place. I have nothing to compare it to in Philly. I got several rolls and all were great. The specialty rolls were phenomenal. I really loved the one with fried oysters coated in tempora and served with a sweet chili sauce.     Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to some sushi here... And don't immediately begin dipping your rolls into soy sauce- this sushi stands on its own with superior ingredients and craftsmanship, you owe it to the chef to have it as prepared first.     I'd recommend this place to anyone, it's great.
