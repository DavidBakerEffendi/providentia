The firecracker sake is incredible! And Bun's late night specials are brilliant for the starving artist or cash strapped student! I never miss a chance to eat at Miya's. Though I no longer live in New Haven, I make sure to eat at Miya's at least once a month! If you are unfamiliar with Miya's, the most important thing is to go in with an open mind. Bun Lai is a pioneer in sustainable sushi and the menu will surprise and entice you. I rec having a salad bc the greens are grown locally and the dressing is made in house. Delicious! Next try the Tokyo fro. Unlike anything you've had and fun to share. Then you have to get the Roll of a Lifetime. This roll is ridiculously inexpensive and insanely delicious. Additionally, I love the roll with cauliflower, potato and melted dill cheese. Yum. To be honest, everything I've ever tried- and there are always specials and new creative options on the menu- has exceeded my expectations and left me feeling full in a healthy and satisfied way. Run don't walk to Miya's. Now. Don't forget to get the firecracker sake!!!
