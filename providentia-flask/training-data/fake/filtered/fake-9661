Today for lunch my wife and I had a special anniversary dinner, a sea bass special prepared by Andrew.  It could not have been a better moment for the two of us.  The last time we had a lunch this amazing was during our honeymoon in Paris. I am so happy that Andrew's Project has come to Hudson County.   The town of Bayonne has lots of good Italian places, but when it comes to fresh, healthy continental cuisine, nothing beats this place. We were going to travel into the city next month and decided it just isn't worth the hassle.   I cannot recommend this place enough. The food is delicious and have never had Chilean sea bass that comes close to what I experienced here at Andrew's Project.   To make it even more of a special lunch we had ice cream with Gluten Fee Chocolate cake which was mouth watering. Andrew then topped it off with a fresh organic mountain coffee.  We took home a few pounds of this coffee.  I'm finished with Starbucks.  For now on, we are going to Andrew's for coffee and desert!!!!
