Despite its South St. location, this bar is one of my all time favorites. Awesome weekly specials on food as well as a humble draft selection, you can't complain. The waiters also double up as bartenders, so cut them some slack. Don't worry, they'll have the piss water beer for the "poor hipsters" $3 16oz PBRs but you should definitely come during happy hour 5pm-7pm and grab an IPA or seasonal draft. Worth it. They also make you jealous with their sweet action figure collection on the first floor. Upstairs is just as smooth with bumper cars just waiting for you to jump in and venture into booze town.
