This is my favorite bar and restaurant in Philadelphia.  I go there three times a week, and never grow tired of it!  The staff is super friendly, and very knowledgeable of their amazing beer selection.  The menu has enough selection to make everyone happy.  Most people don't realize it, but this place has two levels: if it looks crowded, the downstairs bar is usually empty and offers a very relaxed and more intimate atmosphere.  I strongly recommend this place and can't wait to go back next week when I'm in town again!
