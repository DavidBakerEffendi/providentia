This was the second time I was here and much more disappointed than the first time.  The wait staff is not properly trained and either rushes you or disappears. I called ahead to see how late dinner was served and was told 9pm with plenty of time to have a relaxing dinner.  We arrived at 8:10.  We were given a menu and asked if we were ready to order at the same time, while our waiter looked at his watch. Of course we needed time to look at it  to decide.  Within 3-4 inutes he was back., looked at his watch again and asked for our order.  We had just opened a bottle of wine and needed a little more time.  Shortly,we ordered an appetizer to share.  When it was brought to the table it was placed in front of one of us.  We asked for plates since we were sharing but was only given one so we had to take a bread plate from another table and use that. But... it was barley warm and had to be sent back for reheating  It was impossible to even get a spoon for driziling the oil on our bread.  My ravioli came out dry like it was under a heat lamp for a long time.  When I asked for a small side of sauce the waiter asked me what it was going to use it for.. Duh  As soon as the only other table remaining left, at 9:10,  the lights were turned up and the staff began to clean.  Our waiter asked us if we wanted dessert, but of course, under the circumstances we declined.  The service is terrible and the prices are much higher than the on  line menu and the food barley mediocre.  I certainly wil not be back.
