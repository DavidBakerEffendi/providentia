I have been there 5 times and the food is excellent.  I had the trio platter and the tabouleh salad it was very good flavor right on the money.  My wife and I started with the hummus for appetizer the best hummus I ever had and I have been to many middleastern restaurants.  There baklava, I was told it was homemade was out of this world.  I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a place with a great atmosphere and Mediterranean food.
