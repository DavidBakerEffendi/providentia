Yums!  I am going to be totally honest ~ my hubby and I went for lunch and it will now one of our favorite places to eat in NJ.  We both had the lunch specials.  He had the mussels and oreganato tilapia and I had the meatballs & spinach soup with tortellini and meat sauce....it was soooooo delicious.  My husband had celiac and must have a gluten free diet.  The waiter was very helpful with his selection and my husband was grateful and no reactions to his food allergies.  The wait staff was friendly, polite, professional and attentive.  I would absolutely recommend Lassoni Ristorante in North Arlington, NJ....WE look forward to dinner and sangria the next time.
