I've been coming to this place since it opened and I"ve always loved it but it seems like some of the new staff is a little bit clue less. Im not a big yelper but I was so disappointed in the service I had a few weeks ago that my girlfriend and I probably won't be back for a while. She had her breast exposed which I found to be a bit offensive. The last 2 times we have gone we have had the same server. I never seen her before but she was very slow and inattentive. She seemed to be more concerned with her cell phone and talking to her coworker then getting our order right. At one point , after placing our drink order which took FOREVER, we noticed that she went outside to smoke while our drinks sat at the bar. I really wanted to go up and get them myself! She was shorter,very blonde hair- Worse server ever. I only say this because we had her 2 times and both times were lack luster. We have been coming here for a very long time and know the staff and they are all pretty awesome but my girlfriend and I know great service and she failed us both times. Other than that, our food was good as usual.
