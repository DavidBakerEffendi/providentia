I used to like this place. Then it got a B on the Department of Health inspection. I went on the DOH website to see the reason why and looked at their past reviews. Causes include: "1) Cold food item held above 41ยบ F (smoked fish and reduced oxygen packaged foods above 38 ยบF) except during necessary preparation. "2) Food worker does not use proper utensil to eliminate bare hand contact with food that will not receive adequate additional heat treatment. "3) Evidence of mice or live mice present in facility's food and/or non-food areas. "4) Facility not vermin proof. Harborage or conditions conducive to attracting vermin to the premises and/or allowing vermin to exist." GROSS. I won't be returning. Ever.
