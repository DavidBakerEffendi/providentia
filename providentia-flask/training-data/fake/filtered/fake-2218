This place has great panini's but they can't pay attention to you very well. I'm a very picky eater, so I went in, told them what kind of panini I wanted and left to go home. I opened it up at home, and they added stuff I didn't even request and didn't add stuff I did request. Only 1 out of the 4 ingredients was right.. But the time they do get it right, it's great paninis! A big too expensive though. (Lost 1 star here)
