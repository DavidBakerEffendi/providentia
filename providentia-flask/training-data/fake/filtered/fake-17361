My friends and I are regular center city weekend brunchers, and recently have decided to expand our horizons past our standard sunday morning stomping grounds. Since positive Yelp reviews led us to Cafe Lift, I figured this would be as good a time as any to post my first official review. Atmosphere, food, and service were all excellent, and we were all extremely happy with our first Lift experience. We arrived a little after 10, and didn't have to wait at all for a table (which was awesome, considering there was already a considerable line at Green Eggs as we walked by it), but by the time we left the joint was full...so keep that in mind when you're thinking about dining time. Our waitress did a great job - very attentive, and the right combination of hands on / hands off. Our waters and coffee were never lacking, and she came back to check on us just enough (which is a huge pet peeve of mine). Now the important part...the food! I ordered "eggs in purgatory", which was an interesting combination of Italian fennel, eggs, zucchinni, potatoes and their home-made tomato sauce..all baked together and topped with cheese. Admittedly it was good, but lacking a little bit of, well, something...right up until I added their home made hot sauce to the mix, which really did the trick. Just the right amount of spice (if you're not a spicy fan, you could add a little and still be OK), but don't ask what's in it - it's apparently a house secret! Friend #1 got one of the special paninis, which received an above average review, but the real gem of the morning was Friend #2's proscutto frittata. I'm not a big breakfast sharer, but I gave it a try and it was head and shoulders the best plate of the morning. So much flavor, my mouth watered just thinking about it. Overall...the food wasn't SO good to deserve a full 5 stars...but if 4.5 stars was possible, that's where I'd be. All in all, great breakfast, and we'll certainly be back.
