I rarely comment about my experiences at restaurants but needed to take the time to thank Peppinos for the truly amazing food and excellent service!!!!  The Bruschetta is a must have so so yummy {trust me}.  My main meal of Penne a la vodka was unforgettable.  My Hunny had the Philly Cheese Steak which of course I needed to try, it was incredible, needless to say no more driving to Philadelphia for us.  Pricing is excellent for the amount of food that is served!  If I could give a 10 star rating they would get it for sure.  On another note we were at the restaurant when that musician came into the restaurant.  What an unprofessional jerk!  Yes the manager was trying to find out what was going on in the middle of dinner service making tons of calls and trying not to let it affect the patrons.  Kiddos to Peppinos for not allowing the musician to play and standing their ground.  I ENJOY the family restaurant values!  WE WILL BE BACK OFTEN!
