Possibly the best wood-fired pizza in Northern Jersey that has the quality, freshness, and service to really make this place a great spot for food and hanging out. I have had the pleasure of having my birthday party held here in the other side of the dining room where 40-50 of my guests enjoyed the pizza and other appetizers that the staff was able to bring out for us. The food was great, the bar was open late, and everyone had a great time there. I recommend this to anyone who is looking for something different in Bergen county and experience Vesta Wood Fired for themselves. Â Please try the different beers that they carry too, not many have the type of selection like they do.
