Love this place. My friends and I waited a little for a table. Wait time wasn't too bad. But the waitress I had wasn't too helpful, I asked for a steak and she didn't bother to ask me how I wanted it cooked or if I wanted a side order. She also forgot to get my friend a drink and side of fries. I got up and went to the manager, who was well dressed in his purple shirt and tie and who was well mannered. He sat at my table as I explained what had happened. The manager was very polite and funny, making us feel comfortable and at home. He was good looking also =) He bought us a drink and apologized on the waitress behalf and helped us get our orders correct. Our night was fixed. The music was great and the food was amazing once corrected. The drinks are strong so I only had two but they are really good. Can't go to Yuca bar and not have a sangria.
