I have to start off by saying that blends on the water is by far not like the first blends is. I'm not going to lie the location is ideal beautiful view. The waiters & waitresses are very pleasant, but let's talk about the food & drinks, the nacho tostado were burnt both times they came out, the guacamole was pretty good. My churrasco was extremely burnt & dry Smdh. No substitutions you have to get rice & beans or pay for additional price, there's no happy hour the coconut mojitos suck suck suck, noting like the other blends even there sangria it was way to sweet. But wait I have to give credited when credit is needed the pollo ala plancha was phenomenal. Â I'm sorry but the other blends is sooooo much better.
