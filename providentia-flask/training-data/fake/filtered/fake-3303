I have had good and bad experiences. I like the pizzas, meatballs, and wings. The environment is nice and relaxing. Good place for a pre-movie meal and drinks. On the flip side I have ventured away from pizza a couple of times and regret it every time. This past visit I had the mussels, shrimp and cod in a bowl (can't remember the name, something futti). It was awful. I have a strict rule to never send food back because there is probably a pissed off cook making the replacement dish. As far as why it was disgusting here goes. The dish was small and had maybe 8 mussels - only half were opened and one was a broken shell. So I was able to eat 3 safely and I won't risk the bad ones. The shrimp was good and the sauce was tasty enough. The cod was under all the sauce and in can only describe it as soggy. I think it had gnocchi in it I couldn't tell if it was that or parts of the cod or a detracted mussel... Not good when you can't tell what you are eating. The service is always good and I would still go back. Just wont be ordering the mussels in the future.
