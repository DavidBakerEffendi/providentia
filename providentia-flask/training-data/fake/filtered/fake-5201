This place was not bad - the service was definitely struggling (there were only three other tables and we had to chase the waitress down). But, they did let me order off the lunch menu when it was clearly dinner time. The food was not terrible, the ribs were not the best. The wings and nachos were good I would definitely recommend them!! The mashed potatoes were excellent! Â And the burgers were OK. Overall, the place was meh.
