One of the finest restaurants in NYC. The menu is filled with dishes that will satisfy anyone. The appetizers are spectacular, especially the fois gras. The tasting menu is terrific and not unreasonably priced. You can find a good wine that doesn't cost hundreds of dollars. On top of everything the service is wonderful not overbearing but help is there at a moment's notice. Terry C
