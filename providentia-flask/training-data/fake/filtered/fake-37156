Only been here once, but I was pleasantly surprised (being a mostly-vegetarian).  I ordered the falafel sandwich and when I was part-way through it, the server commented, "For a place that covers everything in bacon, the falafel is actually pretty good, right?"  And he certainly was right.  I'm not a falafel expert, but this was probably the best I've had.  My fiance ordered the thanksgiving balls and loved the off-color humor that came with it.  Overall, it was a fun atmosphere, and I'd be glad to go back again.
