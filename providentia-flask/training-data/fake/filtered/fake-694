Some have raved over the food, others have commented on the "laid back family atmosphere".  Typically both are great. However, it seems that each time I venture down to Casa Adela without my spanish-speaking roommate, I step through some vortex into a parallel universe.  Instead of smiles, I am met with glares.  I am treated like an asshole.  No matter how nice, quiet and patient I am with the service, I am treated like a nuisance.  It makes me wonder if they haven't mistaken me for someone who took their lunch money when they were younger. Really, I would rate this place a 4, except that when I go by my non-spanish speaking self, this place deserves 0 stars.  So if you are fluent in Dominican or Puerto Rican spanish or can at least fake it, go for it.  Or, if you don't mind being huffed and puffed at or outright ignored, go for it.
