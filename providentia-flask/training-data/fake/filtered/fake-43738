Terrible customer service.   Arrived with a party of six with a late reservation, we had to go have drinks elsewhere in advance before hand to kill time.  When we arrive we're told the reservation was canceled because it was not confirmed by 3pm. Now, the person who made the reservation, a bride-to-be, had been trying on dresses the entire day with family in from out of town and didn't have her phone on her to answer.  The manger on site didn't even TRY to fix the situation or understand her inability to get to the phone (ps. they should try to confirm earlier than DAY of).  He was rude and the other gentleman with him was even ruder. We tried to explain that we had people in from out of town, but they didn't seem to care whatsoever.  We used to bring clients to this place, but will no longer do so due to the terrible, terrible service.  We went across the street to Piadima and had an INCREDIBLE Italian meal and very friendly service.
