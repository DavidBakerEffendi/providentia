Looking for parking took forever but it was worth the effort. There was no table initially so we waited at the bar. We each tried a different drink each one was better than the next....I bartended and these were truly works of art. We also ordered a few appetizers. The Guacamole was incredible. The empanadas were a little dissapointing the chorizo was sharp and tasty. The place is sexi and cool great feel, certainly a great place to go on a date. I do not recomend the shrimp ceviche....it was the only blight on a great experience(overly bland no zest that I was expecting). The waiter knew exactly what he was talking about and took pride in it. He recommended the salmon and made sure that it lived up to my expectation. The place is cozy with with a pretty bathroom even and the owner from Costa Rica thanked us for coming in when we were leaving and made sure we had a positive experience. Will return....and try some more drinks.
