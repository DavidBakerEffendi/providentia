I was in the mood for a bahn mi sandwich, and I came across Joju. My first impression was its a cute clean place, which is always a plus with the clean factor. We ordered the veggie ham and garden sandwich and the bbq pork with kimchi fries, my first bite and I was in love, it was so fresh, we loved the sandwiches and they were filling as well so you're not left hungry when you leave. I would def come back and bring more people who would def enjoy the experience. The drinks are also very interesting. I had the green apple and pinneapple bubble tea which was really refreshing.
