My husband and I just experienced one of the best taste sensations in a restaurant in our 30 years.   Not that Dough is a place you would choose for "fine dining", it is a comfortable, casual and inviting place that makes you feel you are in a friend's family room outside their kitchen.    And fortunately for you, your friend has an amazing gift of presenting top quality food in innovative ways.   I propose that Dough starts a "friends of dough" email list where the chef lets us admirers know ahead of time when he's obtained items such as Ribeye from San Jose, which is free roaming, cornfed, free from antibiotics and taste absolutely amazing.   Or when he concocts a special ceviche from Bronzino.    You can have a wonderful taste experience at a very reasonable price with their fabulous unique menu of pizza, salads, and appetizers, or you can spend more ( at a very fair price) for amazing specials. Both can be obtained in a laid back atmosphere with a very attentive and enthusiastic staff.   My advice: if you are going for the specials, bring your favorite (expensive) bottle of wine and enjoy!
