First of all, I love dumplings! I was walking in the area when I thought I should definitely give this place a go, since I heard it was good. and, to tell you the truth, after I managed to squeeze in to that tiny (yet very sweet!) place I was quite pleased. We had a couple of sesame pancakes with beef, and a dish of pan fried pork and chives dumplings to share. it was brilliant, very very tasty, and also very cheap. All in all good Â value for money and really really TASTY! Love it.
