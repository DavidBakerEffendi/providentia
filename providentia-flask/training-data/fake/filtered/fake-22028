Love this place! The hustle and bustle, the energy, and of course the food.   We have not been disappointed once during our multiple visits to this place. My favorites are Beck's Cajun, Carmen's Hoagies,  Little Thai place, and Kamel's middle Eastern.  As always the vendors are eager to please .  The lines at peak lunch hours can sometimes be long but they do try hard to keep it moving. Convenient to the convention center attendees and close to public transportation.  A great value, this is a Foodies dream place.
