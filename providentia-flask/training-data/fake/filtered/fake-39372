a friend suggest this place as a good spot to go os on this first date with a girl i just met, i really was pleased ,the food and service was Â good,the ambiance was very chill and a perfect atmosphere for the occasion,it was just far enough away from the vortex of willamburg that it wasnt't too crowded or loud and very romantic setting.i'm stillseeing that girl so i would say it made an impression that lasted.
