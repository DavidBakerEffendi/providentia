Horrible execution of a great idea. A cramped, noisy, and confusing attempt to create an upscale market/deli. The staff was rude. Our waiter was condescending and inattentive. As most others there, we were confounded by the ridiculous rules that limit what you can eat and where you can sit. We wanted to get a glass of wine, browse, and buy a variety of goodies to eat right there, but to do so you had sit at one of the scarce tables by the entrance or stand up at one of the absurdly tiny bistro tables. We opted for the bistro and on one of the 2 occasions when our waiter actually visited us, he insisted our party of four squish together to make room for a couple of strangers at our table. It was very awkward and uncomfortable. The Eataly concept is to promote the love, knowledge, and enjoyment of food, but it accomplishes none of this. Instead, it throws hungry patrons into a frustrating rats maze staffed by ornery employees, making you yearn for any one of the thousands of genuine NY delis that offer wonderful diverse goodies with much less hassle and none of the prefab, puffed-up, marketing BS.
