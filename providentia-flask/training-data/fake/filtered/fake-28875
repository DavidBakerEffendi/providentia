The diner is acceptable. Decent breakfast food. We come here because my son loves the pancakes but how I wish they had better and stronger coffee. Â It taste like water, horrible!! I make sure to have a cup of my own java before I leave the house. Which defeats the whole purpose of going to a diner in the morning and enjoying a cup of coffee while I wait for my food.
