Super Friendly, Great Service, Great Food, Huge Portions and So Affordable I walked away almost thinking I had robbed the place. A local business doing everything right.  I think this is the first positive review that I've been inspired to Yelp. About 20 minutes from Sesame Place and running ahead of schedule we wandered off of the beaten path to get some inexpensive NJ gas and fill our cooler for a long day at the park.  We wandered into this gem in the rough purely by accident and couldn't be more glad that we did.   Yogi's Hoagies has instantly become part of a family tradition as the group meet-up destination.  We stop here to stretch our legs, get some hot breakfast, and fill our coolers with giant hoagies for lunch.   Any last minute family adventure essentials that you can't find at Yogi's can be had at the Big-K just across the parking lot.  Mark your maps super-dads this is a must stop for the family road warrior.
