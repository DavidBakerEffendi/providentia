I don't normally do online reviews but this place was so fantastic I wanted to let others know. The food was delicious, exciting, and new. The service was good. The drinks perfect. It was an ambient place, perfect for a date. It was my boyfriend's birthday and they ensured to bring him out a dessert with a candle too! It is a tight space, but with all the fun you're having sharing tapas and drinking tasty cocktails, you forget real quick how close you are to the next party. The only downside was the host was a little curt, perhaps because it was so busy. The server, however, more than made up for it. She was so amiable and helpful and patient.
