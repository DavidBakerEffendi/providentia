This place was pretty hard to find, but nevertheless I had an enjoyable experience there. I wasn't sold on the vegetarian thing but even none vegetarians can have the potato cake (it's not on the menu I think) which was obviously sent down from heaven somewhere. Whoever made it must be a genius. I am not a drinker so I can't comment on the drinks but water was fantastic! Also if you are nice to the white Italian chef with the funky pants she might give u free food, that is if she's not trying to feed u weird smelling vegetables :P she's absolutely fantastic they should give her a raise.
