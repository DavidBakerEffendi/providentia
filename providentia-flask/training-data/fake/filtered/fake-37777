Beware all ye who enter......... Only a dirty, smelly, thirsty pirate would enjoy the likes of this place. Fancy artsy painted naked ladies painted on the wall danced across from me and my hubby as we dined on undercooked mussels in dish water. The more I drank, the creepier they stared me down as if I was a fish out of water. While waiting an extremely long time for two burgers not cooked to perfection, if you told me the cow died out back and donated a chunk of it's butt, two minutes before it was put on our rolls I'd believe you. My draft beer was warm! The ice water we asked for was hot. I complained and I swear they gave me the same beer glass! Even a thirsty pirate would slice your hand off if you didn't deliver the goods. For $40 plus tip (on bad service because my hubby is an honorable man) We grieved over two over priced undercooked burgers, warm beer, hot water, and mussels which eventually made me unbearably sick for 24 hours. Fries should always be included, NOT charged $2 extra for a tenny tiny bowl. Next time I'll walk the plank before entering this galley.
