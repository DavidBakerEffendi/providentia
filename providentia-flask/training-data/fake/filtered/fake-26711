Think most people in New Jersey absolutely have no or little taste for gourmet food.   The services at 99% of restaurants are inferior or mediocre at best. Fortunately Sun Ray is the very few exception. But most of the in born Jersey folks would not know good food from bad, even if they life would depend on...they buy food based on what is on sale rather what is quality. If there is not sweet they don't like it.  And  Pizza 46?? Might as well eat frozen pizza
