If you are around Astoria/LIC and just want to have great dinner, Cafe Triskell should be your destination. It's not just their famous crepes but also their mussels, whose delicate sourness I am not able to imitate at home, onion soup, scallops, and tender hanger steak (eat rare/medium rare!) that we develop a crave once in a while. Don't think having a dinner crepe is enough--be sure to also try a dessert crepe!
