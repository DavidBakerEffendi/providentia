I am an anti-red meat person. I have always hated burgers..... However, my husband ordered the Tavern Burger when we were here visiting. Literally the best tasting beef either of us has ever had (he is a big burger guy). A very simple burger, just meat, onions, and cheese. (They serve it with an awesome Aioli on the side) It melted in my mouth. My husband and I were fighting over the last bite. I had the mussels, which were also absolutely perfect. Great service, casual but classy atmosphere. A definite must if you are visiting Burlington.
