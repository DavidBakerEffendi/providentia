Dined there 2 nights ago for a friends BDAY because she liked the restaurant. This will be the last time we go to Divina. We bought a cake in with us to celebrate a Bday and were suprised to see a $14 CAKE CUTTING CHARGE.on the bill. When I asked the waitress to show me on the menu where this charge is listed obviously she couldnt respond. There is nothing listed on the menu stating this. The waitress(short with red hair) made a nasty comment that we wouldnt have been charged if we ordered their dessert.The CAKE CUTTING CHARGE was taken off and I called to speak to the owner the next day and his response was, "You cost me money to run dishwasher for cake dishes". The food wasnt that good. Go some place else where the staff and owner will treat you respect instead of staring you down.(red head).They turned off 6 families in 1 night and hopefully the word will spread.
