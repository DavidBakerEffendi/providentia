I have been to this restaurant multiple times and have had delicious food on every visit. First, the restaurant is adorable-clean and cozy- and the wait staff is attentive. Food highlights for me have been a corn and shrimp summer soup that was out of this world. Light and full of flavor, I am not sure if this is always on the menu but it should be because I would order it every single time. Grandpa Tony's Escarole salad is a very bright tasting, simple, refreshing salad. Clams casino over angel hair pasta, basically all the ingredients used to make clams casino but in a saucy over pasta version-delicious and satisfyingly flavorful, so much more than a regular clam sauce. Lastly, the handmade cheesecake with strawberry balsamic sauce-Yummo is the first word that comes to mind! Definitely a must try!
