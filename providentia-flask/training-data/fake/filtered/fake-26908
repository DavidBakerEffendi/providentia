The service was great, ambiance cozy, decorations appropriate, and everything was delicious (the cake on-the-house was a nice surprise), but why oh why don't you serve coffee? I was dying for a cup. One star missing for no post meal coffee to go with that yummy cake. Will be back! Maybe you'll decide to serve coffee?
