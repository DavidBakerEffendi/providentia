These guys have been one of my favorites for years.....from 53rd and 6th ave to their spot now in harlem. It is authentic, and let me add fresh! Not too many Halal stands can compete! These guys have a HUGE reputation. =) I wont eat it everyday but a night after the club.... most def! Keep up the good work guys!
