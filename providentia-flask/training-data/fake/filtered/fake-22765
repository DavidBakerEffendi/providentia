This is the best "Chinese" food around if you live an hour or more away from NYC or Queens.  Weekend Dim Sum is great, I have had better in Toronto.  Roasted BBQ pork, and beef tendon on display is great.  Peking duck is great because you can have it in three ways (skin, meat and soup).  Ask the staff what they suggest and price when you go any other time.  Fresh fish, Soft Shell Crabs, lobster over sticky rice.  You can spend a bit more if you consider the time, gas and tolls you saved.  So by the time you get to NYC, I would already ate and sitting at home watching football.
