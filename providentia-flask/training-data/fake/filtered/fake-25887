My friend and I ate at this restaurant on our way to a show this past Friday.  Everything from the smell as soon as you walked in, to the service to the fabulous meal was DE-LICIOUS!!  Our server was polite (she looked like she just arrived from Italy!!), efficient and made sure we had everything we needed.  Someone had erroneously posted that it was BYOB -- it's not.  Villa Di Roma has it's own, very well stocked bar.  I'll go back again and again.  Recommend at least trying the meatballs and gravy as an appetizer.  We both wanted the Chicken Parmesean (which was out of this world!!) but wanted to try their highly recommended meatballs.
