We had a difficult time finding the restaurant, it's tucked away behind a bedding and linen dept. The restaurant offered a nice view and had a nice modern look. We started with the Fried Calamari which was inedible. Tough and rubbery, the breading flaked off, and the portion was small, maybe 11 or 12 small rings. We later noticed an adjacent table, with the same order, which was twice the size. The waiter removed it and did not offer to replace it. At this point we were quite hungry and we were offered one piece of bread, we had to make a decision whether we wanted semolina or white. We later asked if we might be able to have one more. Although it was not crowded, we waited an unusually long time, we had to ask a hostess if she could check on our dinner. When the main course finally came, the portions were small, the pasta chewy, and the taste mediocre. We were offered a small portion of gelato, on the house, which was probably the best thing about the dinner. Doubt I would give it a second try.
