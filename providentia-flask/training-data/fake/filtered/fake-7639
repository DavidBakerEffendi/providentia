Amazing meatball banh mi! Need I say more? Walked past their Clark Park location a few weeks ago with some friends and we ordered one to share as we were on our way to another restaurant for lunch. Their tofu meatballs were amazingly flavorful and the red sauce, carrot, daikon pickles, cucumber, cilantro, jalapeno and vegan mayo complimented each other very well. It was indeed a bit messy to eat, especially if you're sharing as sauce ends up dripping everywhere but I'd definitely go back again! Edit: Got the same banh mi again once and there was WHITE hair in my banh mi which was obviously not mine..... Oh well guess these things do happen but it just grosses me out when it actually happens to me urgh! That's the reason I'm pushing down the stars to 3 stars instead of the original 5 stars I gave it
