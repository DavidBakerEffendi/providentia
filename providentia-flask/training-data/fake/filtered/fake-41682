Gave this place a second chance over brunch this past weekend.  Even though we made a reservation we still had to wait 30 minutes for a table.  That being said, I was far more impressed with the brunch fare than with dinner.  Everyone REALLY enjoyed the bottomless mimosas.  We were all satisfied with our food, the poached egg and polenta was very tasty, but still lacked that something extra I want when going out to eat.  However, I would definitely go back for the brunch, as there were several items on the menu I am still interested in trying.
