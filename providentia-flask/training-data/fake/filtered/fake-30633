I live in Fishtown and watched as it was getting ready to open. Just stopped in and had 2 slices: 1) LOVE the decor and museum, fun stuff and well thought out 2) LOVED that it was THIN crust pizza, I hate thick pizza, if I want to eat a loaf of bread, I would 3) Ordered JANE and sadly, it was burnt black on the underside, had a pool of grease on the top and tasted like pepperoni even though Jane is supposed to be just cheeses and basil. Don't know how pepperoni flavor got on Jane.....a used utensil with pepperoni juice used to cut the slices? Or did the tomato sauce get tainted with pepperoni juice? My husband also ordered Jane and he said his also tasted like pepperoni, was also greasy but his was not burnt. 4) Will stop back again and try again and hopefully, some of the kinks will be worked out. Don't want to abandon the place, it is only day 2 for them. ******* UPDATE Oct 10, 2012: Went back a second and a third time and all was well! No burnt bottom, no pool of grease, no pepperoni taste on the Jane. Now a great tasting pizza still with my fav thin, thin crust! Will definitely be back for more. Also liked the fact that they contacted me after my first review to discuss...class act.
