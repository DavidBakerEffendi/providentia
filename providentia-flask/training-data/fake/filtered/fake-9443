Their PANCAKES are the best! I come here for breakfast every day before I go to work because of their pancakes. If people think its pricey, I definitely think its not. I've been bringing a lot of my friends and colleagues here and they totally agree with me - the place definitely rocks. Good food, comfortable place, not too pricey... what's there to hate about this place? Nothing!
