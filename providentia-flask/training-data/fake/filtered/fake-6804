I was spirited away to Philadelphia this past weekend by my maid of honor and friends for a fun-filled bachelorette weekend.  I am not so much into the traditional bachelorette rites and we chose to forgo the strippers and tequila shots for something nearer and dearer to my heart that being copious amounts of very tasty food.  Much to my delight my friends booked reservations at Marrakesh for our first night on the town.  I had gone to school in Philadelphia and had a chance to eat there once before for my graduation dinner and for the past five years have been dreaming of going back. As many other reviews have covered the pre-fixe eight course menu I won't go into too much detail about the food except to say that everything served is delicious. However, do not go in the preconceived notions that delicious means super heavy on spices or spiciness. Additionally, when the waiter tells your table that the goal of Marrakesh is to recreate a how you would be served at a traditional Moroccan that he means it in every sense. Do not expect dinner to be less than a two hour affair. Expect more food to be brought to you than you could humanely consume. The whole point  of the meal is to show hospitality through excess and  to provide a space for you to create entertainment for yourselves. So do not expect a hovering waiter and do not bring a boring date or friend. As luck would have it I was surrounded by my favorite people in the world making Marrakesh the best place for us to come together for the first time in a year to relax and catch up.
