One word to describe this place: amazing!  I came on a Sunday with a group of friends.  We waited about an hour outside.  Although it was cold we were entertained by the hostess who kept telling jokes.  The place itself isn't that big which explained the long wait.  For appetizers, we got the atomic macaroni & cheese fireballs.  They were cheesy & spicy, perfect combination.  We also got the cheddar cheese tater tots.  Those were also really good.  For my main course, I got the cornflake crusted chicken.  It was delicious.  Now for my favorite part, dessert!  I had the lucky charm cinnamon donut.  It was sooo delicious.  It had pieces of lucky charms on top of it with a glaze.  Another thing to note about this restaurant is that you can bring your own alcohol.
