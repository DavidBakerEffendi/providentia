This place is so good!! The roasted eggplant appetizer is delicious.  We also had the mackerel - it was ok.  Then we had the pasta in cream sauce with roe.  This dish was so good. I recommend you try it.  I hope to be back soon and try the meat dishes, and of course the pasta dish again.  Prices are more than reasonable.  Quite a wait line but well worth it.
