I had always heard about the great Lombardi's pizza so my husband and I decided to give it a try when we were in town. I just couldn't believe it. It reminded me so much of those pizza kits you get at the supermarket and make yourself. Our pepproni pizza had very sparse sauce that didn't even cover but about 70% of the pizza and we had a small number of dime sized peppronis sprinkled around. The flavor was awul. It was truly one of the most disappointing dining experiences I have ever had. A few nights later we grabbed a slice at Sbarros and both of us remarked at how much better it was that Lombardi's. Glad I went to see what it was all about, but truly disappointed.
