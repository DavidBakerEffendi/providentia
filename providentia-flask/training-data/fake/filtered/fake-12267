I just held a Family Reunion/Baby Shower at Tierney's - in the upper dining room. Adam and Keith Tierney could not have been more accommodating. My Family was so impressed. Decorated for the Holidays, with a fire burning merrily in the fireplace, lots of stonework and dark beams, the setting was just beautiful. My guests were able to select their meal and be served by the lovely and attentive staff. Food was delicious and drinks were generous. I highly recommend Tierney's and am already considering having another party there. An elegant party at a very fair price!
