Found this place on yelp and wanted to try a new sushi place. The portions are decently sized, but what I really enjoyed here was the fresh taste of the sushi. The tuna melted in my mouth. There aren't many places with fresh real fresh sushi. Not to mention the seafood miso soup was a delightful surprise with real big pieces of seafood mixed in. It looks small on the outside but it was delightfully a lot bigger inside once you enter. Will be returning again.
