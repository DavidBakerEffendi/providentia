I loved Brad Farmerie's new venture. Sophisticated but not at all pretentious, from the friendly service to the well thought out menu. I had the mushroom pot of deliciousness... this guy has a real love affair going on with portobellos, because he works magic at Public with them as well. The Branzino was cooked to perfection with a lovely light, herbaceous stuffing. Everything I tasted was interesting without being overworked... I hate it when a dish has a laundry list of ingredients. The bar was absolutely packed by the time I left...with the accompanying decibel level, but uncharacteristically of most restaurants, the dining areas were relatively quiet. Kudos to Avroko for paying attention to acoustics!
