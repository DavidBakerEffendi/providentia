What is going on here?  Despite having a reservation, waited 40 + minutes to be seated for brunch. Absolutely nuts with more than 50-60 people waiting outside on the sidewalk.  They double booked all reservations was one of the stories?  It was a big hot sardine can  disorganized mess with no apology; no organization; no attempt to make it better; no management.   Regardless of what is being served - even if $100 bills - who cares.  This was inexcusable. If you like a stuffy warm disoragnized mess and like to wait for a very long time even with a reservation and have crowds of people hanging over your table and deafening noise - then this is your place.  if you like to dine (or even eat) skip it.  One of the worst restaurant experiences ever.
