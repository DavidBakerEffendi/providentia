Enjoyed dinner there recently per the reviews posted here and have to say I agree - it was excellent. Â I'm a Thai food fan, have been to Thailand, and the selection, pricing, staff and food itself was great. So many "Thai" restuarants Americanize their food to appeal to a broader audience, Thai Taste was very authentic. If you love Thai food I have to think this well worth your while. Enjoy.
