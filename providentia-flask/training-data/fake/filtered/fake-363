Geno's may be one of the most famous cheese steak restaurants in the world but in my personal opinion they are not the best.  All Philadelphians have their specific favorite and most don't agree on who makes the best in town.  Many Philadelphians think Geno's is the best and it's a great place to go if you are only going to try one cheese steak when you are visiting Philly due to their reputation and wild neon ambiance.   I personally find the best cheese steaks to have the cheese melted on the roll under the meat because it keeps the roll from getting soggy & you can really taste the cheese.  That is not how Geno's makes theirs.  On the other hand, they are better than most small, single store cheese steak restaurants who make cheese steaks similarly to the way Geno's makes theirs (with the cheese mixed in with the meat).   One of my favorites is actual a single storefront but my other favorite (my #1) has multiple locations and it's most famous location is on South Street with big black and white checker tiles on the outside.   If you are going to South Street you must try this place!!!
