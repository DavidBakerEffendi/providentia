We had a reservation for 6pm for 14 people, an hour later no one had come to cook @ the table. Spoke to Mgr. who never in 3 different conversations offerred ANY apology, the end result was us leaving, after they gave us a bill (never should hv gotten due to THEIR mess up) and the Mgr saying there was nothing she could do but fire the waitress!!!!!! Absolutely HORRIBLE customer service - will NEVER eat their again. BAD, BAD, BAD experience!!!!!!!
