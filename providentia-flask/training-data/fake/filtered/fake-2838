Was there Spring 2012. Met a friend around 4-5pm so it wasn't busy. Waiter SUCKED. He was difficult to find. We ordered a lot of tapas - coconut rice was good. BYOB - good. Ordered espresso after we ate and mine was served in a cracked espresso cup. Last straw. I complained to the host and demanded a new server. He sucked so badly and didn't pay attention - the place was not busy, so he doesn't get that excuse. We walked around town after that. As we were leaving Montclair I noticed the place was packed. It seems to do good business but they will not get my business again.
