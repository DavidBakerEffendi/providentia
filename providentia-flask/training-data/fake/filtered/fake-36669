The burgers were pretty good but considering the atmosphere and the crowd, I would rather have drive thru McDonald's. The service was absolutely terrible, the music was way too loud and the crowd was louder than the music.I dont believe the waitress even told us her name, nor did she thank us at the end of the meal. I have waited tables for years, and that is basic service. I felt like I was in a Crown Fried Chicken off of Allegheney. I expected hipsters and young professionals, instead was greeted by a gangsters paradise. We checked in with the host, then had our ID's checked to eat?? It is the responsibility of the server to check my ID, I'm surprised I didnt get frisked for hidden weapons too. PYT has potential and maybe we went on an off day. The Institute has a much better menu, better service, and much better clientele.
