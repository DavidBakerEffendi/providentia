Back in 1997 I was forced to have food from this place due to the fact that I used to live across the street from there, and one December night there was a crazy ass snowstorm leaving this the only place open for business within a two mile area of downtown New Haven. Yes, I really walked in a foot of snow for a couple of miles, and found nothing. I really wanted to avoid this place like the plague due to the numerous warnings I had heard over the years from friends & locals. So to my dismay I walked there and ordered a large pie to split with my Girlfriend at the time. Let's just say that calling this Pizza does a dis-service to every Pizzeria that has ever existed in the city of New Haven, or the state of CT for that matter. I have had bad Pizza before, but this was truly unique..from the cardboard textured crust, to the sour milk tasting Mozzarella and overly sweetened high fructose tomato paste..I mean sauce. Alpha Delta is the absolute worst food experience I have ever had. Seriously..I would opt for Chuck E. Cheese over it.
