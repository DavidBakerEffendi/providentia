Came here for the second time in a long time today, the hostess didn't seem so friendly. However, once seated my waitress had a good attitude and was very helpful. I ordered a platano relleno as an appetizer, a mango margarita, and the churrasco.The frozen mango margarita was a bit crappy , it was too thick. The platano relleno was amazing though! and the churrasco was even better! juicy and very flavorful. Food was a bit pricey but it was all worth it. Left the place with a full belly and smile on my face. i definitely recommend it. :)
