Excellent authentic Italian cuisine. Food is outstandingl. Marzullo's food is always consistent, never off, always on. I laughed my arss off at the reviewer "return to the mothership." Not everyone appreciates good food. The atmosphere is friendly and comfortable. This is hands down the best Italian restaurant in Essex County and beyond.  If you appreciate delicious Italian food , fresh  ingredients, and high quality, check out Marzullo's. It's a sure bet.
