I have been curious about Rouge for a long time, I was apprehensive about trying it considering they do not take reservations, and was concerned that they would be very busy and have a long wait. However when walking past the restaurant I was delighted to see that there were several open tables. Upon entering the atmosphere was very luxurious and had a elegant feel to it. However it is a very small space, the hostess seated us at a table which was right adjacent to the bar area, it didn't leave much room for comfort. I inquired about the 3 open tables by the window which were open, but was told "they are spoken for". For a place that "doesn't" take reservations this was disheartening. We decided to stay even though the hostess seemed to have an attitude at this point. We ordered the Rouge Burger and the Gnocchi. The burger was delicious, however I think it was very overpriced. The burger ended up being $18, and the Gnocchi was delicious but also overpriced for the serving. The sever was very pleasant and attentive with our drinks, however disappeared when it was time to take the check. Overall, the food was good but overpriced and the hostess's attitude was unnecessary considering how many excellent restaurants there are in the area for either the same money or less. Those tables sat empty for our entire meal, and other patrons left the restaurant because they wouldn't seat them at those tables instead of packing them in like sardines. I only gave it 2 stars because the food and server was good. I used the email on the website about our seating/hostess issue and received no response. I won't be returning there ever again.
