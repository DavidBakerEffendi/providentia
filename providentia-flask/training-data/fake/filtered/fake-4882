This place is our favorite spot- let me tell you why... 1) Bring your own saves you a great deal off of the check, especially on a weekend. 2) Excellent Service: Every time we go the owners take excellent care of us. 3) Live music jazz music on Saturday nights 4) Fresh food and not overpriced at all. My favorite place in town.  If you still have room to eat after dinner the desserts are all home made.  Even if you come here with a bottle of wine and eat dessert, its well worth it.
