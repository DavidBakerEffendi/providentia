Good bar SAD FOOD. If you're from Philadelphia you will think this is good Mexican food. If your are from out west you'll say "what the hell is that?" My al pastor pork burrito was nothing but rice. No meat, no beans, no sour cream, no cheese, just a rice wrap. I'd give it 2 out of 10 stars at best. Didn't have the tacos, but they were so small they should be embarrassed to serve such finger food. They were more appropriate for small bites being brought around at a cocktail party or event. The bar was very cool though with great atmosphere Â and fun. Nice friendly staff giving- good service. Get your taps fixed though every beer was flat regardless of which beer. I'm sure they'll fix that soon. I was really hoping for some good Mexican I could walk to, but not for me, but like I said if you don't know any better you'll think it's good. Try Plaza Girabaldi on Washington and 9th. Best I've found in Philly. Mexican is slowly growing and improving here- just need a little more time. It's on it way.
