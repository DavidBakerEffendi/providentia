Recently while visiting our friends in Connecticut my girlfriend and I discovered the lovely gem, the Mint Thai Cuisine, while driving to our hotel. We decided to try it out since we were starving after the long plane ride from New York. As soon as we walked in we were promptly seated by our friendly server, Lucky. He was very knowledgeable about the drinks. I must say, I was surprised they offered Bubble Tea, nevertheless the entr√©es. My girlfriend had the Duck cooked in the Panang Curry with a Iced Bubble Tea with the pearl. I had the Basil Fried Rice with the Shrimp, also with a Bubble Tea. And for dessert we shared an order of Fried Ice Cream. It was absolutely delicious. I would definitely eat here again the next time we pass through.
