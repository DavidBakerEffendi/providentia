Try the thin crust with extra sauce it is as good as the Star Tavern and they had it delivered to my place in Harrison in 15 minutes. Sorry Pizzaland you were good when Freddie was sweating over those pies but this place has you hands down. I was shocked I hadn't eaten from there in years and a buddy ordered a pie and I almost fell of my chair when he told me where it was from BIG NICKS ROCKS!
