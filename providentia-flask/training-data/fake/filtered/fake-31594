Kayla was phenomenal!!!!. She was very friendly and really attractive. She made the entire time a perfect experience, even if she was half Italian half native american. Just kidding. Food was really good seriously, churrasco was amazing. Drinks were outstanding. But overall the service beat everything else out of the water. Deff coming back to visit
