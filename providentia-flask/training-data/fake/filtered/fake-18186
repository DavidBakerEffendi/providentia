This is my go-to place. I think what makes it so great is the balance of affordability and environment. I find everything on the menu to be reasonably priced which is made all the better by the quality of the food. It is always pretty hopping, and you see some cool people, and you should be able to get a table on a Sunday night. They don't take reservations for parties under 6, but even if you had to wait it is a cool place to walk around and the bar, both on restaurant level and upstairs, is a nice place to have a cocktail. While the menu is long and allows a great deal of creativity, I would strongly suggest including the Beau Monde Pizza as a starter. I don't recall having any other starters in my 10+ visits, but this one is all you could ever need. I am a vegetarian, but my friends have raved about the chicken with spinach crepe and have them add the caramelized tomato sauce and some cheese. The real highlight here, though, are the dessert crepes. My personal favorite is Dulce de Leche a la mode, while my ladyfriend goes for the chocolate sauce and berries (again, a la mode) Sorry this is so long, but I love the place.
