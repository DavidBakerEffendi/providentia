Since we have been dying to get outside, the Llama Tooth was the perfect place to go with their courtyard. The food was excellent. We had the sweet potatoes and the dip for them was amazing. I had a Cuban and my fiancee had the Asian salad. The portions were more than enough and the food was really, really good and the prices were even better. Our waitress was very friendly. They have a very nice craft beer list. We had a great meal and great service. The atmosphere in the courtyard is awesome. We will definitely be going back.
