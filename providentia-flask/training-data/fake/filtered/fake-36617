I actually ate there about a year ago on a business trip. I was taken there by a co-worker who lives there.  Maybe it's because I'm not from Philly, but I don't get the appeal.  The food is WAY overpriced for what you get. It was decent, but nothing to rave about. To be honest, most of it looks like it was made by a 14 year old, and thrown on the floor. The waiter acted indifferent to our presence. Like he had better things to do. I really expected more. In hindsight, a trip to Wendy's would have been more satisfying.  I didn't originally post anything because I don't usually do internet reviews, but since they don't have any problem with publicly displaying their displeasure with customers, I felt compelled to share my  experience. I give the restaurant 3 stars for being meh, not bad or good, but deduct 2 stars for their public attack on customers.  I won't be going there in my next trip out there.
