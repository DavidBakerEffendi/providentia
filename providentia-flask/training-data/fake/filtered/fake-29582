I actually love the food here...chicken biscuit is amazing.  Collards are also pretty close to authentic southern style.  Mac-n-chesse...meh, not so much.  Slight improvement on Kraft mac -n cheese (because of the hot sauce on top that you didn't ask for).  Pies are insanely good. The reason for the 2 star rating is because of their service.  Most of the waitstaff is great (the waitresses have always been very nice for table service), but the "where's waldo" looking hipster kid who's too busy playing with his iPod and listening to the T.Rex that he just "discovered" makes this place look bad.  On numerous occasions he can't be bothered to say hello, or greet you...just the blank stare.  He finds you so, oh annoying...how dare you order lunch?   Douchebags like this are a big reason why this neighborhood sucks now.
