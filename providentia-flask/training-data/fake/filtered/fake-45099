Went here with 9 people tonight. We all really enjoyed it. Great dumplings. The crispy spicy eggplant special was light and favorful. The fried tofu and bean noodle soup was a little bland but we ordered it vegetarian. The scallion pancakes were among the best I've ever had. I wish I had more room to try the cold mock duck amd the sesame noodles. All and all, a great find in the heart of Chinatown. We left full with lots of leftovers for $20 pp including tip!
