This place looks great since they renovated it. Great vibe and music selection. Food was excellent. Started with steamed buns. Would highly recommend the Gang Nam Style spicy pork. Went with a group, sampled a ton of sushi, everything was delicious. Â Had bread pudding for desert which was very tasty.
