Although they do offer good food, never ever use them for a catering event or a wedding.  Last September, yes in 2010, they catered our wedding.  Needless to say the last thing a bride needs to hear is they ran out of food.  We had requested food for 120 people, there were only 110 people and 10 of them were children under the age of 7 (so did not each much at all).  Well basically before the last 20 or so people got to the buffet they were out of the main dishes.  At first all they said to me and those in line was "Well it looks like your other guests ate all the food"  WHAT? Really that is what you say to me.  Fortunately our wedding coordinator and yes DJ took it upon themselves to locate a local restaurant in which more main dishes could be purchased.  The caterers then did go and pick up this food and serve it to the rest of the wedding (Can you say embarrassed).  But even after all that, they promised us a refund for those people that did not get served the first time.  And let's see, it has been one year, many emails and phone calls later, and we have yet to see that refund.  They can't live up to their job or their word.  Don't use them!!!!
