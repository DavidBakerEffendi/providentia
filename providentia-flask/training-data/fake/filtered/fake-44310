My friend called in a order for us. By the time we drove to pick up the food , it turns out that they made her the wrong type of Stromboli. So, we had to sit and wait for another 35 mins for them to make the correct Stromboli. Now, with that being said. I had ordered onion rings and a chicken on a pita which they let sit in the oven for almost an hour now. When I got the sandwich the lettuce and tomatoes where hot! I told the guy at the counter " I can't eat hot lettuce and tomatoes" this Jerk tells me he does not understand the logic. I told him " you reheated the sandwich! if you made the right Stromboli for my friend, my lettuce and tomatoes would not hot!" so understand the logic and just give me money back !...  which he did however, they should remember the golden rule in business " the customer is right " especially when you made the mistake. that place is going down hill. the only reason they stay in business is because the students  have no where else to go!
