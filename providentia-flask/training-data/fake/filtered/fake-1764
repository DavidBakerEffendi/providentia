My fianc√© loves this place and brought me here a while back. She said she used to go out the one in Queens when she lived there. The food is awesome and not expensive, which is nice change for this hood. Only thing I gotta say is the hostesses are kind of rude. We've gone there before around 5:30/6pm after work and they've given us a hard time about getting a table inside (during summer) when there were clearly tables inside, the place isn't small. The food made up for it though.
