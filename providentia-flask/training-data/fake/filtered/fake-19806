These reviews are crazy! This place is absolutely amazing. It's absolutely beautiful and the food is soooo much better than some other local spots. The best thing is that the prices are no higher than the other places. I go here all the time and sit in the swing seats - the waiters know to bring me right to them! I bring different friends who are equally as thrilled and even had my graduation party here. I didn't use the party room, just a big dinner. I love it!!! Favorite restaurant in the area.
