My friend and I had the pleasure of dining here this past weekend. The food was delicious and the staff was outstanding. Â We had the cowboy steak and crab stuffed shrimp for dinner; the steak was done to perfection and the shrimp very tasty. The only negative I have is the salad, maybe some nice field greens instead of iceberg lettuce, the field greens would have been a nice complement to the dressing, bacon and tomatoes. I definitely would recommend it for dinner.
