We were there last night with friends.  We were seated in the main dining room, attractive but with many hard surfaces, which was too loud for our comfort. The staff couldn't have been more accommodating - they opened another smaller  dining room just for us (which was also attractive) and we had a lovely dinner.  The food was very good, the service was great and attentive throughout, and we will definitely go back.  We really appreciated the staff doing all they could to make us comfortable. The building has been unoccupied for a number of years and it's wonderful to see it back open and thriving.
