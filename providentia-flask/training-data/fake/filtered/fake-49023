If I could award a ZERO I would.  Can't review food.  Or drinks.  Because on a SATURDAY EVENING we showed up and were informed the restaurant wasn't opening because they didn't have enough staff.  I've never heard of anything like that in my life.  And this place is attached to a HOTEL, it is the hotel restaurant!  They should be mortified.
