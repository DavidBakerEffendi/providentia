If you decide to go there, be prepared to eat bad food for high price with poor service. My breakfast experience there ruined my entire day and I've been having a stomachache for the past 8 hours. Claire's corner has always been an attractive choice for its large menu, versatile selection, homey atmosphere, and good quality fresh food made from scratch in-house.  Today I was so deeply disappointed that I will never go there again. The service was horrible. Mainly because of their popularity, they became inflexible and rude. Cooked food bar was displayed on a shelf under glass. However, they refused to heat it up because it was before lunchtime and I had to stick to breakfast menu. I stuffed myself with gross  French toast and dry cake because I was starving and left the restaurant unsatisfied and longing for some real food. Despite my begging for the dishes on the food bar, the owner refused to waste 5 minutes of their time to heat me a plate. Meanwhile, they heated potatoes and cooked eggs for other customers... I never write restaurant reviews, but I neither was I ever this disappointed with food service.
