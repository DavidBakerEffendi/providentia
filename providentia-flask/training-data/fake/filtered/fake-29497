I was rather disappointed with what's supposed to be "the best soul food in Harlem." Personally, my grandma, mother and auntie could do better with Sunday dinner than they can here. The best thing about the place is the service. They have a friendly staff, and on occasion, the proprietor herself will come out and greet guests, asking them how their food is. My fried chicken was over done, therefore a little dry, and the portion of food on my plate (collard green and macaroni and cheese) left me still hungry at the end of the meal. Their food is just okay, its nothing to write home about. The worst part is that the place is soooo small so, expect to have your chair bumped or feet stepped on a couple of times throughout the meal.
