We went the other day for lunch. It was really bad. We ordered two potato soups, the special, no flavor, thin and gross. We ordered the irish nachos, housemade chips prepared like nachos. The potato was too thick, no seasoning, they tasted like cardboard. We also ordered a burger, it arrived dry, with no flavor. This restrauant is not going to last very long. The food is not good, has no flavor, they need a chef. Nice decor, but you have to have decent food to make it.
