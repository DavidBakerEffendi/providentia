This place is one of Philly's best places to eat....  My wife and i trek from Center City to Hummus at least once a week!! Best hummus in the city and their chicken kabobs are awesome.  We have been to many of teh falafel joints in the city and none compare to this, the place is always clean! the food is always tasty!  Try the chicken shwarma, falafel or my favorite the sabich!!!
