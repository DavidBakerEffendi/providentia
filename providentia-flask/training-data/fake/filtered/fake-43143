I am currently attending an intense graduate level program in the area and this past week some of my colleagues had mentioned PINE; therefore, we decided to make a reservation. I had some of my own reservations after reading the current posts. However, we had a fantastic evening at PINE.     Myself and two others arrived early and decided to have a before dinner cocktail. This was a great idea! We enjoyed a muddled raspberry cocktail which was not presented on the menu; however, crafted by the tender upon our request!     George, a manager, who was very attentive suggested a bottle of wine for the table upon our request. He genuinely suggested a unique bottle that matched exactly what we were looking for (including price!)     Personally, my food was extremely tasty and the beef tartar even reminded me of a visit to France when I was younger ! Every single person at my table thoroughly enjoyed their meals.     Keep up the good work, PINE! There really is no other place like this in Hanover!
