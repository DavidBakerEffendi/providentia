Everything was tasteful and very unique. Blue has an array of appetizers and has a different twist to the ordinary. Great wine menu. The service was pleasant. I originally sat in their outdoor dining but was chased out by the bugs. They swarmed our food and quickly moved indoors. The staff apologized but I felt they should have offered something complimentary for the inconvenience. The tables inside were extremely small and very difficult to maneuver the plates to fit. Overall, I would definitely be visiting for another nice evening.
