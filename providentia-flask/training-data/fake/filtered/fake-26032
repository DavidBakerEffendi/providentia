I had the hirata buns, the akamaru modern ramen and the creme brûlée desert. My friend had a different type of ramen. Overall the food was very heavy since the fat content of the pork belly that they use for the buns and the base of the soup is very high. The buns were awesome!!!!!! If it were not so pricey ($9 for 2) then I would have gotten more. The ramen was only ok. I would not drop $60 for another meal for two people at this place again but it was decent for my first time as a Japanese ramen place in the city. There are many other Japanese ramen restaurants in saint marks place with cheaper menus and more buns so I wouldn't come back here just for the food.
