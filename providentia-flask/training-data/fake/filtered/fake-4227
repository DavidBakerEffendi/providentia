We recently had San Sai cater lunch for a conference that we were holding. I couldn't be more pleased with how things went! The servings were very generous and the food was absolutely delicious. Some of our sushi-loving participants said that it was the best Japanese food they've ever eaten. The food was delivered on time and was beautifully presented. 5 Stars for sure!
