Real, authentic italian food. The owner, Mauro is the guy taking your order most days and a pretty easy going guy. Of course it's super small but they get a pass for the food is delicious! You're greeted by their motto "No diet coke, no decaf coffee, no skim milk, only good food" and you just know this place has a special flavour to it. Try their penne arrabiata and I guarantee you'll be back.
