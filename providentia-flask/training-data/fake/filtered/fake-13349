Service is atrocious. Food is not bad, but a good portion of the dining out experience is the service. I don't expect to be waited on hand and foot, and I understand a new/inexperienced server will be running around like a chicken with its head cut off, but when you look around and see other tables seated after you being serviced first and more attentively, and you constantly need to call out to the server and remind the server to bring items to the table, it gets annoying after the third time. For crying out loud, this is not a large restaurant! I get better service at the truck! You ever get that feeling after you sit down, wait a bit, ask for water, then wonder if you should leave after what feels like 20 minutes of no one wanting to take your order? That's here. The food is unremarkable, except for the base (the fried cheese over the tortillas and the deep fried sopes) - those were yum. Service was dumb. :(
