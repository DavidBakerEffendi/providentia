this is the only branch of the mighty Ippudo outside of Japan itself. having been to Japan 17 times (really), I can tell you it tastes the same, and it's great. to those who say "theme park behavior of staff": i say baloney. EVERY real Japanese establishment greets you and sends you off with the goofy shouting (ok not always shouted but definitely loud). it's considered rude not to. so enjoy the authenticity! to those who say "you can make it at home": baloney...they boil pork downstairs for 13 hours to get that broth, then season it with things you don't have. to those who say "it's all MSG": baloney...(see above). that woozy feeling comes from a big warm belly full of fatty amazing pork broth and carbs. you're not drugged. you're well-fed. add the decent sake collection, and i'm happy. the only thing missing is these amazing carmelized gyoza pork dumplings on the menu in Japan only. but i can wait....
