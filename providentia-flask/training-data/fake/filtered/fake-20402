Though I do much more grocery shopping here than using the restaurant side, I thought the food was above the quality of the other vietnamese places in town. It's a little funny eating dinner and seeing people with shopping baskets walk by, but the food makes it worthwhile. And it's my go-to asian grocery store, hands down.
