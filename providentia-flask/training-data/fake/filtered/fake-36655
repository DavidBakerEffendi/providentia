This is was first and only time I will ever go to PYT. I spent 15 dollars on a burger that was dry, there was no mozzarella cheese in my burger, and the spaghetti was hard, burnt and not seasoned at all!.. I was so hoping for a great experience but instead I wasted 15 dollars on a burger I couldn't even finish because it was just that bad.
