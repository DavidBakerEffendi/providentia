I have been eating at Sazon for about two and a half years now, and the food is fabulous, creative, and inexpensive.  A hidden jewel on Spring Garden, Sazon boasts home-cooked Venezualan cuisine, including arepas, empanadas, platanos, and the most delicious chicken soup I have ever eaten.  The entrees are exceptional, and the hot chocolate is out of this world - I rate it up there with my best orgasms.  I also enjoy the fresh juices such as passion fruit. I recommend this restaurant highly, and I am proud to be a loyal customer.  The chef, Judy Suzanna Campbell is humble, but very dedicated to bringing her traditional food to a wide audience.  Her husband, Roberto Campbell is known for his amazing innovations in Venezualan chocolate desserts, hot chocolate, and other sweets.
