I've lived in the piazza for 6 months now.  Not a weekend goes by without having to listen to a fight between some stupid thugs after a night of boozing.  This place attracts nothing but garbage at night. Last night's shooting is just another example of the garbage it attracts.   The food is ok, but it is not worth risking your life for.
