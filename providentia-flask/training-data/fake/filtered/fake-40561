What a brilliant idea to open up a cafe connected to our town's beloved bookstore! This corner in Watchung Plaza has now become one of the hotspots in town. The food is wonderful and the family-run business is refreshing and delightful. Very original menu and everything I have eaten there has been fresh and well presented. Highly recommend for a delicious and casual breakfast or lunch. Great coffee too!
