Great place to go to with a group of friends and Eat, Eat, Eat.  We went there with 2 other couples and really had a great time. We ordered Apps - Charred Octopus was great, Mommy's Meatballs was  Excellent, and go for the Crispy Artichokes as well.  We split 4 salads which were all good and then we went fot the Pizza's. All thin crust wood stove and excellent. Mushroom Zucchini was good,  Pepperoni awesome, Margherita we did 2x and we did a Burrata as well.  5 pizza's was more than enough for 6 people.  The waiter we had was informitive and really knew the menu. The place is really fun especially if you are with a group.  We will be back !!!!
