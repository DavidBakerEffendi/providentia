The music, hostess and the bartender oh wait the waiters&waitresses are delicious parts to the whole ambiance of this beautiful restaurant. The bartender was nice, smiled and spoke while I waited for my friend offered me a Ginger Ale with lemon, the hostess with all that hair and pretty smile said I had to wait for the rest of my party to get seated and the Macaroni&Cheese is the Bomb GIRRLLL!!! My friends came and ordered drinks and he kept with the ginger ales in different glasses with sliced lemon with a smile..I guess he noticed I was the only one at his bar without an alcoholic drink.. I LOVE THIS PLACE!! The oysters are the BOMB as well!!! The best time too go is during the weekdays so the rush and crowd do not distract from the GREAT FOOD and hospitality!!!!
