This is my favourite restaurant in the city, literally. The food is artful and waiters are usually warm. It has this ambience that not stressful but elegant, and makes you feel welcoming. The only less than perfect experience is the new young male bartender--I saw him him being hostile and crass to other customers and I wonder if that was just an exceptional one time thing. I'd of course go back again soon. I have faith in this place and one unpleasant experience could be accidental.
