Love, love, love this place. The neighborhood bistro--well worth a trip outside your hood!--serves consistently authentic, comforting, and soul satisfyingly delicious meals in ample proportions. They have a great selection of salads and desserts, and the wine pours are generous. it is affordable and easy, and the head waiter--at least he appears to be the head waiter--is relentlessly friendly and helpful, and unflappable. We love the steak frites, the sole, the sacre de couer salad, the coq au vin. For parents: the chicken fingers are made in house... Quite simply, it is a lovely place for a dinner or brunch for couples, friends, and families alike.
