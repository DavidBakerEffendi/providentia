Please do not eat here!  Max Brenner is waaay too expensive for what you actually get.  The chocolate tiramisu was $13.25 and although it tasted very good, they put it in this little 5 ounce glass cup.  Call me crazy for paying that price for desert but I'm a tiramisu freak and was sure for that price I'd get almost a 7 inch plateful.   The $16 kobe burger was served lukewarm and didn't taste as good as kobe burgers I'd had elsewhere.  We were sitting right near the kitchen and there were few other people there at 2pm this past Thursday so I don't know why the food wouldn't be hot.  We got a total of about 5 little "potato chip" fries in a little glass cup to go with our burgers.  Seriously?   I've never eaten at a restaurant that overcharged so much for a stingy amount of subpar food in my life.  I am not exaggerating.   Our waitress was lifeless and unfriendly and didn't do anything to deserve a tip - which she still got because my friend and I allowed ourselves to be slaves of custom.   High prices for small servings of substandard food at little wooden tables in cheap surroundings.  I repeat - please do not ever eat here!  Don't even buy their chocolate candy-to-go.  Instead, go two doors over to the Good Dog Bar for a culinary experience 10X better in every way.
