On the outside Modo Mio looks like another building on the North side of Girard Avenue, but once you have tasted the food and enjoyed the friendly atmosphere- you will see this restaurant in a whole new light. Chef Andrews has created a menu that highlights fresh quality products prepared with traditional italian flavors in mind. Each dish is prepared with classic care but given a contemporary twist. If the delicious food wasn't enough, the well-informed, detail-oriented staff will keep you smiling even after your belly is full! I LOVE THIS PLACE! Combine all these great attributes and put a modest price tag on it and you have the perfect Â mix for a new Philly favortie!
