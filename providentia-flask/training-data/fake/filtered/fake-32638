Over the past ten years, I have sampled diners throughout New England, and even a few in Colorado, and in most cases, I was satisfied.  But The Makris Diner has now become my hometown favorite. First and foremost, I go to a diner to eat, and I have never had better meals than at Makris.  I tend toward omelets, and these are the best.  The eggs are light and the ingredients are fresh.  My sons are more the pancakes and french toast types, and if given a choice, they want to go to Makris.  Need I say more? The second element of any diner visit is the coffee.  I never used to pay much attention to the coffee at diners.  It was what it was because I had to drink what they served.  But at Makris, the coffee is worth the trip itself.  The dark roast is always fresh, bold, and hot.  And unlike most diners, where I spend as much time looking at the bottom of an empty coffee cup as drinking my coffee, my coffee is refreshed constantly. Which brings me to the third and, in many respects, the most important quality of Makris, the people.  The service is quick, efficient, and friendly, as it should be.  But at Makris, you feel truly welcome, regulars and newcomers alike.  You're not just another table (or counter stool) they are trying to turn over. My standards for diners have been altered.  Before, it was about the tangibles that I could measure: service, cleanliness, food, and coffee.  But now, I also have an intangible measurement of genuine care for the customer.  In my book, Makris is the best at all of these.  No where else can you find this type of mix.
