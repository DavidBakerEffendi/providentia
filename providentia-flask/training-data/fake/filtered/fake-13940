Let's start with the worst part of the dinner, and yes, I am angry, but more so I feel disrespected. The Tiramisu - worst I ever had, they promise blood orange, amaretto etc. what you get is dry pound cake (from yesterday) old mascarpone cream and whipped cream. It is an embarrassing dish and although the dessert scene in Philly in general is mediocre, this one has managed to really get me upset. What else did we have - sardines, again in every street corner in Portugal you get better. The meatballs were nice, the salad - forgettable. It seems enough people enjoy the place so there must be something right about the concept. If you however take food seriously I would not recommend this place.
