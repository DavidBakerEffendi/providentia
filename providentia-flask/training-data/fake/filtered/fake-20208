Most reviews of Tria reflect the age range of many of the reviewers. The mostly excellent reviews seem to come from folks who are under 35 years old. As an older reviewer, I think its important to stress that the crowd here is generally younger, and while the wine selection is decent, it is not the most interesting selection in the city. Coupled by the very young crowd, I found it to be not the best food & wine experience for anyone in their late thirties or early forties. The cheeses are mostly pedestrian by philly standards. Philly is a cheese town, after all, with a number of amazing cheese shops. The wines are often very poor quality selections of some very interesting grapes. Sure, you will find Gruner Veltliner on the menu, but its a rather poor quality one. The noise factor is one of the main reasons I am giving it only 3 stars. The place is an echo chamber, full of very loud and very young woman... at least the two times I have visited Tria.
