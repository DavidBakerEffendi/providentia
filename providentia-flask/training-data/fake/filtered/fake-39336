When eating genuine NJ pizza, there's an instinct to fold it. Only Â the best thin crust can inspire that instinct. Whenever I get back to NJ, I go to Alfonso's. This last visit, I discovered the veggie. Large chunks of broccoli, tomatoes, onion, etc. Great service, friendly, family atmosphere Can't be beat
