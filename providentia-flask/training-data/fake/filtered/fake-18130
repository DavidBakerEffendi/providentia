Went here for restaurant week. the selection for RW was great, typical three course meal. I had spinach pie, chicken with orzo, and rice pudding. food was really good, im usually a red meat fan but this chicken was fulll of flavor. service was decent nothing to go crazy about. over had a great time, would go when its not RW also. paid about $50.
