I'm SO glad we went to dinner here. The atmosphere is warm and the staff super friendly from the hostess to our waiter. The salad bar has so many choices. The food came quickly and just as we ordered it. My wife ordered the Salmon over spinach and it was tender and moist with a sauce that was so incredibly tasty. The Prime Rib I ordered was cooked medium just as I asked and melted in my mouth. We are really looking forward to our next visit!
