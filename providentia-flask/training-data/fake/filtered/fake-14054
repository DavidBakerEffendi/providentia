I think the chef accidentally spilled the bag of salt into our meals while preparing them. The Biscuits Benedict and the Chile Marinated Shrimp were both smothered in salt. The portions were much more decorative then for eating purposes. Ironically, the way you are rushed out of the place, you couldn't even appreciate it from an art angle if you wanted to! It's also a shame, because the Shrimp had a nice spicy touch to it(though too spicy for my girlfriends taste, so not for those who aren't that into spicy food), and perhaps the biscuits and honey smoked ham would have been pretty good, otherwise. But we both suspected that the salt was making up for a lack of other flavor, for the most part. It's a really trendy place, the prices are a bit up there for the amount of food you get, and the wait staff is over you like hawks, so there isn't the right atmosphere for a slow, pleasant brunch conversation. Â We made the best of it, but probably about as undesirable a place as there is to ever return to, I'm sorry to say.
