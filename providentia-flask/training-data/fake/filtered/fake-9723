Went in for brunch today with my family. The decor is classy/cute and the service was great. I loved the eclectic plate ware and the farm to table concept. They served muffin assortments instead of rolls (tasted home made) and the milk for coffee came in cute little milk glass. We had the sausage scramble, the smoked salmon omelet and crab cakes. All delicious and you can taste the quality of the ingredients. We will be back : ) p.s. They are BYOB.
