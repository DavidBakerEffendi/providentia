Me and my mother went there for dinner on a weeknight.  We had a Living Social deal so we decided to use it.  The Kale salad was good and that's about the only thing that was good. The service left a lot to be desired and the food was terrible.  My mother and I both ordered hamburgers.  My mothers came back raw and had it sent back three times.  Do they not check the food they cook there?  The waitstaff did  not seem to be overly concerned about feeding the customers raw meat!  To their credit, they did refund her purchase. My hamburger looked ok, but smelled and tasted funny.  I gave the benefit of the doubt and did I pay for that!  The meat they used for the hamburger had to have been expired because I was violently ill with food poisoning the next day.  I had the horrible aftertaste of the rotting hamburger lingering like poison inside of me the rest of the day.  We had a horrible experience there and probably won't return until the department of public health examines the place.
