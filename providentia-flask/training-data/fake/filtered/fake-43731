UPDATE 4/15/2012.  I wrote a very nice letter of complaint to the restaurant explaining all of this and they failed to answer me.  I strongly believe that a restaurant that can't answer a customer complaint does not deserve to exist.   Are you the type of customer who wants to eat in a restaurant where they won't even respond to a complaint? We went here the other night for probably the 15th time in the last 3 years and this place has really gone downhill.  The food is still quite good, but the service was horrific. 1.  They didn't have the wine I ordered.  The waitress could not suggest an alternate, nor could she ask anyone else working there to discuss wine with us. 2.  We asked if the waitress could serve us our tapas gradually instead of all at once.  She flatly refused, "The ticket is in already, I can't do anything."  So we got to eat cold tapas.  An excellent Frito Misto becomes fairly unpalatable when it is cold.  In addition, we also ended up with every square inch of our table covered with plates - to the point where the busboy stacked the pork belly on top of the paella! 3.  Both the waitress and the manager refused to honor our Foursquare checkin special. It's sad because these guys had a quality operation for a long time, but I believe they are now cutting corners and riding reputation.   I'm not going back there again.  And I repeat that I have dined there at least a dozen times and enjoyed it.  Last night left us feeling unsatisfied and neglected - not a winning combination for a restaurant.
