I am used to the high prices and mediocre coffee at Starbucks. Cafe Boca Ciega has great Cuban influenced coffees and treats. This is a can't miss spot in not only TrBeCa but New York City as a whole. The staff is excellent and well versed in their art. Their coffee packs quite a punch...and absolutely love it.
