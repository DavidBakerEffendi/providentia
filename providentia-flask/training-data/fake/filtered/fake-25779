DON'T BOOK A PRIVATE PARTY HERE!!! I had my rehearsal dinner at LaScala's a few weeks ago.  It was a nightmare.  We invited 60 guests and booked their private room.  A week before the dinner, I came in to check out the room and describe how I wanted the tables set up.  I wanted tables of 8 or 10 and instead we had these extremely long tables which made it difficult for people to get around.  Issue number 1.  Both bathrooms were broken the night of our rehearsal.  Issue number 2 (Big issue!).  Our guests had to use the bathroom in the building's basement or the Dairy Queen next door.  So tacky!  Lastly, we were required to give them the entree counts prior to the dinner.  Most restaurants allow their guests to chose their entrees when they get there and they just make sure to have enough food on hand.  Some of our guest switched their meals and the restaurant said they wouldn't be able to cover them.  The manager came to me (as the bride) and asked me how I wanted to handle it.  I was dumbfounded!!  Haven't they dealt with this before??  Isn't it there job to handle these sort of issues?!  I had a list of what everyone ordered but I didn't want to go name by name through 60 starving people.  Issue number 3. In the end, i think they stretched the fish dishes.  Meaning instead of getting two pieces of fish, those that ordered fish only got one small piece since they didn't have enough to go around.  On top of all that, they overcharged us for five meals and said that's how many came out of the kitchen.  Issue number 4.  This caused me so much stress.  The issues were circling around in my head the entire night before my wedding.  The only saving grace was that two of the dishes tasted okay.  The fish dish had no taste.  I've eaten at LaScala's with my husband in the past but I will never go there again.  I'm furious!  Thank goodness my wedding day went smoothly!
