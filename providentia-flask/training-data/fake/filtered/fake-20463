I've been back a number of times since my original review, and things just keep getting better.  The burger is delicious.  The goat cheese baguette is as yummy as before -perhaps a bit of turkey on it, as an option? - but hands down, Jack's Breakfast is my favorite.  The eggs are, well, eggs, but tasty.  But the steak... oh my... so good.  It's a smaller portion of the dinner steak, cooked to perfection - rare enough to get some red center, then pinker outwards to the crispy charred fat along the edge.  My mouth is watering thinking about it.  The dinner portion is too much food for me, but breakfast? Anytime!
