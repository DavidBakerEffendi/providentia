I love going to this restaurant after a long week of work. Having a wonderful meal there is my little treat to celebrate the end of another busy week. It is a perfect place for good friends to meet and catch up. The ambiance is warm and the staff is very friendly. I tried many dishes in their menu and loved every single one of them. The prices are very reasonable for the quality of food they serve. I highly recommend it.
