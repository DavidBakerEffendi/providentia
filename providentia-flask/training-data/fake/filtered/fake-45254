I had a horrible experience with the owners of Gelone and Lissoni in North Arlington. My Mother and Father, two sweet and innocent people booked a party for over 40 people at Gelone two months ago and already given them a deposit and invitations were sent out with the date that was agreed upon. One week before the party, my mother went to give in the final numbers for the party.  They told my mother that they gave the room away to someone else, a friend of the owner, and that they moved the party to another day.  After we refused to change the date.  In talking with the owner of Gelone's, he was rude, belligerent, unapologetic and insulted us by saying neither restaurant wants "people"  like us, after he told my mother earlier to her face that Lassoni's had room on the date we needed.  People like us? What kind of people are we? People that are paying customers who just wanted the owners to do what was right and keep their word.  Obviously these owners have no respect for themselves or others since their word means nothing.  I have never been so insulted by another human being as much as by both of the owners Chris and Giuseppe. Both owners repeatedly lied to us and insulted us. I WILL NEVER STEP FOOT IN EITHER RESTAURANT...NOT EVEN RISOTTO'S IN RUTHERFORD THAT IS OWNED BY THE SAME OWNER. THEY ARE RACIST BIGOTS and LIARS!!! NOT TO MENTION RUDE, ARROGANT AND INCONSIDERATE OF PEOPLE!!!
