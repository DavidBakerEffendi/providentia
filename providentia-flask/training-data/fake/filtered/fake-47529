A tourist trap with great marketing.  You do wait in a long line outdoors for an hour and then enter an "earthy" small crowded restaurant where customers sit across from each other at long tables.  Prices are about twice what you pay outside NYC.  The pizza is high volume mediocre.  If you want a slice of the "New York Experience" go there.  Otherwise enjoy NYC sightseeing, walk the Brooklyn Bridge and forget about  Grimaldi's under the bridge.
