We used to order food from Steak & Hoagie all the time @ my firm down the street. The food quality is inconsistent...half the time cold. When good it is good but you never know what you are going to get. We have spent thousands and thousands of dollars here and today we had a delivery that was missing a sandwhich. We called to inform them and they told us they had several "witnesses" see the missing sandwhich go into the bag. Now...you would think that we are a valued customer and they would promptly correct their error. Instead they refused to bring us back the $6 sandwhich after all the business we give them!!! This place does not appreciate their customers and hung up on us insinuating we were lying. Pretty stupid in my opinion to tick off one of their best customers. We will go to great lengths to insure no one @ our business orders from this overrated hole in the wall.
