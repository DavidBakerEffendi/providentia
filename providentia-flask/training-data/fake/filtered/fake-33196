I think a reviewer on this site said it well when they said it's all about expectations. For a neighborhood restaurant, this place really does the trick, and they do it well. Here are some specifics: - Super eggplant parm, - Very good pizza, although I recommend you ask for your pie thing and crispy (if you like it that way) - Pasta is very basic, and admittedly I'm a stickler for pasta, so not my fave - Always consistently friendly and good service Not saying this competes with super fancy places, or the best in NYC, but always satisfying.
