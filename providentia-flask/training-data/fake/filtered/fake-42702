I have been a fairly regular customer, enjoyed the slices although disappointed from time to time in not having available the regular flavors, while they experiment with new choices. But could live with that...and always the wings, which are good but always take an awfully long time to be served...frustrating but could live with that...but the attraction of 2 specialty slices and a beer for $9.99 was most of the reason would stop.... Well I guess all good things come to an end, at least in part. Ziggy's opened a new "Tap Room" to expand its "service area" and to remove the Bar side from the Family side, unfortunately, the transition to a bigger space, which is visually attractive for a large open bar, and clean since it is new, has the ordering, service and experience in such a turmoil, it will be a long period of time before I return, if ever. Stopped at 4pm for a quick slice, beer and some wings, with son and daughter in law who were visiting, thinking a quick bite and be headed home. The slices had to be ordered and paid for at one place, getting the beer and wine at the bar (which wasn't crowded) which was ordered but took 10 minutes to get, while the pizza got cold, and then to order a salad and wings.... TERRIBLY DISORGANIZED.   The salad took another 10-15 minutes, which I had to remind the bartender, who was too busy socializing on the wrong side of the bar, about the order. And then wait another 25-30 minutes to get the wings.... The bill for 5 specialty slices, 4 beers, a full "Black & Blue" salad,  3 glasses of house wine and a dozen wings (At happy hour price $.50 ea.) exceeded $70, paid in three different places. Was not a bargain, was not enjoyable experience, and IS NOT something I will be doing again or recommending to a friends.
