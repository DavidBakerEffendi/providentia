I've been to Yolanda's twice and have not been disappointed. I am cuban American and I felt the food was authentic and my Spouse thinks its better than my mothers. Sorry mom your the bomb when it comes to cooking especially cuban dishes but Yolanda's black beans were better and had more flavor. I plan to go again and again.
