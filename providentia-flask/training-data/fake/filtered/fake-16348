There's a general dearth of halal comfort food for the hungry lawyers and truant high schoolers of the outermost borough, but Papa's used to be my go-to place for a cheap, delicious, and bountiful lunch. I don't know if the management recently changed, but they have completely dropped the ball and I've been put off for good. The past three times I've gone, the price for chicken over rice has gone up every time without any explanation. There are two signs with different prices for the same food, and when my friend and I asked the cashier about it she just rolled her eyes and pointed to the more expensive one. Her demeanor is generally brooding and needlessly hostile. They also seriously decreased the portion sizes despite upping the price. It used to be a solid two meals' worth of food in one order, but now it's about one meal's worth. Plus, we stood around waiting for over 30 minutes until the food was finally ready. They screwed up my friend's order and then made someone else's food before hers, even after realizing they'd forgotten to start her food. They didn't really seem to care that they had messed up. Then, icing on the cake, her falafel was still uncooked inside, and she found a hair in her rice. Why the sudden change, Papa's? I used to be your biggest fan girl, but now I vow (Girl Scout's honor) never to buy your shawarma again. We're breaking up: and it's not me, it's you.
