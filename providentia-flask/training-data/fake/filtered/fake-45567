Honored to be DP's 100th review!! Been a fan since 1985. The best Italian food without a doubt in NY.  The linguine and white clam sauce is by far the best of its kind. I won't even order this dish outside of Don Pep's as I know nothing will ever compare. The biggest compliment one can give any restaurant is to say that they are consistent.  Since 1985 I have not had one bad experience. Every time they get it right. Waiters are a trip, casual gourmet dining at its best.   Top picks are zuppa de mussels, baked clams, chicken parm, and of course linguinie and white.  House red will set you straight to. Highly recommended for any occasion as my family and I have had many good times at Don Pepe's. A home run
