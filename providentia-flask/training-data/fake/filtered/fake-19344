I can't say enough about the new Twenty Manning Grill!!  Since the reopening I've been there on an almost weekly basis and have yet to be disappointed.  It's become my go-to place on 20th Street, since it's close to home and work.  The servers are always on point and I haven't been disappointed with any of my meal choices.  I've tried almost everything on the menu and have yet to pick a favorite. Top Choices: Moules Frites, Beet Salad, Burger (One of the best in town), and the Pork Chop.  The Prosecco has become a great summer favorite and a great pair to a fabulous meal.   P.S. The gooey Chocolate Chip Cookie/Vanilla Ice Cream dessert is delish!
