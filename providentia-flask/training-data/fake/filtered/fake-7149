This restaurant is, in my view, the crown jewel of the neighborhood.  I teach across the street at City College, and I've been waiting a long time for a place like Home-sweet-harlem to open.   It's in the location that used to be the restaurant "La Pregunta".  But H.Sw.Harlem. is on a different level altogether.  When you order a coffee, they ask if you want steamed milk.  (Not just for espresso drinks, even with regular coffee!)   The coffee (and espresso) are excellent.      I haven't sampled all of the food on the menu, but I can say that the soups are amazing.  I've had the  Curry Lentil soup (really special) and the Turkey Chili (also excellent).  As you know from the earlier reviews, the staff are wonderful, and the layout of the place is charming.   The general motif of the menu is 'healthy-eating' but also 'delicious'.  This is a winner.
