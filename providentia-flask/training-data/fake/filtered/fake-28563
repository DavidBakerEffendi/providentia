When friends visit from out of town, I gravitate here with them.  Food is one reason.  But more importunely, when I want dinner with friends who I have not seen in many years, I don't want a dark and noisy or rushed experience.  Jewel of India is well lit and not pretentious.  It's not so acoustically echoey that you can't have serious conversations, or have to hear all the details of conversation from the other table. If you want to linger over dinner, you're not rushed out.  But it's still a lively place, with a good mix of dinners.   The breads are terrific, loved the coconut naan they had as a special.  The rice and mint chutney are consistently good. The meat dishes are very well made.  I would not call it a gourmet restaurant.  But since Hanover doesn't have any dinner restaurant where I can take my friends to eat the traditional food of my own rural New England culture, I will keep going to the Jewel of India.
