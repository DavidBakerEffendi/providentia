Never had much luck in this place. They always seem to make it hard for you to eat there. For some reason you are never allowed to have a table at the back as it's always closed, and you are always offered to eat at the bar served by the most hapless staff in New York. The worst part is that THEY NEVER GET THE FOOD RIGHT. For a non-pretentious, real taste of Filipino food, it's much better going to Pig and Khao.
