I came in for brunch yesterday excited to try the pastrami and hash sandwich. I was crestfallen when I was told that they were out. It was 11 am and there are only 5 items on the brunch menu. Pathetic. How can you have a pastrami sandwich for lunch and a special of crab potatoes for the day but no hash? The manager in a suit looked disheveled and confused throughout my experience. I ordered a Sweetwater beer and it came out warm which was gross. The ambiance is non existent, it's a bunch of tables on top of each other in an awkward room. The owner is clearly trying to hard to make a "market" in olde city something it will never be. My advice to Ellen and Eli is to simply stop trying. The cuisine at Fork is pitiful enough, what a waste to have it's younger sister suffer as well.
