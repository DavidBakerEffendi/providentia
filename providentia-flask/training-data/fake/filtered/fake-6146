I had a guest in from out of town and we decided to try the brunch at Stone Hearth. She had the Florentine Frittata and I had the Eggs Benedict with bacon. We are long-time foodie friends and were expecting a good meal-locally sourced, fresh from the farmer's market, etc.. The meal was superb! The service was excellent and it was a glorious day in Westville Village, New Haven.
