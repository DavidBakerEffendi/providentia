Last time I was here was a long time ago.  My friends and I played our oletimers touch football game nearby.  We stopped by here afterwards and spent over $100.  As we were down to our last pitcher, we talked about ole time for 10 minutes.  For whatever reason, one of the managers stopped over and just about kicked us out, as if we were tying up one of his tables on Saturday night.  It was about 6 o'clock.  I guess he didn't appreciate the $100 that we already spent, and needed that table badly. I found the food OK, nothing you can't get around the corner,  but more expensive.  Overall, this is a decent place, but overrated.  And honestly, I didn't care for their corporate attitude.  Give me one of the smaller, local cheaper places in South Philly, where aren't in a hurry to get your table.
