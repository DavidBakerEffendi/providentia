Real NYers beware!! Yesterday, I had a very bad experience at Bathazar. Food was good and waitress was great but they were rude in their need for turning the table. Scene was Xmas lunch for work colleagues. 4 people for a long lunch with cocktails. Arrived at 2pm...but after a few hours they told us we had reached our drink per hour maximum and we were being cut off...we didnt think much of it and let it go. But then, we requested another round to see what they would say...they said no but now they said then needed the table at 6pm despite the fact there were many tables open....we had just spent $500 for lunch and, despite many drinks, we were completely in control and certainly not boisterous or bothersome to our neighbors. In fact, one neighbor couldnt believe they were treating us this way. We are not tourists. We are professionals who entertain for business. And, we dont appreciate being treated like naive tourists. Most of us are native NYers. As we left, i Â thanked the hostess for ruining a perfectly wonderfull afternoon. I will never go to Bathazar again or its other restaurants my money is better spent at establishments that respect their patron.. Real NYers beware.
