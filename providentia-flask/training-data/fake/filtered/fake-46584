Had brunch at Hudson Clearwater Saturday. There was a crowd but the staff went out of their way to accommodate us. We had the best seat in the house. I ordered salad, omelet, and beignets. My husband ordered the steak and eggs which he raved about. I asked for a dry white wine which hit the spot. My husband ordered one of their specialty drinks which was so good he ordered another. I was here when they first opened in 2011 and I am ecstatic to see that every time I think the food, service, and ambiance can't get better it does. Chef Wes you have out done yourself.
