This place is consistently GOOD. Whenever I have the craving for a tasty sandwich, this is my go to place. Have the specialty chicken cheesesteak with fried onions added, amazinggg! Basically all of their options are good. I would say you will be pleased with whatever you decide to order. However, beware, they tend to put dressing on subs without asking whether you would like the dressing, mayo, or dry.
