Where to start Best Breads in CT or in all of US. The pizza is really good. This place has been a staple in the New Haven County Pizza industry for years. Not many people do it better. It would be nice if they moved location Â to make a sit down restaurant cause they would sell out. There service is great you feel like it's your family. Max the cook or the brains behind the operation always makes you feel like your family. That is why I will always point people in the direction of this hometown landmark! Keep up the good work guys and gals (lady's at the register)! I forgot to mention the steak and cheese it's amazing!
