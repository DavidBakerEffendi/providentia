My husband and 10 year old daughter and I arrived after a long trip on a Wednesday night to Philly to visit our 27 year old son. It was also my husbands birthday..a big one.  We said all we want is a good burger within walking distance so he said we had to go here.  He admitted he wouldn't get the fried donut burger again though, although if you have a sweet tooth it'd probably be great. Our table wasn't ready at our res time but we only had to wait about 10 minutes, and the manager bought us a round for our patience...was very nice and got my daughter a milkshake which she inhaled even though it was so nice and thick. He did proof my son (which happened the next night too at a different restaurant) and although my 6ft tall son didn't like it, we assured him it's a good thing and we were glad the manager was so conscientious. My mushroom and swiss burger was out of this world, juicy and cooked t perfection and so were the others.  the sweet potatoe fries were the best I ever had and my drink was actually made how I asked for it! And best of all, I can't believe how reasonable the cost was for clearly excellent  food and service.  Anytime we are in Philly we'll be sure to save our burger cravings for there. They really know how to run a restaurant..again, the manager was excellent.
