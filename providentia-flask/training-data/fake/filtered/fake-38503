Never been treated as poorly as we were treated last night from hostess through manager.  Our party of four arrived for a 7:30 reservation and was never seated.  After more than 1 hour another party of four was given a table and we were informed that we could have seating at the counter.  Absolutely atrocious behavior from the hostess, then the wine steward portraying himself as a manager and finally the manager whose only response was that he only just walked in on this situation so there was no way to fix it.  If it is possible to give zero stars--no restaurant would deserve it more.  Too bad because the chef is really talented but restaurants can not survive on food alone.
