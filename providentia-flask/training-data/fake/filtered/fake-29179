Recently went into annabellas for the first time and needless to say I will be coming back....not sure what other reviewers meant by the sarcasm of the staff...Anthony took care of me and truly went out of his way to accommodate me....he offered me a sample of their fresh mozz and the best olive I ever had....of course I purchased more of both....this place is the real deal with a staff that truly cares....I will definitely be back!
