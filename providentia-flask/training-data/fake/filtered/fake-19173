We recently tried August for an intimate Birthday dinner.  The atmosphere was charming, service polite and professional, and the food was was excellent. We weren't rushed, nor did we feel a lack of privacy.  Our appetizers, entrees, and salad were all very well done.  The Banana Bread pudding for dessert was truly amazing! I would absolutely recommend August.   A great experience and being a BYO it didn't break the bank.
