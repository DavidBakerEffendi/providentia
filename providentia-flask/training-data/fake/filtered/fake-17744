Yama rocks! The food is consistently good , fast, and cheap. The waitstaff is always nice, courteous, and good. It is extremely difficult to find good service in the upper valley, but yama has it! Definitely worth going there. I gave 4 stars because the menu doesn't change, nor are there rotating specials. I would go here more if there were, because right now I have basically had all of the food on the menu I can eat (vegetarian). And it is a little boring to always have the same things to choose from. But overall, excellent place!
