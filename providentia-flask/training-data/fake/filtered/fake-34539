Just moved to the area and my wife and I went to Yummy's with a few friends.  Our reservation was 8:30 and we were sat as soon as we got there.  Food was great from the white tuna appetizer to the sushi rolls to the delicious dessert.  We had great service.   Everyone in our party loves sushi and raved about Yummy's.  Highly recommended and will be back again soon.  Also we got a lot of food for not a lot of money and also a BYOB.
