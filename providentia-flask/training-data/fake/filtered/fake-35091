Our family have been their customers since my girl was a baby, but we have never had a chance to write any review for them. My daughter is seven years old and she told her friends,"Nori is the only place I go for Sushi!" She likes Kani pizza and Fountain a lot because kani and cream cheese combination is her favorite. When she was very young, she liked a lot of tofu in her miso soup. The owner kindly gave us an extra bowl of tofu without charging us. Their servers are always friendly and sushi chefs are very polite. Tuna tartar and tuna amazing is what I like the best although they have so many good things. My husband likes their sashimi a lot. He works in a fish company and he can tell Nori's fish is the best, especially Yellow Tail toro and salmon toro. I am so glad that they can keep the same standard since they were open because consistency is not easy! Thumb up! Must try their updated special roll -- Ocean!
