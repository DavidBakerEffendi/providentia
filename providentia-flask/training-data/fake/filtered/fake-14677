This place was fantastic.  I live in Manhattan and came out here to meet a friend from NJ.  I generally eat at places like rareburger and 5 napkin and this place holds up.  The shopping center is a little daunting at first but the restaurant is class.  The service was above and beyond.  Food excellent.  I highly recommend.
