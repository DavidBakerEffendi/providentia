Cornerstone cafe offers you brooklyn home style food with brooklyn dinner-esk prices located in manhattan. Something very rare for the city. Their breakfast items are the best, especially the baked eggs, eggs benedict and their french toast which is becoming more and more famous. Their dinner menu is also a hit. With their "grandma" like italian dishes, makes you wish you were part of the family. Also, in new news. They have just gotten approved for their beer and wine liquor license and are going to start serving in the next fews weeks. They will also be staying open later... Till 11pm as i was told by an employee there. I read in one of the other reveiws someone said it was a cash only place, which is not true. They accept both cash and credit and also have free WI-FI
