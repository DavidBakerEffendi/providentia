I have been to Mancinni's a few times and each time has been extraordinary. The place is small and easy to miss, but once inside you know you're in the right place. Each member of Mancinni's is warm and very friendly (on the last visit, the woman turned up the volume on Cutting Crew's 'I Just Died In Your Arms Tonight' after seeing me dancing in my seat! The other guests boogied throughout their meals as well!). When my girlfriend and I went for a Valentine's pie, we were offered one in the shape of a heart! The ingredients are fresh and each pie is prepared in front of your eyes. The wood/coal oven in the back of the small restaurant is easily accessible and interesting to watch as your meal cooks. They offer Stewart's and Boylan soft drinks but like many of the Montclair restaurants, it is BYOB. The prices are very reasonable, approximately $11 for a "small" pie and $16 for "large". One large pie leaves two people satisfied. They will make a pie to any specification you ask so long as they have the ingredients on hand. Each time I find myself in the Montclair area now we try to stop here for a pie. The only problem I really found was the size. Every seat is near the entrance and on cold days you easily catch a draft from the opening door. People walking by either have to press against the wall as not to interrupt your meal, or the seated has to push their chair uncomfortably close to the table and meal. Each time I have gone, however, there have not been many other patrons inside. I have recommended this pizzeria to friends, family, and coworkers. If you find yourself on Bloomfield Ave and are in the mood for a good pie served by very friendly people, then Mancinni's is the place to go.
