Love this place!!! Seriously, have been here several times in the past month. Gluten free empanadas! The Domino is AWESOME, as is the steak. Great guacamole, very friendly staff and the mojitos are on spot. Tasty and strong. However, the last visit was plagued by a really overbearing and almost aggressive manager! He came over to our table out of nowhere and started to talking to us.. The table was clearly not trying to engage him in conversation, our waiter finally had to come over and interrupt! Totally weird and threw us off for awhile afterwards. Will still keep coming back for the food for sure but not necessarily this guy's company.
