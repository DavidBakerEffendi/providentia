I agree with the comment from Leslie, so I had to write too! I love this place. I was buying a computer at Small Dog and saw this place, I hadn't seen it before, and I was so glad I went in! Best Italian food I have had in a long time. I use to live in Italy and could not find a place in Vermont that came close to that authentic cooking, until I found Pulcinella's. Seriously to die for, I go all of the time - I love the panini's and the meatballs are so good. I also love the wine list they carry a lot of types you don't find at other places, and they are at a great price. Also to the Leah who wrote a comment, those are what real breadsticks are, the soft ones are at Dominos and the Olive Garden...not hardcore Italian eateries.
