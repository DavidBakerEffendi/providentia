My lady friend and I were walking by on Saturday evening scanning the ave for a bite to eat and opted for Cantina.  Wow!  This place is cool! On walking in there was a wait at the door (duh, its a Saturday) so we slipped by and snagged a table by the bar.   Christmas lights, loud music, dim lights, this place is for us!  We ordered our drinks (great tequila selection) and grabbed menus.  Our drinks were good, the food was good and the service was what you expect at a busy bar, attentive but very busy.  We really enjoyed our time there and are looking forward to coming in on a quieter week night to get the full experience (and time to work my way through all of those tequilas)!  A definite must try if you're in the hood!
