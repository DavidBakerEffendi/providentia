After being recommended this place by many friends my husband and I were very much looking forward to it, on our honeymoon from Scotland. The service is appalling, 45 minutes for our main/only course, hadn't even ordered a starter. I had the calamari starter as my main, it was cremated, black solid and cold, utterly inedible with a side of freezing cold tasteless watery kale/broccolli. None of the wait staff seemed to notice we hadn't been served after 45 mins nor did they ask how our meal was on bringing the bill.Can't believe how bad this food was considering how much people rave about it. Hipster nonsense, the emperors new clothes!
