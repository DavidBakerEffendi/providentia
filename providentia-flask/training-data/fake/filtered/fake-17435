I first visited Ristorante Venezia in August of 2013. I make it a point of returning at least once a month, sometimes twice. Anyone who can't enjoy themselves here doesn't have their head screwed on strait. From the greeting you receive at the door, to the atmosphere, the service and most of all the food. This place is spot on!
