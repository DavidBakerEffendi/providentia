Earlier this afternoon, my boyfriend and I stopped by this restuarant to celebrate his birthday and WOW!  Were we impressed.  Our waiter was incredibly nice and attentive, starting us off with a yummy chips and salsa platter.  For an appetizer, we ordered nachos with cheese, beans, and jalepenos.  DELISH!  For our main meal, I ordered tacos with spicy chicken and my boyfriend ordered tacos with regular chicken.  In addition to that, we ordered a side of rice and beans.  The food was made quickly (we barely waited longer than 15 mins) and was so yummy!  We entered this restuarant with empty bellies and left feeling like Kings.  I would ABSOLUTELY recommend going to this restuarant - the food is terrific, the waiters are fabulous, and the place is small, clean, and very comfortable.  I'll definitely be hitting this spot more.
