I went to this place once with a friend, it was a semi-okay eveing, so I thought, what the hell, I will try it again. I went a second time with a different friend, the crowd was pretty wild, good energy, I'd give the music a 7, so all in all, it wasn't a bad night for me. The third time was the best time I went, and I should have just left it that way, and never looked back, so I'd have some fond memories of the place. The music was poppin' the place was hot, I really had a nice time. Well, off the back of that experience, I took another friend there, after being away for like two months. OMG, it was so WACKY, and I mean that in the worst possible way! The DJ was some skinny dude with long stringy hippie Â hair, the music sucked, there were no words! Just some lame tune kept playing and he was fiddling with the tempo. I tried to be positive, and stuck around for a good 20 minutes in the hopes of things improving, but they never did. I started to look around, the crowd was pretty freaky....a bunch of uncoordinated old fogies, wiggling about, and flapping their limbs, the only thing I can liken it to is a wounded animal writhing in pain, or someone getting zapped with a stun gun. I couldn't take it, so I left, quite pissed! I wanted a refund, but decided not to even take it there. So I suffered a ten dollar loss plus cab fare.......I ended up going to a place up the street, which really was NOT my style, but I ran into some friends by surprise, and partied it up. The great thing is that the other club didn't close until 3AM. BOOYAH!
