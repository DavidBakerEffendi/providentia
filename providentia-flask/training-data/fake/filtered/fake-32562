I had food from a truck for the first time today and was not disappointed.  The food here is fresh and hot and plentiful for an affordable price.  Service is courteous; lines are long but move fast.  My only complaint is that the rice, while good, is anything but greek.  It's not how Greeks prepare rice pilaf.  Complaint #2: The Tzaziki sauce is great but how do I stop myself from smelling like a garlic clove for the rest of the day??
