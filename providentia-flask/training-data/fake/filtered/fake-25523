We walked in and just stood there, no one greeted us, for a long time.  After being seated we waited for over 10 minutes.  The waiter finally came made no eye contact and seemed to be annoyed to serve us. (There are only 8-10 tables in the room.)  The waiter dropped the menus and moved on, no smile, no specials... He came back we asked for the specials once again he was annoyed then we asked for some napkins he brought them back and dropped them on us instead of handing them to us. The owner who was also serving was greeting tables very friendly to people but not to us, never once greeted us. Something weird is going on in there like invite only.  All in all the service was horrific, the food fair, the atmosphere awful unless your on the VIP list.  We will never ever go there or recommend it.
