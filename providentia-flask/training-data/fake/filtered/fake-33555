Anyone can make a tuna sandwich, a basket of fries, a hot dog with toasted bun....so let's not bother with that.  NOT everyone can make the perfect ice cream cone...lackluster flavor, ice chips, skimpy scoops, favorite flavors out of stock, the list of possible disappointments goes on and on. NOT at SCOOP CITY :) :) :)   The absolute best ice cream cone I've ever had.....gobs of flavors, both standards and creative combos ~ practically impossible to choose just one, which is why you have to go back again and again!!!!!   As far as I know the ice cream is imported from a dairy in south eastern MA, and but for the limits of the board above I'd have given it 10 stars :)  Rich flavors, creamy textures, helpful kids having a blast at their summer jobs (I guarantee you'll have them explain a few of the options before you decide on one).....on a hot  summer evening nothing beats a drive in the air conditioned car to Claremont for the best ice cream since, well............ice cream!!!!!!   LOVE IT
