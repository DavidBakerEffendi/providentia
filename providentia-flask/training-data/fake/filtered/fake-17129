This restaurant is new to my neighborhood.  All the food we had was delicious, the lobster bisque, the lobster salad, the crab cake, the steak for two and the halibut, the brussel sprouts and the lobster mac and cheese. The steak was just as good as a steak from Peter Luger's, and all the seafood was very fresh.  The staff were friendly and very attentive. The fireplace in the back of the restaurant adds to the cozy atmosphere.
