Food is very good in the little storefront restaurant. Service was pleasant and you can BYOB. As stated the portion are big. Fresh salsa excellent. The complaint and the reason for only three stars is the food was cold. Room temperature cold. No sizzle to the steak fajitas, rice and beans cold. Don't understand it and even after sending the enchiladas back for reheating, they came back cold but the plate was warm. Â Learn to send out the food hot and you get another star or two!
