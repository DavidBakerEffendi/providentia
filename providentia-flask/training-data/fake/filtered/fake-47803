Had an exceptional meal here!  The clams casino,  fresh oysters and turtle soup for starters.   Then crab cakes and scallops for main course.  Every single item that hit our table was phenomenal.   The cocktails as well were spot on.  I had an "Oakland blackout". Which was delicious and pleasantly presented.   Our server Michael was very helpful -- quick with a good recommendation and a winning smile. The only thing that lost some stars in my book is the fact that while we were waiting for our table there wasn't a lot of room by the bar.  I ended up close to the service bar area and a manager was extremely rude about telling me I couldn't stand there.  I can understand if it's their policy but I'm sure there were nicer ways to go about telling me. All in all it did not ruin my experience too badly and I plan on returning.
