The reason that I gave only two stars is mainly due to the awful service.  The food should get 3.5-4 stars.   We were two large parties next to each other on a weekday afternoon for lunch.  The first offense happened when the food runner/server spilled hot oil from a pasta dish all over the legs, iPad and phone of someone in our party.  He did not even apologize and no one came out to remedy the situation.  After the incident, the server barely came to check on us.  We sat there for a very long time with empty plates until someone finally came by about an hour to check on us, in the meantime, the bus boy was clearing our table and took away a glass of wine right from under my nose that I was not finished drinking.   After we left the restaurant, the other party we were with was just finishing up eating and overheard the waiter complaining that he got a crappy tip.  Bad service = crappy tip.  Better training needs to be implemented in this establishment. We will not be back!
