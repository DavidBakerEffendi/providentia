Absolutely awful experience.  My order was messed up, the salad never arrived....I asked for gravy for my dumplings and schweinshaxe and after 15 minutes (food was now cold) it arrived.  Oh, and charged me a buck for the gravy lol!  Asked for the manager, he never graced us with his presence.  Overpriced for sure!  I have no problem paying a premium for good food and service, this place had neither.
