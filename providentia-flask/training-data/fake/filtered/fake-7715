I work in Hartford and i have to tell you that I will NEVER go back here.  I was asking a few questions about some ingredients (I have dietary issues) and a guy that identified himself as George the owner was so INCREDIBLY rude and condescending.  If you are too busy to answer my questions, then you are too busy for my business.  The funny thing was I had a group of work friends with me and we all said the same thing - not only would we NOT go back there but we planned on telling everyone about this experience.  What an ass!!!
