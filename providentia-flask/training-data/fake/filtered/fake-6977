This place has an abundance of TVs, so it's great for watching sports at the bar. Otherwise, it's very noisy and a lot of people crowd around the bar to watch. The food is average. Some basic dishes are good, but none are worth raving over too much. Overall, not bad, it just doesn't stand out as being great.
