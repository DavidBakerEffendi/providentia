Really enjoyed the breakfast at the Skinny Pancake. Easy to get to, cool decor and friendly staff. Coffee was really good and all 4 of us loved our meals. Tried the Heartbreaker (Nutella, banana, strawberry crepe), the Noah's Ark (2 eggs, bacon and 2 frumple cakes) and the Fetatastic (Feta, olives, tomatoes)...all amazing!  Asked if we could order Frumple Cakes separately and...YES!  If your meal does not come with any, order a side. You'll be glad you did.
