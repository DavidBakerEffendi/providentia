Atmosphere: trendy yet comfortable; very clean; lots of attention to details Service: had reservations (for 4) and we were seated on time; friendly, knowledgeable staff; well-timed (didn't feel rushed, didn't feel like we waited for anything) Food: avocado and spicy radish on toast is very good; sea bass is fantastic! Value: it's a little pricey, but totally worth it Overall: run, don't walk to Vernick
