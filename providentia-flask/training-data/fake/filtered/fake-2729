I love this place! The bartenders are friendly and pleasant, the beer selection is pretty good, and the vibe enjoyable. It's a pretty mellow place with a solid rock playlist and often has a movie playing (convenient for conversation lulls or enjoying a beer alone).  The crowd is chill, mostly twenties and early thirties if I had to guess.  Not too hipstery.   Their seasoned fries are amazing and their wings are also pretty good. Can't be beat for happy hour.  North Star throws a great New Years party as well. All in all, a quality, cozy, unpretentious bar in a neighborhood with few offerings.  When headed to this bar, I am happy to stay close to home.
