This is an amazing place to visit! There are so many vendors and a variety of cuisines to suite any craving. You can wander for a couple of hours checking out all the vendor's and their wares. The market is clean and well lit. Centrally located in center city, it is accessible on foot. A must see when visiting Philadelphia!
