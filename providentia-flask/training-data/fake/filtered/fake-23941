Talk of the Town is definitely the best places for quick bite in the area.  Right by Sona Jewelers.  This place is extremely clean and the service is good.  My mom and I ordered kachori chaat and samosa chaat.  Both to our surprise came in large quantities.  Compared to the other places around, we got a lot of food for the same price.  The quality of the food is also good.   The atmosphere is nice and I will definitely be coming back.  Also, the chai is superb here.
