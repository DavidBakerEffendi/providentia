They only serve the house brewed beer, which is not very good. They are all really heavy and are just not worth writing home about. They have the normal pub fare which is good (great frys), but that's really it. The place is dimly lit, and the there is usually a 20-25 minute wait for a table at peak dinner hours. They do serve food till midnight, which, is convenient.
