Just had lunch here.  Ate one of the specials: turkey with Apple and bacon grilled cheese on challah (sp) bread.  Bread was far too dry, apples were thick with thick skin and virtually no bacon.  Have eaten here before with slightly better results. To top it off we were sat next to a table with a LOUD talking gentleman who was apparently related to the owner and an expert on EVERYTHING.  Absolutely annoying and rude.
