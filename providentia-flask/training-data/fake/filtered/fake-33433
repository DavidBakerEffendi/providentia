Any foodie that lives in and about Hartford knows there are very few great restaurants to choose from around here. And Firebox is trying, but I have to say they are not one of them. Been there a few times, and have found they are suffering from the inablility to find great waitstaff. Consistancy is the issue. The food has been fantastic, to acceptable. Perhaps it was my choices, but the last trip there I felt the dish was so-so. So unmemorable, I can't tell you what I had. If you are looking for a quiet night out, this is not your place. The big back room does not have one soft surface to absorb noise, so even at 1/2 capacity, the room is loud. Go when they have all the tables full and it's really loud!
