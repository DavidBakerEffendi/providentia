the grandmother part is cute and maybe if the owners mother ran the place full time it would be ok   but it is tiny disorganized and unprofessional.   the owner bar tender is a casual  observer of this chaos who often turns into a wine nazi.  "My wine is always served at the right temperature"   Hey pal go home smoke some weed and let your mother run the place.
