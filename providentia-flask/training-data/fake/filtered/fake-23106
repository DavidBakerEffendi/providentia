We usually go to Wood 'n Tap on Thursday nights but lately we have been going on Tuesday evenings and have a waiter named Chris.  We were pleasantly surprised when the last time we went-June 10th,  Chris not only remembered what we had to drink but the tomato cheese pizzas  we ordered.  Kudos to Chris. We continue to take advantage of the gift card promotions. L.R.  Milford, CT
