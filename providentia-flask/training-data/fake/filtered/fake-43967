I was really excited to check this place out. When we got there about 5pm there was no where to sit. Tried to go to the bar and the bartenders ignored us so we left. So pretty inside but pretty means nothing when you are hungry and thirsty. We tried again after our show around 11:30, same results..ignored. So if you want to be ignored by the bartenders and just use the bathroom..go here.
