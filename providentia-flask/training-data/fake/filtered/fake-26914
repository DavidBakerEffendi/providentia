I went here about a week ago and the food was amazing!! I had a burnt ends sandwhich and sweet potato wedges, and they were to die for! The only thing that really put a damper on the whole experience was our waitress sigen. When we first were seated it was by another waitress with blonde hair. She was very nice and outgoing, but when we sat down the other waitress came over and started speaking over the first waitress. It seemed kind of rude to me, but I didn't think anything of it. Then every time my boyfriend spoke to the new waitress, sigen, she would lean onto the tabel and was very "friendly" with him. I tried to ask the blonde haired waitress to give me a refill and as I was speaking to her, our original waitress started speaking over her. Like I said the food was amazing, and my boyfriend and I will definitely be back, but maybe next time have only the blonde waitress as the other girl seemed rude and brought down the over all experience.
