i went on a tuesday and had the prixe fixe menu, which my friend insisted on prounouning "pricks ficks" and really irritated me, but that's not the restaurant's fault. "american food" usually means something crappy like chili's or applebee's but this place gives our country's cuisine a good name. the mac and cheese was satsifying, the burger on ciabatta break very fine. only the dessert was disappointing, though it wasn't bad. all in all a good experience
