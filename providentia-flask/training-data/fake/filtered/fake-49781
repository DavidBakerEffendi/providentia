I am so sick of hearing these yuppies come in to neighborhoods that were once extremely crime ridden and violent to complain about new stores. A few years back you could not walk from 49th to 50th Street without getting robbed. Hibiscus is a nice healthy spot to have in our neighborhoods--stop all the complaining and if its not up to your exact liking or taste then go downtown.
