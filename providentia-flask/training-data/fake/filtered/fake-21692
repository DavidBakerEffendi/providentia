Best Indian food that I've had in the area... I work on 5th and 31st and struggle to find good restaurants in the immediate area. I did a quick yelp search and saw that Pippali had great reviews and wanted to try it. My friend and I went today and I had the Chicken Tikka Masala lunch special--everything was amazing. We received large trays with seven little bowls of Heaven on them... chicken, rice, lentils, vegetables, spinach, raitha sauce and rice pudding. They also brought naan, which I used to scoop up the sauce that I couldn't get out of the bowl with my fork! I didn't want to miss a bit of the food! Very inexpensive, perfect portion size for lunch, friendly staff. Will definitely be back again!
