Tried again tonight...been there several times....never been better than OK, and tonight it was just plain bad. We live about a mile away and will not be back. Better options around and calories are better spent elsewhere. My wife who is not one to complain, did let the server know that the fish and chips was pretty bad. The server said she would see what she could do...cam back and asked if there was anything else that she wanted to try...after the meal was over. A bit weak, not that we really looking for credit, she just mentioned so that the cooks would, hopefully, do better next time.
