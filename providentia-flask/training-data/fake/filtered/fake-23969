Went there with a mellow, non-demanding group. We were primed for a fun get-together. Unfortunately our waiter spoiled what should have been a nice evening with impatient rebukes, a raised voice, and lectures about various things, including how the restaurant could not move a chair. Very strange. Afterward we spoke with someone who purported to be an owner/manager, but their Mona Lisa smile indicated they either didn't believe us or didn't care to. That's fine. We'll take our wallets elsewhere.
