We just had a great dinner at a new, latin inspired restaurant on Fairmount Ave.! Open barely one week, this airy, modern restaurant is open for lunch and dinner. The food was delicious! Very fresh and flavorful dishes presented beautifully! Four of us shared the authentic guacomole with homemade chips, Â shrimp and chorizo with a pineapple glaze and a wonderful chopped liver for starters. Our entrees included fish tacos with a delicious sauce and a refreshing watermelon and jicama side salad, a cuban sandwich and a fish of the day entree which was served with several sauces and salsa. All were perfectly prepared! They have a great selection from soups to salads, sandwiches and full entrees. With this restaurants resonable prices and fresh, perfectly prepared, flavorful selections I can not wait to go back!
