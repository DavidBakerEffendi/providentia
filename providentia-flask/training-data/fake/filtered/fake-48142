I am extremely surprised to see the overall star rating of this restaurant (currently only 3 and a half). The pasta here is by far the best I've tasted in the city (having tasted offerings at Babbo, Scarpetta and other well revered Italian restaurants in the city) and rivals that I've had in Rome. The pasta (made in house) was perfectly rich and creamy and every mouthful was a joy and pure heaven. My date thought his dish was a little too rich for his liking but he agreed that he hadn't had anything like since being in Italy. They even gave us free pistachio gelato (not as good as grom but still hit the spot). The only problem i have with this restaurant is that is so difficult to get a reservation to go back! If i could give it another star i would.
