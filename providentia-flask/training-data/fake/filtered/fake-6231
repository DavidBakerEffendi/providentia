Went with a friend to Mambo tonight for the first time and I strongly doubt I'll return.  Its a cool looking place and the wait staff is one of its attributes.  The Iced Teas are phenomenal and the flan was great too.  But, that's about it.   We ordered the ropa vieja tostones as an app and it was barely warm when it came out.  Our entrees were nothing impressive either.  The mofongo w/ pork just plain sucked.  Zero flavor.  The pork was totally taste-less and came in a sauce that resembled dirty water.   The churrasco w/ chimichurri was decent, but out of control salty.   I starved myself all day long in hopes of a great Cuban dinner tonight and I'm still pissed about it!  So disappointing.
