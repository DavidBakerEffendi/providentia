Friendly guys----long wait for food----big portion on the doner sandwhich----lamb meat was VERY unseasoned---two sauces on the side were VERY VERY underwhelming--very watered down--- Not sure if I will go again---- Have had doner kebab all around the world----kinda disappointing.....just had one last week at Alibaba in Toronto......flavor here at Istanbul not even close to Alibaba---which is a chain. Everything fresh!!! yes----but spice it up guys!!
