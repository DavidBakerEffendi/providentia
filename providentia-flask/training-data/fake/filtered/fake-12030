Tonight was my first time eating at Â Boulevard Bistro, and I will not be returning. I ordered the Roasted Lemon Chicken with herbs, and it was very bland - flavorless! The taste of herbs and lemon was absent. I was with a party of 8, and other folks in my party who ordered the Braised Ox Tails, and were not happy either, unhappy with the ox tail gravy over the polenta. it was a mushy mess. Would have been better if the polenta was on the side. Please Boulevard Bistro, improve your cuisine!
