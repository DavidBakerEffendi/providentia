The view is great, as long as you are on the river side.  We were seated along the pier, a little grim in the dark in winter.  Sappy music played excruciatingly loudly on speakers that seemed to be every two feet.  Appetizer, the small filet, garnish, a glass of wine, and desert for two  came to over $ 200 with the tip - pricey considering the steak was good but not quite up to par with the $ 200-for-two steak places in town.  Our appetizers were quite good, but the Berry Berry desert touted by the waiter was forgettable.  Service was attentive and pleasant.  It cost $ 12 to park.  All that being said, the food was good, and the place is different
