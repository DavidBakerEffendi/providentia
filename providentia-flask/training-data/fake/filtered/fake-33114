I used to a fan of this little establishment with comfort food, but today I had an awful experience with ARIELLE - who has, unfortunately, completely turned me off. Typically, the people at Westville are very friendly and do a great job in customer service - wether you eat in or have it delivered. However, today, ARIELLE was extremely rude, short and unhelpful. I have placed orders here for a few years and am very familiar with what is, and isn't included in their fical BRUNCH menu - yet, she insisted (pretending to put me on hold and speak with the manager, which of course, did not happen), and then she overcharged me for a substiution, charging me for a full separate side!! I am disappointed by this unpleasant experience, and hope that Westville Chelsea will weed out the "BAD SEEDS" and be able to move forward with the great service and good food I used to know them for.
