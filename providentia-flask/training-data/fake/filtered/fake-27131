I've been here many times and have had the following - wings , pizzas, grinders, salads, shwarma.  Oh yes, shwarma.   The pizzas are great.  Villa's got great quality cheese - crust is always fresh, ingredients are all fresh too.  The salads I've had - great as well.  One bonus - the salad dressing, in-store made vinagrette ... which I personally liked.   Wings are good + big - fresh chicken fried up + all the seasoning done right there on the spot.  One thing though, that's DEFINITELY got me coming back often is the shwarma.  Oh man, if you haven't tried this stuff - DO get some.  It's freakin good.  I've had it in Hartford, NYC, even overseas - this one's right up there at the top.  DAAAAAMN!  You've got a pile of awesome rotisserie meat + fresh-made tahini hummus + salad to go with it.  Either just eat the thing right out of the tray or make a sandwich.  You'll be overeating that - I guarantee it.  Oh - did I mention it's around five bucks?   :D    With a price like that it's TWICE as good.
