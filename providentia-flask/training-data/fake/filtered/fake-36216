The food is good, but the service is terrible. Also loud and crowded. After the waitress took our orders we were never able to get her attention again. The food arrived, we finished it and sat for about 30 min with stacks of dirty plates on our table, trying to get the server's attention. We ordered a 3 course pre-fix lunch that was included dessert, which we had hoped to get. Eventually I cleared our dirty plates onto a neighboring table to see if that would signal that we're done with food and would like a dessert and a check. After still not being able to get service, my husband walked over to the waiter's station to pay. The we just left to get a dessert elsewhere, having been charged with no apologies offered. We won't be back.
