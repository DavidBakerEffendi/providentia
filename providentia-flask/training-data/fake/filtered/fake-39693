I am a Malaysian from Kuala Lumpur. I've been to this place once and that's it ! The food is not as good as it taste. The service also very disappointed. When I try to ask for soy sauce, the server just turn their head away and pretend not seeing you! The roti canai just like a roti tissue and expensive compared to the rest of the Malaysian's restaurant! The satay is SUCK ! I won't waste my money for this place anymore. REAL SHAME!
