I think this restaurant is spectacular.  My only hesitation is that I  don't want it to get too busy by letting everyone know that the service is incredible, the food delicious, and the prices are reasonable.  But that's not fair.  Everyone who has a chance should go. The prosciutto and buns are delicate and a must have, the calamari salad is tender and wonderfully seasoned, and the salmon and artichokes are moist and flavorful.  I love this place!!
