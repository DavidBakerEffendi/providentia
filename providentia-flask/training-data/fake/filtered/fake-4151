TOTALLY AWESOME PLACE!!!!!!! I was here a couple of Weeks ago and left a five star rating. I decided to try again and it gets better and better! I happened to be hanging out reading the paper when the chef came over to my table to photograph the daily special, which happened to be Fish and Chips. After he took the photos, he very kindly offered me the plate FOR FREE!!!! Not only was it delicious, and by far the most creative interpretation of Fish and Chips I've ever had, but it was all sustainable and the potatoes were local. Please check this place out!!!!! It's becoming my new favorite in all of Brooklyn.
