Any one that believes that canned beans are used in this restaurant are mistaken.  When I showed the reviews to the owner she showed me the storage area - BTW it's immaculate - and proved to me that she buys them in 100 pound bags.  I am going to post the photos I took.  I am very suspicious of people who make statements that are false.
