worst experience I have ever had, the service was very bad, never go back again. we went there on black friday afternoon to have brunch. the guy was so unfriendly, like he didn't want to work. we asked if we can sit at the empty table outside, he said he needs to ask the host if anyone else is waiting for the table. however, when he went back into the restaurant, Â he was walking around, chatting with his co-workers, totally forgot that we were waiting outside. eventually some busboy came clean the table, so we asked and he sat us down. the rude waiter came to take our orders after, didn't even bring us water or bread... about 40 mins later, our food still didn't come, so we asked him to check on our food, he said it's a busy day, that's why it's taking longer, but he will check on it...another 30 mins past, he came out with other table's food, the table who arrived at least 30 mins after us...so we asked him to check on our food again. he came back and told us that the kitchen has forgotten our order... if he had checked on our order when we asked him to, we would have our food ready, instead, we saw him chatting with his co-worker inside the restaurant. On top of that, he did not apologize, he just simply told us, if we want, we can leave, like nothing was wrong, nothing has happened...WTF we were cold(after sitting outside for more than an hour with only cold water), starving, and angry...we should have asked for the manager, but we were too hungry, we needed food, so we just left...and will never go back again, ever.
