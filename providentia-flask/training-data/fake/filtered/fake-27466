Went back for the first time in many years. We went without planning to, the place we were going to dine was closed for the night, and the line wasn't too long at Grimaldis. The pizza was still fantastic!. We got a traditional margarita pizza.   Only suggestion would be to go with a bigger group (we were only 2) to be able to try out a variety of different pizzas.  Only slight downgrade was that they (accidentally?) over charged us. We noticed the mistake, and they did correct it, but it was still frustrating.
