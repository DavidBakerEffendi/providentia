for the price! not super impressed. the service was mediocre. and they could have put more attention on the plating and presentation. my food was ok. but not impressive or memorable! sure its all "farm to table" but this is vermont, what isnt. and the beers are outrageously priced!!! if you think you are a " foodie " and like mediocre service from unproffesional hipster wait staff. then this is hog heaven for you.
