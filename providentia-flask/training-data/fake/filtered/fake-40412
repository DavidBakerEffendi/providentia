As for food-delish! As for staff-very nice! As for ambience-modern/simple! Just a +5 all around. Highly recommend the Pod See Yu (although I may have misspelled it), it is basically the Drunk Man's Noodle with a different name. As for the appetizers-liked what I tried (just don't remember the name in the menu). It's a perfect place in the neighborhood that's good for a date as well as a group outing!
