The food is amazing here, but it's hard to catch this place open. Just in the past week I've tried to make it here for lunch, only to see a "Closed until Xpm" sign on the door. One of those times I was there past the stated re-open time. Oh well. The food here is so good it doesn't even bother me. I continuously go here for my lunch breaks. The owner is super friendly, and really cares about his customers and their opinions. Give the lamb gyro with hot sauce a try, I promise you won't be let down.
