To get a reservation is not very easy. If you have passed this hurdle, you can enjoy this experience only. The ambience is quite economical, but they will be shepherd of mostly bearded men in dark suits. We opted for the accompanying wines, which was a very good decision. The individual dishes are top quality and highest rating level. If you like fine dining, this is the starry sky. For dessert, the chef comes personally, we did not know that he is the chef. He created the dessert on the table, without wasting a word, he disappears again. A great, expensive experience.
