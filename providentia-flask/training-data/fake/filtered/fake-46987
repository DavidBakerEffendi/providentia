Wow.  My friend and I made reservations for dinner here for one of our two nights in NYC last week.  We read about it in Zagat and could only get the 5:30 p.m. reservation (always a good sign).  We made plans to go before we saw a Broadway show.   From the arrival, the restaurant has a very warm and friendly feeling - almost like you are walking into your mom's kitchen (not really what I expected being connected to the Grammercy Park hotel).  The hostess greeted us immediately and our coat's were quickly checked in the coat room.   I loved the seating in the dining room - very open and again, warm and inviting but not too noisy (yes, there were others dining at 5:30-7 pm).  The food and wine list is so amazing, we did not know where to start - thankfully our server made great recommendations.  I started with the Insalata Misticanza (my favorite) and it did not dissapoint.  My friend had the Prosciutto e Mozzarella as her first course and it was delicious.  For my main course, I had the Agnolotti di Zucca and it was incredible.  The flavor and texture were just right; I savored every bite. Note: the portions are just right and perfect for sharing.  I would recommend ordering 2-3 courses/person. Our experience at Maialino was excellent and I would highly recommend it.
