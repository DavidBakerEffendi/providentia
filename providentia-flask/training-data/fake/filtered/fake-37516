Stopped in for a bottle of wine to unwind from a day shopping in the village. Had lunch at Joseph Leonard and received AMAZING service. Here was totally the opposite. Waiter was extremely rude, flippant and attitude at every step. He needs a new career for sure. Too bad!! The place looked promising but service killed the experience.
