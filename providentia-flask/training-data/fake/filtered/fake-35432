Hands down the best Italian food this side of the Atlantic.  Been to L'incontro several times.  The food is simply amazing; from traditional Italian to more modern and exotic choices, you can't go wrong.  There menu is sizable, and their specials are numerous.   You can never go wrong with their Osso Buco. Also their venison steak with a bluberry and moscato reduction is by far one of the most amazing meals I've ever had.  Go to Trattoria L'incontro; your taste buds will thank you.
