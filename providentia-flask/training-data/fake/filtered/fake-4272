The 2 star rating is  "Meh. I've experienced better... And sadly I've experienced better at this very same "traditional diner"  at better times. It's been awhile since the Mrs and I have been here, we used to frequent The Americana in better times.  But we decided to make a special trip and relive some of the old goodness that the Americana used to dish out.  We walked into the same great looking place that we were used to seeing. We were quickly seated and got our first warning when we had a sheet of paper that consisted to be the "Breakfast Menu".   As a "traditional diner"  you should be able to choose from a wide variety of breakfast choices, in fact you used to be able to here at one time, it was part of what made the Americana what it was and why it used to get rave reviews in local area newspapers... Granted I could have had my eggs, but I wanted steak and eggs, which is a traditional american breakfast.  Sure they can get me a steak as they do serve steaks for dinner but that would cost me $24.00 ...  Slightly less then double what it costs to get the item which is on menu's at real traditional diners across the state.  It is a staple on diner menus...   It used to be a staple right here at the Americana.. So rather then spend an outrageous $24 for what I should have been able to get for like $16 in most of NJ I opted to get 4 pancakes with fruit and a side of bacon for $11...  Hello I can get 2 eggs scrambled with breakfast potatoes, bacon and 3 pancakes for 6.99 at Perkins...  It's sad to see what was once a great place to go, end up being a bad experience.  Folks if you want a choice for breakfast there are 2 other diners within 5 minutes of the Americana.   If you are looking for normal choices of breakfast staples you need to look elsewhere you wont find it on the Americana's 1  page overpriced menu.     You guys used to rock... sometimes change is not always a good thing.  Thanks for the memories.
