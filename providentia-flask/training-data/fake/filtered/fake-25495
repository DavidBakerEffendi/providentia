I have been going to this bistro since I was 15 years old.  Always loved it. Great food, I will admit it is overpriced. Crowded table set up means less than intimate dining experience.   BUT  last time I went to Leunigs was over a year ago, my sisters had given us a gift certificate for our wedding anniversary.  At the time I was pregnant with my now 8 1/2 month old daughter. On the drive home I told my husband i felt I little strange, fuller than I should have felt.  Then about 2 hours after arriving home I began violently throwing up. Two hours later found my husband also violently sick.  By 8 am the next morning i was feeling slightly better but my husband (who ate more of the shrimp and steak special app. than I did) was still violently ill, diarrhea, vomiting, severe muscle cramping.  He skin looked like wax and he was on the floor from muscle cramping so severe he couldnt stand. Took him to the ER where he spent the next 6 hours on an iv drip to rehydrate, muscle relaxers to stop the cramping and nausea reducing medication to help stop the dryheaving (since he had long since emptied the contents of his stomach).  After finally checking out of the ER we traveled to my OBGYNs office to hook me up to an iv drip and monitor my baby which they found to be in mild fetal distress, which resolved after 2 iv bags.     After all this the only thing leunigs had to say was...well nothing.  No apology, no refund, no compensation (not like we would ever go back there to use any GC anyway) They denied any blame for the incident, although the hospital planned to report the incident.  My husband and i were left with over 600$ dollars in medical bills.   Any one who frequents this restaurant, beware.
