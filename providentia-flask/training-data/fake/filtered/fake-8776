Was going to give it a 1, but I think the food is decent if you can make it that far into the meal.   I've been going to blue ribbon sushi in brooklyn regularly since they opened and was very very sad when they closed up shop. I'd been to the brasserie a few times but not recently, so we decided to try it (you can order sushi items from brasserie's menu now).  A few other posts have mentioned the service and it was really terrible (hence the 2 stars).     After we were seated, we waited and waited and waited. We were served water but nothing else--no bread, etc. The table next to us placed their order and received their appetizers.  We were in a corner and kept trying to get someone's attention (there were a lot of servers) but we couldn't get anyone to notice us.  After about 25-30 minutes, we told the host we were leaving. We went down the block to al di la and were seated and munching on their fantastic bread and butter in less than 5 minutes.  With such great restaurants in the neighborhood, I'm not sure how this place stays in business with such terrible service.
