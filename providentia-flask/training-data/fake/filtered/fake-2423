Was there with a bunch of girlfriends last night.  The service was very slow and not very attentive.  The food was not great, at least the main course wasn't.  The sides were actually good, like the bread and potatoes.  However, an incident happened where we gave the waiter cash and a gift card to pay for our check and he came back to tell us that the gift card wasn't working and a $100 bill was missing from the cash portion.  The waiter insisted that it wasn't their fault and there was no manager around that we could talk to about it.  The whole thing wasn't handled properly by the restaurant staff.  Very very disappointing.  On a positive note, I have gone there several times to the bar side for karaoke on Saturdays and I must say that part of the restaurant is great.  Good for a casual fun night of music and drinks.
