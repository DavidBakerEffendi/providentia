Food was good -- but I guess as it should be expected for southern cuisine -- it was quite heavy. I must say their biscuit is delicious, and they also offer some great fresh juices, which I didnt expect. Not a million things to chose from, but they're known for every dish on their menus. Atmosphere is nice, but expect a heavy smell of frying oil when you enter (we were at the very back of the restaurant, much more enjoyable in my opinion).
