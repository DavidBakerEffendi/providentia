Little pricey but the pizza was good. Also, there is a TV inside last time I remember so I don't know why it would say otherwise. I love this place and it is truly amazing! It is right next to AMC24 so you can eat, then walk on over for some movies. I had a blast last time I went. I do recommend order pizza with red sauce though because when I ordered a white sauce pizza it was really salty. I don't know what it was but perhaps it was just that one time. I don't know.
