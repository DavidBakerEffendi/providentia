Jims is quite simply the best cheese steak on earth.  Geno's is rude and so lazy they can't slice the meat.  Pat's has gotten cheaper and cheaper on the meat over the years.  Jim's has the consistency that lacks in a lot of today's establishments.  The staff is great, the service is quick and the cheese steaks are unbelievable.  If you go to Philly and only have time to hit one steak spot, make it Jim's.
