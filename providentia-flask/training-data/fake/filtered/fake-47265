I have been frequenting Lucas Ristorante for at least 10 years now if not more.  It has come a long way, originally being a pizzeria more than a restaurant, to the exact opposite now.  Located in a strip mall that isn't anything special, you wouldn't imagine it to be the best of places; that all changes when you step inside though and figure out you just found a very well kept secret.   Between all the decorations, art, and trinkets, which are all imported from italy, you get the feeling that you are really there.  The staff is always friendly and courteous, trying to make your experience as pleasant as possible.  The food is absolutely amazing.  Whether its the poached pear and goat cheese salad, the jumbo shrimp, lamb ossobuco, or their daily specials (just to name a few of my favorites) you are in for a treat.  All prepared the way you'd like it, and usually with perfect timing (unless of course its during the "rush", but that is to be expected anywhere).  No meal is complete of course without a double espresso and some fresh made desserts, at least for me! I have taken many dates here, as well as friends, and everyone agrees this is the spot to go.  Whether a family get together, romantic date, friends catching up, or really any occasion lucas is always on my list.  Everytime I come back from college to visit the folks, it usually includes a trip here.
