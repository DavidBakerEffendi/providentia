Absolutely fantastic!  Best empanadas ever!  I also had the octopus, char grilled and lemon heaven!  My friend had dirty martini, expertly made.  I had the house tequila, lime, grapefruit with a smoked paprika rim.  It was a little sour at first, but as the ice melted it became better and better.  From music to food to great vibe!  Def 5 STARS!
