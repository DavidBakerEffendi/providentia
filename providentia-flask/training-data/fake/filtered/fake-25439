Classic spot in Dumbo that I never forget everytime I go. The pizza is fantastic, but I'm not sure if it's worth the whole tourist line and tourist atmosphere. I live between Brooklyn and DC and I have to say I've had better pizza elsewhere, as much as this place is great, it's not the BEST like everybody says it is. I'll go back but as soon as I see the line I keep driving forward.
