Cool place.  Terrible service. I brought my son here for the games and dinner.  The games were fun, but the staff completely ignored us.  I asked the bartender if I should order food from her.  She told me to find a seat and wait for a server.  I found a seat just a few feet away from the bar.  No server ever came.  The place wasn't even busy.  The bartender I spoke to was a few feet away doing nothing, yet never noticed that no one was serving us. After 20 minutes we left to find food elsewhere.   Hopefully they can figure out how to manage this place.  It has the potential to be great but ignoring customers is a very bad sign.  :(
