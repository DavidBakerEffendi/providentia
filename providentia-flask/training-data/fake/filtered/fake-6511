First off, let me say what a lovely little place this was. I been for Brunch and dinner and the food was amazing. Reminded  me of my last trip to Italy.  And if this review was only on the actual meal itself, I would have given it 5 stars, hands down! Unfortunately I have to report beyond the meal. Last Saturday, the wait staff was great; although I do not know how the kept smiles on their faces. A taller man, with light-ish hair  color, was yelling at them the whole night. He was disrepectful to the staff; insulting and berating them in front of customers. He had an attitude with anyone who came in contact with. It was so obvious, it ruined my meal... and I was so uncomfortable, at one point I almost said something to him, but I was trying to enjoy a meal with close friends from out of town (I was embarrassed in front of my friends as well). After that, we left our kind waiter a generous tip (we felt that we could at least  make up for some of the abuse he had sustained!), and vowed never to return! It is unfortunate because the food was great, and the other time that I went to eat at Aurora, that man wasn't there and the atmosphere was a lot lighter and much more pleasant for all. And it was not just me that noticed it, an older couple sitting next to us was also commenting on his blatant disrespect to his staff. They said that he was the manager. So, overall, great food, great service, poor management!
