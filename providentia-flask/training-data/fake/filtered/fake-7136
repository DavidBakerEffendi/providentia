My girlfriend and I went here for Valentine's Day and it was fantastic - we quite literally ate everything they gave us and then some. The spring rolls to start were great, and we split the duck and pad see ew for dinner. Honestly they were the best examples of either one I have ever had. Then we ordered one of the homemade desserts mostly just to try, but wound up eating the whole thing! Needless to say, after eating all that we were stuffed but very happy. Will certainly go back again
