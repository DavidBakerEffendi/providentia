We went to dinner to celebrate a birthday, the place was empty when we arrived and yet we were sat at the worst position in the restaurant with a rickety table, no less.  When we asked to change tables, it was a flat out no and they only offered to take our coats.  The server didn't understand English, she never came over to check on the food, the bill was presented before we could order dessert and the manager disappeared while we were leaving - don't waste your hard earned money!
