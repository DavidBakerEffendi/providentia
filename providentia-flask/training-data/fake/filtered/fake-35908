One star, for the pizza. Pizza was great, fresh from the oven, artisan pizza. We waited for 45 minutes to be seated on a long table in the second room in the back. We shared the table and a rickety bench with three (one left halfway through) other groups of patrons. One small fan in the corner, no AC, really loud punk rock, warm water without ice, and a 25 minute wait for two small pizzas and a $32 dollar bill. Absolutely terrible management, lots of people waiting while tables are empty, chaotic and inefficient seating system, and waiters who don't know the menu and can't seem to get the order in. Â  We left hungry, annoyed, and fed up.
