Very Very nice, especially in the heart of BedStuy where quality choices are limited.   We did wait approx 45 mins, but it was worth the wait.  The services was good, food was very tasty, prices were appropriate, atmosphere (funky/sophisticated/down home) all at the same time.   Music was enjoyable but a little loud for the setting (am I getting old??.   Went to the corner coffee shop, and had the blueberry lemonade, and bought a few slices of old fashioned pound cake.   Would definitely come back.
