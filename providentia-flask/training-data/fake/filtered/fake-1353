The Pines combines a sweet and relaxed atmosphere (ask for the story behind the decor, very cool) with just insanely delicious food and really great service. The menu is interesting and features flavor combinations that are innovative and seemingly brand new, but obviously carefully tested. The food is seriously scrumptious, as are the cocktails. And The Pines lacks the pretense of some innovative Brooklyn restaurants-they make their guests feel very welcome and providing them with an enjoyable culinary experience is clearly top priority. Go back a lot because the menu changes all the time, and try an Uncle Buck!
