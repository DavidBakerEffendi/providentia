I have eaten from many Indian places but this is by far one of the worst Indian food establishment. Â I agree with Vik R's review, food was aweful and probably was reheated as it did not taste anything like Indian food. I had to throw away my food after couple of bites. I would stay away from this place, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY AND TIME.
