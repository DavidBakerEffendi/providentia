On Tuesday, March 2nd -- they were out of the Diavlo (spicy chicken with salami, roasted tomato, provolone and broccoli rabe) at lunchtime.  I opted for the Arista, since I desperately wanted broccoli rabe.  This sandwich has whole roasted suckling pig, provolone, long hots, and (I requested extra) broccoli rabe on it.  However, the rabe was far too over-salted, especially with the saltiness of pork and provolone.   I was sadly disappointed because everyone from chowhound to Yelp! raves about their sandwiches.  In this economy I feel like it is a luxury to buy lunch in the city, and I was really excited to have a tasty treat, based on such consistent accolades.   Let's just say the office water cooler was given its due yesterday. On the flipside, my boyfriend ate the vegetarian Panelle and loved it.  He said he couldn't believe it could possibly be healthy because it tasted so good.  In case you don't know, the Panelle is made up of a chickpea pancake, w/ roasted tomatoes and fennel, then hit with their "godzuki" sauce (sour cream, lemon juice, garlic, rosemary and hot sauce.)
