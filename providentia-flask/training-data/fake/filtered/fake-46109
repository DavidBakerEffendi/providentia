I went to this place recently with my family after hearing about it from some of my friends. Being a big seafood guy that I am, I really enjoyed their shrimps and crab legs. The prices are very reasonable. My wife enjoyed the coconut chicken and sushi and my kids mostly ate sesame chicken and rice. We had a great time and Â will be back soon. This place is definitely worth checking out!
