The buffet food taste very good. Still no free water or tea and we are expected to pay for the bottled water. There is so much wasted plastic after each meal; just look around. The owner has no environmental conciusneness. Another small issue: The receipt is not itemized. When you buy buffet (per pound), soup and other items, the total due amount Â is a mystery. They don't tell you how much the buffer food weights/costs. Like I said the food tastes good. They can do much better with other issues. My biggest issue: STOP BEING CHEAP AND OFFER FREE TAP WATER SO THAT WE DONT HAVE TO CONSUME YET ANOTHER PLASTIC BOTTLE.
