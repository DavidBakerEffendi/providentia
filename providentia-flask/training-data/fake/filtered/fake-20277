I would give the quality of food 1.5/5. Most of the items in the menu are not made as they should be. I could eat rocks instead of their chicken pakora. Same item taste different every time you eat. No consistency. Over priced for a low quality of food. The biriyani rice is not long-grained but par-boiled rice. Don't get fooled by the name "Indian restaurant".
