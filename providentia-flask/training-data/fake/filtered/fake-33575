Went there for date night on 1/11/14 using a grouping.  Had the chicken and shrimp pad Thai with peanut sauce, this was good although not the best.  However, every other dish we had was beyond good, dare I say great!  My husband ordered the Emperors Chicken, spring rolls, a pomtini and another drink, all of which were excellent choices.  Nothing was greasy.  The decor and restaurant overall is very nice, neat and clean and we were created by and waited on by two wonderful waitresses.  We plan to return soon with friends without a Groupon, that's how great our experience was!!
