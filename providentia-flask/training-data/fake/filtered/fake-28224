Mac Attack is awesome. So glad we stopped in while visiting family in NJ. The lobster Mac was great, as was the southwest chicken and carbonara. We also tried the manchego and apple grilled cheese and the Nutella sandwich. Lots of YUM!! Super nice people. Great addition to the foodie scene in Montclair.
