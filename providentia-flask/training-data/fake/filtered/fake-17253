I've always been pleased with the sandwiches at Stacks. The Maple Cilantro Turkey is my favorite... or maybe the Buffalo Chicken... or the Cuban Missile. The sweetness of the turkey on the Maple Cilantro is just so perfect! All the components just go together so well, and the bread is great too. Soft, yet sturdy enough to hold up while eating. Ingredients always seem fresh, and their house made sweet pickles are DELICIOUS. I would buy a jar of those any day.
