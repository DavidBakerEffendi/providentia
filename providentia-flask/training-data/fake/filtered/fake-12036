Under new management, just opened the doors 3/14/14. Brunch today was amazing. "Crafted American Soul" describes it well: Mac & Cheese, with 7 cheeses; Shrimp with Grits; Fried Chicken & Biscuits; Blueberry Buttermilk Pancakes. . . Service was excellent. Very warm and inviting atmosphere. Great meal/experience, then when you factor in that it's only been open for a little over a week, I expect really great things.
