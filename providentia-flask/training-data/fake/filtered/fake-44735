If you don't like this place then something is wrong with you! I kid, but seriously. I have been a loyal customer of this restaurant for YEARS now. It's more than just the food, it's the attention to detail that is beyond exceptional from the staff. The bartenders are not your average "I'm just looking for a good tip" bartenders; they are actual mixologists whose cocktails are more of an art than just a drink. They are patient, kind and will literally create a new, customized drink to suit your taste buds. The wine selection is also great and the food is AMAZING. I have had pretty much EVERYTHING on the menu for brunch and dinner and I have no complaints. My favorite dish is the Arroz Con Pollo for dinner and the Fish Tacos or the Arepas for the appetizer. Also, this place can accommodate large crowds with a private room downstairs. I've hosted birthday dinners, bachelorette Â dinners and corporate dinners. My guest always leave super satisfied. You can bring a client for a dinner meeting or you can go out for some drinks with friends or enjoy a romantic date - great for either. When you walk into Yerba Buena, it feels like you're in a home away from home. They understand QUALITY customer service which is evident and consistent in all of their YB & Co. restaurants. Hope you enjoy!
