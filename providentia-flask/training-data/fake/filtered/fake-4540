DO NOT expect to receive anything these other reviews say. This place has horrible service and very disappointing food. After waiting 45 minutes for a table, our (what looked like a 15 year old hostess emulating "Jersey Shore") sat us at a table about 3 feet away from a door that opened approximately 30 times before our meal was finished. And if we hadn't been blown away enough by the freezing wind, our lifeless server who was probobly hung over and un-showered took our plates before we were even remotely finished. Awful, and disappointing.
