This place serves up a mean steak and fantastic lobster salad. I think that there's pretty good service, but it really depends on who you get. The place is typically known for brunch, but it's not the ideal spot to take a date to. It's a little bit loud on the weekends, the ambiance isn't exactly romantic. I could imagine people primarily coming here for casual meetings with friends or business acquantices. Overall, pretty good place to find quality French cooking.
