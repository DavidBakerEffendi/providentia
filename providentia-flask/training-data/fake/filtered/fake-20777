My partner and I had a 9pm reservation last night, Saturday. Restaurant was almost full but emptied out around 9:45. Agreeed with other reviewers that if your are looking for quiet and intimate location probably best visit earlier in the evening or midweek ... Staff were very attentive and welcoming.  Male waiter knew the menu and offered advice when asked. Actually I would probably rate him one of best waiters in a long time. He visited regularly but didnt do overkill.  The wine we brought was opened immediately after we sat down and our water was refilled as necessary. Food was excellent, a little on the rich side for my palate and I considered the portions to be sufficient ... In fact given the richness of the food the portions were in balance. We shared the goat cheese tartlet and I enjoyed lamb for entree and my partner hungrily ate up his rare steak. The veg were delicious and we loved the presentation. Imy partner cleared the delicious looking plate of profiteroles (i was way too full) and had a lovely expresso. I considered it to be the best French food I have had in the city and will return very soon for a midweek experience. Thanks for making our date a wonderful experience.
