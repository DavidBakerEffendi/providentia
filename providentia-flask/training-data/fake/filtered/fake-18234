Had dinner there last Saturday for the first time. I was truly expecting some fabulous food. In the past we were regular patrons of Passione. So naturally i had high expectations. So much for that!!! The menu is VERY limiting!!! i kept turning it over to see what else was available....there was only the one page. Â Fish....4 selections with no shellfish to be found. Chicken...only in a pot pie!!! I get that they are going for different and eclectic but for customers who want to eat a piece of chicken and not consume 2000 calories doing this... enough said. I had a major problem deciding what to order so i ended up with the arugala salad, mussel appetizer and 4 of us split the carmelized onion pizza (which should be classified as a flat bread). Pizza good...salad good....mussels...eh!! Missing something. Anyway....place is gorgeous. Would only go back for drinks before heading somewhere else for dinner. I hope they get their menu together because it could truly be a great place to dine!!
