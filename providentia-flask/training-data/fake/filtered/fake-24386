Went here just to check the place out as Ive seen big lines outside this place on numerous occasions. Let me say the food was outstanding, one could smell and taste the freshness. We love Indian food and have tried a lot of other establishments in that area and I can confidently say no one even comes close to Khasiyat. I wish the place was more bigger though, other then that the best Dosa's and Paratha's we've ever had.
