We stopped at Boonton Bagels on our way home to Boston from NJ. The bagels and sandwiches were absolutely delicious. The staff was unbelievably friendly. I cannot say enough about how nice the staff and owner were to my family. I wish I lived closer to Boonton NJ just so I could frequent this deli. Thank you!!
