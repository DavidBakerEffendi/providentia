Wife and I went there twice and had an amazing time. We had a glass of wine each and split a couple items off the menu. The first team our server was ver helpfull in helping us choose wines we love. The next server the following time was clueles. We loved our food ( which is basicly topas) with great service. Small place but amazing time. We look forward to the next time we can go back.
