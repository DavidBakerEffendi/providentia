Look.  It's simple.  There are three pizza places in the known universe.  They are Sally's, Modern, and Pepe's.  They are all in New Haven, CT.  If you've never eaten at one of these places, you've NEVER eaten pizza.  You've probably eaten what's passes for pizza by those who do not know, but truly it is not pizza.   There is a reason people wait for hours to get into these three restaurant.  They are beyond anything you will EVER taste.  I have toured the world looking for the best pizza, so forget NYC (though NYC is a distant second place), forget Chicago (possibly the worst pizza in the U.S.), New Haven is the pizza capital of the world, and these are it's three palaces.   When you go to these places these are the pies to order: Sally's: a plain, Flo's summer special, sliced potato, or just good old fashioned cheese Modern: eggplant, or cheese Pepe's: white clam and garlic Any of these pies will blow your mind.  Your eyes will roll back in your head and you will think you've seen god.  And that is NOT an exaggeration.
