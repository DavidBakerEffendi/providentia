This is by far one of the most delicious Jamaican restaurants I have ever been to. The food is delicious, the employees are extremely friendly, and it's just an overall great atmosphere. Seems as though many people view it as a take away although the foods even more delicious when you sit in. I suggest the jerk chicken with a glass of sorrel; quite the combination.
