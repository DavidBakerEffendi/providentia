Finally! Have been waiting for this place to open!! I wandered in tonight after I got off work, saddled up to the bar. Howdy partner (just kidding) - I was greeted by the bartender, a happening chick with an outstanding mowhawk (a la Anabella Gwin) .. She welcomed me and I had only been sat for a few seconds before the manager came over and welcomed me as well. Very cool. The decor was open, inviting and peppered with Banksy prints. I started with one of their signature syrup drinks with fresh cucumber and vodka. I watched the bartender shake it to a frothy perfection while she also explained the food. Her partner also came over to say hello and recommend a starter as well as an entree. The music was awesome, not too loud, but enough to feel open and lively. I had the Cheese curds and the Salmon. Both were particularly yummy + my compliments to the chef (I work in a Restaurant so I am pretty picky) .. I ended with another drink that had a jalpeno agave syrup .. Stupendous. I will most definitely be back and actually opened a YELP account (something I said I'd NEVER do) just to spread the word. Hope Garage is the Sh*t! Good job guys!
