After moving to Burlington from the NYC area, we knew we would have a tough time finding decent Chinese Takeout. When we found Zen Gardens, we knew this was going to our new takeout place from then on out. Every single item we got was amazing. Finally Sesame Chicken the way it should be. Everything from the boneless spare ribs to the dumplings to the noodle dishes has been awesome. They deliver to our apartment as well, so I am such a huge fan. It is pricier than other options in the area...but absolutely worth every penny. They also give the good kind of takeout containers, the ones you can reuse as "tupperware" later on. Such a good find.
