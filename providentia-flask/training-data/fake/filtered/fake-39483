I recently visited this restaurant with my coworkers. We were all very excited to dine here. However, we were turned off immediately. The manager was waiting outside telling us we were late for our reservation. Then our server asked us to call the rest of our party and ask them what they were ordering because the chefs had to leave and the kitchen was about to close. The service was terrible. And the food wasn't all that either. For the price, you can eat somewhere else and get much better service. If I could give them 0 stars believe me I would.
