So I came here the other day for a lunch with some friends, and had just an OK experience with it. The sandwich I got wasn't the best, but wasn't the worst either, just average I guess for the price. The service wasn't bad, and the place was decently clean, just nothing extraordinary in my experience. I may have to try this place again as it could have been just what I ordered, but we will see.
