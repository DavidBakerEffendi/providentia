Great atmosphere, really liked the decor.  Ultra comfy booths, cool lighting and great music.  Food was outstanding.  Our table of 4 ordered lots of small plates and shared - enjoyed by all.  Service not so good.  Hostess half-hearted at best - both coming and going.  Not even a look up and nod to our party or the two others leaving at the same time as we did.   Waitress not really bad, just not there or engaging at all.  Had to find her for extra drinks and just no warmth at all.  Even with the service really lacking, I would go again just for the food.  Hopefully a different staff on a given night would make this spot great.
