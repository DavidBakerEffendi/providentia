Never the judge or a juror, just a foodie .We were not thorough with Geno's critique, because it wasn't worth the memory... to rehash the nightmarish experience naah , but Pat's was better. This will help you greatly, if you trust our experience , We went to 6 spots, Pat's was one of them, of course, considering the hype. Meat, cheese and toppings, bread, and overall sandwich considered.  BREAD: was fresh, and a good texture, on a scale of 1-5 , the bread was a 4........MEAT: the meat had no seasoning, as if it were frozen, then on the grill, the natural steaming process was a problem , on the =15 scale it was a 2.5.....CHEESE AND TOPPINGS: though not a fan of cheese whiz , it did compensate for the lack of flavor of the meat, and the WIT(onions)  was WHAAAT???? enough said, scale 1-5 it was a 2.75. OVERALL SANDWICH: though better than Geno's, that's not saying much, on the 1-5 scale it was a 3, Pat's and Geno's isn't the real Philly battle that's needs the hype, they are close to throwing in the towel, because they know people will come anyway, and that's sad .Give other places not so publicized a chance, and you will be surprised. I'm not wacking Pat's , but, a horse head is in the bed.
