So I finally got a chance to go to this restaurant and I must say I was totally impressed the atmosphere was so refreshing, the service was incredible, and the food was to die for. My girlfriend and I had shared Spanikopita as an appetizer along with fried zucchini and she had Moussaka as her main dish and I had Greek pizza with olives and feta both were delicious. I highly recommend this to others who are looking for delicious food at an affordable price.
