Long wait but well worth it.  We went during lunch time and killed time at the near by Starbucks before getting seated (hr and half).  The staff here is on top of their game.  Very well organized and prompt.  I ordered the spicy bowl of ramen with the additional spice blend which costs extra.  I think this was the best bowl of ramen I've ever eaten.  It's pricey for ramen but everyone knows that going in.  It's a must try at least once.
