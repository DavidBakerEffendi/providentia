Hands down, one of the better sushi places I have eaten in. Their "chef recommended" rolls are excellent and the prices are decent. They have a few tables and also deliver. However, I always call ahead and pick up. They are very quick with my orders, friendly and very good sushi for the price you pay. It's the only place I get our Sushi here in Fairfield.
