Very disappointing. Out of 4 items for lunch 3 were disappointing and one was only OK. The dining area is quite frugally oriented for maximum customer containment. Crepe, soggy, minimally crisp. Squid, fishy aftertaste. Pork in the appetizer wraps, tasted old, leftover. Grilled pork rice vermicelli bowl was OK but lacked enough cucumber and fresh basil.
