You want to talk about rude?  The owner, Gaia, has to be the most rude and arogant hostess there is.  My wife and I ordered food, waited about 45 minutes before inquiring about the food to give this woman the benefit of the doubt.  We figured she's cooking by herself.  Come to find out that the girl that took the order was giving our food to another group of people there who in turn think that they are being sent extra food because one of them was trying to show that he speaks italian, and he didn't.  I guess he thought that Gaia found him to be an authentic italian.  When we inquire about our food, Gaia comes out of her kitchen and tells us if we don't like it here, we can leave.  Gaia, you're a horrible person and you're not hearing it from me for the first time.  Now she's probably going to get in touch with Yelp and insist that they take this review off.  What an arrogant person.  Believe me, there are so many other restaurants in the city that serve authentic, homemade italian food.  But, if you want to get abused, like a second class citizen, by an arrogant owner, come here.
