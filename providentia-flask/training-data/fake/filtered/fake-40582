What a joke. Went late on a Tuesday night. Place mostly empty. Got seated right away. Waited 20 minutes for some bothered clown to come to our table. Staff was doing shots at bar while I couldn't get waited on at our table. When we finally got service, the " quality" service forgot our appetizer. Really! Stay away from this place by all means. Called following day and some attitude chippy answered asking why I wanted to talk to manager, was told manager wasn't there, which surprised me since it was noon, took my name and number, never a call back. If you can, go to Grimaldis and ENJOY the experience.
