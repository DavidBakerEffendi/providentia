Wow! Rizzuto's at Blue Back Square is a breath of fresh air. This new place rocks! Great space - lots of eye candy including multiple display kitchen areas,  counter seating, high-top seating and banquettes, huge bar. I'm diggin' the Italian wine list and being able to drink these special wines out of big beautiful glasses. We had fun with the staff - Rizzuto's seems to have gotten the cream of the crop with these young and personable waiters/bartenders. Nice change from the lss than stellar service/interaction we get at other places in town. Lots of antipast dishes made their way to our table of 6 hungry friends. Right away we noticed the quaility - and appreciated the simplicity of the food. I grew up in an Italian household and this is how we ate.  Fresh bread, imported salami/prosciutto, fabulous cheeses, housemade componata and chick pea puree, and my favorite roasted peppers! Pizza is special here, light, crispy, and with choice toppings. The sharing continued with housemade pasta dishes and the chicken Cacciatore and roasted salmon. The monkfish wrapped in prosciutto was so good we ordered another one - add broccoli rabe to that and we were plotting our next return. When we first walked in we were wlecomed with an Italian wine tasting. We lingered and chatted with the manager and  found out a lot about what Rizzuto's has planned - including these wine tastings that will be a steady occurence. Rizzuto's should do well here - it's defintely a place for people who enjoy food and wine with a lot of energy thrown in.
