After shutting down for a four-day span, Mompou reopened its doors around 5 p.m. today ready to serve Kentucky fans. Mompou closed for renovations that doubled the size of its kitchen. The construction was originally suppose to begin next week, after the tournament, but Mompou's contractors pushed the project up, said Mompou manager Steve Yglesias. "It just had to happen now. It was terrible timing but there's not much we can do about it," he said today. Mompou was one of four eateries on Ferry Street, in the city's Ironbound section, designated to host team's fans. Sagres will be catering to Marquette fans, while Iberia Peninsula Restaurant will host North Carolina and Iberia Tavern and Restaurant will draw on the Ohio State fan base. Despite Mompou originally being designated the home of Wildcats, The Kentucky Alumni Association's website directions KU fans to gather at The Spot Bar & Lounge at 45 Commerce Street before the game. "We are open for business and hosting Kentucky fans," Yglesias said tonight.
