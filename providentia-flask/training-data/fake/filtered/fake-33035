This was one of the worst culinary and overall service experiences in NY. My friend waited for over an hour to get a glass of lemonade, after we reminded the waiter three times. She didn't even get a glass of water and the customers next to us had to pour us some from their bottle! After half an hour's wait, with no apologies, the waiter tells us that our order was never inserted into the computer and he had to take it again. We waited for another hour for three empanadas and two arepas. In the meanwhile we made friends with the table next to us who proceeded to leave since they were hungry. They invited us to go with them to Yuca which is around the corner and we should have gone. When we finally got the food, the empanadas were undercooked and arepas tasteless. Imagine the wait if we had ordered main entrees! Neither the waiter nor manager even tried to make up for this experience in any way. This was the biggest waste of money I have ever put out in the city. We were later told that they were short-staffed. This was obvious but it could have been handled in a better manner. Don't waste your evening by going here.
