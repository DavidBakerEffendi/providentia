By far one of my favorite places to hang, all of the bartenders are friendly & its a great atmosphere, I love being welcomed to this place. the wait is crazy long, i would recommend to show up early to get a great seat, also wednesday night all you can eat crabs it is a must ! last time I was Â here i had a server named Maddy, she was super friendly & a great server ! I will be visiting this place often ! Two thumbs up Pete ! Great Job
