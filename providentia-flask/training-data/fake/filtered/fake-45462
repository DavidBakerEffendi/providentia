WOW! All I have to say is amazing! I have traveled the world and I have NEVER had the type of hospitality experience that I had at terre a terre. Â Chef Todd did a phenomenal job preparing our Sea Bass. Our waiter was Christopher, he was so informative as he described every food item to perfection. I will definitely return to Terre A Terre. Also, not to mention it is bring your own!
