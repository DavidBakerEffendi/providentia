Distinctive offerings, fine service, and excellent wine list make this busy restaurant a terrific choice for dinner; we were well fed and well taken care of.  Fresh ingredients, knowledgeable staff, and warm, inviting atmosphere welcomed us on a cold, wintry night.  Try the juicy Coq au vin or the smokey carbonara- both amazing.
