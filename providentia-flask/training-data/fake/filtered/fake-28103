This place was only 2 stars, even though we thought the food was delicious, ambiance great, and beer selection fun. The service was BAD. I came for my friend's birthday dinner with a group of 9. We were seated at a nice long table, and things started out well. However, they quickly went downhill. The waiter forgot pretty much everything everyone said. He SHOULD HAVE JUST WRITTEN OUR ORDERS DOWN. I asked for shaved parmesan on my pizza- he did not bring this. My friend asked him not to clear her full plate of salad, as she was still working on it and next thing she knew, it was gone. The birthday girl didn't get her entree til everyone else was completely done, and this was only after another friend reminded the waiter that we were still waiting on two pizzas (he had completely forgotten). Though he gave the birthday girl one free drink, I felt they should have given the entire table a round of drinks for the number of mess ups. He needs a pad and paper to remember our orders, and that would have been much better than just forgetting half of it. I would love to go back but I really encourage them to get their act together. Oh and the seating is all uneven- you could be hovering two feet above your date because your chair is so much higher- which seems unacceptable and embarrassing.
