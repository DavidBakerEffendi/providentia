Gato is celebrity chef, Bobby Flay's new NoHo restaurant, but Bobby must be MIA (missing in action) from this restaurant. The service, food and general management of Gato is abysmal! We saw our waiter twice the entire evening: when he took our order and when he gave us our check. Our appetizers and entrées came out cold. We actually had to flag down someone and send our entrées back, as there were inedible. The wait between our appetizers and entrées was so long, I actually considered cancelling the orders and going elsewhere. To add insult to injury, this woman, who seemed to be just circulating around the restaurant, came to our table and to the table next to us to offer a fake smile and an insincere apology (not quite sure what her job was other than to go from table to table apologize for all of the restaurant's problems). While I do not expect a restaurant to compensate me for their poor service and improperly prepared food (obviously, I would prefer to have a nice evening with good food and good service), the gesture would have mollified the situation. This did not happen. Everyone: our waiter, the manager and the "apology woman" seemed to be oblivious, while they just walked around and talked to each other all evening. The unfortunate but significant irony of this situation is that the table next to us had the exact same experience. We were all in agreement that this restaurant isn't worth it and doesn't live up to its hype. There are so many other, better restaurants in NYC. Don't waste your money. Don't let the concept of "celebrity chef" sway you. At Gato it is meaningless. Too bad Bobby Flay and Laurence Kretchmer could not repeat what they had created at their other (now closed) restaurant, Bolo.
