This place was a joke I went there with my mom and daughter My daughter had the black bean-soup She asked for sour cream ( the waitress said the did not have sour cream ) seriously. My mom and I had sangria , it tasted like Dry grape juice . I had the Ropa Vieja That was not bad. My mom Had the Pernil that was a joke A $81 lunch not worth it . The only thing that was good there was the music. We sat inside , it took them for ever to sit us down in a restaurant that was empty inside The outside was busier . All we wanted was a nice lunch But that's not what we got . Very disappointed , we don't recommend it . Eat at the Boardwalk .
