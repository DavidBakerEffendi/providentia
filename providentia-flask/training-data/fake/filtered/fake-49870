I was a little girl, in Visitation B.V.M., Catholic School.  I remember going to get sandwiches, for my teacher, Ms. Cooper.  She always got a ham Cappacola , lettuce, tomatoes, cheese with mayo.  That was her favorite sandwich.  On Fridays, I'd get a shrimp sandwich, or pepperham, ham, lettuce, tomatoes, mayo, oh and provolone.  Those were the days...Now I'm an adult, live in Maryland and I go to NYC on a regular.  I always make sure I purchase about 5 sandwiches, and take them to my mom's house in Crown Heights.  We get all types of sandwiches.  I wish we had a deli like that here in Maryland ( BOWIE).  I love DeFonte's, Love it....The family that own the Business also went to VISITATION...My children go there as well....I LOVE IT...CONTINUE THE GOOD FOOD...EXCELLENT...
