ive been to every pizzeria about and if i lived closer to linwood i would have ordered for delivery hundreds of times by now. fantastic pie..something about their fountain soda harkens memories of the jersey shore..ya know..the sunny days.. the staff always make it seem like your order is the most important order in the world. underrated top notch spot.
