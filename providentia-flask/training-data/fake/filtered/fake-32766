Wow!!!! The next time I want a plate of duck bones I know the first place I will go. These were the best duck bones I have ever attempted to eat, unfortunately my teeth were not strong enough to crush them so I had to give up soon after receiving the dish. However, if my mouth was a trash compactor I'm sure I would have enjoyed it so much more. What's even better is that there are several ways to order duck bones! I chose crispy duck bones while my friend ordered wet duck bones. They were even nice enough to give us about 3 pieces of duck meat with each order!!! $40 well spent!!!
