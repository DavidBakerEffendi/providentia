I live on the Upper West Side and I WANT UPPER WESTVILLE! This is one of Manhattan's best restaurants in that the food is extremely tasty, healthy, attractive, and pretty inexpensive--which applies to home delivery, too. I discovered Westville while dating a woman in Chelsea. Now that she no longer lives there, I am praying that this brilliant chain will bring its imaginative veggies-and-protein-wth-few-carbs formula higher up in Manhattan. Whenever I need to grab a meal in Chelsea, this is where i'll be. The staff never lies about the wait time for a table and they move diners along without pressing them, so the wait can be miraculously brief. Please expand northward.
