My son recently got married and we asked the Cake Over to prepare a vast array of goodies. My husband and I are gluten free, but we were determined to have a house full of relatives stay with us and enjoy all of the meals we shared. Thanks to Alison, that was possible. The sponge cake and the crumb cake were the favorites. No one could tell the difference, the only comments we received were how scrumptious everything was. Thank you Alison for creating such wonderful gluten free baked goods!
