Choice of 1/3, 1/2, 1 lb burgers. Need I say more. I'm a heavy eater and wanted to get a 1lb'er but decided not since it was my first time there. I had a third pounder burger with delicious bison meat, medium rare. I'm going to convince my other friends to try it out tomorrow, after snowboarding. I'll write a follow up review of my second experience. Alcohol and burgers? Open until 2AM Fri and Sat? Chill atmosphere? What more can you ask for? TL;DR ask for Kennedy to serve you Note: have to try non-virginal shakes
