Had dinner their on Monday  evening with friends The restaurant was not crowded, the A/C was off and the windows opened. The waitress service was kinda slow and well it needed to be addressed. This is a repeat visit and had similar service concerns. . Admit tingly the food was just ok, I had Scallops over risotto in a lemon sauce. The scallops (5) were good but the risotto was just bland and tasteless. We also ordered shrimp  scampi which was very tastee and complimented by CAPERS and nice lemon sauce, very good. A friend had a seafood medley which was so so. The portions were good size ,but the food did not  hit any kind of home run. Unfortunately, I wouldd give it a so  so rating..
