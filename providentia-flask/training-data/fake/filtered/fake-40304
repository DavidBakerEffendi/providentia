Since Cheryl's opened i have had little reason to venture into my own kitchen for a home-cooked meal. Her food is excellently cooked yes there is a wait but the fact that everything is cook when you order it and not sitting around congealing is well worth the wait. The wait staff is friendly and will even offer you a beverage ( free of charge )  while you wait for your take out how very civilized. I have eaten here for supper and brunch several times, the summer months are less crowded as the admittedly small restaurant doubles it size with a fantastic patio. Their brunch has been discovered and so there is a wait for tables if you go at peak hours. The service staff could use some brushing up but the good food and the friendly service  go some way to make up for what seems to me to be nerves when the restaurant gets crowded. Cheryl herself often comes out to meet her guests welcoming them to what is a very friendly family style restaurant. Great for dinner with the parents, lunch with the kids, or a date night out. A very welcome addition to Prospect Heights.
