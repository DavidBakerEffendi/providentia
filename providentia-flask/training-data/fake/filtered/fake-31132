If you're looking for a cozy, romantic atmosphere with a touch of traditional Greek comfort, this is your place. Zorba is snuggled in Fairmount in Philly, but something about the location makes it a hidden gem. Not only are you able to get away from the trendy side of Philadelphia, you can also find a nice neighborhood to enjoy quality food. I had the pita and hummus for appetizer- absolutely delicious. Â For dinner, Avgolemono (lamb shank with artichoke sauce) I have never had lamb cooked to perfection. It was so moist, the side of vegetables and rice was so filling. Totally worth the wait for it to be cooked. (Tip: If you want to try this dish, make sure to call ahead and check to see their availability for lamb). I must say, Greek coffee really hits the spot. It has a very rich, chocolatey taste to it. And the amount served is perfect for ending your meal. I assume the restaurant is family owned and operated, including the waiters. We had the same waiter the two times we went and he was VERY accommodating to where we wanted to sit, given the restaurant isn't that spacious. Here's one of the things I really appreciated: The restaurant is always busy, and there can be long waits for when you come without reservation. However, while you are dining waiters do not rush you to get out or to leave once you've signed the check. Cannot wait to go back!
