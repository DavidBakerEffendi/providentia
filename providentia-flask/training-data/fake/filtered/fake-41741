Better Bites is conveniently located in Newark, NJ... a block away from Seton Hall Law and I must say... I am addicted! Their oriental chicken/turkey salad is delish and light... their bison burger (the santorini bison) is lean, light, and absolutely addictive... and their armenian lentil soup is phenomonal. I def recommend this place!  They are green-frendly, probably the only green certified restaurant in Newark.  The staff is friendly, everything is made fresh, and the decor is neat.  Love their slogans too. Looking forward to going back!
