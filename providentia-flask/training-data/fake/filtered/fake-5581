I hve been a constistent fan of Max Brenner over the last few years. HOWEVER my last 3 visits have been less that avarage both the food and service were borderline awful... Banana Split waffle was so cold the ice cream didn't melt. The service so disappoing that I probable will not visit again!!! It's a shame because I really like the chocalate. Mag232
