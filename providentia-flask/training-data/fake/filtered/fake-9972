I've been to this Sabrina's location several times. They've always had good food and nice service. Today I went with my boyfriend and brother for breakfast. There's a new system that you have to sit in a room a door over from the restaurant and they'll walkie-talkie over when the next party can come over. We came in as a party of 3 and there were six parties of 2 that were seated before us. Kind of understandable since the restaurant is on the small side. Our waiting time went from 5 mins to about 10-15 mins. We were sitting there for 10 mins when another party of 3 walks in and was sitting there for maybe a minute. The person in the restaurant walkie-talkied over to the hostess that the party of 3 can come over. Another girl working there, who wasn't the hostess who took our name but standing at the hostess desk, told the other party of three to go over. The hostess didn't even correct her to tell her our party was there first. We were all so appalled and upset at the situation that we left without saying a word, because we are nice enough people not to make a scene. I was shocked at this horrible service from the hostess at Sabrina's.
