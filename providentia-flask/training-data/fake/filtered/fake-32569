Love Uncle Gussy's! Its my favorite truck. They best chicken and rice option there is and quite generous servings. Its priced right, and I always consistently good. I've been going for several years, but its seems as though the secret is out and the line has gotten longer and longer. Still one of the best options and I need to get my weekly fix!
