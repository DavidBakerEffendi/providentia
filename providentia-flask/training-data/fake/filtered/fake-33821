Went to Carbone's with friends that I hadn't see in years wanted to go somewhere nice to reconnect and have a good meal - reconnection was nice, meal not so much.  The service was somewhat slow, took 20 minutes before bread was on the table.   The calamari appetizer was good (highlight of meal) and the brisket ends in the blood orange BBQ sauce were OK.  We ordered the Sunday family supper; the chicken Marsala was under seasoned, the penne pasta with ricotta was passable.  The meatballs were thoroughly disappointing - bland, basically boiled in sauce.  The frozen meatballs from Big Y are superior.  The tiramisu was similarly bland.  Maybe it was just an off night for the kitchen but I won't be returning to find out.
