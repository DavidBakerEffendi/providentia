We ordered a lot of food for our family gathering and everything was overly spiced up. Haleem was nowhere close to be a Haleem. Shami kababs appeared to come out of frozen food aisle of a desi grocery store. Chicken kebabs were not properly cooked. Long story short, everyone who tried a bit of this food, had to go to rest room instantly. I got up in the middle of the night and threw up. Very bad experience.
