My boyfriend and i were looking to have a romantic dinner at this little restaurant we had heard so much about, it was nothing close to romantic. When we arrived at the restaurant with a reservation they were "running a little behind". It was already "too crowded" at the bar, according to the owner, waiter, hostess so we were asked to wait outside on the streets of Red Hook. When we finally sat down we ordered the fried oyster appetizer. It was hardly cooked and made my boyfriend queezy. I don't want to go to a restaurant where I don't feel welcome. The owner should spend a little less time hyping up his restaurant and a little more time on customer service.
