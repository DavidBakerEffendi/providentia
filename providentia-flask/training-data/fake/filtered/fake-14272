I heard mostly good things about Beso and decide to have my birthday dinner.  It was a small party of 8.  Since it was in the middle of the week, a prix fix menu was available for my party for $20. You really can't beat this for a three course meal.  Planning was easy. The ambience was excellent.  It was dark and moody with its exposed brick and vintage pictures.  My party arrived and was seated by a very attentive host unlike our server for the rest of the evening.  For midweek serve, the waiter was slow to take our orders.  The first couse was my favorite- tuna over plantain topped with corn.  Delicious! I was eager for the next course. And then we waited and waited and waited.  When the second course arrived, I was excited to try my shrimp pasta dish.  While enjoying the creaminess of the sauce, I beat into a piece of chrizo.  As a non-meat eater, I was completely disappointed because this was the only choice on the menu for me and half of my guest.  Many people pushed aside there plates. Disappointing! It was time for dessert time.  Our orders were taken.  During this time my cousin, requested that the birthday cake be brought out with the dessert ice cream.  The waiter rudely told her that the cake comes after the dessert.  Isn't cake dessert?!  So the ice cream came out and we immediately expected to have the cake follow.  Well, most our ice cream melted or was eaten.  Another cousin had to go directly to the kitchen to request the birthday cake and still we waited another 10 minutes for it to arrive. I wasn't impressed by Beso.  My dinner guests were definitely the saving grace of my experience there.  I wouldn't recommend it for a dinner party and non-meat eaters.  Excellent deal but the inexpense is overshadowed by the slow service.
