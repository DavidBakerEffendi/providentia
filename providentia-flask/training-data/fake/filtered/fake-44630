This restaurant warranted a review from someone who has never reviewed a restaurant before. Everything in this restaurant is great. The design, music, customer service, menu diversification, food quality and taste. I recommend: blue crab, steak tartar, duck, cod, pappardelle. For wine get the fiano avellino.
