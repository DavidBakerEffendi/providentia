Talk about being embarrassed.  My husband and I took a very important client out to dinner on 11/5/11 and the client ordered the monk fish.  What came out was a serving the size of a scallop. How I regret not having my camera or phone with me to share this with you.  I asked the waiter what it was, thinking there was some confusion with the order, but there was no confusion at all.  This was intentional on the part of the chef.  The client was 6 feet 2 inches.  Marc: Do you think this filled his big toe?  I don't know what you can possibly be thinking with respect to portion sizes. We took our client for a pizza after spending a ton of money.  Shame on you.
