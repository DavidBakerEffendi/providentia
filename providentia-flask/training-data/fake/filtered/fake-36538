After not having ordered from Jim Dandy's in 3 years or so, I had a craving for their buffalo wings today.  I ordered 18 buffalo wings and two rare cheese burgers.  Instead, I was delivered 18 fried wings with NO/MINIMAL BUFFALO SAUCE and two over-done hamburgers (no cheese).  When I called to have the order corrected I was told they were "too busy tonight" but would offer me a $5 credit for next time.  A $28 wrong order and they offer me a $5 credit?  I declined.  They replaced my wings, which STILL HAD ALMOST NO SAUCE.  When I called I was told that their wings have been like that for years.  This is not true.  I guess they are skimping on the sauce to save money.  I will NEVER ORDER FROM HERE AGAIN.  Oh, and I used to work here...the pipes in the basement are filled with asbestos and they "corrected" it by wrapping masking tape around the pipes ten years ago.
