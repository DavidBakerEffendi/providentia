Went for dinner last week and loved it.  The place itself is great, small but cozy.  The exposed brick and music really create a great vibe. The food was excellent.  Went with a few friends so we tried a few different things.   The highlights for me were the short ribs (amazing), jerky and ribs.  I'm not usually an adventurous eater, but tried the pig ears and liked them a lot. There was also a good beer selection, and the cocktails all looked good.  Looking forward to going back.
