the wait time is soooo long! your just standing around while more people just step right in front of you not even asking if you ordered yet and when you dare to say "excuse me i didn't order yet" you get attitude and heavy eye rolls! finally when i get my food the gravy is spilling out the containers all into the plastic bag so i had to open the bgs in my kitchen sink! anyway...the food so good i don't trust the fish so i just skip over that.
