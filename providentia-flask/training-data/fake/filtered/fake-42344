I went yesterday and i'm going again today.  i'm taking two trains to get there because it's that good!  first day i got an order of the fired pork and scallion dumplings (5) and an order of the steamed veggies ones (10).  good thing i asked for some sauce because otherwise i would have to eaten them with none - which probably would have been fine. next time i go, i'll order by number too.  me and the guy at the counter had a tough time understanding each other.  good thing the menu is limited.  didn't look like there was any potential for mistakes - from what i saw, it all looked good.  sesame pancakes - must order one of those next time too.  i don't know why they call it a pancake though.  looks more like a sandwich to me!  a yummy one!  ...and 100 dumplings for $15?!  muhahah!!!
