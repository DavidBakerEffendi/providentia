The staff are outstanding - courteous and pleasant. Always keeping an eye out for when they are needed, but never intrusive. The decor is cozy, elegant and lush. Dramatic ceilings, rich fabrics, deep colors - I immediately felt comfortable and content in my surroundings. We went for the 5 course lunch tasting menu. Everything was delicious and promptly served. In particular the black cod, the salmon, and even something as simple as a Boston Bibb salad were exquisitely prepared. The bread service was a novel and tasty treat. The attention to detail about everything was top notch, nothing was overlooked. I went there to celebrate my birthday , and my dinner at Bouley left me with a delectable memory
