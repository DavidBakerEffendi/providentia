Complimentary sparkling water... started the meal off just right!   A friend and I split the green salad and a pizza and each got drinks.  It was fairly priced for gourmet pizza and the rosemary peach sangria was wonderful.   Service was great and the outdoor seating was a wonderful addition to a great meal!
