Being Filipino I'm usually skeptical on Filipino restaurants especially in Manhattan. The food in the usual restaurants you see in the city serve some sort of Asian fusion recipe which isn't bad but really doesn't give a good representation of Filipino food.  Grill 21 is definitely the closest to mom's home cooking I have had. Food is awesome, service is great and they don't have you waiting long periods of time on your order.   Dishes I ordered: Appetizer: Lumpiang Sariwa (crepe w/ vegetables covered in peanut butter sauce) Entree: Ginataang Sitaw & Kalabasa (string beans & squash sautéed in coconut milk with shrimp). Desserts: Halo Halo (special) and Cassava cake. Made for some awesome eating and definitely will be back!
