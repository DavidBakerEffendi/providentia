The service was decent, but the food was below average.  Not impressed at all.  If I ever decide to go back, it will only be to grab a drink...  and not a mixed drink.  Just a beer.  Their mixed drinks are a bit off. Fish Tacos -- The fried fish in the tacos was super duper dry, and the sauces and guac that came along with the fish tacos were bland. Fries -- They were dry and stuck in my teeth a bit... Weird. Mixed Green Salad --  The dressing tasted like pure vinegar.
