This place does a really nice job.  I went with the pero caliente, which has some kick to it and was very tasty.  The buns are great as are the fries.  I really liked the variety of dipping sauces (try the garlic aoli).  Seems like a good lunch and/or late night spot, something a little different and affordable.  Highly recommend checking it out.
