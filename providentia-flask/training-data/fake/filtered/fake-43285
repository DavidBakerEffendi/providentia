I have lived basically across the street from this new Federal Donuts location for years and have been anxiously awaiting their opening. I had the chicken with buttermilk ranch seasoning at the South Philly spot before and was underwhelmed by the chicken, but found the staff to be exceptionally nice and conversational. I cannot say the same for my experience at this new location. I entered the place and immediately the guy at the counter was eyeing me up, making me feel rushed even though there was literally no one else waiting to order. I had one of their fancy donuts. It was fine, but by no means worth the $2 and change. Maybe if the guy at the counter was the least bit welcoming I'd give them a pass, but you're better off going to the South Philly store if you want anything resembling friendly service.
