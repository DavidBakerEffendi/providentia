MY FAMILY AND I WALKED IN AND THE HOST IM NOT SURE OF HIS NAME BUT HE'S OF SPANISH DECENT. HE HAD A HORRIBLE ATTITUDE. WE JUST SO  HAPPENED TO SHOW UP AT THE DINER AT THE SAME TIME AS A GROUP OF PEOPLE WE KNEW.  BTW BOTH PARTIES ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN. THE GUY AUTOMATICALLY assumed we were together and asked us collectively  "how many" so we replied 5 and 5 he then said "oh I have to sit you together" then we tell him that we didn't come together, he looks at us then walks away and starts putting tables together we were saying no we don't have to sit together because we came separate and he ignores up rolls his eyes and continues fixing the tables we told him again, only then he goes and puts the tables back in the order they were in. all while looking as if we were doing him some injustice. a bleached blonde elderly server kept staring at us with the most unpleasant look I have ever seen. we felt like we were not wanted there and I don't usually pull the race card but we all felt very uncomfortable even my 12 year old sister said she felt weird and wanted to leave. on the bright side our server was great very pleasant and charming I should have asked him his name but I know he's a fairly young Italian man. he may need to be in front greeting people because he has a way about him. he makes you feel at home and welcome we tipped him about 25%. I had the calamari and it was not seasoned and tasteless and so was the sauce. I will not revisit
