I was in New Haven on business and decided to order from Downtown Pizza for delivery.  I ordered ravioli with no cheese on top, garlic bread, Italian dressing for the included salad, and two 20oz Pepsi. First the ravioli not only had cheese on top but about a third of it was burnt to a crisp.  Instead of Italian dressing I got Caesar dressing.  The garlic bread was okay but it was loaded with red pepper making it VERY spicy; they didn't mention this on the menu.  Finally instead of receiving two 20oz Pepsi bottles I got three Coke cans.  The ravioli was decent though.   Very disappointed that there were that many errors on a relatively small order, and the delivery guy refused to take it back.  Since I ordered online I pretty much had to take it instead of trying to not take the order and try and deal with the credit card company later on.  I might try them again, but only if I go and pick it up in person.  I cannot recommend getting a delivery from them after my experience.
