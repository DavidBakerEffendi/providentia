Just had dinner there last week and overall a great experience.  The staff was friendly and informative, the drinks were amazing - I suggest the Hemingway, and the food was fantastic until we got to dessert. The maple glazed chicken was moist and flavorful, the garden green salad had a nice peppery bite, the bread reminded me of being at my grandmothers house - it was outstanding!  The duck is not to be missed.  The wine list is impressive - even a huge selection of wines by the glass.  We were so happy and then came the dessert.   They must buy it elsewhere because there is no way the desserts came from the same kitchen.  We ordered the lemon tart which tasted like cabbage and onions and the chocolate semi-freddo had a stale taste and a little freezer burn. It was a disappointing way to end the meal.  I would definitely go back to the Firebox but find another place for dessert!
