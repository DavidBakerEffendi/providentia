Would have given 5 stars if the burrito would not have been so greasy.  The table side guacamole was the best.  Hot salsa was best i've ever had.   Ask to sit in mariana's section as she provided quality service with a smile...the best in CT.  With the exception of the burrito everything was extremely fresh and delicious.
