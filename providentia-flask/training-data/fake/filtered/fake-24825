I had the opportunity to dine at Brauhaus Schmitz for the first time Tuesday June 25th. The whole experience was great! Myself and a friend spent over 3 hours at the restaurant, all the while our server, Guy, was excellent. In addition to the phenomenal beer selection, Guy had numerous recommendations for us as we spent the better part of our evening eating and trying several different beers, all of which were out of this world. The German cuisine was fantastic, the beer was amazing and our server, Guy was on top of everything! Two thumbs up!
