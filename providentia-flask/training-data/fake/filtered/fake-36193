Shalimar Resturant on route 1 is one of the best indo-pak restaurant I have been to in a while. The food is great and I was impressed with the service. Friendly staff and waiters. It is family oriented restaurant. They ask you regarding the service you received today and what they can do to make it better. I will recommended everyone to go there for lunch buffet or dinner at lease one.
