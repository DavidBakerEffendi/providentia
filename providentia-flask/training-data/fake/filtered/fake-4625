Salinas is my favorite Spanish restaurant in NYC. This is my second time dining here and both times I have been impressed!! From the moment we stepped in we were amazed from the beautiful flowers that had surrounded the whole place!! The service was really attentive and friendly. Finally and most importantly the food was delicious from tapas to main courses and desserts... I loved everything about Salinas and would definitely come back!!!
