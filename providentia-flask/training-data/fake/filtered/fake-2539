First, check out the cool wood wall art.  I would say that it's definitely a sign of the eclectic sandwich findings available at Cheeky Sandwiches. My sidekick and I dropped in to take lunch to go and found super friendly service and wonderful lunch options. There's sandwiches, scrambles, buttermilk biscuits, and of course the ALWAYS delicious ben-yays for my little friend.  They packaged our meal really well, even wrapping our Iced ginger tea in foil to keep it frosty Our Order: Osyter Po' Boy.  This was delicious.  All the ingredients super fresh. The oysters were nicely sized, not the teeny ones you usually see in po' boys.  And the natural flavor of the oyster came through--the mark of good quality and fresh shell fish.  Oysters were cooked perfectly and the bread was AMAZING. Pork Sandwich. Perfection. Marinated Pork chop, caramelized apples, onions, special mustard. The sandwich had that deep porky flavor you want in a chop with just the right amount of sweetness For sides we got the scramble with muenster and salmon, ben-yays and biscuits. All had very authentic flavors. Great spot. Glad Yelp came through when I was searching for lunch options in the area!
