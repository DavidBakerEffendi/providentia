Caveat Emptor, "Let the buyer beware". My daughter ate there once weeks ago and they charged her credit card incorrectly and then issued a charge for 4 times the original amount. The manager was rude and insensitive to the issue. She has had to cancel the credit card and told her bank about the fraud and Identify Theft. You have been warned.
