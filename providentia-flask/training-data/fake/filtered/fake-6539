While the atmosphere was great, the food was less than desirable.  The fish taco was almost raw and the condiments were too hot.  The drinks were watered-down.  It's a shame as I really enjoyed the lay out, bar, etc.  Unfortunately, when you go to eat, you go mainly for the food, and it was not good at all.
