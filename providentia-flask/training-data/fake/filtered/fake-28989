Delicious, affordable, great atmosphere, BYOB!  It doesn't cost a lot and is really good and simple and somewhat healthy.  Last night I had cous cous but before I had the chicken kebab platter and let me tell you the kebab is the kebomb!  My stupid boyfriend had the vegetable kebab.  But back to DAR 525 go have a party with your friends there or get some take out!
