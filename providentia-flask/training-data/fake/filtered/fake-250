I love Hand Drawn Noodles!!!  My friends and I love going to this place both because it tastes great and ESPECIALLY because it's uber cheap.  The broth tastes great.  It's hearty without being overly salty or heavy.  It's a lot more subtle than other soups, which I enjoy immensely.  I love the option of ordering shaved noodles instead of regular noodles.  It's a great different texture than regular noodles and is more filling.  It does make the dish taste a little more bland, but still, worth an order every once in a while.   In conclusion, check it out!
