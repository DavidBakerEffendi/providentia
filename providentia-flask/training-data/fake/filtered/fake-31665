I gave quick fixx a 2/5 - not because of the quality of the food, but due to the attitude of the staff. It was a Sunday around 4 in the afternoon, and my friends and I needed something quick and easy. I ordered the make your own salad, told the cashier what I wanted on it, and it came out very quickly. However, there was chicken on it - I've been a vegetarian for eight years. I definitely didn't slip and add chicken. The girl who brought it out saw my reaction and offered to remake it, which I accepted because that was very nice. Then, I guess the cook or manager came out and asked the cashier what happened.... and not even ten feet away from me, began insisting to him that "she ordered chicken" and "the word chicken came out of her mouth" and "she's lying". The salad itself was okay and my friends' food was good, the atmosphere was cool and I liked the outdoor seating, but the rudeness of that girl has convinced me to not eat here again.
