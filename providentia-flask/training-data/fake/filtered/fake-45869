Went here yesterday based on Yelp reviews.  I love spicy food, but I also like my food to have flavor and Spicy Village lacked the latter.  I ordered the soupy dumplings, a pork bun, and the spicy beef stew humei.  The pork sandwich lacked flavor and the dumplings lacked soup.  Some of the beef stew chunks were tender and flavorful, other chunks were dry.  The wide noodles in the beef stew were good, I'll give it that.  Now I didn't try the big spicy chicken platter that everyone seems to rave about, but seeing as how I tried three dishes and was not impressed, I'm inclined to think that dish has been over-hyped as well.  Not sure if I will make any special trips to try their specialty...  Not bad food, just not as good as I expected and certainly not on my list of places I will definitely go back to.
