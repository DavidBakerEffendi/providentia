From our first interactions, the staff of the Bed & Breakfast we consummate professionals. Adam, the Innkeeper, welcomed us despite arriving without a reservation. He was accommodating of our dog, even bringing treats. The room was well appointed and the mattress was very comfortable. We deliberated between dining next door or at Parker House, as we settled in. Adam offered us cocktails, we settled on white wine and wandered out onto the deck as the sun was setting. The deck won the deliberation and Adam sat us at a pleasant table. The service was immaculate, present and attentive, without being overwhelming. A concise, but broad, wine list.  A menu that offered well executed traditional dishes, we had the lamb meatballs, the ginger roasted beets, and the escargots. We followed up with half roast chicken and hake provencal. Cared for plates. Just what we were looking for.  Desserts, we chose the homemade tart, the lemon ricotta cake, and the caramel board. I especially loved the caramels. Great stay, great breakfast.
