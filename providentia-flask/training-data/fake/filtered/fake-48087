Love this place! The brunch is stellar - though you have to be sure to make a rezzie - this place is slammed for brunch! Try the chair lift coffee and the french toast. To die for. And the bacon - don't even get my started. It's ruined me, seriously, for all other bacon. Incredible. Highly recommend.
