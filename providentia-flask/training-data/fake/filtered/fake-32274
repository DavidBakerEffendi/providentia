Our favorite restaurant in Hell's kitchen.Tiny place but with very nice atmosphere. The food is delicious. Mushroom cigars (really tasty), tuna tartar are my favourite appetizers. Filet mignon (amazing especially with rosemary fries), rack of lamb is very good too for the entry. The service is very good. Every time we coming we are getting our own bottle of wine. The place is cash only.
