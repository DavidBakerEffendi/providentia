My mother and I love traveling around the city and finding great Italian Restaurants! We loved everything about our experience dining there! We got a bottle of Bardolino. Our server Charlo was FANTASTIC! He knew the menu, was very energetic, extremely sweet, adorable and so accommodating(my mom can prove to be a difficult diner sometimes)! I had the Carbonara and my mom had the octopus Â with lentils. It was absolutely delicious! WE LOVED EVERYTHING ABOUT OUR WONDERFUL DINNER AND WE WILL DEFINATELY BE GOING BACK FOR MORE!
