Contrary to what "Ryan J" has to say, I would say the bartenders here are outstanding. The first time I entered the bar, I was served by a bartender who sort of resembled Splinter from the Ninja Turtles movie who plied me with chilled Jaeger shots. During my second visit there I was served by short little guy in a flatcap who wouldn't shut up about Drogheda United. If you want to have a chat about League of Ireland football, I HIGHLY recommend this bar.
