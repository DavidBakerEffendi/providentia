Food is good but the place is too crowded. Also, thier kitchen is below the ground, and although I never would have noticed or cared, I am now spooked by this - especially since a diner exclaimed (upon exiting) that she saw a rat scurry across the sidewalk down the steps east of the restaurant entry. Eew.
