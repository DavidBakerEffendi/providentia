Finally got to experience The Manor's famous Lobster Buffet on Saturday 3/23/13.  The Manor is a beautiful venue; it still maintains the classy and chic atmosphere it established decades ago.  The rooms and grounds remain impeccable and beautiful. Sadly, the famed "Lobster Buffet" was quite disappointing, and not what our party of 4 (early 40's) was expecting from "The Manor".  In general, the food was bland and uninviting.  The lobster? Skimpy, rather mushy and tasteless.  The shrimp in one word: small. The lamb was over cooked, turkey on the dry side, and the prime rib mediocre.  Mussels were ok; in fact, everything was just "ok".  The dessert selection was probably the best offering in regards to taste. Overall, the quality of the food was not worth the $55 per person (without drinks and before tax & tip).  While the staff was friendly and polite (dishes were cleared promptly, though sometimes too promptly), overall we felt the 20% tip automatically included on the bill was not warranted, as you serve yourself and interaction with the wait staff is very minimal.  From our party of four, three had previously attended weddings and the Sunday Brunch offered by The Manor.  All agreed that the quality and presentation of the Lobster Buffet could not compare to the fare they had experienced previously at The Manor.  The Lobster Buffet may be plentiful, but it sorely lacks in the quality and innovative department.  It pales next to the quality of food they serve at their weddings.  Better off sticking to The Manor's Sunday Brunch, which is still of very good quality.
