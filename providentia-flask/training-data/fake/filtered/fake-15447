We came to Smokin' Betty's after seeing it on TV for their weird Thanksgiving burger, the  Tur-DUC-ken burger. It sounded and looked great on TV. But when we went there, on a Saturday around 6pm, it was DEAD! There was only two tables including ours. We thought "Uh-oh, something is wrong" with this kind of dreary look. We were seated upstairs near the other table of around 6 people. Our waiter had to place several coasters to even out the wobble under our table. Pity, there were several coasters under the booths. Place seems like it's falling a part. The beers and wines were OVER priced even for the bottles by 1-2$ We ordered the cheese steak spring rolls for appetizers and tur-duc-ken (12.50$). The spring rolls had an interesting texture when eating it but it was bland. There was no distinct flavor. The heart of the whole experience, the Tur-DUC-ken was the worst! It was bland, NOT cooked fresh, as shown on TV, and it had a bad odor in the middle of the meat. There are three meats, Chicken, Duck, and Turkey.  When you bite into the meat patty, there was a grey ground up meat, we think was the duck. It tasted like can mush and from there was the bad odor coming from. The meat was bland. The stuffing was also bland, almost tasted like potato- no distinct flavor. The only bests part was the chips and they were scarce. The sweet potato fries that came with the burger was ok. I ended up trashing most of the burger and had only one half of the spring roll. It was sad that they didn't live up to the expectations we had from the TV show. Be warned!
