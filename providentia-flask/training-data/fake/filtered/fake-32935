amazing food and HUGE portions!  I'll buy something for lunch, and I'll have some leftover for dinner.  Plus, the food is sooo good.  I overheard someone the other day telling their friend they no longer cook at home because of this deli!  I don't blame them, where else can you get good, quality food for $6-$7?  Try it!  They get a bit hectic at lunchtime (I've seen crowds out the door) so it's best to try to come after 2:00pm.
