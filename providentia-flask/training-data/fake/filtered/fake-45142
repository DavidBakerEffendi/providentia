This place was my families and I go to sub shop for years. It won't be anymore after the encounter  my daughter and I had with the manager. He was extremely rude to us. He kept yelling our order back at us and cutting us off ever time we we're telling him our sandwiches, as if he was annoyed with our BIG order. By the time we we're done ordering all of our sandwiches they had little to no meat on them and it was hanging off the bread. I would have to say this was the worst experience I ever experienced coming here. Needless to say my job just recently stop placing their catering orders with them for the same reason I stopped coming here. They kept getting these sloppy trays  and thats embarrassing to present in our business meetings. Especially since I recommended this place to them. After that day I will not be back with  my family nor my husband that's been wanting to try their food for years now. I guess it's back to Subway!
