Such a good place for dessert! I walked in on a Saturday night with no reservations and the two of us were seated within five minutes. We were in a hurry to see a show and the waitress was very accommodating! And quick! We both ordered the Melting Chocolate Truffle Heart Cake with the Carmel Heart. SO FREAKIN' GOOD! The cake was so rich and yummy! The cake also came with a mini chocolate milkshake topped with whipped cream, and a scoop of ice cream with crepe flakes. I loved the presentation - all three items came on a graph paper plate (including hole punches!) and to top it off, they gave you a shaker filled with chocolate to drizzle on EVERYTHING. We also decided to grab drinks while we were there. I ordered the Key Lime and my friend had the White Hot Chocolate. The Key Lime had a decent amount of alcohol and actually tasted like a Key Lime Pie. It was so flavorful! The White Hot Chocolate was like white chocolate, just liquefied. I highly recommend coming here for an indulgent dessert when you're in the city. It is worth every penny!
