My cousin and I stopped by at the shop on our way to go shopping on Madison Ave. to get two macarons for us.  Macarons are delicious without being too sweet.  And the staff are very nice and friendly.  I bought boxes of macarons from Laduree a few times and what surprised me was that the people who work there are just as nice even if you buy a small amount of macarons.  Once again, customer service is the key to good business! (of course the macarons are wonderful!)
