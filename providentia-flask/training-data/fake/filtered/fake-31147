First of all let me tell you that I had plenty of Lebanese food, good food. This place didn't do it for me. I took my husband there so he could try Lebanese Food. I wish i hadn't done that. The place was way too small to be called a restaurant, a take out place maybe. The food was not good and overly priced for no good reason. The tables were a joke when it came to size. literately, each table was no more than 18 inches wide. Â We ordered an appetizer and half way through it, the waiter came out with the main dish. There was no place to put the plates so we had to get rid of the appetizer so the food can fit on the tiny table. That says so much about service. Normally even at an average restaurant, the waiter would wait for you to finish your appetizer before they dump on you the main course. And the worst of my experience was the waiter who reeked with cigarette smell. Really? What happened to a non smoking restaurant?
