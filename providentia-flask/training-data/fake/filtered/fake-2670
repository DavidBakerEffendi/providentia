Mostly for the killer lunch special but I dig the atmosphere too.. The food is decent but nothing is outstanding, good food and the prices are great. Every day the $7 lunch special ($9 w tip and tax)  includes two apps and a main. On Mon & Tuesday the same deal goes for $10 at dinner, nice.   Food is tasty and filling. For the apps I typically go w the meat dumplings (3 in a tasty peanut sauce) and the thia sala. The curry puff is a tasty and fresh samosa. I'm not a fan of the fish cakes. For lunch I think the noodle dishes (especially w black soy sauce) are stronger than the rices dishes. Good for lunch w a friend or a casual date w a significant other. Less hectic than Spice. Great deals.
