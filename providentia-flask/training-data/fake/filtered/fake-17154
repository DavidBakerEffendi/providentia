Wanted so much to go to Â this restaurant but it was always busy. Finally went there and ordered a small steak with 2 sides. One of the sides was a salad with chopped eggs. Eggs were probably not fresh and not refrigerated. Got sick after the dinner and I knew it was the eggs. First experience visiting the restaurat and perhaps the last..
