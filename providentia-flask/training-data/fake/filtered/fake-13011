Want to impress your lady? Ask for the booth upstairs over looking the restaurant and Columbus Ave! This place is very romantic and the food is excellent! Had the wild mushroom flatbread with Goat Cheese, White Truffle Oil so delicious! For my meal I always have the Grilled Mahi-Mahi with Crabmeat & Sweet Potato Hash. The place is elegant the staff is wonderful. Enjoy!
