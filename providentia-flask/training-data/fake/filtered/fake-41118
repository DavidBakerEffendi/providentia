I think totto is over-rated. The broth is too salty, i can never finish the whole thing. Ippudo is so much better, i drink all the soup whenever i hv ramen at Ipuddo! Besides, Ippudo is even much spacier. At least u don't hv to sit beside the stove. Will only go if there is no line. Not worth to queue for so long.
