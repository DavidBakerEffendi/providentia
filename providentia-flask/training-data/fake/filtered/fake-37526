My wife and I went to dinner here last night around 6:50pm When we walk in there was another couple waiting at the empty host booth, not a good sign. After awhile a waiter came along and sat us. The waitress came over and took our drink order and went over the specials. We ordered our dinner, no salad or apps, just main entree's. The tables around us were slowly filling up. There was a couple next to us with a baby in a high chair that sat down right after us. After 45 mins we over heard the couple complaining that they were waiting Forever with no food and were leaving and not paying for their drinks. With that, my wife asked the waitress about our food and she said she would check. A short time later returned and said it was coming right out, and that she told the owner that we had been waiting long for our food. The owner Tommy or Anthony continued to seat tables around us but never addressed us. The food finally came out about an hour after we ordered. It was horrible, the veal parm was deep fried and the sauce tasted like it had been frozen and very bitter. The seasoned chicken was tough and chewy. They just dumped a pound of seasoning on top. Avoid this place, over priced for what you get ! The owners don't care about your satisfaction just your money !
