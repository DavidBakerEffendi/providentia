Another Jewel I found in the neighborhood. Food is just simply awesome and the casual & subtle atmosphere is always the plus. Little packed, but that's normal in the area. But I really do wish there are more restaurants with better flooring to accompany the customers with bit of more room. But still very nice place to go with friends and family. Will come back
