Definitely has to be one of the most overhyped spots in the city.  The guys that own the place played their cards right because you can't beat the location.  I had a regular slice which is bigger than your average slice of pizza, but the crust was charred, and for the money I shelled out, the crust should not be charred.  Just looking at the artichoke pie on the counter made me want to vomit.  Whoever said it's pizza bread with artichoke and spinach dip on top, this seems to be accurate at least from looking at it.  They would probably laugh at something like this in Italy.  Only in America.
