I just signed up for Yelp in order to give this five-star review to Pho 501 because this is the best pho I have ever had.  And it is the best pho my out-of-town friends have ever had.  It is a great little family-owned hole-in-the-wall.  I hesitate to call it a best-kept secret--how can it be a secret if it is always crowded with customers? The key for me is the broth.  It is full of umami goodness perfectly balanced by fresh flavors of onion and cilantro.  And it is a very clean-tasting broth, not oily at all.  The broth I've had at other Vietnamese restaurants have been either too oily or too beefy or too bland or too salty, but not at Pho 501.  This broth is as perfectly balanced as it comes. In addition to the broth, the bowl contains the requisite rice noodles and a respectable amount of thinly-sliced, tender beef brisket.  A plate of mung bean sprouts, Thai basil, lime wedges, and chili peppers are provided on the side.  And the standard complement of condiments--Sriracha sauce, fish sauce, hoisin sauce, ground pepper--is available on the table. I typically like to add the bean sprouts and a generous amount of Thai basil to my pho, topped off by a squeeze of lime juice.  Then, I add about a tablespoon of Sriracha sauce to make it nice and spicy.  On the side, I make a dipping sauce for the beef using a 50/50 mix of Sriracha and hoisin sauce. All this adds up to a great lunch, especially during the winter.  The heat from the meal is usually enough to keep me warm and happy without having to put on my winter coat as I leave.
