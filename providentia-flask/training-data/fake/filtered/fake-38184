Heard a great deal of positive reviews from friends about the Greek Lady as I am  a new arrival to the neighborhood.  Visited your place this past Friday and had the house gyro which came to me with meat that was rubbery (clearly not freshly cooked) as well as spoiled tomatoes. Not sure if this is typical but needless to say, I was very disappointed.
