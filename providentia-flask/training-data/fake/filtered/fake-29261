Even though they forgot to put extra pita bread ( I asked for it) in my bag, I still love this place. Hummus and babaganoush dippings are to die for. The only problem this place has is that there is no seating available unlike the east village mamoun. You need to stand and eat. When it is crowded, it is impossible to stand inside or outside of this place.
