Burger was fantastic.  The latin-american bartender for some reason never asked me if I wanted fries with my burger.  Sorry I assumed my $14 burger would come with fries! Food was prepared very well though and despite the girl at the door who was a huge you know what, and the lack of offered fries with my burger, everything was tasty.
