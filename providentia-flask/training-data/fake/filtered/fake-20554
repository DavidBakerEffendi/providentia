I picked Zahav for my birthday dinner.  We were seven people so we decided to go with the tasting menu.  Our waiter asked if there were any diet restrictions before we started.  He picked all the food for us and it just kept on coming.  The laffa and hummus was so wonderful.  We couldn't get enough.  Everything they brought out to us was so delicious. We sat for two hours and ate 'til we coundn't move. No one rushed us.  The wait staff was very attentive and we are still talking about how they cleaned the table and gave us new dishes and silverware with each course.   So many more things we want to try.  We will just have to go back again and again and again.
