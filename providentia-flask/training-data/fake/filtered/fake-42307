I ate here at this pleasant Chinese restaurant during my first visit to NYC. The pizza and cheese steaks are out of this world!  I especially like to franks red hot they put on their wings served with a cold one. The football games on big screens are a plus as well. Lastly, the take out garlic and chicken is great. The mozzarella sticks are the BOMB.  If you like Chinese food, I recommend you pass. Chinese food,wings,and beer will make you explode.
