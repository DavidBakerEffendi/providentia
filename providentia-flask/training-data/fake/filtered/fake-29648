Pies-N-Thighs catered our wedding in September. We knew we wanted delicious hearty food and that PNT would have great fried chicken. But they surpassed our expectations by miles. From our first exchange until the day after our wedding (they provided delicious and amazing looking donuts the morning after) they were so professional, warm and generous. The food at our wedding was presented beautifully and was sublime. I can't tell you how many times I heard "best food at any wedding ever!" from our guests. They also offered a perfect variety and a nice balance between yummy fried fish and chicken to tasty, healthy and colorful vegetables and salads. And people are still talking about the pies and how great they were. As for the service: Anne Marie is the events coordinator that we worked with and she truly went above and beyond. She took such interest and care in how our day played out and was an absolute delight to work with. The chefs also showed so much care and it was clear that everyone wanted our day to be great and for us to be happy. The servers that helped at our wedding were so kind, so professional and did a perfect job. Honestly, I could go on and on about what a special and wonderful experience we had with Pies-N-Thighs. I will continue to dine in their restaurant and use their catering services and wish we could do the wedding all over again exactly the same way!
