We ordered food and ate in the food court at the University Mall about a month ago.  This restaurant was a wonderful surprise for a food court venue!  The woman behind the counter was friendly and helpful.  The food was fresh and very good. It's not your typical asian fare that you often see in food courts. The seaweed salad was a bit pricey, but worth it-delicious. We would definitely recommend trying this (relatively) newcomer at the UMall!
