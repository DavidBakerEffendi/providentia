The food here taste so good late at night when your tired and drunk from a long night of partying.  However, when your not drunk and come here during the day time, you realize that the food is pretty average.  There are definitely better places around to get good roast pork or duck.  Come here only if its past 2am because its the only place youll find open at that time.
