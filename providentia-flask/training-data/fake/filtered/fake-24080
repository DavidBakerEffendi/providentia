I went into Marigold's with high expectations after reading reviews and looking over the menu.  Usually all the hype leads to disappointment.  But I was really amazed at culinary skill evident in the menu and dishes.   I've eaten or worked at some of the best restaurants in Boston, San Francisco, and Philadelphia, and the quality of this meal surpassed or was on par with 4 and 5 star restaurants.  We each had the four course option.  What struck me most was the way Chef Rob Halpern played with texture and temperature.  This definitely seemed to be where he was pushing, rather than mimicking, culinary trends.  The play on texture went well beyond the cliche foams too, solids were turned into liquids, smooth balanced with crispy, and the serious was balanced with whimsy like liquid nitrogen popcorn.  The best part is not only was the food cutting edge in terms of technique and presentation, but the flavors across multiple courses ranged from good to truly exceptional.  Staff was friendly, attentive, knowledgeable and unpretentious (which is rare).  The generous portion sizes left me full despite having a hearty appetite.   The only minor knock is that some dishes were a little heavy on butter and salt, but I also tend to eat healthy so my palate may be oversensitive; and some more vegetarian options would be a welcome addition.  But overall, combine exceptional food with unpretentious service, and I have a favorite new restaurant.  This was without exaggeration one of the best meals I've ever eaten.  My experience was night and day different compared to the reviewers that came during the UC Dining Days promotion.  I don't write a lot of reviews, but I was so impressed with this little gem I had to write something.
