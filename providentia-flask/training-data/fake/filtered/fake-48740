Went there for Thanksgiving brunch.They gave us a nice big round table which was nice, as 7 of us were able to sit around it and see and talk to everyone. The food was bad.  Just really bad.  The food portions were large which generally triggers the sense of doom for me since that usually means quantity over quality.  I was right. The turkey special was full of fat and grissle and cut really thick.  Not sure what they mixed in the mashed potatoes but it was spread all over the turkey.  Lucky for me it was dark in there an I couldn't really see. I couldn't really stomach the food but I was hungry since I didn't really touch the meal so I got the chocolate cake for dessert.  Again, very disappointed.  The cake was cold and stale, not moist, no flavor to it.  I can't believe I paid so much money and the food was so terrible. I actually got sick shortly after eating there.  Will not be returning.
