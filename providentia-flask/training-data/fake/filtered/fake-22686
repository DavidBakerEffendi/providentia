The food here is outstanding. Their squash ravioli in brodo is delicious -- the broth is the perfect consistency and it's wonderfully spiced. The pork special is, according to my boyfriend. "fucking amazing." We shared the ricotta and aged provolone crostini and it was divine. My drink, some sort of peach bellini, was also delicious. However, the place is kind of crowded. They definitely shove as many people in here as they can. The waiters are all very nice. The big problem with this place is the awful, awful host. I've been here three times but only eaten here once because of the snotty jerk who was hired, inexplicably, to greet customers at this otherwise fine restaurant. If I'm waiting, patiently and silently, shoved up against a wall (it's a small space) I don't need to listen to some dude with an inflated ego disparage my friends and the other people waiting in line. Get the fuck over yourself.
