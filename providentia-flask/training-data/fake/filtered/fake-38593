We tried Tilt this weekend and first - the fries are amazing.  The service was very friendly, but slow considering it wasn't crowded.  Kids and adults had fun with games and the beer selection is awesome. I'm mostly writing this review to try to convince the owners to change the painting on the women's bathroom - there is an image from mortal combat of an almost dead female character and the words "end her" painted above.  Really poor, poor taste for a women's bathroom.  Stop and think a minute about who your patrons are - women and girls - and how this might look to someone who doesn't play mortal combat or even so, thinks violence against women isn't something cute to paint on a bathroom door.  Please change.  Please.  I'd even accept Ms. Pac Man, as cliche as that is!!
