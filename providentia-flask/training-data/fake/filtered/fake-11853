Went there last night for dinner.... Long wait, but worth it.... My wife started with the minestrone soup and I had the bruschetta, both were excellent.... She then had the lobster risotto and I had the rigatoni alla sciciliana.... They were both good, but I could have used a couple more Â rigi's on my plate.... For dessert my wife had panacotta with berries and I had tiramisu.... Both great.... Overall a great experience.... Cash only FYI.... And speaking of, it was pricey.... I am surprised it only has 2 $$ signs....
