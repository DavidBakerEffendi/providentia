Coming from the coffee capitol of the world (Seattle) we thought the latte and coffee from the Iris Cafe's was spectacular.  Baked goods were delicious and all made on site, the atmosphere was delightful as was the service.  We loved being surrounded by people who were actually talking to each other rather than head bowed to the ever present screen gods.  The kids in the place were an addition, not a problem.  We took the subway from mid town and would do it again to try dinner.  Next time in NY, we'll be back.
