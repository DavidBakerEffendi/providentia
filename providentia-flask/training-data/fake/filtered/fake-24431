I LOVE this place. The food and atmosphere and service was amazing. Everything I tasted was absolutely delicious with such unexpected flavors. The plating was beautiful and our waitress was attentive and sweet. It can be crowded during the dinner rush so reservations are a must at that time but wow, definitely worth it. Fun to see Bobby Flay in the kitchen too!
