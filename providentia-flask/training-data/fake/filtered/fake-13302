I was first introduced to the food, vision, and passionate team behind Maharlika through a class they taught at WholeFoods, so when a Filipino friend and I ate there a few weeks later I had high expectations .  I'm happy to report those expectations were not disappointed and, in fact, exceeded!   It was obvious that great thought, passion, and heart was poured into each dish,  translating into a unique, memorable, and most importantly, a delicious dining experience.  We walked away totally stuffed but definitely smiling!         We began with their award-winning cocktail, Pacquiao's punch (so refreshing for a hot day with a kick from fresh ginger) and a small plate of fried chicken skin (a crunchy, salty treat, similar to chicharrones).  For apps, we tucked into Arroz Caldo, infused with such a flavorful of garnish that it was voted a table favorite. I was super excited to try the Lumpiang Barquillos because I grew up in the bay area with Filipino neighbors who always made big batches for any special occasion.  These were crispy enough to shatter when you bit down but tender once you hit the filling - just the way they should be served!   The table, and our stomachs, really started to fill up as we dug into Kare Kare (an osso bucco dish called with meat so tender that it just fell off the bone!), a rice noodle dish with a name I can't recall, and garlic rice so addictive that I couldn't stop myself from "one more spoonful." (I learned during the cooking class that they go through so much garlic the neighbors all know when they are prepping for the week!) We sadly left no room for dessert- but I'll be back and hopefully will do a better job of pacing myself!  This is a true gem - you'll love their generous spirit, great service, and amazing food!
