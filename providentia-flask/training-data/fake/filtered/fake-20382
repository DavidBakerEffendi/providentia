What a great place! Spur of the moment decision to go after reading other Yelp reviews. My son had the curry goat and I the corn vegetable. My son raved about the goat and my veggie dish was perfect. The naan was so warm and fresh that I ordered some to go. The staff are very nice and the vibe is laid back and comfy. Cool spot.
