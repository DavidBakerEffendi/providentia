Smh,  been here before and though this place was cute until I order food to go last night.  I order a chicken sandwich on a bun with swiss cheese and grilled onions.  I also ordered two grilled chicken salads one with onions and one without.  I received a chicken sandwich on a club roll, raw onions and american cheese (did not eat the sandwich). Onions on both salads and wasabi dressing instead of italian.  I was unhappy to say the lease.  I proceeded to call the manager.  I called the manager and while he was on the phone with me he was asking the staff did they do what iam accusing them of doing. They responded "no" and he stated did you hear them (WOW).  He also said sorry 15 times because he keep putting me on hold (Really). At the end of the conversation I stated that my call wasn't of importance so I will no longer visit his establishment, his response was "ok thank you, have a good day". SMHHHHH Just sharing my experience.......
