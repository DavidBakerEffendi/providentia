I was temporarily living in White River Junction, VT for 3 months and finally found this place my last week there. So bummed I didn't discover it sooner! A great sports bar with a huge menu, tons of beers on tap, and CHEAP. I'm used to Boston prices so it was amazing to get beers, apps, and a meal for under $30. If you're in the area and want a fun place to watch the game, I suggest checking the place out.
