Delicious doesn't even begin to describe the dining experience at Roia!  As someone with a gluten intolerance, the server was informed and if she wasn't sure about something, she went to the chef and asked!  Almost everything I wanted was gluten free!  From the appertif to dessert, the server was knowledgable and helpful!  The char was deliciously prepared with just the right amount of flavor and texture!  Devine is the way to describe the whole experience!  It's a great date night location!  Also, my husband is very tall, so we sat in a booth, which was very comfortable!  I can't wait to go back!
