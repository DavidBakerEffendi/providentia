Heard about this place from my girlfriend.  Husband and I decided to try a few things from their menu.  We ordered ribs, 1/2 chicken, baked beans, mac&cheese, collard greens and mashed potatoes.  I was so disappointed.  Yuck! The ribs were rubbery.  The meat did NOT fall off of the bone.  In fact, they needed to be cooked a bit longer.  The chicken was very dry and there was no sauce (because they forgot to place it in our bag). The mac & cheese had a soapy taste to it.  When I pulled the lid off of the collard greens, you could just smell the vinegar.  I love spicy food but they were too spicy and way too much vinegar in them.  The baked beans were a little too firm for my liking but had an interesting tex mex flavor but way too spicy.   I was mad at myself for spending so much money on a dinner that I did not enjoy.  I thought my kids would at least eat the mashed potatoes, mac & cheese and the chicken but they didn't!  I had to fix then something else to eat. I will definitely not eat there again. Oh, and the service was very unorganized.  We waited 50 minutes for our order once we realized it was sitting there on the counter but no one bothered to look and see who's order was up.  My husband had to tell the girl behind the counter that it was our order.
