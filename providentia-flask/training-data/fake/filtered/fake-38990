I discovered this place by accident and I am so glad I did! The atmosphere is nice, quiet and intimate. The staff are accommodating and the food is really good. The prices are really reasonable - for example, the mussels appetizer is $10 and you get a huge bowl filled with them. Also, the house wine is great; my S/O and I really enjoyed it. I really like going here for dinner because it is not too expensive, the food is good and the vibe is nice. The minus one star is because I find I often have to wait a while for the check, which can be annoying at the end of the night when you are ready to leave, otherwise this place is awesome!
