Wonderful flavors in every dish our party of four ordered.   Some of the flavors were delightfully unexpected. The buffalo mozzarella asparagus appetizer was a real find, as were the pan-roasted cod and the chicken-and-risotto meatballs. Be sure to try the demitasse of potato soup.   The presentation was flawless; the service was welcoming and professional without being intrusive.   We will definitely be back.
