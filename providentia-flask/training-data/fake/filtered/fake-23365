Have eaten here several times over the years....stopped in tonight for a quick dinner. Had to keep waving flies away....then I looked at the empty table next to me. There must have been about 30 flies crawling all over. Got out of there as fast I could.....totally disgusting. Where's the department of health on this one? The A rating in the window is a total sham.
