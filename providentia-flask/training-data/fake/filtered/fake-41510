I would have given this restaurant a higher rating if it weren't for the horrible service I received. I went to the restaurant with family and friends having gone there before thinking the food was good for the price paid. When we went they seated us and gave us menus. Then we did not get service for about 15 minutes. As other people walked in, they were served their drinks and their orders were taken. We understood that service could be slow, but if we were there before other people we expected to at least get some sort of attention. We asked if we could get our drinks and they ignored us. After about 20 minutes we were getting frustrated so we asked the waiter again if we could at least have water or coffee while we waited. He didn't respond. Then we asked the owner and rather than answering us she looked at the waiter and told him "There's too many of them". The restaurant was not even full. We were upset to have been seated and given menus when they had thought they would not be able to serve us. This does not make sense though since they were able to serve incoming costumers. We were being very patient, and I was embarrassed at having recommended this place to people visiting me. I had had previous decent experiences. I thought it was extremely rude and unprofessional of the owner to make that comment and Â ignore us for so long. A person should be happy to get business. She could have politely told us that there would be a wait or that there was a backup. We would have understood. We felt completely disrespected. I never write reviews, but this was too much. I highly do not recommend Patricia's Restaurant.
