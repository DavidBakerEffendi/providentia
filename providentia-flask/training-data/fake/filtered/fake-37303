I went to the Sidecar last Saturday. We arrived around 7:30, it was not too busy so we easily found a seat upstairs. I liked the atmosphere. We came to order a bunch of appetizers and small plates so we could try many things on the menu. We ordered the cheese board, mac n cheese fritters, the clam chowder gnocchi, and the corn bread. I loved the cheese board. The selection was great. There were three cheeses, figs, apple slices and two types of bread: one soft and a crostini. The man n cheese fritters were good, not amazing. They came with a good tomato sauce and Parmesan. The gnocchi was delicious! The portion size was small though considering it was $12.00. The bacon made it perfect : ) I liked the cornbread but my only complaint would be there was not enough butter on it so the bread became more crumbly than moist. Sidecar has a great beer selection that changes daily as well some wine and specialty cocktail choices. Overall, I really liked this place, both the atmosphere and the food.
