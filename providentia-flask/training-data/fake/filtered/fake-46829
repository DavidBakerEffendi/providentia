WOW!   Visiting New York and was dragged to this place by my brother on a Friday night --  who wanted to impress his recent flame -- a tall attractive Indian girl.   We ate at the new Toa the previous night and had a blast.  So, even though Yelp reviews highly recommended this place, our expectations were muted. We got there around 10pm. Place was packed.  We sat on the cozy bench outside, next to a big monkey.  Selfies with the monkey were in order.  We got seated and our drinks arrived.   Good presentation of the cocktails and the metal straw they use  just makes the drinks taste better.   We did not have that at Tao. +1 Food was outstanding.  Not too spicy and the lively atmosphere gives it a very french (read: home)  feel.   The lamb chops were one of the best I've had.   We kept ordering the okra side dish.   Our Indian friend who initially did not seem thrilled about going to an Indian restaurant, could not stop raving and rewarded my brother later *wink*.     Okay, so this was our best outing in New York. Spectacular. I'll be back!
