Middle Eastern is quickly moving up my list of favorite eats, and Uncle Moustache didn't disappoint. We shared a hummus plate and zaatar bread, which was solid. But my entree, Lamb Ouzi, was amazing. It's lamb & spiced rice in a filo dough, with a refreshing acidic yogurt sauce to pour on top. I want to try this place for brunch and get the tunisian eggs... might be changing my review to a 5 star. BYOB is always a plus as well.
