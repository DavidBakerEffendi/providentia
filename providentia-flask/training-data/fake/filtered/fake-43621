Five Leaves used to be one of our favorite Â spots in Brooklyn. The food is good but the ambiance and location was why we went. The truffle fries, mussels and burger are good but the staples like granola and steel oats are overpriced and not well mixed. Dry and dull. The past four times I've visited however the hostess has been such a huffy mess that it has made me swear not to return. Stressed by spoons, derailed by decaf, she whines when you ask to add a chair and never seats you even when the restaurant is empty. Is your whole party here? Come back when you're ready. This place has meat packing attitude with hipster tattoos and frankly is not worth the hussy fuss to get seated. I hope others voice how terrible the service is and how fast the owner should fire the hostess. I'm done with five leaves.
