Staying overnight in Newark and had a hankering for Protuguese food.  Read the critiques and decided to try Coimbra.  I was surprised they had my top shelf Bourbon - good way to start off the evening.  Ordered the Pork Cubes with Shrimp (Picadinho com camarao) - a large dish of meat, potatoes and a few shrimp.  Delicious and very filling.  Out the door under $30 with drink and tip.  I would definitely recommend to others and will repeat when I am back in town.
