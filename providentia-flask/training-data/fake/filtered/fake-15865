Twice when i was in the Brooklyn Junior's i've had very surly waitresses.  Both times their personalities changed for the better a few minutes before the check arrived and the tip was calculated.  However, i feel that when  you weigh the attitude of those waitresses against the amazing deli sandwiches and cheesecake, it's a small price to pay.  Also, to be fair, most of the time the staff is very pleasant.  Whether you're in Brooklyn or Manhattan, find your way to Junior's for a real treat.  The red velvet cake is just as delicious as the cheesecake, so take a chance on that some time.
