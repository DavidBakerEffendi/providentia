I went here with my boyfriend in the middle of July. We're both from around the area and we wanted to try something new so off to Yelp we went! Â And boy, did we make the right choice. We ordered the chef's sampling (which they say is four courses but we got more like 6 or 7 plates). Don't be too hasty to eat all of the (heavenly duck fat and sea salt) bread if the food looks a little small at first; by the time dessert rolled around I was so pleasantly stuffed that I didn't think I could eat another bite (but there was chocolate so...) The waiters were extremely friendly, professional, and accommodating. They were careful to listen to my likes/dislikes and allergies and they explained every bit of every course. My water glass was never empty yet they never felt overbearing. The food was some of the best in NYC. I will certainly be returning. If you have a little extra cash to spend, I recommend Vitae-you won't be disappointed!
