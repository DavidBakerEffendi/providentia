WOW. I ate at Paisanos this past weekend with 5 friends and I must say, It was the BEST meal ive had in a while! The portions are big enough to have left overs the next day. The specials that we were offered sounded delicious. I decided to go with the Short Rib special and it was awesome. I devoured the whole dish, including dipping the homemade bread in the short rib sweet balsamic sauce! Overall great experience. The atmosphere is friendly and cozy. Service was great. Our waiter ,which i believe was named Adem, did a spectacular job all night. Its BYOB so dont forget your bottle of wine. DEF. A MUST GOOO!!!!
