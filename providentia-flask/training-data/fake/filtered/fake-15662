I loved this place,you can tell people who run this place have style and know how to make you have a good time,the music was not too loud so you can have a conversation.the beer selection is like 50 different types of beer and the lobster sliders were Â yummy,they also have like 10 huge tvs,so watching a game there just be perfect.no other place in midtown like this,its a must to check it out.
