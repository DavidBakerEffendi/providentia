Find somewhere else. One of the daily specials was grilled cheese, fries and soup for $6.  Decided I was really just hungry for a sandwich and I ordered a grilled cheese with ham.   Ashley made the sandwich, plopped it on a handful of chips, walked to the register and charged me $7.  I handed her a twenty and said "$7? I guess I should have ordered the special."  She said "You want soup?" and I said "Sure."  While she got me the soup (no choice, she selected), I picked up the menu and read that a grilled cheese with ham was ... $5.  I told her.  She repeated "oh, it says $5."  That was that.  No apologies, offers to refund my money.  Nothing.   I should have demanded a refund, but I took this as a $2 investment to help other people avoid this place at all costs.   I should note that the grilled cheese was average.  Grilled bread and cheese and ham.  Chips were stale.  Haven't tried the soup, chicken noodle, seems standard.
