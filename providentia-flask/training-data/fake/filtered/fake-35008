Went for brunch at 10:30.  Not a large crowd as it just opened for the day. Food was very good--different, and prepared with knowledge and care.  We each had a drink--excellent. The entire wait staff--Pierce was our waiter--could not have been nicer or more professional.  Bravo! The one downside, and it could be quite problematic if it continues, is the attitude of the greeting staff.  We arrived a little before 10:30, and it wasn't open yet.  That's understandable, but the door opened for another group, and when I tried to walk in,  I was told the restaurant didn't open until the appointed hour.  i said it was the hour and was told rather quickly that it was only 10:28.  The same young lady never cracked a smile, and found other things to do before she paid attention to us.  We had a reservation, and there was only one other party there.  The other young lady who seated us finally did smile, but mumbled most of the time. Everybody has a bad day, but the greeters set the tone in every venue, and this was  poorly handled at Agricola. This being said, we will return, because the dining room staff and food were superb. It is critical, however, to work with the young people at the front desk.  How hard can it be to have a warm and welcoming attitude?  That's their job.  If you can't stand the pressure then perhaps you might consider a job where you don't have to interact with the public.
