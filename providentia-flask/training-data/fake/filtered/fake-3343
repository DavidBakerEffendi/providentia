This place is great for quick-serve healthy dining. I have been here several times (trying to make my way through the menu) and always leave feeling energized. So far I have tried the fish tacos (favorite) , balkan burger (love the slaw!), mahi curry (curry done right), basque shrimp (tons of flavor) and midtown chicken (excellent, filling salad). The dishes are well thought out and balanced. Highly recommend.
