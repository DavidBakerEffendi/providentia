I've been here twice. The first time was during restaurant week and the place was completely dead. The menu looked awful so I just ordered and app and went somewhere else. Second time was just last night. Again, only one couple in the entire restaurant and a couple of old drunk guys sitting at the bar. The bartender was very rude and just spent the time talking to the completely intoxicated guys in the corner. I finished my drink, didn't order food and was about to leave. Asked if I could speak to a manager. He claims he was the manager and if I didn't like their service then I should leave and never come back. The vibe there sucks. It's like that crappy hole in the wall bar only locals go to in a stick town. I will never be back and I will never recommend this place to anyone. It's terrible because new haven has so many good restaurants and this one is just taking up space.
