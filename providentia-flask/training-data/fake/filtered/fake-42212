There is nothing like coming here when hunger hits at 2 am and your craving some DELICIOUS halal food! The line is usually down the block whether its lunch time or 3am but the many guys working there make the line move really quick so make sure you have your order ready when your up. My favorites from here are the lamb and chicken mix platter over rice. After they quickly give you your platter which also comes with some pita bread slices you can get to the sauces on the end of the cart. The white sauce is HEAVENLY. I seriously pour about a quarter of a bottle on my plate. They have to go containers of sauce if your taking your food with you. I also usually put some bbq sauce on my platter with the white sauce, the combo is delish. They have about 3 carts within a block with guys just preparing more meat to bring over to this cart so their always pumping out a ton of meat and quickly. Beware of their hot sauce bottles because that stuff is so HOT it felt like it was burning my insides. I actually couldn't taste my food once after mistakingly pouring this stuff all over my food. Use sparingly unless you like your tongue going numb! Also, these platters are BIG. Big enough to share or to have enough leftovers for dinner or tomorrows lunch. Great value for the price. I definitely recommend this place and as I said don't be intimidated by the lines. A line down the block only takes around 10-15 minutes be at the point of getting your food. What are you waiting for, just GO!
