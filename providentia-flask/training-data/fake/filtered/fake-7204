Four of us, from two generations, ate at Tinto during the recent Phila Restaurant Week.  The food was amazingly good, but the kudos stop there.  The portions were badly inadequate.  The lighting in the basement was almost nonexistent.  The lighting on the basement steps was so dim as to be dangerous.  The service was mediocre.  The banquette seating made shouting from one end of the table almost mandatory.  My husband's seat was so broken down, he had to use one of the throw pillows to raise himself to the right height.  The bathroom was freezing.  Such a shame.  The delicious food can't compete with all the drawbacks.
