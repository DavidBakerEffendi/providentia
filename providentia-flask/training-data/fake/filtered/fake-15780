Beware of the mixed drinks.      The bartenders are not consistent.  In lemon drops they use "citrus speed bar mix" not lemon juice unless you are very specific with them.  I drank less than 1/4 of my drink. And called it to the attention of the manager... He agreed that they did it wrong but did not offer to remake it. So because of the management' s lack of care... I give it one star.  No matter how good the cheesecake is (and I did like the cheesecake).   They obviously don't really care. Try other places.....
