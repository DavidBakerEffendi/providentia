Wow, Wow, Wow! I had gone to Hawthornes to pick up a six pack of Efes, which I hadn't had since I was in Turkey last October. Imagine my suprise when I found an incredible, small, almost gourmet restaurant right smack dab in the middle of this beer heaven. I hung out for an hour until the kitchen opened for dinner service and it was well worth the wait. While waiting I sat by the fireplace and savored to glasses of Over Ale by the Half Acre Beer Company. The beer had a russet red/brown color to it, with medium bodied fullness and held a good head. Once the kitchen opened, I ordered a Mediterranean Plate which was well prepared and fresh & brought back memories of my visit to Turkey. Next up was braised short ribs over a potato pancake with asparagus. The short ribs were fork tender, juicy and full of flavor. The potato pancake was crispy on the outside and soft & full of flavor on the inside. Just as it should have been. Finally, the asparagus was mouth watering! Roasted in a simple garlic/salt/olive oil combo it was cooked perfectly and full of flavor. The service was excellent and very accommodating without being overbearing. The price more than reasonable. I will definitely be back. Hawthorne's you have found a new customer!
