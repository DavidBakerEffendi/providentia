what i great concept! fun place, great music and food that isn't to expensive. I went with a party of 5 and loved the fact that they portioned everything so that we could all get a bite of everything. The edamame dumplings are to die for as is the korean rice cakes. we also loved the romen (so good, very surprised to hear that anyone on this site didn't love it) I don't know of any other places in philly that serve it. The bahn mi was amazing too. My favorite part of the meal had to be the creative ice cream flavors. thank you sampan, this is my new favorite restaurant.
