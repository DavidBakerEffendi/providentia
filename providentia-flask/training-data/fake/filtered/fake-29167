Terrible. Overpriced and the staff are rude. Ordered a $9 omelet to treat my friend. They brought him the wrong omelet (the one they brought had ham. He can't eat ham.) and when we pointed out that it was the wrong omelet, they got an attitude, lied and said that was what we ordered so it's what we get. Food is not great quality either. I guess they're used to rich Yalie customers and feel they can treat anyone else like shit.
