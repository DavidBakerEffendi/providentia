My wife and I ate at Ofrenda's last evening after meeting Luis, the chef, when we walked by earlier in the day as he was fixing up the Dia de los Muertos display.  Luis is very friendly so we decided to give Ofrenda a try. Drinks are cheap at Happy Hour and Bryan is an excellent bartender. I make pretty damn good margaritas myself but Bryan's are even better. And the food!  Amazing food for such a small unassuming place.  Scallops are the best I've ever had.  Service was as good as the food. We live in California and eat lots of good Mexican food....but not this good!  This is more like Mexican/French fusion or something of the sort. As we left the restaurant, walking down 7th, Luis comes hustling out to tell us goodbye.  An 'abrazo' for both me and my wife. Overall, I could not recommend any restaurant more highly.
