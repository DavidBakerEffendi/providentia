The bagels are decent, and the sandwiches are edible. However, the service is absolutely horrendous. The system for ordering & paying is poorly conceived, and terribly executed by the staff. I would describe the general attitude of the employees as apathetic. I've simply stopped going there for lunch because of how unfriendly the service is.
