I went last night for the first time and I have already recommended it to everyone I spoke to since! The atmosphere was lively, the servers were knowledgeable and the food was to die for! We started with an assortment of oysters and clams, and the grilled octopus. Then we had the lamb t-bones... I had to stop myself from chewing the bones clean they were so good! Then we went with a variety of the desserts and each one was better than the next. Their wine list is varied and the recommendations we received from the sommelier were spot on. I'm in the restaurant business myself and I would like to say that I know what kind of work, passion, and dedication goes in to a place like this and I was thoroughly impressed from start to finish! I will definitely be back...
