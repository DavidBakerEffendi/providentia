This is a chill place with a great beer selection and courteous staff. I usually come here with some friends for happy hour to relax. I've tried most of their burgers and was never disappointed. It's a great happy hour joint to kick back and hang out while having some brews. Very close to other bars(Cask, Bar, Black Bear) if you want to check out other spots. It can get pretty crowded at times, so I usually just sit at the bar. If you're coming with a big group it might be a long wait.
