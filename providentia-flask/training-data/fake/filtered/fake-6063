I visited your store on today, I had such a taste for your pancakes & link sausages. I was sooooooooooooooo disappointed with the pancakes. They were heavy & rubbery. I was on crutches & there was no parking. I parked in the other lot & had to walk. Everything else was ok. I asked the female waitress & the guy at the counter to please speak to the two cooks to follow I Hops procedure for making pancakes. Once again I was so disappointed.
