Reality Check: It is very nice to have Hibiscus and more shops around Cedar Park, but there is one problem: they can't charge 5 dollars for a carrot juice, and I would really like to drink a carrot juice every day. More than half of the area residents cannot simply afford it on a regular basis. If you add a couple of children with you, it is simply unbearable. I would go every day if prices would be just reasonable.
