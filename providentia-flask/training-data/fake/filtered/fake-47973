I consider myself something of a wing aficionado. A chicken connoisseur, if you will. In all my years spent pursuing the great American pastime of masticating chicken-wings, I've never come across a place that rivals the crisp, tasteful crunch and savory flavor of Cluck U. Well done Cluck U. You've reignited the passion of bored Parsippany poultry pundits, which had gone unkindled for far , far too long. Highly recommend the Sweet Chili Sauce. I'd swim in it if I could.
