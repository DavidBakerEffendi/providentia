I live in the borough and have taken my friends and family here many times.  I have never had a disappointing meal.  Ingredients are Jersey Fresh and often prepared with an interesting flare, but never over the top or fussy; the food presentation reminds me of many a meal I have eaten in New York. Atmosphere is relaxed and the wait staff attentive. Yes, sometimes it gets a bit busy, but the staff never ever rushes you and are very accommodating to tweaks to the offerings.  This is a lovely local eatery employing local staff and supporting local farmers.  I like the fact that it is BYOB - makes the experience a bit easy on the pocket, too!
