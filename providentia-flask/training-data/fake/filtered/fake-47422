The only good thing about this place? The fries. And that's the only thing that I order from this place any more. Why, you ask? They've screwed up my order way too many times to count. I often get my food to go, and when I get home to find a burger that has cheese on it (I can't eat cheese) after specifically asking for no cheese, it becomes infuriating to have to go back. And this has happened on multiple occasions. Guys, you are not McDonalds. I should not have to check my order before leaving. You all speak english. There's no reason my order should be wrong so often. Not eating burgers here again, just the fries.
