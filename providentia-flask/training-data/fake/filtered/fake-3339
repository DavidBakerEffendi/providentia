Exactly what I want out of a burger joint! The food is a little pricey for a burger, but boy oh boy was it worth it for the quality. Won't be able to go that often due to the price, but a visit every other week or so will definitely be in order!! Great selection of different types of meats and an even wider selection of toppings. Can't complain about much besides the use of pickled Jalepenos instead of fresh ones. However my other toppings were delicious, especially the guacamole and bacon (3 types by the way). Consider ordering sides though, because the burgers were a little small.
