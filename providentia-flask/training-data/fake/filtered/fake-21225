So, in the spirit of playing fair, I first want to note that everyone seems to love Taco Riendo and I myself went there because I had heard many good things. That being said, I signed up for yelp specifically because I wanted to mention the horrible experience I just had there. The service was quick and efficient and friendly enough, but I ordered the beef flank burrito, and there were many small bones in it.  I tried to be a sport and ignore the first few that I bit into, but around bone number 4 I gave up, leaving a whole 2/3rds of the burrito behind. I was truly grossed out and disappointed, to the point where I actually decided to talk to the woman at the counter about my meal, which is not something I ever do.  Her response was to say "that is just how the beef flank is". Now... I have had beef flank before and I have never chipped any teeth on it. Also, if that just truly is how they serve their beef flank and not a cop out, then maybe that burrito should come with a warning label. Overall- really unhappy and genuinely disgusted, oh- not to mention still hungry and $10 poorer.
