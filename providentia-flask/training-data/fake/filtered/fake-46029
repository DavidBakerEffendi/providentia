Amazing Dominican cuisine! I highly recommend the rotisserie chicken family combo or the pernil. They are both super tender and seasoned to perfection, they have generous portions that comfortably serve approximately 2 adults and two children/teens. The owner is really friendly and accommodating. The sauce for the chicken is amazzzzzzzzzziiiing. This restaurant just opened up a couple days ago and I've been there twice already. I will definitely make this a regular take-out option. 5 stars in my book.
