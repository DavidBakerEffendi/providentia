Pizza Brain is fantastic!  I frequently find myself traveling uptown for the experience.  All the employees appear to have fun with their job, and it certainly shows in the end result, as the food is fantastic, bar none.  The prices are well worth the bike ride up, and the fact that Little Baby's Ice Cream is literally a doorway away solidifies the spot as one of the greatest places to get grub in the city
