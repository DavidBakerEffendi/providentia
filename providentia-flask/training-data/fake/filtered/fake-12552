I was at positano Grill this week with my girlfriends.  A picture fell off the wall while we were sitting at the table.  It hit me in the head and knocked over a bottle of wine.  They were apologetic and gave me ice for my head but said it wasn't their fault that the picture fell down, its been there for 4 years.  They did not offer anything.  My friends phone was destroyed by the wine that spilled on it. They didn't care...it was not their fault.  I would never go back there, nor to their other restaurant across the street..Romeos.
