I love zorbas! My husband and I have been going for 5 years. We don't live too close but its a priority. The family works very hard to greet you when you enter and leave, and always make sure were holding out alright. I've noticed many stubborn older people give these people a hard time and I've had to speak tp a couple pwrsonally. The staff is great but the customers could be better! Plus that kalamari is out of this world!
