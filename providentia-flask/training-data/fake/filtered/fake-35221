For all those complaining about the service, Don't go to Italy. Italian people are genuine, passionate, hard working and honest to the face. Dont expect the fake smile routine that American employees have. For 5 dollars you travel to the heavens and back, if you are still complaining then take a dunk in the Hudson for your own sake. You can taste the passion in this womens cooking. Its phenomenal.
