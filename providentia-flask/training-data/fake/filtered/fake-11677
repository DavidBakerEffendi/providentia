Saturday night dinner.  If we closed our eyes, we would have felt like we were in any of dozens of trattorria's throughout Tuscany.  The food was crazy good, the wine list of 100 Italians quite impressive, and the service could not have been better or more attentive.  Lauren, our server was so good when we return we will ask for her again.  The wood burning ovens add a wonderful flavor to the oven dishes, we had a broccoli rabe and sausage pizza, the eggplant, and for appetizers the octopus, the roasted mushrooms (to die for) and the rice balls.  It's going to be hard to move to some of the other menu items given how wonderful everything was.  The Vivoli experience needs no comments, while no where near the flavor choices in Florence, if you have the hazelnut and pistachio available, you don't need the others.  It was the perfect way to end a great meal.   The pizza was crisp, the sauce wonderful, the broccoli rabe not at all bitter.  The eggplant was to die for, it's one of my favorite dishes, and their razor thin slices were cooked till they were sweet and tender.  We already have made reservations for the next visit.
