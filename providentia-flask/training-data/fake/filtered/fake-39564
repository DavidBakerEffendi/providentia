Having lived in Woodside my whole life, I decided to finally give this place a try.   The food was alright. I ordered the basil fried rice, and it was pretty much what basil fried rice is anywhere. The rest of the dining experience sucked. The wait staff was impatient and rushed us to order and spent the entire evening dragging chairs across the floor all night so all we heard was chair screeching. Above all, the place was just loud. I guess that's a good thing for them since it was super crowded, but it was uncomfortable and felt like a cafeteria...I  just couldn't see what all the fuss was about. Give me Rayong (formerly Sweet Basil) any day over SriPraPhai
