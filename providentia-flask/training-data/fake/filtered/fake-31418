I ordered a large pie and I was told it will take 10-15 minutes. I sat and waited inside. 20 minutes had passed, and after seeing other people who came after me getting their orders, I asked how many more minutes for mine. Â And that's the only time they prepared my order. Had to wait another 10 minutes. I took home the pizza and it was very disappointing to find out that the pizza wasn't fully cooked. It was a waste of time and $13. Never going back to this place
