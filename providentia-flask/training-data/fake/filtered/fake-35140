The Falafel is good.. but the owners are rude and NOT friendly.  The girl working there... she's either the man's wife or daughter is sooo rude.. she doesn't even say THANK YOU or look at you when she takes your money and gives you change.  Been there twice and same deal both times.  It amazes me how people can be so unappreciative and still stay in business.
