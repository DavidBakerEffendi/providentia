I went to the Hourglass Tavern on April 16 with three friends.  We all thoroughly enjoyed our dinners.  We all went for the prix fix pre-theatre option.  Two of us got the chicken, one the pasta primavera and I got the home made ravioli.  The salad, and especially the dressing, was delicious.  Our waitress was really sweet also.  Would definately go back.
