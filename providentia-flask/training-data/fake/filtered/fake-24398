Stay away. Disinterested hostess, mediocre food, fryer and grill not working, high prices, cash only, no wait service upstairs, get your own drink from the bar ... what's not to like? The best feature of this bar is the view, which they can't take credit for.  They manage to spoil what should be an outstanding experience.  Overrated, overpriced, and overattended ... eat and drink somewhere else.
