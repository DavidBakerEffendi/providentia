Yes! I have found the solution for late night craving! And they deliver. I went to the one in Bryn Mawr after a recommendation. I got the Kadai Chicken and Basil Naan. Incredible! I had the rest for lunch teh next day. The menu had 2 peppers next to it signifying that it was pretty spicy, but this was incredibly spicy. I didn't realize I had to mix the other rice-like stuff with it to cool it down. I did this for lunch the next day and it was even more enjoyable. Lot of chicken, peppers and onions. Delish!
