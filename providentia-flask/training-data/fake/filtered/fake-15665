By far the worst pseudo "Mexican" food I have ever had - ground beef in a burrito - please it's not taco bell!!!  The only authentic thing in the place is the Mexican beer and tequila.  So excited to eat there - and so disappointed - and the service was mediocre to horrific.  Very sad that we won't be back or recommending this restaurant to anyone.
