I've driven by here a million times and finally stopped in tonight for the first time.   Atmosphere: I was immediately reminded of Five Guys.  Similar pricing, similar vibe, with a larger menu (of course, Al's has been around longer and isn't a chain, that's just the vibe I got).  Typical diner feel, black and white tile with red accents.  Order and pay at counter, get food, sit down--fast food restaurant feel, I had thought it would be more of a diner style service. Food: I went classic and ordered chicken fingers, fries, and a chocolate shake.  The chicken fingers were okay, nothing great, but they were definitely fresh and super hot.  Good, fresh cut fries.  Chocolate shake was SUPER thick, very rich and creamy.  Darn good, and the best part of my meal by far. Price: Fair for what I got. Staff: Basically didn't talk to them except for ordering, but seemed pleasant enough.  Happier than the average disgruntled fast food employee, so that's something. Overall not bad.  I'd like to go back when the weather is warmer and get some ice cream--I saw the ice cream window on the side of the building.  I really could have gone for some soft serve.  Next time!
