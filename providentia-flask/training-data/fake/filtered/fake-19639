I LOVE LOVE Ethiopian food-  worked in an Ethiopian restaurant in W Philly for years and continue to enjoy the food often.  So, I was really excited to try ERA, when my work moved right around the corner.   I ordered the vegetarian combination, which is listed as a sample of EVERY vegetable dish on the menu and is supposed to feed 3-4 people.  We got three dollops of vegetables (lentils, collards and the potato/cabbage combo).  It barely served 2 and the injera was rubbery (which happens when it is not fresh.) I specifically asked (because of reviews here) when i ordered if it was really enough to feed four and I was assured that it was. I was a potential new, consistent customer.  But, I will never go back.
