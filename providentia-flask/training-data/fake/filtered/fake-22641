My girlfriend and I want to enjoy this place. We love Italian food, live only a short subway ride away, and think the setting is fantastic. But twice we've gone, and twice we've waited not only well over an hour, but also longer than parties of our size who arrived after us--likely an offshoot of the rude host/manager, who seems to play favorites among patrons. First, the wait. It would be tolerable if not for the fact that they usher you outside with little to no regard for the current weather conditions. Are they allergic to gas heat lamps? It's obnoxious to expect people to wait an hour or more in overcast, chilly weather because of your reputation. Get over yourself and pony up; judging by the wait times, they certainly must have some money left over to invest in several lamps. Second, the food. The crostini are very well done, and at $3 reasonably priced. The pasta is al dente, and, well, that's about the best you can say for it. The sausage cavatelli made both of us ill (literally... it kept my girlfriend up all night), and the bolognese tasted like Chef Boyardee, with a few extra spices to throw you off the scent. A subpar dining experience, even if the prices aren't outrageous. My suggestion: Try Caffe e Vino in Fort Greene. Much more authentic, and better bang for your buck.
