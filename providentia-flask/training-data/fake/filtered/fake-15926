I rather not eat Italian abroad since I come from Italy but this Italian restaurant pizzeria was highly recommended by a friend of mine and I had to pay a visit. I found this place outstanding ,I had timbal lo di zucchini first and than a diavolo pizza,to be honest I don't think you can find a pizza so good in Italy so easily. The crust , the tomato sauce, the mozzarella fiordilatte in NYC I couldn't believe it. So good that they deserved my first review on yelp. Bravi
