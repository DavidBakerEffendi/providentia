I was visiting Philadelphia on business and I joined several co-workers who had already begun their evening at Umai Umai...I could not have been happier that this was their chosen location!   The atmosphere is cozy and inviting and the food was fresh, unique and an absolutely amazing taste experience.  We enjoyed several Krakken and Eternal Sunshine rolls, along with the Oyster Shooters which were fabulous and unlike anything I've ever tasted...I highly recommend all of the above.  If you have room after overindulging in the sushi offerings, don't miss the Funnel Cake Fondue. Our server was friendly, enthusiastic and very knowledgeable and the BYOB definitely worked well for our crowd. Looking forward to my next trip to Philly and Umai Umai.
