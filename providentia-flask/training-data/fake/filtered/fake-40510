We had my daughter's bridal shower at Paris Inn on 8/25/13 and it was wonderful.  The brunch was highlighted by delicious quiche and french toast, and the food was plentiful.  The staff couldn't have been more helpful and attentive and I felt the cost was quite reasonable.  I would definitely use Paris Inn again for any type of party.  Try them.  You won't be disappointed!
