The decor and the selection of liquor is great.   The service, unfortunately, not so great. I've been there numerous times, and each time the bartender has acted arrogant and indifferent.   Ahh bartenders and their inflated egos. I wouldn't expect them to be friendly if they didn't expect me to leave a tip.
