This place hit the spot. I've been on a noodle kick recently and after the last Yelp Event, it was a pleasure to be able to walk in, get a seat and warm up. I think the broth is wonderful, but for some it may be a bit too salty. I was happy. The food is beautifully presented. Â And I left full and smiling. The place is small so go early but not too early , like candice says, it takes time to get the food right.
