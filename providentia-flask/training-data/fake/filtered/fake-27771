We weren't sure what to expect from this resto, which has gotten a lot of press lately for their Italian Grandma Cuisine. We ended up having one of the most memorable meals of the past year, and because we work in twenty or thirty states, we probably dine out two-hundred nights a year, or more. This place is truly special. Great vibe, great kitchen, great service. I don't generally look forward to visits to Staten Island, but that may have changed, now that Enoteca Maria is there!
