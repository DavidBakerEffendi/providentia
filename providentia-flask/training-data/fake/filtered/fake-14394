I can't rave enough about how much we love Los Gallos! We are fortunate to live right around the corner and make sure we head over as often as we can. The Al Pastor is amazing and the steak and chicken are always delicious. We always order a guacamole upon arrival and always have leftovers :) We brought family from Texas to try Los Gallos and they were totally impressed by the authenticity as well as the reasonable prices. With meals averaging $10 - $12 Â per person it makes it a very affordable and delicious night out!
