Their breakfast, horrible. The review about the precooked egg patties is accurate. For a place that is all about "organic and local" I was disappointed! Their juice is okay, but expensive. I got the green monster. Since I work in the area, I decided to try the lunch today..... Their chicken and rice soup was ehhh- too much parsley. And I found a bone in the chicken salad. What really ruins this place is the service. Everyone is completely rude and makes you feel like you're burdening them with your patronage. The woman at the counter is on her iPad and the cooks roll their eyes at you and are just terribly rude. You're better off paying a little more and going to olives around the corner. No Â precooked eggs, better soups, WAYYY better service. Never going back.
