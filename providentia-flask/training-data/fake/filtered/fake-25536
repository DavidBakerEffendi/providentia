I have followed Franco from 2nd & South to Ridge Avenue to City Avenue  and last night for the first time  to Indian Queen Lane...and I am always glad I have! This newest venture is the smallest of the restaurants  and located in an unlikely spot on the very long and winding, one way Indian Queen Lane in East Falls. Fiorino only holds maybe 30 people but doesn't feel crowded.  It feels like something from a time past as neighborhood folk come in with their BYOB and receive a huge hello and hug from the staff. The food is an absolute marvel. We got an antipasto for the table that was large and freshly made. I had the branzina fish, delicate and flaky with the most scrumptious potatoes and lovely fresh crisp steamed veggies. One table mate had a pork chop stuffed with mozzarella and broccoli rabe that was tender and cooked to perfection  while the others had angel hair pasta with clams in a white sauce.  Try the tiramisou at the end of the meal. It is like heaven on a fork. 4 of us ate to capacity for $100.  The parking is a bit dicey and the street is a steep hill. Well worth it!!
