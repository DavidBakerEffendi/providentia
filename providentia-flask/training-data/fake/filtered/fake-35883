Great for lunch! Surprisingly, they have the best wings. We sometimes order them by phone and stop by to pick them up. They have wonderful appetizers, salads and such. The dinner main courses can be a bit pricey, and I sometimes really don't feel that they are worth the expense. However, this is still one of my favorite places to go in the afternoon when meeting up with family or friends. It's quaint and everyone is really friendly.
