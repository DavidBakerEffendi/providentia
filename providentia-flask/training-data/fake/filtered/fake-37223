There was nothing less than perfect about my meal at Hillstone. The music, the atmosphere, the service, Â and, of course, the food were impeccable. I definitely recommend the Roasted Prime Rib and the Hawaiian Rib-Eye Steak. Reservations are a good idea to have, as it was very busy when I was there even at 9:30-10PM. I'll definitely be going back.
