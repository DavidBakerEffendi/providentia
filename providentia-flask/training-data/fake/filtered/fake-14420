We left this restaurant feeling just about as satisfied as we've ever felt after any meal.  Ever.   My husband ordered the spicy chicken enchiladas with the mole sauce, and i got the chorizo tostadas.....and MAN oh MAN were they delicious.  We also got two Mexican sodas and a vanilla flan which were quite tasty.  I've been to plenty of Mexican restaurants, but I don't think it gets more authentic OR flavorful than this. Alicia, the owner, spent lots of time talking to us and keeping us company even while running around filling multiple orders (apparently a really busy night).  She filled us in on all sorts of interesting information about Mexican chocolate, mezcal, and other such tidbits of information. An amazing meal, great conversation, a wonderful time, and all for a mere $22.  WHAT??
