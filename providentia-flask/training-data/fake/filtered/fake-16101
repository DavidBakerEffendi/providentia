I was made to feel less than and discriminated against. Having been there 3 times prior, I walked in like before but was told they were seating "only reservations", at 10:30pm, even after I offered to wait for a table, they said "we're fully committed and you can return tomorrow". So i decided to call, 10 minutes later pretending to inquire about the wait time for a table and was told it would be a 25 minutes. Whether it was cause I'm brown skinned, was dressed down, if I were gay or any reason they could find...DISCRIMINATION IS DISCRIMINATION and its wrong.
