This is as good as it gets. Best bang for the buck in New York City. We love to order all the antipasti and have a pasta as our main course. Wine list is extensive and so fairly priced that you won't see such deals anywhere else in Manhattan. Staff is always knowledgeable and friendly. Reservations can be difficult and the wait can be long if you don't have any. But everything is so fresh and yummy, it's worth the wait. Can be loud.
