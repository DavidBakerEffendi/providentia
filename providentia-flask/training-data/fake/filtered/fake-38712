It was our first trip to NYC with my husband and 2 teenagers.   The concierge at our hotel suggested the Marshal for lunch.  Teenagers can be fussy but my 2 were blown away with the restaurants friendliness, quaint atmosphere and SUPERB food!   We loved it so much we went back for dinner on our last night.  Local products are used and as a tourist I love trying our local items.  They even had it down to the soft drinks and local wines - AWESOME!   If you are in NYC or about to got there, this restaurant is a must!
