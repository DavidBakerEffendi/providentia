I've been to Cucina Zapata three different times now and each time I come away amazed!   I've had the Cap'n Crunch Tilapia each time and it has been consistently delicious - well-cooked, enhanced just perfectly with Asian slaw and a mayo sauce with a ZING!   After reading the reviews on this site, my next choice in the chicken satay taco.  Well done, Cucina Zapata.  You are a welcome addition to the Drexel 'Food Truck Row' and I will continue to frequent your business.   HOW do they make such amazing food out of a TRUCK???    And - they are super-friendly to boot.    I also caution readers to not wait until late in the day to grab your lunch - you may be disappointed as I have been a few times.
