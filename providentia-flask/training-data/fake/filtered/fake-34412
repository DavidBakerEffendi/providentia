I held a dinner party at Supper in their private room for my friend who was getting married.  The private room is incredible, the food was amazing and the staff was very attentive and helpful.  To top it off, the price per head is very reasonable and includes beer and wine.  I am so glad we held the dinner here and if I ever need a private room again in NYC, I will without hesitation come here.
