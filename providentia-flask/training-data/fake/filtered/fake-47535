This is definitely for tourists only. The eat-in experience is absolutely terrible. You're pretty much sitting on the person next to you and I don't go out to restaurants to crouch over my food and hope my elbows don't knock off shit from the table next to me. And WOW, the authentic coal oven. So authentic that you taste the coal. Literally. The bottom of our pizza was quite black in most areas. Yum? We got the classic Margherita and it was good, but definitely not great. It's comparable to any restaurant pizza and I would take real Brooklyn pies over this any day. Got a great picture of the bridges while waiting a half-hour to get in though.
