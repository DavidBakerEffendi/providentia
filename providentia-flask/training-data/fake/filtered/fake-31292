If you're ever in this area, you have to check out De Mole.  A hidden gem in the 5 boroughs, IMO.  Guacamole is pretty good here, although I've still yet to have better guac than Toloache.  When I was here, I ordered steak tacos, medium-rare and they definitely exceeded my expectations.  Mind you, I came here with a friend who lives in the area and was not expecting too much.  It was a pleasant surprise.
