For the most part, I like this place.  They really take pub food to a new level and really have set a standard in Philadelphia.  That said, there are other places that have surpassed this standard and I wonder if Standard Tap will be able to keep up in the future.  I came here for beer week and had a really great meal, great beer.  Other times I've come and the food seemed like it was thrown together by pirates and the service was mediocre, even for a bar.  Biggest complaint, you can't see the chalkboard beer list from everywhere in the bar and they don't provide an alternative to awkwardly standing behind some dude looking over his shoulder.  That and inconsistency.  I have high expectations for Standard Tap because I believe they can meet them when they try.  Hopefully my next meal will be better.
