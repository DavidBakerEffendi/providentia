the worst custermer service i ever had, they fuck your order up and never say sorry, they are high as shit and the food isnt that good, i use to order from them all the time but they ketp fuckiing my shit up day after day , i use to order 3 and 4 time a week and all the time i ordered they fuck my oder up and they dont take credit cards even thow this website say they do, dont ever ask them to put anything on your foood cuz they wont no matter how many times you ask them,i live at the top of the block from them and it Â took over an hour to bring my food to me how the fuck do you take that long to come up the street thats bad service it not like i ordered a bunch of shit just a med pizza and to ch burgers that dont take ahour, then i ordered 2 hoages and they didnt put no mayo on it even thow the menu say they use mayo i took it back and all they did was take the meat off and threw mayo on it and gave it back they never even said sorry, PS. to ROASARIO'S PIZZAERIA. LEARN HOW TO SAY SORRY when you fuck a persons food up,and stop being so fucking CHEAP and give people something for there trouble,if you dont wanna give anything for then dont fuck up people order. as for me i will never order from that place ever again the food is no where close to being worth all that shit, and i no they might not care since im only 1 person, but im still goota post what think
