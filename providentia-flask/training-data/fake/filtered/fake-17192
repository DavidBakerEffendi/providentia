I went into the Southern  place thinking OK. here we go again another boot leg Southern cooking place. The place was empty and very clean.  To good to be true kinda thing!  My better half ordered a fried chicken dinner, my daughter ordered the honey BBQ wings and I ordered the fish & shrimp dinner with a side of red velvet cake.  Well, when we  got home and started eating. . . OH, MY GOODNESS!! We looked at each other like WOW I don't believe it.  We finally hit the JACKPOT and it is located around the corner from my home.   If you want Real Down Home Southern Cuisine. Please make your way to Napoleon Southern Cuisine & Bakery on Bedford Ave Between Putnam and Madison. Delicious!!!
