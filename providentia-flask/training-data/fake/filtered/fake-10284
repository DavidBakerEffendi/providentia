I will never return to this place again. Upon entering it was clear that there were empty tables. Instead of being seated we were told to wait until this other couple finished eating. Which normally is not a problem at all. Ive been a hostess and a waitress and having three open tables means you seat your customers. We were told it would be "3 minutes" when the couple still had full glasses of beer left. There is no place to wait we were standing in the middle of the restaurant just waiting for these individuals to drink their drinks and leave which is so rude and unprofessional of the waitstaff. When the other customers in the restaurant started apologizing for barrios behavior we left without eating anything. I will make sure to tell all of my friends to never eat there. Horrific customer service.
