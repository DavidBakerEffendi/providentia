Pros:   The food is decent. The free salsa is very very good. Especially the green, which I have tried time and time again to mock without success. Great veg varieties! Great happy hour specials! Fun atmosphere! Cons:   The staff is hit or miss. I have had fantastic service here, and terrible service. If you work here all I can tell you is that if you give me bad service I'll only tip 10%, but if you give me awesome service I'll tip you 20-25%. So, it's up to you.    And if you have yet to give this place a try I'd recommend it for happy hour during a week day, when it's less crowded and shockingly loud.
