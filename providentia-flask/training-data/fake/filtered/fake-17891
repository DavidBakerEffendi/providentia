I  was very disappointed after all the hype from family members. They brought the salad and appetizer out at the same time so there wasn't any room on the tiny table.  The food was flavorless  - Tagliatelle Bolognese was just thick fettuccine and hamburger meat and the salad was nondescript.   The tables are too close together and the hostess and waiter were pretentious and inattentive.  He took the order and we didn't see him again until dessert   - no "how was your meal"?  We won't return.
