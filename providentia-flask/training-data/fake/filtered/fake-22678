I've eaten here dozens of times and every meal has been consistently delicious. The service is friendly and low key. My favorites include the meatballs, the gnocchi and the sweet potato ravioli. The only downside is the wait. If you're a first-timer, don't go with a big group and go early or late. It's also a nice place to eat at the bar.
