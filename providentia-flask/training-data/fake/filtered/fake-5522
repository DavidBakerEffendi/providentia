I was so excited after I read the reviews to this place, I had a delicious quinoa bowl and then I ordered a smoothie, all was well and then I noticed that the smoothies were nearly 10 dollars. I couldn't do anything about it because I already paid for it, but that was fine. The staff was nice enough I guess, until I had a problem. My tongue started throbbing and my mouth felt super weird and I asked them kindly if I could return it or exchange it for something else, like any restaurant would.. as something was clearly wrong because I'm not allergic to anything. They brought the manager over and I told her the same thing (nicely of course), and I have never felt so disrespected in my life.. She was awful and essentially said nothing is wrong on their part and it was all in my head and looked at me like I was incompetent, I was horrified and wasted ten dollars and it still makes me sick. I do hope no one has this experience they need people who know how to do business-- which means when you work for money you are working to please the people and give them what they want so they come back.. I'm not going back.
