My second visit to this local restaurant convinced me that something is amiss here.  What is the beverage of choice on New Year's Eve? Champagne perhaps? Or Prosecco or some other sparkling beverage (not a wine spritzer please)? I was anticipating that glass of champagne mightily so I was very disappointed when the waitress informed me that they had one bottle, not chilled, and she didn't know the name of it.  Alas, the name was never revealed but she said the bottle was going to be "saved" for pouring later at midnight.  We were early diners.  Could a little aforethought about ordering enough champagne and offering it by the glass for New Year's Eve been too much to ask? The food was mediocre at best.  Caesar salads are not tossed in the kitchen.  I got a plastic cup full of gloppy dressing sitting in the bowl.  The waitress couldn't be bothered to explain the specials and just gave us a slip of paper with the specials on it.  There is no finesse with either the food or service here.  Because of the lack of competition this restaurant survives.  No grace, no energy in cleaning up the snowy slush in the entry way as we made our way out.  Good restaurants pay attention to details and train their staff so that they understand the concept of "service".  I have a long history in all front of the house positions so this comment comes from years on the front lines, working all the big holidays and making my entire income on tips.  I really hope they make it but they need to look beyond decorations and the TV screens.
