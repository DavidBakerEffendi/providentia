Hosted my kids birthday party here after going around New jersey for a real south indian spicy food and a decent place to accomodate 50+ people. I was so happy that i did the birthday party here. The manager Sundar was really friendly and helpful and was catering to my needs. He blocked the entire restuarant for us on a saturday luch inspite of losing his regurlar buffet customers. That is a real customer service. The place was neat the service was great and on time, the food in the buffet table was filled frequently...everyone in the party appreciated the food and the place. About food, it was really out of this world, all the items that we menued down was served to our taste, if you really want to taste the south indian style food with authentic spice and flavour that too at a reasonable price...this is the only place i would say in NJ. Iam a food freak i have been to almost all restuarants in and around new jersey...this guys are really excellent...some food to mention Chicken lollipop, pepper chicken fry, Mutton fry, dum briyani, Â chettinadu chicken, masala dosai etc etc...they also have those speciality food in their buffet like once we tasted Rabbit curry...it was so tasteful and flavourful...also they serve crab masala and kaadai curry or fry during special buffets on saturday and sunday. Overall my experience with Arusuvai was very nice...and all my future parties or gatherings will be here..i will not be looking around anymore. Thanks sundar for your excellent and exceptional service.
