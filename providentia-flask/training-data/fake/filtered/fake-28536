Do not go.   The only redeeming quality is that it delivers.  The pizza is greasy and tasteless.   The owner is arrogant and actually scolded customers who took too long to order.  He was impatient and unprofessional.   Do not waste your time or money.   The owner is constantly prioritizing young females and harassing them with cat calls.   He also berates his workers in front of customers.   What a waste of real estate!
