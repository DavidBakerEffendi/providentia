We arrived for a dinner on Saturday night and restaurant was so busy even though, they served the best food and service was on time. That's the really a good thing I liked about it. Â Definitely some of the best platter and roll I had. The all ingredient in platter speaks for itself.. I kept eating it.. So fresh.. And fair price..
