DELICIOUS.  And honestly, an exceptional bang for your buck as the portions are HUGE.   The Sangria is TO DIE FOR.  Do not go here without at least tasting the sangria.   I had the grilled eggplant stuffed with goat cheese for an appetizer.  Now, I am a sucker for absolutely anything with goat cheese in it and a dish that tells me that it is socially acceptable to eat almost an entire 4 oz. log of goat cheese in one sitting will win me over in a heart beat.  It was delicious, I honestly could have split it with two other people though as it comes with three rolls and they are all very rich.  Nonetheless I finished all 4 oz of goat cheese without second thoughts.  I also tried the scallops which were also amazing. I had the bass as my entree.  I've never seen so much food on my plate.  It came with cherry tomatoes, fennel, and lemon sauce AND mashed potatoes, AND squash, AND greenbeans, AND carrots.  And these are all relatively healthy sized portions not just a greenbean with a carrot.  The plate was larger than a stearing wheel.  Somehow I ate EVERYTHING although this took some time and concentration on my part.   The service was excellent, although I'm knocking off a star because it was almost too good.  I felt at times that I was being watched as I ate.  The busboys and server hovered and gave a somewhat awkward overtone to the meal.  The food though (which ultimately is most important) was to die for.
