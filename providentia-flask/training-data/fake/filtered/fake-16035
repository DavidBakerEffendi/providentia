Outstanding.   Great authentic Russian/Ukrainian food.   Being Polish we ate quite a few of our favourites ... borscht, herring, potato latkes, and perogy.   Sergey had perfect recommendations.  We had a lovely tour of the restaurant including the banquet room upstairs.   Price was superb.  Portion size excellent.  Even better we had a lovely Russian gentleman beside us as well as a businessman from Taiwan.  They were both extremely intelligent and worldly ... great conversation!!!  Tried the horseradish VODKA ... gotta do that one again.   We will be back.
