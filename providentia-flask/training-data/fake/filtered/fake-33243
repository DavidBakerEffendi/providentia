Went to Front street Bistro for dinner then went to the theater afterwards to see Silver linings playbook. We were welcomed right when we walked in the door by the ticket taker, hostess and even a manager who was just walking by, this was a great and welcoming feeling. We arrived at 6:20 for a 7:15 movie. We were sat right away and our server was over to us for drink orders within less than 30 seconds!!! We ordered from the Taste of Hartford menu, what a great deal an entree, appetizer, your choice of sides and desert all for $20.13, by the way not to mention they give you a free movie ticket with every guest who purchases the Taste of Hartford deal. The ticket is good only Sunday thru Thursdays, but not a bad deal at all since tickets sell for $11.00. Our food came out within 15 minutes after ordering. The speed and customer service at this business is extraordinary. The food was delicious, my compliments to the Chef! Line moved fast at the box office/concession stand, we were greeted by an attendant with a warm, cheerful smile, we weren't planning on buying any snacks, just tickets but the smell of the great popcorn and a little sales push from the attendant we decided to get a medium popcorn which was freshly popped and sooooo good! We had purchased our tickets and received our popcorn all within under a a minute or two. As we proceeded to our theater my wife dropped the popcorn and started to pick it up, a young manager with glasses saw this and came right over and told my wife not to worry about cleaning it up and that he would have it taken care of, he then called over en employee to sweep it up, took our popcorn said he will re-fill it for us and bring it into our movie so we wouldn't have to wait and miss any previews, now that's service, going above and beyond to do anything to make the guest happy. We absolutely love this place and will be back many times and will bring our friends!!
