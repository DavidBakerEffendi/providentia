The Blue Elephant Trail- Where to begin!? I first attended this place when my sister told me it replaced the old lemongrass. I had eaten at lemon grass once, but I hated it! I was more than pleased with my experience at the Blue Elephant. To start, I was seated right away on a friday night, even with out a reservation. We were given a comfortable half table/half booth. The waitress was with us right away with free appitizer, which was pickled veggies. They were gluteen free and awesome! After we placed our order, we took advantage of the full bar and had excellent drinks. The food took a little while to prepare, but we are aware that everything is made to order, so it was worth waiting for. The food was well cooked, hot, and just how we liked it. The waitress refilled our water and checked on how the food was multiple times. When we were ready for our check it was brought out promptly, and we were out the door intime for our movie. We even got a chance to talk to Sohours, the owner, she was wonderful! I will definitely be visiting here again, and I know that I will be coming back with friends and family for many times to come. Thank you thank you thank you!
