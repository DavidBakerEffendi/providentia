Four of us had diner at the Cook shop this past Sunday. My husband and I arrived first and they made us wait at the bar, but as soon as the rest of the company arrived a few minutes later, we were Â immediately escorted to our table. We had appetizers, main courses and wine. We were satisfied with everything except for a certain problem with one entree, which was quickly and gracefully resolved and we enjoyed our evening thoroughly. I would like to thank the staff for its attentive service and the kitchen and management for going beyond the call of duty to see that we were thoroughly satisfied.
