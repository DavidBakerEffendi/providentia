I met several friends at Zutto's on Monday evening and had a OUTSTANDING dinner.  We started with the portabella mushroom with a tasty Japanese sauce and wrapped in a rice roll and a similar dish with tender pork --- this was to die for!  We had an assortment of sushi that had great flavor and well prepared. My main course was the chicken sous vide - it literally melted in your mouth and the flavor of the cauliflower puree and caramelized brussel sprouts was unbelievable. The restaurant is very relaxing, a flavor of Japanese decor. There is a huge wood beam table in the center of the room that is very organic and inviting. Or, sit up at the sushi chef table and watch the magic unfold in front of you as he prepares the food.  Cost of the dinner was moderate. This a must stop --- oh yes, and the Service was A+.  Bravo!  I will be back...just hope it doesn't get over crowded and I have to wait in line..lol.  Zutto is a real treasure on Hudson Street.
