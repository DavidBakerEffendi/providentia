Love this place... go here almost every weekend for brunch. Staff is great, super friendly and the food is really good and I think priced decently, especially compared to other places in Old City. Orange french toast is awesome for brunch, the roast pork italiano is really good for dinner. Definitely a great neighborhood spot.
