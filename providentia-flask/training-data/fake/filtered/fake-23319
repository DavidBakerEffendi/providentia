we heard that this eatery had rave reviews. well, my family of 5 ate there this past sunday and each one of us was disappointed in our entrées. my husband's pizza was so soggy that he didn't finish it. my rib steak was overdone and the asparagus was so "charred"that it tasted burnt and not edible. the fish taco had hardly any fish included. my granddaughter's slider burger was overdone and burnt. mediocre at best was everyone's opinion of our meal together. just because an eatery is located in williamsburg, the "in place" doesn't mean that every eatery is worth visiting. and, certainly not this one. whether your product comes from farm to fork, if it's not prepared well, why bother. to make the meal even more unpleasant the music was too loud and not conducive to an enjoyable evening out.  the conclusion that we all came to is that no one in the area cooks and they accept whatever these eateries dish out because they don't know any better. what a shame! great concept of farm to fork, but those cooks/chefs need to learn how to cook so that whatever they serve merits the FULL meaning of their mission statement.  so sad... we each expected a delicious meal. but, instead, we vowed NEVER to come back... they need to up their game for those who know how any food can be made simply but deliciously....  the whole experience was disappointing, other than the solicitous waiter waiting on us. but, it was early and besides us and a few other people, the place was empty. another reason to make sure that the meals served should be the best, since they are not rushed w/ a crowd of people.  so, in conclusion, i would not recommend this eatery to anyone who doesn't like burnt food.
