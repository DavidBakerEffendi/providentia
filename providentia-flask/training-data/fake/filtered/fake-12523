the food was very very good, i would def eat there again, However, the service was very slow and off. Mind you that it wasn't even busy so why weird service..and he clearly made my dining experience less than par. No water and bread till after we almost finished our meal. He seemed like he didn't want to be here or they are working him to hard...but I over heard the other tables saying the same thing. If it wasn't for our server I would have given this place more stars and would have enjoyed the night cause like I said the food wasn't the problem. Like other places we visited in Montclair the owners always forget about the service and for last night to be slow I hope he takes my advice and does something with the service cause the food is surely not the problem. Just a friendly tip...
