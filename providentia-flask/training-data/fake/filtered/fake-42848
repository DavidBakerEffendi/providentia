I am particularly fond of the pasta dishes. The sauces are always scrumptuous. My husband really enjoys the variety of veal dishes offered. We were there last week for my birthday and to celebrate we indulged with a decadent caramel cake...Yummy!!! On the weekend, they have live piano music which is always a pleasure. The only negative to me are the wall decorations...they definitely are outdated.
