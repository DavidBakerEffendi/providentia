My husband and I love this place !!  We especially enjoy the falafels and gyros.  We don't live close, but always head there for a low key, enjoyable night with great food !!  The salads are as fresh as they can get and the greek salad is superb.  The owners and the staff are personable and always welcome you back within the second visit.
