Mixed feelings, the food was ok.  Several people with our party tried the Dozer Challenge.  That was disappointing.  One person was able to finish but the restaurant didn't have any T-Shirts on hand that they advertise.  Your name is supposed to go on a placque but they say they wait until the end of the year to add names.  However I didn't even see a placque with any names on it from previous years????
