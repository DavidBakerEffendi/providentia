Rizzutos is my favorite Italian restaurant in the Farmington/west Hartford area. The food is always delicious!!! Waitstaff is very friendly and we have always had good service, even on packed nights that we've sat in the bar. The funny thing about this place is that no matter how busy it is, we never wait a long time. We either get lucky and get a table or sneak in at a bar table. Awesome food, drinks, and atmosphere!
