They say New York has the best pizza restaurants in the USA and so we decided to go to Lombardi's. This place has received over 2200 yelp reviews..WOW ! And it didnt disappoint. We had the Margherita pizza and it was the best ive ever had. I didnt give it a 5 star only because the wait was long (45 mins) and the place was so cramped. But if you're in NYC, you should come here for their pizza.
