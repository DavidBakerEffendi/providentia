I've stopped in for drinks before, but I bought a Groupon and decided to actually come in for dinner. Sat at the bar for a drink before we sat at a table. I must say I miss the bartenders they used to have. Service at the bar wasn't good at all. Finally sat at our table. Groupon or not...it wasn't worth it. Service was awful, staff seemed annoyed. No one came back to check on us. How can any server expect a good tip when you can't even find them to ask for another drink or extra napkins. I won't be back.
