I started coming here over the summer, and have always had a great experience.  The food is absolutely delicious, and there is a wide variety to choose from. The service is great, and everyone is really friendly.  Recently, we had a family party of over 30 here, and they were very accommodating to us. The bar is also a great place to go with a few friends.  The bar has a good crowd, and the outdoor dining area/patio is great during the summer/fall nights.  Last week I tried out their Sunday football, and they had great deals, and of course excellent pizza and wings.  Strongly recommend if you're looking for good food, service and atmosphere.
