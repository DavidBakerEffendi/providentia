The restaurant's Decor is eye catching, but I have to say the food was not good at all, my husband and I will never return, we both ordered the Cesar salad, and the salad was very warm and wilted, with hardly any dressing on it!!!! we both ordered two different types of brick oven pizza, first of all it was not brick oven, the dough was just flour and water, which makes it very crispy like a brick oven, there was hardly any toppings on the pizza, very small!!!! and when my husband asked for Pizza  Margherita , they gave him napoleon style pizza, he asked why was the pizza like a regular pizza and they stated that is Margherita pizza, Margherita pizza is with fresh roma tomatoes and fresh mozzarella cheese sliced with basil!!!!!   I asked for the Vegetarian Pizza, and all there was was very little melted cheese and maybe one mushroom sliced very tiny on the pizza, they should be embarrassed to even serve something like that!!!!!!!Will Not be Returning!!!!
