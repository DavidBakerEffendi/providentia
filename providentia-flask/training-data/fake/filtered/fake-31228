The food was good, but this restaurant had about the worst service of any place I've visited in NYC.  At first things were fine, although the waiter politely refused to get us a round of drinks for dessert because they were closing soon (a disappointment as it was Friday night around 10pm, although not unreasonable).  Then things spiraled out of control when we got our check.  We gave a meager but not outrageously low tip (10%) because our waiter wasn't terribly attentive and we had to call over other wait-staff a few times.  He freaked out and loudly demanded to know why we were giving him such a poor tip.  The conversation didn't go so well, and he started yelling at us to call attention from the rest of the patrons in the still fairly-full bar.  "Look at these people, who gave ME only a 10% tip! they obviously need the money more than I do!" and when I told him off (still fairly politely) he shouted "get out!  you're not welcome here anymore!  don't come back, mother f**kers!  so long mother f**kers!".   Mind you, they were close to closing, but there were plenty of customers still in the restaurant, many of whom looked mortified.  We certainly won't be returning.  My advice: sit at the bar, and get the food to go.  Who knows, maybe you'll get a show while you wait.
