Brunch here is always worth the wait.  The appetizer of fresh pastries and breads is enough to fill you for brunch, but of course then you;d be missing out on the fresh fruit, brioche french toast or sour cream hazelnut waffles, dependent on your tasting preference-- all of which are to die for!  The scene can be chaotic but is usually fun and once you settle into your seat you can easily people watch - I love the table in the "center-back" corner, its the best to for a little intimacy but to still be part of the scene. Pros: Fantastic food,  decent service and usually one or two people that you actually want to run in to! Cons: Can be over-crowded and have a bit of a wait- but where in NY doesn't if it's good?
