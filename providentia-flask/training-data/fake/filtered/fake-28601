I walked in here thinking I would see the cooks preparing the salads and sandwiches right in front of my eyes but I was sadly mistaken... I didn't think the salads were ready-made and for almost $10, the kale superfood salad was a little overpriced but it was delicious. The roasted sweet potatoes (as many of you have commented) are indeed AMAZING. The lemon tahini dressing was light yet flavourful and the chickpeas and quinoa (though bland and small) were nice additions. Since I'm pescatarian, not vegan, I had to eat my salad alongside some real eggs because it wasn't enough. Next time I'm there, I'll have to try the smoothies because they look fantastic! If you're looking for a quick lunch, definitely go grab a salad to eat along with something else.
