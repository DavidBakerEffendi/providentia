My husband and I don't usually go out for RW, but this time around we figured we would try it out.  We arrived at Xochitl a couple mins early and were informed by the host that our table wasn't quite ready.  She invited us to wait at the bar with Kate and Joe.  As soon as we were seated, we had drink menus in front of us and Kate recommended a spicy margarita to kick off the night (don't remember the name of it but it was delicious.).  After enjoying our first round, we decided to just stay at the bar and do RW there.  We had such a great time.  The food was great and VERY filling.  The staff was very helpful with whatever we needed.  We will definitely be back to see what their regular menu is like.
