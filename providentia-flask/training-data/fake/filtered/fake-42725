Well I went and tried Elixers and was very disappointed.   I order the Filet mignon for $21 it had a nice taste but not worth $21.  The menu is limited to what they offer. Than I tried the yin-yang  for dessert took one bite and couldn't get rid of the awful taste.  The waitress asked if I wanted to take it home and and I told her she could throw it away. It is one one of the worse tasting desserts I have ever tasted.  The other desserts didn't even sound good. This is one place I will not go to again or send anyone to. I'm a pastry chef by trade so I know good desserts when I taste one.
