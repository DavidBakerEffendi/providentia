Tonight, my wife and I decided to give Bistro Mediterranean and Tapas Bar a try. Let me say that it was one of the most enjoyable dining experiences we have had in many years. The staff was attentive, polite, and professional. The decor was elegant but not overbearing. The tables were not crowded upon each other, and the overall atmosphere was relaxing and pleasant. Glasses were clean - no spots. Silverware was clean and polished -no food. Linens were clean and crisp. Now let's get to the cuisine. In a word: fabulous! Having been a waiter for over 15 years, I can safely say that everything we ordered was extremely fresh, and professionally prepared. No hacks here. The tapas were delicious and generously plated - no skimping whatsoever. The pear salad was refreshing, crisp and saporific. The fish was beautifully prepared - not over nor undercooked - and perfectly seasoned. Pasta was cooked slightly past al dente (i.e. perfect). The caramelized bananas dessert was beautifully plated and was a perfect way to end our evening. I can't say enough about this restaurant. But what I can say is that we will definitely be back again, and again, and again. Â Congratulations Leonardo and staff on Bistro Mediterranean & Tapas Bar's upcoming 2 year anniversary. We wish you continued success for many more years to come.
