I've been to this location a few times and absolutely love this place. I have severe dairy allergies and Han's does not use dairy in their food. It feels great knowing I can order anything from the menu without having to stop by he emergency room. Everything I've tasted so far has been great, my favorite dishes are the green beans, the spicy cucumbers, and the seared lamb. The food is delicious, the service is great, and it has a great ambiance.
