Went to Rats for Easter Brunch,big mistake, the price of 59 per person was not warranted. I have had better Easter buffets at thr Hilton for half the price. The food was sparse for a buffet and there was total chaos trying to figure out where the line started,since they served the buffet in the kitchen .Let me explain, the kitchen is circular and the buffet line seemed to start at all ends.The actual buffet consisted of 2 pasta dishes ,leg of lamb with plenty of fat and gristle,some rare pork loin, cheap smoked salmon ,bagels, some shrimp.The desserts were nothing to write home about either. Overall this may have been good at 29-35 per person,but at these prices this restaurant has plenty of nerve ,or they think the general public will accept this sort of food because they dont know better. This is the type of establishment that gives restaurants a bad reputation,I for one will not return. The restaurant needs a new staff and menu or maybe turn it into an art gallery.
