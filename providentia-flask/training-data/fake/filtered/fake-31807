The Divy is a dive bar in Princeton with cheap drinks and people.  Toothless townies by day and unruly mobs at night. Greasy redneck comfort food, such as possum 'a 'gratin, though under priced,is not worth the discount.  Most if not all of the bartenders are douche bags--especially the bald, menacing Canadian and the overweight owner.
