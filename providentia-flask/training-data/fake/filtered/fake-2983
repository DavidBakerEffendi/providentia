I love going here in the Summer, when you can sit outside in the courtyard.  The food is delicious, just wish they served alcohol.  Street parking can be difficult, but well worth any trouble.  The decor is totally out of 1950's Havana, makes me think of Ricky Ricardo.  All in all a really fun place.
