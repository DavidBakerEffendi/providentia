Getting into a debate about pizza with someone can be just as dangerous as opening up a discussion about religion or politics...it is something that can lead to a huge argument. But when we decide we want pizza...there is usually no debate about where we're headed. And we'll defy anyone to show us if there is any better pizza than the square pizzas at L&B Spumoni Gardens in Brooklyn , N.Y. This place is simply iconic. It has been around for generations and continues to be as popular as it ever was. During the warmer weather, the lines for pizza and their famous spumoni can be winding around the large area of picnic-style tables which are always packed. And during the colder months, there are always people vying for a table inside the pizzeria which is separate from the more formal restaurant. We can never get enough of the pizza...which explains why we recently went for dinner and drove back over the two bridges the very next day to get more for lunch. And, of course, you can't leave without finishing it all off with the best spumoni you will ever find. This place is frequented by the locals...and it is also revisited often by those who have moved away. During our last visit someone said that they traveled a great distance to bring their family for dinner because, "You just can't find this kind of pizza and dessert any place else. It makes you feel like you are home." Hmmm...he is so right. Visit the Karmin Kuisine Tour at our website or on Facebook.
