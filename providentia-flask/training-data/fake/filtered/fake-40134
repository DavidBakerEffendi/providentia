As a New Yorker, born and raised, I have gotten the chance to have pizza from MANY places here. This place is NOT worth the 1 hour wait. Â I think most people like it not because it's good (it's average) but because of the affordability. (A large pie is only $14) However, based on reviews, the "second" best pizza in Brooklyn right after Grimaldis (since New York has the best pizza in the country, I will say this is the "second" best place in the country!), Di Fara Pizza on Ave J, had MUCH more taste. The prices there are ridiculous but it's VERY tasty. I'd take Long Island Pizza over Grimaldi's any day. (Long Island has great pizza as well!)
