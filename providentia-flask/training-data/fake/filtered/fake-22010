Short line on a rainy day in Philadelphia...also at like 2pm. I ended up getting the Cheeseteak Wit & Provolone. I love provolone so definitely was the cheese of my choice. The meat was juicy, but again - the sandwiches was huge. How can a person finish that and sides - like fries? Too much food for me. I chose Pat's over Geno's since I read my friend's reviews and it appeared they liked it better. Since I was only had one meal dedicated to cheesesteaks, I decided to choose the one of my friends favorites. The food comes out a lot faster than I thought it would have. Since it was slow, the person at the register was probably a bit nicer than it would have been if it was busy. Also you know, a girl by herself. Overall, good experience and next time I would have liked to do a cheesesteak-off between the two places.
