VEGETARIANS BEWARE!!!!!!!!!! My boyfriend and I are regulars to the State Street location and usually very satisfied.  They are fast, reasonably priced and good.  But tonight we had one of the worst experiences ever. We ordered our usual, which is vegetable chimichangas with everything (meaning rice, black beans, guac and pico de gallo) hot sauce and sour cream and beef chimichangas with everything except no sour cream or hot sauce. Where it went wrong... my boyfriend eats no poultry, beef or pork..I eat almost anything except I HATE sour cream and like spice but not hot sauce.  We got 2 containers, one marked with a "B" and the other unmarked. The one marked with a "B"  was the vegetable and the unmarked was beef with no hot sauce or sour cream. Unfortunately,  for us the unmarked one had beef with hot sauce and sour cream and my boyfriend didn't realize until a few bites in that it had meat. He hasn't put red meat in his body in 25 yrs, so of course this made him sick. Upset, since now neither of us have dinner I called to rectify the problem.  The person who answered spoke very little english, so trying to explain the problem was an issue. I asked if there was anyone who spoke english and he put me on with someone.  This gentleman told me thats how I ordered it and kept responding with "yeah?" ...So, after a very frustrating few minutes and no offer to comp our meal, remake it right or offer us a comp on our next visit, I told him he just lost a once a week customer. WE WILL NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN OR RECOMMEND THIS PLACE TO ANYONE!!!! They would've recieved a four star reveiw otherwise.
