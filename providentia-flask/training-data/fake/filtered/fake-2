This was the worst experience I've ever had a casual coffee/light fare place.  The server disappeared for 20 minutes, just talking to his friend by the window as my girlfriend and I sat dumbfounded that this dude had the nerve to do that on the job.  We're trying to make eye contact, but clearly getting paid to talk to his bud was more important to him. My girlfriend went up to the counter once the server disappeared into the back for another 5 minutes (what is this guy doing?) and asked if she should order food up there or something.  The girl at the counter gives her a weird look and just says "I'll get your server."  When they arrive from the back, they look over at our table and have a laugh.  Yeah, leaving us hanging for half-a-goddamn hour at a place with only two other customers is not funny - but in retrospect, your collective incompetence and false sense of entitlement certainly was. The food was okay.  For a place called "toast," I'd figured the bread would be better, but it was just cold Le Bus.  Additionally, I'm 95% sure the "andouille" in my special was just a link of the pre-packaged offering from Trader Joe's cut into four pieces.  $9 for unapologetic mediocrity will not be happening again. Avoid this place like the plague.  I almost didn't leave a tip, and honestly I shouldn't have.  I felt the buyer's remorse all day.  What a disgrace.
