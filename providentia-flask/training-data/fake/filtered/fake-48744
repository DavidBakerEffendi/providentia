First visit as I received a promo card in the snail mail. Went for early bird special--$19.95 for 3 courses. I ordered from that menu--"lump crab cakes" which came with absolutely A+ buttery whipped potatoes and green beans which were also A+. HOWEVER, the lump in the crab cakes was missing!!! Simply put, it was crab meat that was from the least expensive part of a crab, and "saucey".  As their prices on their regular menu/wine list are PRICEY and the restaurant is rated as "the Best of Bucks" 2013. Lump crab cakes should be made with lump crab barely held together by the other ingredients .I was very disappointed and "put off". I expressed my estimation of the crab cakes to the waiter and he asked me if I wanted another entrée, but I declined in my disappointment as well as my dining partners would have to wait for me as I would receive it later. I did try a partner's dish of pork loin over sweet whipped potatoes and would have to say the sweet potatoes were A+ but the pork loin too well done--to the point that it had a slight burned taste--however as she likes her meat very well done, she was pleased. I am 58 years young and have never bothered to write a review on any business, but as I become more experienced in life I do feel the need to share my experiences for others.  I do hope The Yardley Inn the best and mostly that they get/serve a new authentic LUMP crab cake recipe which would call for lump crab meat!
