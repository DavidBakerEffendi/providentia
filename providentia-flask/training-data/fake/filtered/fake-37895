While I think the food is very good, the service is always mediocre and the prices are excessive. We like the concept of this restaurant - that it supports local farms - but four of us went out for dinner and had two apps and four entrees. No one had more than two drinks, yet the bill was through the roof. There are many other nice restaurants in and around Hartford and New Haven, that in my opinion, are better at the same price point.
