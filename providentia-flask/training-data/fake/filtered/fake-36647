Staff consists of rude hipsters who look annoyed they need to provide a service for the customers. The food is creative and good enough, but I ordered a veggie dog, they gave me a regular hot dog, I politely complained to the waiter, he argued with me and wouldnt take it back and promised me it was a veggie. Bit into it, it was a real hot dog so I got the manager involved. He took care of me, but I will not go there again. I'd rather eat somewhere else and not get mean mugged by Macklemore clones the whole time I'm there. I hope LeSean left only a $.20 tip, because my experience warranted NO TIP.
