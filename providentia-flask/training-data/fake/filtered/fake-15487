All of the food tasted the same, was too salty, and was cold, despite how good it looks.  It costs way too much for what it is, and when I tried to bring a cold soup back I was ignored by the woman at the counter.  The soup was over sweetened and lukewarm.  Avoid this place.  There are great restaurants in Burlington, and this one has no place among them.
