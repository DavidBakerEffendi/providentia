Perfect place to have good drinks[A+ for drinks] and eat good food [Bartenders actually listen to your problems lol]. kickass happy hour until 10pm. Although I love this place, if you don't get there before 8:30-9pm on Thurs, Fri, Saturdays, don't bother going there will be nowhere to sit or stand. BUT as soon as happy hour is over at 10pm people start to leave and more space opens up.
