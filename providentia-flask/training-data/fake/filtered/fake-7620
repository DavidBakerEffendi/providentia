i would never, ever go there or order delivery from this place again.  first:  the breakfast sandwich is so tiny, i have never seen one this small! second:  don't order delivery because they wont charge you the prices on their menu, they will definitely charge you more for every item!  i ordered 2 egg sandwiches and two coffees and got charged 16.50.  on the menu it says the coffee costs 99 cents (that's the only option) - however, they elected to send us the large size for $2.  they also charged us $3.50 for delivery to bayonne and the menu says delivery is $2. - when i called the mgr to ask the charges be explained (the receipt doesn't have a break down of charges) - i was told my receipt has a break down and they didn't have time to explain. i called back and the manager hung up on me - i also heard the manager raising his voice at an employee while they had me on hold- terrible business and they don't even deserve one star! this was a compete waste of my money!
