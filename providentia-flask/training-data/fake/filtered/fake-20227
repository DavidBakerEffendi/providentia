great atmosphere, hidden gem in Philly. Â drink specials and good beer. also a lot of great food that seems to have a southern twist (think soul food inspired). I love hamburgers but i had the black bean burger and it was super good, yum! place is somewhat small; I was there on a weekday...might get crowded on weekends :)
