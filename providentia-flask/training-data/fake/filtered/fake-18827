What is going on with this place??? I would have normally given them 5 stars.  But the last time I went here Sam wasn't there and the food was so-so.  I brought a friend with me and after they heard all I boosted they were extremely disappointed. I had to agree with them.  I have been coming here since the 90s and this place use to rock.  Where is Sam - did he leave???  OOOh sooo sad if he did - no more good veggie chinese food in Philly anymore.  They better get their act together and find Sam or get him to come back and instruct them. But maybe you just can't learn what Sam had??
