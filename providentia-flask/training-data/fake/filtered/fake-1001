This place is probably a prime example of what happens when you open up a business w/out competition. The first time I went to this restaurant was the day it opened. This was located in Langhorne-- and it was probably the only time I found them to be good. I went there again (before they closed and moved), the food was nothing like the first time. Some items were still good though so not a complete loss. After they closed and moved else where, I went again to this new location and food was slightly more awful with even less items good this time. Finally I went to their THIRD location today (and there's something's to be said about a place when it keeps closing and moving somewhere else) and the food is all in all awful. And I don't mean to exxagerrate but good Lord.. If I burnt my money, I probably would be more satisfied than eating this monstrosity in the name of food. Rice is w/out-- WITHOUT, NOT with little, salt. Salad with everything mushed in and soggy. Microwaved bread which is at least a day old... I'm pretty sure I will not be going to their fourth location.
