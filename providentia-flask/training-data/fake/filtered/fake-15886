Stopped by this place while I was in NJ and I have to say I was impressed. I got the curry chicken and rice and it was one of the most flavorful experiences that my mouth has ever had the pleasure of having. The hot and sour soup was also amazing and I only wish I wasn't so full so I could have had more. If I'm ever in the area again I'll definitely have to stop by this hidden gem.
