I came here because it is a popular spot for breakfast/brunch, but it was really packed. We had a larger group, and the wait ended up being around an hour fifteen to a half. When it was our time to sit, they had to squeeze us at a smaller table, so it was an inconvenience to have since it was a tight. I got the green shakshuka, which was okay, and the greek salad, which was good. The food was overall okay, and the place itself was pretty and clean. However, it does take a time commitment to go because it seems the wait times can be unpredictable.
