What can I say,we love Michaels Pastaria in Nutley and then we heard they were also opening in Caldwell which is closer for us. We tried Angeloni's on Friday, we came back with our other friends on Saturday and we came back with other friends on Sunday. Needless to say, the food is great, the people that run and work in Angeloni's are great. We now have a place close to home to go to with friends. Although it was a little loud there, you knew everybody was happy with their meals. Another nice feature, it is a bring your own bottle so you don't spend a lot on drinks. I've never been disappointed with a meal here so maybe we'll see you there some day. Â Ron - Montville
