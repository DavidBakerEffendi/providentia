I just love this place and it's become my local haunt. The food is consistently excellent, very fresh and creative. I also appreciate the small and friendly atmosphere and the owners and staff are so very accommodating. I had my first ever raw kale and chicory salads there that were so awesome, I asked the chef what he did! The wines are wonderful too and prices are very fair so you don't break the bank. I often see regulars so that's always a great sign too.
