A++ for atmosphere. That's It! I can't give a full review of the food because my husband and our two friends never had the opportunity to order our entree & dessert. WHY??? Because we waited 2 hours to attempt to place our dinner order and eventually gave up. We were lucky enough to catch the servers attention (very difficult) to order some appetizers (small portions) and ended up leaving hungry & very disappointed. What could have turned into a fun and enjoyable night out with friends, actually turned into a long and drawn out evening in hopes of having something to eat. I do have to honestly say that it was not entirely his fault. It was obvious that the restaurant was under staffed and in addition to actually doing their job, the staff has to bang drums every 15 min or so. I guess it's more worth it to the owner that the servers bang on drums than to actually ensure the clientele is satisfied. Speaking of the owner...The owner was just standing in the corner of the room looking at the crowd. Not once did we notice him lend a hand to his staff or working the room/customers. He seemed more concerned with adjusting the lighting. The only positive outcome was on our pockets!  Due to the lack of service we ended up spending about $15 per couple.  I guess this making money is not a concern for this business.
