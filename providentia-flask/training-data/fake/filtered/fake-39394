Lovely, comforting little place and absolutely delicious Ramen. I'm a huge fan/ eat Ramen all around the city and Brooklyn, and this was one of the best. I tried the chicken broth when I usually have pork, and was worried the chicken would be too dry but it was fantastic-- delicate flavor, delicious, satisfying. And I love the aesthetic of the place-- also, incredibly friendly waitstaff and the owner was checking on all the tables. It was a nice place to eat alone or would be fun with a group. I might be going back tonight.
