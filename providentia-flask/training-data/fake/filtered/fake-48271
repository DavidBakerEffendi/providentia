OMG! I do love Pomme Frites. A friend took me there, and I never regretted for a moment. Best fries I've had since the paranoid health Nazi's and weight bigots dictated that everyone should have fries in tasteless low-fat oils (the B**tards). I've not been in quite some time, wish they had a Syracuse branch, LOL. As for complaints about mayo, I guess some of you aren't aware that this is more or less a Belgan restaurant, and Belgians (and the Dutch and others in Europe) mainly have their fries with mayo (Or if British, with vinegar & salt). Ketchup is purely an American thing when it comes to fries.
