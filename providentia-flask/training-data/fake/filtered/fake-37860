The restaurant owner & staff are all very friendly & make you feel cozy & warm, like a fireside chat! The food is better than what you would expect considering the low prices. Friday & Saturday karaoke nights are a lot of fun & entertaining even if you don't sing! Starlite is a little diamond in the rough that honestly, will surprise you how fun it is!
