SpOt came and catered our Olympics party on friday night.  Could not have been happier with the food and the service.  Simply the best burger ever!  All the feed back was positive, especially from one guest who enjoyed 4, yes 4 burgers.  Will definitely be in touch about future parties.  Thanks Josh.
