I really like this place! After walking up and down St Marks Place looking for somewhere to get cheap, good food, my friends and I decided to give this a shot and I'm so glad we did! The sliders were delicious and pretty filling. As for the location it self, very cool decor, nice, laid back vibe, awesome art on the wall. Staff was super-friendly too. It was a little cramped, but really, what can you expect in the city? Â Overall a great find for anyone looking for cheap, delicious food. Will visit again next time I'm in the area!
