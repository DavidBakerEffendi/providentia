This place is great.  We went there to try some new beers that we had never had before and they definitely delivered.  They have an awesome selection and the prices are reasonable, especially considering the quality of beer you are getting.   I would have gone and given this place 5 stars but unfortunately our night ended with an unpleasant experience.  We had ordered a round at last call and at 2:05 we had just finished up and were about to head out.  Just as we are preparing to leave the woman who had been sitting next to us the entire night to our surprise came up and began clearing our glasses off the table.  At this point I wasn't sure if she worked there or not so I was a bit confused but thanked her for taking the glasses.  She rudely responded by telling us that it was after two o'clock and we needed to leave.  I hate being rushed out of a place and we were only there 5 minutes after close.  Not to mention there were still plenty of other patrons in the bar who were not being pressured to leave.   Despite that one hiccup the place was great, the bar tender was very friendly and knowledgeable about the beer selection and helped us pick out a draft that would suite our individual tastes.
