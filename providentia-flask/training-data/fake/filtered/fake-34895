Awful!!! No stars would have been my choice. Used to be good but 4 of us recently went and will never return. As a native New Yorker and former downtown resident, I used to go there fairly regularly. Service was super rude to the point of me writing to the GM. He "invited" us back but I won't spend a dime for abysmal service - you don't have to either with so many excellent places to eat!
