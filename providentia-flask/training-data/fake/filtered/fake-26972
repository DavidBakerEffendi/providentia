First I'll tell you why this restaurant ought to get a 4 star review from me. The sandwiches and burgers are great, the service is quick, the selection of other stuff to go with it is large and of high quality, etc. etc. But it's a three star because the fries, especially the cajun fries, are so uneven. Sometimes they are fantastic; often they are a soggy mess. If there is one thing I can't stand it is soggy, ugly fries, and from Kountry Kart I get stuck with them on a semi-regular basis. Same is true for either delivery or pickup. This week I got a burger and a large basket of cajun fries; by the time I got to the waterfront (a short walk) to eat them, the fries were inedible. It was a sad day.
