Probably the best wine bar in new York City. The plates were not huge, so sharing seemed the thing which was really fun to do. The chesse plate is lovely and comes out so nicely plated -they do a great job with presentation. We got several cheeses and then a few appetizers and then an entre to share so we could taste a little of everything. The service was a little slow but we didn??t really care because we had such great food.
