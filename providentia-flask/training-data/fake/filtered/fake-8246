The food was quite good but the noise and service was deafening and dismal. It's one on those "Who ordered the " places that doesn't record your order by seat so it's aguesing game when it arrives. Some dishes were cleared before eveyone was finished. All the desserts came on one plate to be passed around and scraped off. Never again.
