I've been to Cafe Henri twice - once for dessert with the extended family and the other time for brunch with the husband. Â Both times were splendid. This is definitely now our go to place for brunch. The Eggs Benedict were amazing and so were the potatoes that came with it. The Benedicts were perfectly executed. It's a must try. Dessert wise, I tried several of their crepes and I think I tried a lemon tart there, can't quite remember. Nevertheless, the desserts were delicate and delicious. My favorite was the rich chocolate crepe but even their plain butter crepe was yummy. The place has a very cosy and relaxed ambience but there are times when it gets really packed since its a pretty same joint. I like reading the magazines they have displayed while waiting for our food to arrive. It's somewhat relaxing. Looking forward to visiting again soon and maybe try some of the other dishes they offer for brunch. Look out for Henri's small picture on the wall. It summarizes the place completely - cute
