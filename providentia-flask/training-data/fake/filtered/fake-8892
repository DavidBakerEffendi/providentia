We were there twice for lunch buffet (great price, just 3.99 per person). Selection from approx 10-12 dishes, nice, fresh, some of them hot, others warm enough. We were satisfied, it is OK for occasionally eating. Crispy fries. I would like to see there plain rice or something that is not so typically chinese oily...
