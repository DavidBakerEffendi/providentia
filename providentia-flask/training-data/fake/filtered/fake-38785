Incredibly nice people, especially the woman behind the counter. Incredibly mediocre food. Â Vegan chili seemed to be nothing more than luke warm beans in some kind of tasteless watery broth stuff. The Veggie Taco Salad seemed to be the Vegan Chili dumped on iceberg lettuce. C'mon - really? But they really are nice people - just need to rethink their offerings.
