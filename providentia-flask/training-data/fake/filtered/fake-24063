Because it is so highly rated, a group of us went here to celebrate a great friend who is getting married.  We brought champagne (it's a BYOB restaurant) and had plans for a wonderful evening.  In many ways it was, but no meal - especially not an expensive celebration - should be followed by mice joining you for dessert!  As we finished our dinner, a mouse scurried across the floor and made a number of laps around the room for the next few minutes.  I am inclined to forgive as these things unfortunately happen, but what was unforgivable is the way the management handled the situation.  In a completely unapologetic tone, they tried to explain it away as if it was a normal course of events.  It seemed as if the mice were regular guests and the management had become desensitized to it.  I dread to think what was deemed acceptable in the kitchen if the dining room was treated with such disregard!  I will not return to this restaurant ever again.  We went to Spraga the next evening and had a wonderful - and rodent free - evening and meal.
