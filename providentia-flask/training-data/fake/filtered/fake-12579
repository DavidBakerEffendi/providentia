This was just put in very recently and I have to say this has got to be the best sushi place in the area already. It's a very clean and friendly environment that welcomes even at first glance. The sushi itself is very delicious and you can taste the freshness in every bite. The price is in a good range for what it has to offer. And even does catering. In all if your looking for delicious sushi and a nice small place to chat with some friends, kenko is the way to go.
