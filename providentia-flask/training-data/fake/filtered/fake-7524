This place is a joke. Nothing special. Generic bar with nothing setting it apart from the rest. So crowded that you couldn't move around whatsoever. With the exception of the front door bouncer (who was reasonable and able-minded), the rest of the alleged "security," staff were overzealous and in the patrons faces. Many of the people in the bar were well dressed and there to have a good time, but others, unfortunately looked borderline homeless and were trash at best. I would NOT recommend this poor excuse for a bar to anyone. Waste of time and money.
