I was in on a Wednesday night  and it was packed!! My friend suggested making a reservation and thank god i did!! We ordered bunch of rolls to share and my favorite was King Kong roll.  The fish inside was so fresh and the portion was big! The spicy tuna roll had big chunks of flavorful tuna.  I ate so many spicy tunas everywhere and this one was the best!! And I mean the BEST! Their spicy mayo tastes really good too.  Unlike the typical siracha mixed with mayo flavor (which I can make it at home), it had so much depth to it. The place can get loud and crowded, but the fast friendly service seem to compensate for it. The servers greet you with a smile and they try to be as accommodating as possible.   The price is a little higher than the other sushi restaurants but the quality is truly the best!
