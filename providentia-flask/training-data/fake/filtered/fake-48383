Food was great in taste and size. Cashier who was skinny, with beard was extremely rude. He had no manners in regards to how he spoke to me and what he said. I am out of town and I was having Â a bit of a hard time ordering and I told him this and he told me that he didn't care if I was out of town or not and that I should know what I am getting. So food was good and service was bad. On the other hand the cook at Pat's was real nice and helped me out with my order.
