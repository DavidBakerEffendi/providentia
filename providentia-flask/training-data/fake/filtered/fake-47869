The service is horrible--snotty young kids who make a number of mistakes (like forgetting to put in my order!) and then even have an attitude about their mistakes.  Their fried calamari is decent.  Their marghuerita pizza is awful.  Made me sick so I threw away what was left of it.  Too bad.  This area needs a good Italian restaurant--but they ain't it.
