Great place. Keywords: quick, cheap, friendly, and most importantly, DELICIOUS. Quick: I've been in and out within 3 minutes (not calling ahead), no joke. Don't let the quick time fool you, the food is fresh. the spindle of gyro meat is waiting to be cut and is top-notch. Cheap: $6 for a fantastic meal. Good luck beating that Friendly: The owners are very friendly, down-to-earth, and easy to talk to (and always there). DELICIOUS: words don't do this place justice. go check it out for yourself. you will not be disappointed.
