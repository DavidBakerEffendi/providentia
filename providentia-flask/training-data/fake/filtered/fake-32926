This is one of the best restaurants I have had the pleasure of visiting in NYC, hands down. The food is so perfectly presented you almost don't want to mess it up by eating it, but when you finally dig in, everything tastes as amazing as it looks. The duck and the pork belly are both insanely good. I have been here three times now, and I really love the service, the ambiance, and the bourbon-heavy cocktail list. I try a couple bourbons I have never had each time I visit. Make reservations if you're going at prime time because this place fills up! and have dessert... absolutely worth it.
