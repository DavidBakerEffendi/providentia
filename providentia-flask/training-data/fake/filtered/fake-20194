I haven't written a review about this place because then everyone else will go there and discover that it's perfectly perfect which will lead to a longer table wait for me.  But I have a motive for writing this review (See 3rd paragraph). What do I crave? The pretzel with gobs of butter, the cocktails,  Emmentaler stuffed sausage, the Austrian meatballs, white asparagus month, exhaustive schnapps selection... the silly weinerman prints in the bathroom. I can't fault the place but what I love most about Cafe Katja is the superlatively awesome duo of Amanda and Katja.  Bring them back together for at least for one day a week.  Them, the food and ambience represents some of my best dining experiences in all of New York; certainly the warmest in NYC.
