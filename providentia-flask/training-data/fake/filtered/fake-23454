I will agree with the previous post: the ceviche was good but did not come with enough chips :(  The red sangria was pretty decent, although it could have been stronger.  For the entree, I ordered the pollo con camarones.  I personally love tostones (fried green plantains) so a dish that incorporates that will win me over any day!  I really liked the dish, especially the flavorful rice, tostones, shrimp and the sauce.  Unfortunately, I did not touch the chicken since I was too full.  Overall, a good dish for the price.
