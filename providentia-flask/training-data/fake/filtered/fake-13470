The food was delicious. My friend said her salad was the best she had ever eaten. My tomato and cheese sandwich was marvelous. The coffee cup is enormous, almost a bowl. The service was efficient and friendly, especially so because it was very busy. . The price was surprisingly low. I can see why it is crowded. Had we not arrived  unfashionably early  it would have been difficult to find a table.
