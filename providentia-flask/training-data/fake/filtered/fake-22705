Had dinner tonight at Frankie's -- first experience and definitely memorable! Beet and avocado salad was delicious, and I'd highly recommend the sausage and cavatelli. Â My wife had the Panna Cotta dessert special which we're still talking about and the complimentary crostini were a big hit! Staff was incredibly accommodating and service was top notch. Would highly recommend this restaurant and will definitely make a return trip from Manhattan -- the UWS is not that far from 357 Court St and well worth the effort.
