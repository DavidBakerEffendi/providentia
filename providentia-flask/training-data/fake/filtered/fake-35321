Yesterday, we mistakenly had the Brontasuarus Rib, the Pulled Pork, the Brisket, fries and 2 beers. Outrageous total was over $60! The beers were crisp and cold and then it was ALL down hill from there. They charged us for 2 fries and brought 3 to the table so that was annoying but then they refunded the mistake plus a bit more so that was helpful. HOWEVER: When we ordered the Brontasaurus Rib they said it was 1 pound of meat though really, like the brisket, it was 1 pound of slimy FAT. The pulled pork was tasty, though also admittedly fatty. After we picked what we could from the fat pile (I have a photo) we got very sick (we both puked once each from this meal). The rib was under-cooked and along with the slimy fat did us in. Needless to say I do not recommend eating here if you value your time, money, stomach, and intestines.
