I went to Taverna Ouzo and had the same issue with the Groupon. I was told that they could not take the Groupon because of a system problem they reported to Groupon two weeks ago. They told me I should have received an email from Groupon and I never did. I contacted Groupon and I informed them what happened. They investigated the matter (I guess it was never reported before) and I received a refund of the purchase price. I guess this establishment decided that they don't need to promote their establishment anymore because patrons actually are paying full prices. Â I have eaten at Taverna Ouzo before without a Groupon, and the food is overpriced. The Groupon was worth it!!!
