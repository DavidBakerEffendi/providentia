The food is good. The people are friendly.But for some reason NO One there can get an order correct. This may seem simple to most but when a customer asks for a pizza not to be cut the pizza should not be CUT. When confronted about this on not one, not two, but three different times I get the same ole same ole answer "Well its unusual to not cut a pizza" This is a simple request and has gone ignored THREE times. OK so you guys are doing well and most likely wont miss one persons business. Best of luck to you. NEVER AGAIN ! Once shame on me Twice shame on you Three times LATER ! ! !
