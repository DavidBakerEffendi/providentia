This was the first time and the last time I'll be going here. A group of us went for a friend's birthday on a weekend afternoon at around 330 and we were seated at 345. So "supposedly" the lunch prices are good before 4 pm, which is fine since we were there BEFORE 4. They even gave us the lunch menus. But when we started off by ordering drinks they asked for our I.D. and took forever to look at it. So long in fact that by the time they gave them back to us it was already 4 pm. You would think that since we were seated before 4, and even given LUNCH menus that they would honor their lunch prices. Oh, but that was definitely not the case at this "classy" place. They literally took all of our lunch menus BACK and gave us the dinner menus. What kind of restaurant does that? Ridiculous. I really feel that they purposely took forever with our I.D.s so that we would have to pay dinner prices since we were a big group. On top of that, the service itself was terrible. It took forever for someone to come to order dessert and a friend of mine ordered a drink that never came. The food was alright, nothing spectacular. I was actually looking forward to this place after seeing all the good reviews but I was really disappointed.
