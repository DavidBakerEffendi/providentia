Palazzo's brings the dining experience to an unprecedented level in the Montclair area. I was invited by a business colleague to join a party of three out to dinner on a Friday night. Upon entering, we immediately took notice of a friendly staff, exotic smells of fresh pasta's and a live jazz band that was playing renditions of classic holiday songs. Our server was a clean cut gentleman, who made recommendations and answered questions with confidence and poise. I took his suggestions and opted for a "Calamari Balsamico" for an appetizer, followed by "Linguini ala Nostra" as my entree. The Calamari was an exciting twist to a culinary classic, and my Linguini was executed with perfection. Homemade blackened linguini with squid ink, an assortment of seafood in a marinara sauce! Palazzo's is the only restaurant in the area that can pull of this dish without sacrificing quality of food, nor quantity of the portion for such a modest price (Nineteen dollars!)  We ended our dining experience with Cappucino's - and shared a Chocolate Soufflé and Tiramisu; all prepared by the staff. My colleagues had spoke highly of Palazzos, exclaiming they have been coming back again and again for years. With one experience at this restaurant, I now understand why! Palazzo's genuinely makes you feel like family while you are dining. The staff seems to understand their customers, and have honest care and sense of professionalism while they work. I will most certainly return again.
