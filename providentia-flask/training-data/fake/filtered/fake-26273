O.K. First an admission. I'm a foodie and I don't care about the price if the food is mindblowingly fabulous. I have tried some of the other local Thai restaurants in the area and am consistently disappointed I wasted a meal by eating Thai food at someplace other than The Terrace. The cooking there is exquisite: an appetizer of succulent oysters in what resembles a crepe that has been lightly fried, fish dishes that could convince me to give up steak, specials of the day that come directly from their garden, and then, there's the terrace curry. The peppers are roasted, giving the dish this incredible depth of flavor, which unfortunately means my face is melting off since the peppers are simultaneously the source of some very intense heat (order this Thai hot if you can take it). I fantasize about this dish. The decor is very pleasant and yes, the owner/host seems to be a character (which is why I gave this place 4stars rather than 5. That, and this type of restaurant wouldn't garner a Michelin star) However, this restaurant serves some of the best food I have ever eaten. My reaction to hearing of the legal troubles of the owner was devastation I might never eat terrace curry again.
