Thursday night with a good friend at ll Pittore.  The Mexigroni mixed by Derek the bartender was unbelievable.  The service was good but over-attentive which seems to be the prevailing trend now.  We ordered the salted cod which was a perfectly portioned small plate and was delicious; it was topped with octopus and a delicate pickled onion that balanced the dish with its acidity. The Cacio peppe was al dente and very good as well. I am looking forward to going back!
