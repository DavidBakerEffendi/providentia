Can I get 1 more star please? This place is AWESOME...Did I say it was awesome. I had to plan my 30th bday party here at the last minute because of a mix-up at another club (Key Club Newark, NJ - Don't go there...anywhoo). Leroy, the manager, was awesome and so organized and professional. He emailed me the menu and then after choosing my food he emailed me a contract. He also followed up with a phone call to confirm my reservation. I love organized and professional people. The food was delicious...and my friends LOVED it. Drew, our waiter, was the "bestest" (I know that's not a word). They sliced my cake up for me and served it to my guests and they even provided candles (I forgot bday cake candles).  They serve their drinks in decent size glasses, not those lil' ranky dank glasses other establishments serve.  The music was great (diverse). If you are looking for a nice lil' spot just to hang with your friends this is definitely the place to go.
