I went there about two weeks ago on a Saturday.  It was about 2:30pm so the wait was short.  The Pho was really good and the steamed chicken was the best I've ever had. The service was good enough for me.  The place is small and outdated.  I used the restroom after the meal.  There was no paper towel or hand dryer in the restroom so I had to wipe my hands on my pants. If the owner cares about the customers and reads their comments, I have a couple suggestions: 1. install an air dryer or mount a paper towel roll holder as this is sanitary matter and it also shows some respect for your customers.  No matter how good your product or service is, it means nothing if you don't have customers. 2. Give customers some quality paper towels instead of the thin, folded napkins.  The chicken grease is very sticky and most people use their fingers to eat the chicken pieces.  After wiping your hands with the napkins, you'd certainly end up with the napkin pieces stubbornly adhered to your skin. I will definitely go back there again in the near future.
