Black Oven is one of my top places to go to dinner! I ordered my food to try for the first time, and I was so shocked, it was amazing. I love the thin, brick oven crust and the fresh mozzarella cheese they use. All of their food was fresh and perfectly made.The workers there were very polite and friendly and they suited me right away. The price was very great and fair. I am very glad that I have found this place to have a good quality dinner with my family. I will most definitely be going to the Black Oven again:)
