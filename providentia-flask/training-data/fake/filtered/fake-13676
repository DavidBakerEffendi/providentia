Meh. Just went here with some friends in the middle of the heat wave last week. Go on a temperate day because this place is tiny and has a hard time regulating the temperature.  The food was great but the service kinda stunk.  We were drenched in sweat and when asking for ice for our water got 1 small cup to share amongst 4 people. Boo!!  Also, Yelp says this place takes credit cards but thats not true... CASH ONLY! Again, food is great but the service was sorta awful and the place was uncomfortable.
