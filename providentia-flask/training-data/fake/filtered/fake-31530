So I was at blend on the water the other night with my beautiful mom. I gotta say I live in the area and was hopping for a great place not just to eat but to have great drink as well. They are doing a great job Felicia was my waiters she was the best she made my mom feel at home she loved her I was happy about that. The bartenders where great like Jessie she's always smiling. I feel like people don't give it the credit it deserves. If you live in the area come check it out great people great food and great drink. The arepas are to die for.
