I just read a review of this restaurant in the magazine, New Haven Living. The writer reviewed the food, but didn't mention the other side of a successful restaurant, and that is the Service! Bistro Mediterranean has a fabulous assortment of tapas and delicious entrees, very reasonably priced and accompanied by gracious hosts! The service is outstanding, the wine list appeals to all palates, and is within a realistic price range. The social atmosphere is only enhanced when the weather is right, and you can enjoy outdoor dining. The front patio has been nicely redone, so that you do feel you are whisked away to a land where dining is always accompanied by warm friendships, soft lighting and wonderful hosts. If you are on the west side of the Q-bridge, take the drive, it is well worth it, and you'll return many times.
