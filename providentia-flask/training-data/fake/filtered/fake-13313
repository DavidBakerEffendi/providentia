Recently opened in the space formerly occupied by Aloha.  The chef/owner Everson knows what he is doing in his kitchen. He is also friendly and welcoming. The restaurant's ingredients and oil are fresh and that alone is a welcome change to the area restaurants that have become "tired."  Yummy is basically a take out place with only six seats but the food is a treat: tastey, well prepared and top notch. I knew I wanted to try the food when I saw Ma Po Tofu on the menu.  The tofu was creamy and served with ground meet and vegetables with the right amount of zing.  The lunch special, at $ 6.50, is a good deal and comes with choice of soup, crab rangoon and spring roll and you can opt for white, brown or fried rice. On another visit, the thai green curry was excellent.  Give Yummy Asian a try; you will enjoy it and it's open seven days a week.  Bravo Chef Everson!
