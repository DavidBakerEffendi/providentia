Not a place you'd want to sit down and have dinner but, a good, cheap, healthier alternative when getting take-out. As an NYU student I would frequently eat Mamoun's falafel sandwiches with hummus as they were filling and VERY cheap... Ideal for the student on a budget. I also love their thick, tasty mango juice so be sure to give it a try.
