WOW!! That was the first word to come out of my mouth after having a bite of the amazing shrimp mofongo I ordered during brunch last weekend. I am glad to see that the restaurant has extensively expanded both the brunch and dinner menu since my first visit (it was very much needed). I have been lucky enough to have Michelle as my server during my two visits here. She has delivered such amazing/modest service both times. Gave great descriptions of certain items I was curious about in the menu; during both of the visits I followed her recommendations & boy was I licking off what was left of my meals. The best part of all was that she must've overheard us mentioning my friends bday & surprised us at the end of our meal with ice cream & a birthday candle. Beautiful restaurant, exceptional service, delicious food, and breath taking view. Only tip: change playlist I heard the same exact songs from my first visit.
