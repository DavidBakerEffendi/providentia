Found this restaurant on Yelp with a moderate 3$ rating.  The food was incredible.  We are both of Italian decent and yet we loved the food and the service was just so good.  When you arrive you get appetizers without even ordering them (grilled spicy peppers, salami and cheese as well as some fried veggies that were exquisite and crunchy.  We both ordered a main course and the portions were too large to finish.  The bottle of wine they recommended worked perfectly for our taste and the cappuccino and ricotta cake was great as well.  Top it off with a home made fig grappa that I wasn't charged for and it made for a perfect meal. Will return and will tell my friends and work acquaintances about it.
