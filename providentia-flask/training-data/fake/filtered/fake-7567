First of all I have to say finding this place was pretty hard but it was totally worth getting lost for a bit. The moment I walked in I was greeted by the workers. I didnt expect the place to be such a small place but as I got used to it. I realized it was a great spot for alll of my friends and I to just hangout and get some food. And now onto the food. Everyone recommended me the fish tempura tacos, porkbelly taco, breakroom fries , and breakroom burger, and of course their famous mint lemonade. They definitely did not disappoint. The burger was cooked perfectly and putting a runny egg on it with porkbelly omg. I definitely would recommend this place. I can honestly say it's the best burger and tacos of ive had comparing the burger to shake shacks. I definetly would pick breakroom burger over shake shack anyday. The price is good and the foods made to order so its fresh. I definitely recommend this place and have already told at least 20 of my friends and they all have loved this new little spot and they also have become regulars here.
