I've been to Osteria many many times, and as someone who travels the state often, have yet to find a pizza comparable to Tino's.  The artisan style ingredients are fresh with inventive combinations.  The crust is perfect: crusty on the outside and moist and soft in the middle.  In addition to the many types of pizza on the menu, you still have the option of adding your own ingredients from a substantial list to make it your own.  I've found that the pizza's here need nothing added to them as they speak for themselves.  There's a reason that people will wait to be seated at this gem, and it's the quality and taste of the food.  If you're looking for typical pedestrian pizza, then shame on you, but spend your time elsewhere so it frees up more space for me!  The staff here is just as pleasing as the food.  Service is prompt, friendly, and quick.  It's obvious the owner has pride in this restaurant as evidenced by his unique ability to pair excellent staff with delicious fare.  A definite must-try!
