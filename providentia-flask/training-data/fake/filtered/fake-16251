I recently moved to NYC and ate here on my first night. The macaroni & cheese spring rolls were magical -- seriously one of the best things I've ever eaten in my life. You dip them in a smoked gouda sauce that is to die for. The salads are great too! If you want to hear more about my experience there, check out my food blog at plylerdoesfood.wordpressâ€¦! I'm reviewing tons of NYC restaurants this summer.
