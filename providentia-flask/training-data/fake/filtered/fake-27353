Very nice place with great decor. Went there with my wife, buddy and his wife. We had summer rolls, lemongrass pork tenderloin, curry chicken Roti, Saigon special Bahn mi and ox tail pho. The summer rolls was better than the usual Vietnamese place we go to. The pork tenderloin was marinated and grilled to perfection. The roti was great with OR without the curry chicken. The Saigon Bahn mi was very tasty. The ox tail pho was flavorful especially the stock. Can't wait to go back and try other things on the menu.
