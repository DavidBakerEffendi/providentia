Do not eat here if you have any food allergies or special dietary needs. My daughter has a severe nut allergy. She called in advance and was told they had experience dealing with allergies and that there would be no nuts in her food.  She confirmed when she arrived. The salad arrived, the waiter said there were no nuts, yet  after beginning to eat it she say nuts in the salad. The management was made aware of the error and assured her no nuts would be served in any other part of the meal. Yet her dessert also contained nuts. Not being from the area, she asked them to advise her of the nearest hospitals but no one helped out. The service for others in her group was very bad with meals served at different times.
