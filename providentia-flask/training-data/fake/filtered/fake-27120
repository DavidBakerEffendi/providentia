We drove in for a event and decided to order a calzone,a steak sub, and poppers with bc. While ordering the gentlemen seemed new and needed to be corrected several  times, after reading back our order we where confident he had it correct.  When our order arrived there where issues, steak sub was a chicken sub, no bc for the poppers and we asked for cups and we did not get those either. The food was decent that's why there is a 2 stars for the food. Delivery guy was nice, may need better training.
