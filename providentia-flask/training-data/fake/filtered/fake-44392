Don't ever go here!!!! I went for breakfast and for starters they don't open till 10 on sat and sun. The service was horrible and the food was below average. The biggest gripe I had though was the price. A egg frittata was $10, but the charge for cheese was $3.75 the onions and tomatoes were 2.75 each !!!!!! How can they seriously charge more for the added veggies and cheese than the frittata. I did question the waiter about the charge and the owner came to my table. He was very unprofessional and rude about my issue. I live in town and will make sure to announce to everyone I know to never step foot in the place!!!!
