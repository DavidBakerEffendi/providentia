We had really high expectations for this place after hearing about it and reading the "great" reviews. Last Friday my wife finished up a fun off-off broadway show nearby and we headed over to the PIG with cast and friends, expecting a good time... it's about 11:30pm or so...after waiting patiently while the male host chatted away on the phone, we were treated to a show by the hostess who rolled her eyes twice at my wife and I . The hostess wouldn't even speak with us, she just walked away... Finally the male host realized he had customers, got off the phone and proceeded to let us know that it would be an hour and a half before we got a table, and maybe an hour wait, if we decided to split our group up....give me a break, too crowded, overrated and pretentious for my tastes. I will advise all of my friends etc to skip it!
