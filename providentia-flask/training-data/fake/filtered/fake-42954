I had a terrible experience. I paid $25.00 for an Amazon Local voucher with a promotional value of $50 at Indian Hut. The voucher had an expiration date of a couple of months back, but the owner would not even honor the voucher for the paid value of $25, which they are legally supposed to do. He would not oblige, even after I had Amazon Local on the phone, and said that I could take him to court. He finally accepted the $25.00 paid value, but tore up the voucher and cursed at me. If this is the way they treat customers, I don't know why they are in the restaurant business with this kind of service.
