My husband and I went for our one year anniversary and had a wonderful experience in VT, but we have stayed at better inns/b&b's. The restaurant was great and I would recommend going there for dinner but we are used to very friendly innkeepers who treat us like long lost friends and better beds/bedding/furniture in the rooms. I would not go back to the inn but would eat there again as the restaurant was great!
