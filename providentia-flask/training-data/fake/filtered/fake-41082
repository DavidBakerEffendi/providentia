very tasty Japanese ramen noodle soup. Very classic preparation. Personally, I don't believe it's worth the wait since there's nothing particularly over-the-top about the product, plus, it's technically a chain restaurant that just so happened to gain large popularity and following at this very crowded and cramped East-side spot off the Bowery. Go early or don't go.
