I ordered the pulled pork sandwich. It was $10.50. For that amount, I expected more than somewhat dry pork plus a little bit of cole slaw on a plain hamburger bun, the kind you might get at the grocery store in a bag of 8. The owner should be ashamed of him/herself for pricing a sandwich, which might cost $5 at a southern roadhouse (with a full side of 'slaw, most likely), at such a exorbitant price. BBQ is food for the people. Morgan's BBQ needs to make some serious changes.
