This is truly the best cafe on the Avenue.  Delicious baked goods -- honestly the best cupcakes I have ever eaten!!  Perfectly brewed coffee.  Incredibly courteous and welcoming staff that actually shows gratitude upon receiving a tip, so be sure to be generous with these folks!  Not to mention the interior has amazing feng shui.  Large wooden tables, lovely window seats, huge cafe bar.  Plus, the staff has superb musical taste, and they play it at just the right volume.  I always leave B2 feeling relaxed and satisfied.  Can't wait to get a cup today!
