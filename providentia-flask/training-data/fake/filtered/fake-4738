No complaints whatsoever. I can't speak for dining in but I ordered take out here and it was amazing, and came out to about 30-40 bucks with tip. It was large portioned and tasted awesome! The staff was very friendly, looked family owned, a bunch of Greek guys and gals running it yelling at eachother in Greek. Cracked me up. Loved it and will definitely be returning. I honestly don't remember what I got. I think I got lamb and my wife got eggplant, probably the best vegetarian plate I've ever had and that's factoring my non vegetarian-ness.
