I have been here before when it was Bogarts. It was...alright I guess. Than they opened up this place. I really like what they have done with the place. I like the back area the most because of the vintage feel it gives off. The food is really good too. I am a big fan of the Seared Tuna Salad and the Beet Salad. I think I am going to try the Rib Eye next because I keep hearing good things about it. I think you should definately try the place out, even if for a drink- that bartender Justin has a lot of pep, and some pretty cool jeans too
