This is less a review, and more just wanting to relay a good experience we had at Highlands.  My partner and I discovered Highlands a few weeks ago, loved it, and thought it would be a great place to have a casual gathering for his birthday.  We invited about 30 people for 7pm last evening.  When we arrived, there was a sign on the door saying that it was closed for a private event from 6-9 (I know, I know, we should have called!).  Very disappointed, I went in to just let the bartender know that there may be people showing up mistaking their event for the gathering we had planned, but that we'd try to direct our guests somewhere else.  While outside in the snowstorm, trying to figure out an alternative, the owner came out and invited us all back in, saying that he would open the unused dining room area, just for us...  The owner posted staff at the door to sort guests as they came in, and took a waitperson off the private party and dedicated her to us.  The solution was elegant and seemed effortless, making the whole thing look to our guests like it had been planned all along... this beautiful "private room" just for our party.  What could have been an absolute nightmare turned out to be a fabulous evening... better than we could have ever anticipated.  Needless to say I recommend this place highly, not just for the great food and inventive drinks, but mainly for the caring, friendly staff.
