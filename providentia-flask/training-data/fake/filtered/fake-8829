Great food, atmosphere and music! The last time I went with my family, I spent good money (+$100), expecting to sit and enjoy the band. Right after we payed the bill we were asked if we would be leaving soon... That's the last time I'm going there. They also pour beers an inch below the rim BE CAREFUL... THERE IS NOT A FULL BAR!!!
