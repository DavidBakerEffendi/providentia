There's not much to say except that when you need your fry fix, this is the place to go! I only wish that there was more room to order, sit, and eat. I typically find myself walking by it just because it's so cramped. When I do order, I end up taking it to Whole Foods, buying a drink and sitting in the wide open areas to enjoy my fries. So good, you won't wanna share ;)
