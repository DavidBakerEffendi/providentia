This is not for the restaurant per se...but the swift and unexpectedly appreciative email that followed from a representative.   I was thanked for my candor, and assured that I had menu items that have been known to be delicious, but they will give them another look, and an invite to speak personally I write reviews only when I think a meal is surprising whether it be positive or negative.  Its rare to get a reply, let alone one that isn't a blow off or overly apologetic. I'm really impressive that they took the time, and I can honestly say I'll go back and replicate the meal at some point, and I really hope it outshines the first!
