I recently ate at Beyond Pita for the first time. I got the cheesesteak with the homemade hot sauce. I loved it! I was very hungry so I was excited that the cheesesteak is so big. I also like that they use seasoned potato chunks in the sandwich. But what made it so yummy is the homemade hot sauce. Oh and the prices r great. The huge cheesesteak was less than $7 and they use fresh ingredients. I've already been back and will continue to eat the food there
