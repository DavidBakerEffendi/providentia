I've been going there for 30 years (I guess I'm one of the "old and ugly" men referred to by another reviewer), and I have NEVER seen the owner accost anyone. Visiting a "dump" 5 or 6 different times might lead a reader to question why that other reviewer kept returning. The food is good, the drinks generous and reasonably priced, the staff almost unfailingly pleasant and friendly, and the owner prone more to tolerate untoward behavior than to react with violence. (I wonder what the other reviewer and his friend were actually doing in the men's room. . . .) By the way, I've sometimes wandered in on a Thursday night after 10 PM, and it is amazing how many 20- and 30-something guys show up! Visit 168 York Street and decide for yourself, but don't be guided by the ranting of a person whose grip on reality seems tenuous. I won't ascribe any motives to the previous reviewer's writing; its tone and lack of basis in fact speak for themselves.
