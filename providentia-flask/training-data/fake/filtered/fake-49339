I have been waiting to try this place since I saw a write up online and I finally got there today! Everything was awesome...I ordered the veg general tsos chicken and hot and sour soup...I'm not a veg but order veg general tsos wherever I go and I have to say this was veryyyy good! Also....I believe Sonny the owner was ringing me up and introduced himself - super friendly and a nice personal touch! I will be back again :)
