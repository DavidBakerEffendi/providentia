Love this little place! The owner is accommodating and delightful, and the food is terrific. We live on Cape Cod but had to make an unexpected trip to Manhattan TWO DAYS before hosting a party for 25 neighbors. No problem! I picked up everything I needed at Anthi's. Try their taramosalata... And the galactoburico for dessert!
