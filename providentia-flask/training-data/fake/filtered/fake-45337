This restaurant needs to implement a better reservation policy.  I have NEVER experienced making a reservation at a restaurant and the reservation is NOT honored! My party of 12 reservation was taken away after the restaurant opened for Sunday Brunch @ 12, five minutes later while we were waiting on line.  Who does THAT! You need to have a 30 minute grace period especially if you have a line outside prior to your establishment opening. But I thank you because you introduced me to another restaurant in the area that was happy to have a party of 12 to dine with them. And they didn't charge us a cake fee.
