DONT GO TO THIS PLACE. WORST FOOD. They serve Goat HAIR with Goat Biriyani. We order 5 biriyani from this place, out of which we found hair in 4 Biriyani.We did inform that guy about this and he was not even apologetic, rather he started showing us attitude. He went inside and came up with same plate and told us the chef is saying, that is Goat Hair. We were dumb founded by this explanation and right away left the restaurant without eating any more. My suggestion, don't even go to this place.
