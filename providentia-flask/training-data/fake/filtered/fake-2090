I really enjoy this place.  Love it for brunch and dinner.   Had the maple walnut french toast today - very tasty.  Loved the maple whipped cream (but wish there had been more of it).  Got to try some of their polenta and eggs - it was also very good.  They must get their eggs somewhere nice because the yolks are always such a beautiful yellow. This place does get a little overcrowded - wouldn't recommend it for a romantic date but it definitely is a great place to get a good meal.
