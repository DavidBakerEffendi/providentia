I can't say enough go gusto! First lets start with the pizza, well if u were ever in New York , you know what I mean , crispy ,tasteful crust , no grease or cheese sliding off their pizza and top quality toppings! Grilled chicken and their south Philly rolls , what a great combo ! And tasteful chicken ! Also homemade turkey , not that slimy stuff you get elsewhere !! And their pizza sauce , well just try it and u will be back! Chicken prosciutto calzone !!!! Just love it ! Thank you Gusto!!! Keep up the good work!
