I've been to Maggies a few times in the past month and I have to say what a great place. I always sit at the bar have a few drinks and an appetizer. I was there this Sunday and what a great time. The bartender was so entertaining...can she really handle a bar, think her name was Shannon!!!! I had the raw clams...AMAZING!! Maggies is excellent and I highly recommend it to my friends.
