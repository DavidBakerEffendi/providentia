Discovered by chance on a weekend trip...definitely going back! Don't waste your time trolling reviews for any other place...this is where you want to go. Jack the Horse Tavern is exactly what you look for when in New York; a cozy restaurant with great food at a good price; an attentive, friendly staff; not overcrowded; great beer/wine selection. We were making our way back to the High St subway terminal when we decided to have dinner in Brooklyn instead of Manhattan. As luck would have it, we made our way down Hicks Street instead of Henry St. Henry St is lined with restaurants and we would've been lured into a place to dine, but Hicks St has very few restaurants making this a hidden gem. EVERYONE on the staff was really kind. We were treated like regular customers. Their menu seems to be seasonal and everything we ordered was perfectly prepared and very fresh. I'm happy to give this restaurant 5 stars.
