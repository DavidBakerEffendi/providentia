I loved the spicy mang- the purple rice is so toasty, and the cayenne really gave it a kick.  The mango and avocado added to the richness, and the cucumber a kick. I had the coconut juice/orange juice combo which was very tasty but creamy..sort of like a mango lassi thing.  it was so delicious. Nutty Buddy Rice paper wrap is also out of this world. must b tried
