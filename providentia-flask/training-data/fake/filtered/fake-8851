A quaint little place. Sort of resembles a deli, or small pizzeria. There are small tables you can eat at. The food is great. I'm no expert on this cuisne, but I thought the felafel was delicious. I've had the felafel wrap and the felafel pita. The babaganoush was also very good. The hummus was good as well, though not as good as the babaganoush. I love to get take out from here.
