To begin with, I LOVE YUCA BAR. It satisfies me in every way possible. The Margaritas are great, and every dish is a culinary experience. If you want a place to go, then this is the place to go. Compared to all the other restaurants, I have been to, this is a bomb, a delicious bomb. The Latino theme of the restaurant is a great fit for the personality of the place. And the pictures from Cuba that are part of the walls -- beautiful! All of the people are so nice. You can't help but have a great time! To make it even better, the prices are outrageously fair! I just love this place!
