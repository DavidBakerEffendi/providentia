OK - the 5 stars are due  in large part to a 10 for service bolstering a 4 for food. I mean I have never had service this good anywhere, period.  The person taking the order went out of her way to find enough hot stuff for me - extra hot sauce, extra jalapenos.  Whomever walked by where we were sitting asked if everything was OK or if we needed anything.  I went to get another margarita but there was a line so one of the staff told me to sit back down since I had already ordered, and she rang it up for me and got me a new number.  I was able to pay her and she took care of things at the register.  Now the food - good  burger but not great.  I had a special with monterey jack, sals and blue tortilla chips.  It was tasty but not something that Bobby Flay ever made on TV!!  If he is going to put his name on things, then he should assure Bobby Flay quality.  I ordered it medium well and it came closer to well.  The food came out pretty quickly, as we had just beaten the dinner rush, but the toppings did not seem glistening and fresh - things had congealed a bit and the blue chips were no longer crunchy.  The sweet potato fries earned their own 5!  Crispy on the outside, soft inside, coated with nice salty/sweet crystal.  The horseradish honey mustard dipping sauce was good enough to do shots with, although it could have been a drop thicker so that it could stick a bit more on the fries!  Btw, the order of fries for $3 was huge - enough to share.  I washed everything down with a cold Sierra Nevada and 2 prickly pear margaritas.  Decent beer selection and downright tasty and adequately strong frozen margarita (only $5).  This is a very unique place and would be a regular stop if closer.  If they had a veggie burger in addition to their turkey burger, it would allow vegetarians to experience the toppings and "crunchification".
