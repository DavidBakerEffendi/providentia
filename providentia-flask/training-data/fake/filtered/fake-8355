Decided to visit two weeks ago only to be highly disappointed with the food, service, drinks. Basically all of the above. As a friend of many local chef I can now see and understand why they choose to stay away from this place. Food lack flavor and experience was over all unprofessional. Laetus has potential to be great but with the experience I and others have dealt with I can see why this place is going down the hole. Better of going to Fangs
