I had dinner there last night with my girlfriend and I must say that I was very impressed. We arrived there at around 8:30 pm and were seated right away. It wasn't too crowded and the staff was very pleasant. We skipped on the starters but the wine was great. We had to wait a bit for the entree but the steaks were cooked perfectly. My first impression was that it was a small portion of steak (we both had the bar steak) but with a side order of the creamy garlic mashed potatoes it was just enough. This place is CASH ONLY. I would have known that if I read the fine print on the bottom of the menu but it wasn't a problem because they have an ATM in the back of the restaurant (very convenient). This is a great place for a romantic dinner. The selection of music and the lighting make it very intimate. Overall, I had a very pleasant experience and I would go back again.
