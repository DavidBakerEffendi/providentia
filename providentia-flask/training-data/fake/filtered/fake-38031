I have been to Jacob's Pickles upwards of 10 times for both Brunch and Dinner.  The restaurant is incredibly cozy and trendy with lots of exposed brick and white-washed wood.  It is a very cool atmosphere with a mixture of small tables and large communal ones. Dinner is absolutely delicious. I almost always get the Chicken, Bacon, Egg, and Cheese biscuit sandwich, but their other entrees are great, too, especially the fish tacos! Beware, the serving sizes are quite large.  The cocktails are very good here and the beer selection is great. Brunch is equally incredible.  It appears that the breakfast sandwiches and the chicken and pancakes are very popular.  The BLT Bloody Mary is very popular, but my friend said it was a little too horseradish-y.   I have only ever had their pickles once, and they are GREAT!  Again, the serving sizes are huge and you will likely receive too many pickles.  DO NOT get more than one variety if you are in  party of two people. Order a couple varieties only if you are with at least 3 or 4 people. As other reviewers have mentioned, the owner is very friendly and often very present in the restaurant.  It's true that the restaurant will text you when your table is ready for brunch, which is super convenient.  Expect to wait 45-60 minutes for weekend brunch.
