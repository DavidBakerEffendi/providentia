We were so excited to have our sons 11th birthday party at Nomads in South Windsor, CT?  We arrived a half hour early since it was our 1st time at the facility.  The party started at 5:00pm however, the room was not ready until 5:30.  When the event planner tried to setup the room quickly he proceeded to pick up paper cups and napkins off the floor which were located in the corner of the room under a table.  We couldn't believe what we were seeing but did not want any confrontation.  Then the pizza came in the room and was cold.  The event planner asked us if we needed a utensil to dish out the pizza.  We knew at that point we were on our own.  At 6:00pm he told us we had to remove our stuff from the room since we only had it for 1 hour.  When I stated this must be some type of mistake he said I should address my concerns with a manager.  After speaking with the manager we again felt like we were made a very poor decision but wanted to make the best out of the situation.  Then the children started coming up to us telling us that the events that we paid for in advance were taken off their game cards.  What was even more embarrassing is some of my sons friends go there all the time and already had cards so the took their points that were from previous visits to Nomads.  When we called the day after the party to complain we never received a call back.  We continued to call over the next few days until we reached the general manager, Joanne.  She seemed concerned but explained that they have had over 19,000 parties so if they get a few bad complaints then they are doing well.  I asked her to give the children that lost their points a new card which she agreed with only 1/3 of our money back.  As of today we still never received the children's cards.  What an embarrassing situation especially since we had to explain this to the parents.  What a terrible experience for us.
