well I guess people like this place since I went in recently and had to practically leap frog people to get to the cash register. it really is like playing frogger when you try to walk through the TINY room here.  It seems pretty unremarkable for falafel since I'm used to paying mammoons prices which don't compare at all... Everything changed at this place since I tried the greek salad...it was great I highly recommend it to anyone looking for something light but filling.  My favorite part was the crushed whole wheat pita crisps on top...anyway. Aside from the prices everything's excellent.
