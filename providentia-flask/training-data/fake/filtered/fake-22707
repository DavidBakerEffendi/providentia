Since my initial review, I've eaten at Rye several times and am happy to say that the issues with the service have all been worked out.  I think it's a great restaurant that serves delicious food, but it still falls a bit short when compared to other restaurants in its league (Marlow & Sons, Dressler, and even Traif).  Don't get me wrong, I really like this place and I think it's one of the best restaurants in Williamsburg (and, frankly, destroys many of Manhattan's comparable eateries), but I just don't find it to be as good as the others I mentioned.  However, Rye easily wins in the drink department.
