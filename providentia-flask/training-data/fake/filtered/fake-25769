Dont be fooled. All the waiters are Costa Rican, not Italian. The food is generally blan, no real flavor explosions. The appetizers are bar food at best. The management was seriously lacking too. We had a problem with our appetizer, and asked to speak to the manager. He refused to come to the table, and instead, kept sending over the same waiter to take care of it. I practically had to argue to get it off the check. As for the entrees, I think they are pre-made. The pasta tasted rubbery and the sauce seemed thinned out. One thing I will say, I am in my forties and coming here makes me feel young. A much older clientele. Not for dates, or fun, or anything for that matter. Stay away!!!!
