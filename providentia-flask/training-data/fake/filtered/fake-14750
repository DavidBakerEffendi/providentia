This place was a recomendation and boy was it worth the trip. I didn't know what to expect but since then I have been back so many times I have really lost count. This place is sooooo good! The service is okay. The waiters have gotten an order wrong and one time forgot that we had place an order for more food but lucky for them the food is so amazing that it makes up for the lack of supurb service. I would recomend this place without a doubt. Make sure to try their drink specials and their desserts too. YUM.
