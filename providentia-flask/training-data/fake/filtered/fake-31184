i believe this is the best Lebanese food i've ever had (though i've never been to Lebanon). Â the lamb is seasoned with bold, aromatic spices, but still allows you to taste the flavor of the meat. the chicken is perfectly, still moist. babaganoush tastes like it was just roasted minutes before it arrived at the table. make sure to order hot sauce - i swear, too much, and you'll feel you're hallucinating. also, have the mouskaha. it's a treat. wafa herself is always around, surrounded by her sons. a family joint serving great food. i don't think it can get any better than this.
