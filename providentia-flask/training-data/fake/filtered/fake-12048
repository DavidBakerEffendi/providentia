Gusto's has good pizza, but they are very stupid. I ordered a pizza, waited for the 40 minutes they told me it would take to get here. It didn't come, so I called after an hour. She girl said it left already. Fine. Another hour passes...I call again to cancel it. The guy on the phone was rude and not helpful at all. Pizza in this city is everywhere. Order from somewhere else...like Slice.
