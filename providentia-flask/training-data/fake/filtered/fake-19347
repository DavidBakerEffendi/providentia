Can't get enough of Twenty Manning Grill! Everytime I visit this restaurant the experience gets better and better. From the ambience to the service to the delicious menu, TMG is a must-stop on the Philly restaurant scene. Audrey Claire Taichman really hits home with this one. Can't wait to introduce more friends and family to this truly exceptional restaurant! See you next week,Twenty Manning Grill!
