Awesome pizza and BIG beers. As pizza prices go, it's pretty expensive. A pie and a coupla beers will run you well over $25. But if you're going for a slice and a beer you'll do okay. Buffalo Chix and Veggie are definitely the best slices to go for. Always a friendly staff behind the counter and a very laid back atmosphere.
