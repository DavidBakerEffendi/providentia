this food is worth the trip into NYC alone. i always get the combo and drench it in their signature white sauce. sometimes i would get two just to have some the next day. This place is all the hype and it lives up to it. Portions are pretty big, definitely a full sized meal for most people. Price isnt too bad, its about 6 dollars or 7 dollars now. The only downfall is the line can be ridiculously long at times. Just go to the next cart. But the wait is worth it. A tip: always ask for more white sauce to take home. It goes with everything
