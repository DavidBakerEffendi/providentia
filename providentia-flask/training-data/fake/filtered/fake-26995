Very authentic Korean food.  We lived in Korea for 2 years and everything was just as delicious as if we were in Seoul!  From the side dishes to the soup to the main dish...it couldn't have been better.  The owner was very friendly!!! Can't wait to go back.  If you want authentic Korean food you don't have to go anywhere else!
