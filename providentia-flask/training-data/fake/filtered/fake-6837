We live in the neighborhood, so this restaurant has been a blessing AND a curse.  A blessing because the food is amazing.  A curse because it's so fast and easy that we have been here way too often for such an indulgent feast.   The baby back ribs and the jerk chicken are my favorite, and the cornbread is a MUST.  The sides are a little vingegar-y for my taste, but I'm willing to overlook that for the delicious meats.   It's also great that you can just get your food and sit down without having to deal with waitstaff -- makes for a quick and pleasant meal.  That said, the people who work here are very lovely, and the owner has come by almost every time we've been here to introduce himself and say hello.
