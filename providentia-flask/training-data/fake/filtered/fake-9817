Was there for dinner to celebrate a good friend's birthday. It's an excellent place for upscale dining, in a casual ambience. The d√©cor is warm and inviting. The food is simple, but inventive and delicious. I highly recommend the Kampachi Tartare and the Lady Ashton's Chocolate Cake! The service was attentive and knowledgeable.
