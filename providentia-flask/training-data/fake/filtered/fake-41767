This is my new favorite restaurant!  Fantastic location in the West Village.  Went last weekend with a group - we all tried different dishes, and everything was delicious. The roast chicken, and strip steak were especially good, as were the salads.  Love, love, love the farm to table philosophy.  The service was perfect, understated and efficient.  The ambiance is wonderful, the views of the Hudson enhance the whole experience.
