I really don't know how it gets much better than Tavern on Jane.   This place is awesome. . .from the food they serve to the atmosphere, to the huge drink list.  This place embodies exactly what the West Village is all about. I go here a bunch, in fact, I find it hard to go to other spots around the area because I like this spot so much.  What more could you want?  The burgers are some of the best in the city. . .in my opinion, much better than the over-hyped Corner Bistro, and their other fare is also excellent.  Their flat breads are great and the bar list has something for everyone to enjoy. There's also something to be said about the crowd and the staff here too. . .all very nice people, very chill relaxed environment.  Just the place I wanna go to when I'm beat after a long day and want to kick back a few drinks and a good burger. All in all, if you come to the West Village, come check out Tavern on Jane.  You surely won't regret it.
