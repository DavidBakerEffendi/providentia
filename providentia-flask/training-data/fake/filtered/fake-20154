I've been to Trio on a few occasions and I have enjoyed it every time. It's a phenomenal Thai BYOB with delicious specials and a very reasonable bill at the end of the night. If you do go, try a special as a main course or an appetizer, you won't be disappointed. It also has lovely second floor outdoor seating in the summer. peace out.
