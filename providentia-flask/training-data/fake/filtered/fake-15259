I've had mixed experiences here.  At first I loved the food -- it seemed really fresh and there was usually a good helping of vegetables.  The homemade green curry was especially fantastic.  But the past two visits have been pretty mediocre: the tofu was sour and well past its prime, and mushrooms were also bad, resulting in an evening of indigestion.   Too bad!
