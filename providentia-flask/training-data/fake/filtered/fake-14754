In a nutshell, the food and service is on par with a diner- the atmosphere/modern look of the restaurant is misleading, as I expected more from the food and service based on the how the restaurant looks.  I'd probably go back and give it a shot for happy hour, and just sit at the bar, but I wouldn't eat here again.  Our waiter was polite, but couldn't answer questions about the menu or drinks.  It seems that more time and effort was put into how the restaurant looks than on training the staff and making good food.
