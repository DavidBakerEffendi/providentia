One word.. DELICIOUS! Sure it may cost more than your local halal cart but it's worth the money! The portion of the food is great and it'll fill you up for days! Their falafels are the best I've had so far. They give samples out and I suggest everyone to at least try it. I always order the chicken over rice mmm my favorite
