We are fans, come here at least 8 times a month and am going into withdrawal with the temporary closing. Â The fried chicken and fried catfish are excellent, the red rice and beans and mac and cheese are very good and the other southern food we have tried is good to very good. Deserts are a little sweet for our taste and the biscuit could be better. Service is generally excellent. Prices are reasonable and the bar is great.
