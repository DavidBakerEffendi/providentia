To be honest I have no idea how this place has stayed in Business so long. This was one of the worst if not the worst subs I have ever had, the bread was almost inedible the steak or whatever it was was so dry and flavorless that card board would have tasted better, the onions we just about raw. Really just a terrible all around place. The servers were vary rude and make the whole experience that much worse.
