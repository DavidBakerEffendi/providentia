I cannot believe what I just ingested. Was that fish or chemically produced asshole? And family style cooking? This is no place to bring loved ones. Tony's is where you would bring your ex who just banged your best friend. You would take her here in the hope that she would vomit continuously for days. The pasta "sauces" are nauseating. They are so thick that with one spoon full my stomach is pleading me (in the form of uncontrollable gas and unbearable pain) to stop. But let me get to the heart of the matter. "Tony" is not italian. To call this an italian restaurant is to call a Chihuahua a dog. It's a fucking rat. In conclusion, I would rather penetrate my asshole with a spike-laden stick, then try your "Penne Alla Vodka." Fuck you Tony.
