I recently moved to the neighborhood and asked around for a butcher shop with blank responses suggesting the popular block market areas 10 blocks in either direction. I noticed this post and walked over looking for something special for guests I'd invited for the evening. WOW! These reviews ARE for real. The owner offered me awesome prime boneless rib eye steaks to make you wish for a picnic in January! He even advised me how to prepare it, perfectly.Very reasonably priced; extremely nice people and an immaculate store. I just cannot stop telling everyone I see about it.!
