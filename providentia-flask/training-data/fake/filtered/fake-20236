Where do I begin?? I'll start with the flamboyant bald man who I think was the manager? His attitude towards myself and the other customers in line was as if we were bothering him. Not only was his response somewhat arrogant, but the hand waving was really unappreciated. I can honestly say I have never been treated this poorly at a restaurant before I even got to the table. And it only got worse once my wife and I got seated. Our waitress was very friendly but good service only goes so far when the food is awful. It took 45 minutes to get what we ordered (pancakes and eggs) and sadly the eggs were dry and over-cooked and the pancakes were mushy and under-cooked. Do your self a favor and just go to IHOP.
