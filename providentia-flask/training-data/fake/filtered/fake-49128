Let me start off by saying that I've never written a review for any business or product, however Salute far exceeded my expectations in so many ways Â that I felt that I needed to share this place with everyone! We went on a Tuesday night and it was packed! The food is fantastic and served in a timely manner. We had the cheese garlic bread and something with sausage, tortellini, and a cream sauce. I also had the chocolate lava cake.I never had an empty water glass (and I tend to go through a glass of water once every 5-7 min) and all of the waiters/waitresses seemed to support each other and check on every table so every table was being served at all times. I even saw the manager(s) helping with tables. When we left, one of the managers ( I think) gave us free garlic bread and biscotti to enjoy during our show at the Bushnell. They also gave us a 10% discount because we were seeing a show. After the show the garage was locked and we started to panic. We went back into Salute to ask for help and one of the waiters unlocked the garage for us and were extremely friendly still even though it was 10:30 at night. You really can't go wrong with this place. 5-star service and food. I will definitely be going back in the near future.
