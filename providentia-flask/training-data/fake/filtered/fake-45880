We LOVE the Brothers Moon.  And by WE I mean my entire family.  My parents (in their 70s), my kids (under 7), and my husband and I  LOVE it.  Brunch with the whole gang is delicious.  Dinners alone on date night, fantastic.   We love their commitment to local - local ingredients and the local community.  We love their genuine friendliness when we show up with kids in tow.  And, we love their take out counter for those nights when spectacular chicken quesadillas  and homemade cookies are necessary after a long day at work.   My mother hosted a surprise birthday luncheon for me at Brothers Moon.  The service was so attentive and the food was scrumptious. Our favorites: Mediterranean platter (grown-ups); simply grazin' hamburger (6 year old); the salads (grandma); any of the evening specials (grown-ups); the entire brunch menu (everyone). Oh, I forgot about the black bean soup.  And the amazing desserts.
