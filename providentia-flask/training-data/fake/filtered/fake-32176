Mauro and Michele( the owners) are hilarious...great people as well. The pastas are excellent,not because they are  inexpensive but because they are fresh and the taste is awesome. Try the tagliatele con Bolognese sauce....amazing. I have been going to this place for approx 5 years now and will continue to do so. It's like an Italian   version of "Cheers"... Many regulars frequent the place due to the great food and people. If you want to eat well  and spend little, this is the place! But please be respectful and clean up after yourself. Ciao. Fr.
