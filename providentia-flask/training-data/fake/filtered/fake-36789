We were just there this morning.  We saw the manager was yelling to a pregnant young lady with her two young kids.  it looks like she was be seated in the front door where the cold comes to her, she asked for the seat change but the manager refused to it, and on purposely let them waited their food for 50 minutes.  She was so upset and said she had low blood sugar ..etc.  But the manager looked so cruel!!  He didn't even said sorry, just said because you asked for change a seat, so food wont be served... I simply cannot believe it!!  Is he a human being?  We just left and feel so bad for the young mother.  And swear never want to come here again!  (Foods indeed serve very slow and to be honest, it's just pancake, a expensive but ordinary one)..
