2 stars for decor...and thats where it ends. We waited 25 minutes for a waitress, after we flagged ond down (and it was a slow Tuesday night!). Spare rib app was fatty and tough. Rock shrimp app had good sauce, but tough, frozen shrimp. Awful bartender for a 'lounge'....and after trying a Pomegranate Dragon, Pomegranate Margerita and then a Mohito- i know it wasnt a fluke. (Why would you make a fruity, girly drink so strong i cant even sip it? if i wanted a strong drink, would i order a girly one?) And they ran out of our two dessert choices and gave us cold tea. Wil never go there again...I will stick with Montclair for good sushi!!
