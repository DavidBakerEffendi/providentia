We visited this little gem while staying at the Trump Soho for the week.The service was top notch. Though they had a full bar and a great looking wine list, it had been a boozy night the night before so we stuck with Peronis. The menu is succinct and well curated - something I relish in a world of too many choices. The warm carrot & arugula salad was incredible. Peppery arugula with warm, sweet carrots and nutty pumpkin seeds - inspired. We both ordered pasta - both meaty, warm, with perfectly cooked al dente pasta. Â After dinner our fantastic server brought out a plate of tiramisu - perfection. Lastly, the daintiest little vials of sambuca - a delightful way to end the evening.
