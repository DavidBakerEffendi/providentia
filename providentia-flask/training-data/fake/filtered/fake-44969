IT DOESN'T GET BETTER THAN THIS!  This family owned and operated deli/restaurant is not only a  fixture in Newark, it has earned and maintained its place as New Jersey's best. I've been in Newark since 1979, attending Rutgers NCAS, Seton Hall Univ. Law School, and then working as a lawyer since 1986.  For decades spent in Newark, and eating outstanding deli both at Hobby's premises and various offices and other locations, I can honestly say -- the homemade soups, fresh salads, made-to-order sandwiches, entrees, platters, cookies and desserts are unmatched.  There is something for everyone.  The delivery service is reliable and prompt.   Hobby's is also a consistent supporter of many charities in Newark and elsewhere.  An example of long distance delivery includes sending countless salami to our troops abroad.
