This is one of those rare finds of an authentic Spanish food restaurant (Puerto Rican, to be exact) That boasts great food and working man's pricing.  We arrived to a very pleasant and inviting atmosphere and greeted warmly by the hostess.  Although the premise had been a former Irish pub, no old stale beer smell here!  I ordered the churrasco (skirt steak) with arroz con gandules (rice w/pigeon peas) and I was pleasantly surprised, as were my taste buds.  The churrasco was cooked perfectly to a medium finish, and no small feat since churrasco is a very thin cut of beef.  The wife had mofongo and since I am not a fan and she is a native South American, she gave it a "two thumbs up."  Everything was delicious and in ample portion.  Service was excellent in this family owned establishment.     Entries are priced under $20.00 and everything is home made.  Don't pass up an opportunity to dine here if you are hungry for something different, and by all means we WILL be back!  The restaurant is open Friday, Saturday, and Sunday for lunch and dinner with the hope of expanding days in the near future.
