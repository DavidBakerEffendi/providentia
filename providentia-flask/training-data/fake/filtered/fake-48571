I've eaten here many times and I bring friends and they return. From the street, you'd never know that there is a small but nice dining area and a patio seating area. I live on Long Island in Nassau County, but my trade brings me to this part of Brooklyn on occassion, and a few times I have traveled just to have lunch or dinner there.The baba ganoush is wonderful and the way that they season their chicken is both unique and delicious. The chicken platter is a favorite of mine. I was there a few years ago, they even had a musician performing Arabic and Balkan and Persian standards. I have never had a bad meal there and I have had some truly exceptional meals there. Even their Arabic coffee is good. It is also at very reasonable prices (read very inexpensive). This is just about the best "bang for your buck" that you are going to get in the 5 boroughs. I'm a big fan.
