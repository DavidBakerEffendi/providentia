We arranged our daughter's 13th birthday party at Hot Tomato's on a Saturday evening.  The service was impeccable.  We had 15 girls and the meals all came out at the same time!  The food was delicious.  It was an excellent choice for our event.  The management worked with us to find us a great location in the dining area where the girls could chat and have fun without disturbing other diners.    We would strongly recommend this restaurant for events like this.  All the kids were thrilled with event.
