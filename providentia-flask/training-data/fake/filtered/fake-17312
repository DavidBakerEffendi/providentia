Wow. Easily the best cup of coffee I've ever had. I'm back packing through New York City and I wanted to find a coffee shop that wasn't part of a chain to charge my laptop, phone, camera, etc. After passing probably a dozen Starbucks cafes, I found Rex's near the corner of 10th and 57th. The owner took my owner and the staff is one of the friendliest I've ever met. I thought I was talking to a random NY local for half an hour just to find out he was an employee waiting for his shift to start. Incredibly accommodating, and if I ever end up moving to New York, I will be getting a condo within walking distance so I can have a cup every morning. I'm actually writing the review while I'm still sitting here, and it's the first time I ever felt the urge to write a review for anything. Definitely earned the 5-stars (I promise they have no idea I'm writing this).
