Due to lack of tables on a Friday or Saturday night I usually opt to take out the food from here.  I have never been disappointed in any entree or slice of pizza I have eaten.   If you are on a budget go for the ziti slice it almost like having a ziti dinner.  I recommend the vodka sauce.  Very high in calories though.  Since most of this food is high in calories I would eat only half of the portion given and save the rest for the next day.  On a very negative side they are always leaving out something in my order.  Not small things either its usually someone's slice or entree.  So before heading out the door make sure you have everything you ordered.  They have been good about it and will often give me a free dessert when I go back to get the missing item.  But if you live outside of the area this can be very inconvenient and annoying.   There is always plenty of parking which is a plus compared to other pizza places in the area.
