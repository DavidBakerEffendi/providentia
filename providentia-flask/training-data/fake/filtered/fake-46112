This place is off the beaten path . We found it while on our way to Oak ledge Park, and were delighted to find all kinds of yummyness inside  for a spontaneous picnic. I had the blackened chicken sandwich and my husband had the chicken salad sandwich both were flavorful and fresh. We have eaten at the Chefs Corner in Williston so we were a little bummed that  they did not have the full menu, because its offers more selection. It seems like lunch everywhere is expensive these days but for a little more than a Mcd's lunch we had a nice lunch, and split a fruit tarts for dessert. We found the staff to be friendly and generally happy to help which was also a nice surprise. It is out of the way which would be my only complaint,but considering the alternatives in this part of town its a welcome addition nonetheless .
