I'm shocked at the other reviews of this place, the drinks are ridiculously overpriced, the bartenders act like they're doing you a huge favor just to pop a beer and then scoff at any tip no matter how large, and the music is so blaring there's no possibility of conversation.  Everyone cheers their pizza but New Haven has soooo much better pizza elsewhere for so much cheaper.  This is probably the worst bar I've ever been in.
