LOVE!  The food here is rich and delicious and so cheap.  One of the few places in the city you can have a truly amazing sit down meal on the cheap.  Not much for fancy decor, but it has a cozy feel.  I grew up in this hood and was brought up on it, and it's definitely delicious, and I imagined it was authentic, but not being Puerto Rican myself, I couldn't say so with authority.  I recently went there with two friends who grew up there (on separate occasions) and they both confirmed: authentic and FANTASTIC.  My friend also mentioned that it was hard to find good pasteles in the city and not only does La Taza have them, they are baller. I highly recommend the yellow rice, the black and red beans, the carne guisada (beef stew), pernil (roasted pork shoulder), mofongo (garlic-y fried mashed plantains), and, my all-time fav, the ropa vieja (shredded beef.)  They only serve the ropa vieja on two days a week, (Monday and either Friday or Saturday, I think)  and it goes fast, so be sure to get there early if you want some.  Also there's a drink that tastes like a creamsicle called Morir Soñado-SO GOOD!  Crazy delicious flan and coffee if you want dessert.  I always forget and then am disappointed: they're not open Sundays.
