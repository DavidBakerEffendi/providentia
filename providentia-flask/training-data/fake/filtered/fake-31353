This could very well be one of the crappiest restaurants downtown that has sustained such a long run...shocking. 15 years of terrible service, obnoxiously rich and very average food, and TRIBECA prices to boot.  And it's packed for brunch, which is inexplicable.   Do yourself a favor and walk to the end of the block for a killer brunch at Walkers.
