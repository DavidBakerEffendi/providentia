Munches hit the nail on the head with their,"FAT SANDWICHES"..they are the best around at a low price..if your up early,check out their breakfast too.I pass by every morning and stop in at least twice a week for breakfast.My favorite is the Jokers wild fat sandwich..I'd definitely check out Munchys if you're in the area.they have 2 locations now..Wayne & Little Falls
