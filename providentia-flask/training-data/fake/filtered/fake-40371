The value, food and ambiance are excellent. The bus boys are amazing and polite. Andrew is also pretty cool. The wait staff can be pretty rude the customer service is 50/50 of inoffensive to rude. Placing an order over the phone is a pretty rough and the call is cut short the hostess who is usually there is fairly abrasive but not usually too bad. I like this place and will keep going here but with the understanding that its a good price and food I love that price me back best pad-thai I have ever had.
