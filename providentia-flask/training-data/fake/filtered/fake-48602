I love ramen. Especially chicken ramen and Â shojin ramen and shiro maru here. Nowadays, it's so hard to find authentic ramen store, because so many ramen restaurants r using instant broth...ugh... I studied japanese foods and graduated culinary school so I can tell it... But here NOT. They are original and home made. Price is high but appreciate for hard work.
