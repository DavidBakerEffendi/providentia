We visited here on August 21st!  It was on our agenda to go to the Mutter Museum and then eat @ Jones'.  I just stumbled over it online. WE LOVED IT!   I did have the grilled cheese with avacado, and the tomato soup! My brother got a chicken sandwich with sun dried tomatoes and spinach on it.  Our waitress was fantastic.  My husband raved about the poached pear martini!
