I have only been here twice, despite having walked by it more times than I can count. It always seemed too crowded to go, but I ventured in one Tuesday night with my friend and got a spot at the end of the bar. It was definitely busy, but we were acknowledged immediately by the bartender, who was polite and cool. I am not sure why the other reviewers have problems there with staff and whatever else because my experience the first time was great. Second time around was the same thing..late night on a Tuesday- same bartender, same good service. The music was good, food looks awesome though I haven't eaten there yet. I am going to make this my new spot for sure.
