just came from peaches, my stomach is still aching from the so called turkey meatloaf. it was made mostly of bread tasted no turkey. Â it was more like 2 pieces of bread with a wee bit of gravy. then there was the roasted beets salad. yes there were beets but roasted. wrong ! this was compounded by the mistake i made of eating out doors where the faint ordor of doggy doo could be detected. the only thing that was any good was the red stripe beer. nice n smooth & the waiter was very pleasant. i would rather eat at mcdonalds.
