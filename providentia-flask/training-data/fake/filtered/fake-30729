We were here over a year ago for lunch, before the 'renovation'. Food was okay. Place was near empty. Went there the other night. Full house. BYOB. Places are close by and it certainly makes it cheaper. The service was iffy up front but someone came along and bailed her out. Food was fantastic with excellent portions. Walking out feeling satisfied, not stuffed. Going back for sure.
