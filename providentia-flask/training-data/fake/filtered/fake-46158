Well, I haven't exactly had a chance to eat their ramen yet, if only they would stop running out of it, and the wait wasn't ridiculously long.  My husband and his friends went there on Saturday afternoon and were told that they had run out of ramen, and that they were going to reopen at 5pm.  Fast forward to 9:30pm the same day, there we were, thinking we would definitely be able to try it out, and lo and behold, the wait we were told was going to be 2 and a half hours!!  At 9:30pm, a 2.5 hour wait?!  That's just crazy!  What kind of business runs out of their main product the first week that they're open?!  There were actually people dozing off on a couple of chairs near the entrance!  Not too mention, there was a sign on the window that said they may run out of soup for the ramen, in which case they would be closing early.  With my luck, I'd wait for 2.5 hours to find out they've run out, so we just decided to head back home and try again another day.  I'm giving this place one star for now since I had to choose one. I'll be back to update it once I've actually been able to eat something there. Just thought I give a heads up to those of you who are planning to go - you may want to go when they first open to avoid any of this nonsense.
