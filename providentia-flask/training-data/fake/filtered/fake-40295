I haven't been to Cheryl's in a while, but my friend said their service had gotten better--it hasn't. We went for brunch and things started off okay. Our food came and the waiter did not check back to see how things were going. My friend bit into a huge egg shell which stabbed her in the roof of her mouth, and wanted to send her oder back. He did get her a new one. However, did not offer to remove it from the bill. Instead they gave her a free drink, which might have been acceptable if she had actually finished her other drink which was still full and sitting on the table. Her food finally came and then he forgot a fork so she was just sitting there again waiting to flag someone down for a fork. Meanwhile myself and our other friend were finished. So we ordered another drink to have something to do while we waited for her. The drinks took a long time and I almost canceled mine. I work in the service industry. When things like this happen offer to buy the person's food for him or her or buy the whole table a round because we would no have ordered it otherwise. Â At the very least be apologetic, and that barely happened other than the half ass sorry he gave when he took the first plate away.
