I'm not Italian, but love Italian food, so what do I know?  We dropped in during our visit to NYC to try it out and except for the loudness, we loved the food.  Had individual portions of Tony's chicken and the escarole served with it, which we'd never eaten, was great.  We loved to place and plan to visit again when we return to NYC.
