We read all the positive reviews and decided to celebrate an important ocassion by dining here. Word cozy kept coming up in the reviews and I thought, I like cozy! And then we entered the restaurant and I was shocked to see that a restaurant business could be started in a horribly cramped up space like that. Then the waiter ushered us to "our table" and my jaw dropped. There was one tall table, in the middle of the hustle bustle, with tall and very small rotating stools (no back support) and 6 other people already occupying the 3 other sides of the table. We still tried our best to sit down with our legs touching others and our every movement disturbing their meal and vice versa. Sharing tables to that extent, with the servers touching your back every time they move behind you to serve the dishes - I was put off that very moment.   Suddenly a wooden plank for 2 was vacated - We requested to be reseated there - the waitress politely told us that the plank was being transformed into a plank of 3 (Are yo ukidding me!) We did go on to try the so raved about dishes like watermelon salad, lychee martini and shrimp but nothing was really out of this world. It was different but not heavely different to be paying 70 bucks for 3 small Tapas dishes and sitting toe to toe with 6 complete strangers. Servers were friendly overall but frankly speaking I could not enjoy my meal because of the "coziness" of this place. We ended up leaving completely disappointed, with our appetite still raving, and went to a different restaurant where we had the "luxury" of getting our own table and ate that celebration dinner. I will never go back  but my advice to Mehta - You are earning 100 bucks per couple - Pls rent a bigger space!
