Blows Geno's out of the water. My fiance shared a cheese steak with onions and cheese wiz at both Pat's and Geno's. Pat's uses the chopped method when it comes to their meat. Pat's is cheaper by 50 cents than Geno's and you get way, way more meat. The bread is also a little chewier and you can actually taste the cheese on this sandwich. Definitely beats out Geno's any day for us Wisconsinites! Just make sure to bring cash!
