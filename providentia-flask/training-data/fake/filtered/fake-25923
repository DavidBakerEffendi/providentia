Paesano's is one of those places that everybody knows about. I only ever hear great things about Pasesano's, most commonly, " best sandwich in Philadelphia." Being the sandwich lover that I am, I had to see for myself. To be entirely honest, after trying their flagship sandwich, the Paesano, with a side of their potatoes, I was a little let down. I ordered my sandwich over the phone, and picked it up, which was super convenient. Arriving in a timely manner, I picked up my sandwich, paid the kind Paesano Folk, and walked back to my close friends apartment in the Northern Liberties. With much excitement and anticipation, I unraveled a pair of soggy buns and a greasy slob of meat in between those said buns. Nevertheless, I ate it as if I've never had a meal in my life, but could only think about those dang soggy buns. Nobody likes soggy buns, it's the equivalent to a wet blanket. My close friend assured me that is was abnormal and that I should go back a few more times to make a better judgement. I 100% believe that statement. The flavors were there, packed with a delicious horseradish sauce and a fried egg, I'm positive that this experience was just a fluke. I will definitely go back to the shop and try it out a few more times. Until then, I'm stuck with the memory of the dreaded soggy buns. Updates will come to this review with each visit.
