Definitely one of the top Latin restaurants in the area.   Decor and Vibe in this place is fun and energetic and the staff has always been friendly/Attentive.  It definitely gets crowded during peak dinner hours so reservations are a good idea if you're more than 2 people and even then you will most likely have a wait. Food is always fresh and spot on! Mojitos are some of the best in the neighborhood with a good variety to choose from. The brunch here is great as well and less crowded than dinner so highly recommend.
