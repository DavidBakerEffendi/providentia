I am really saddened by the rude treatment I received at Fort Defiance this a.m. I walked into a virtually empty place at around 10 a.m.  Other than the three preoccupied staff members, I was the sole patron.  Two women worked behind the bar and were chit chatting about how "hot" their last customer was and the one male employee was refilling his lemonade.  None of them acknowledged me -- not a smile, a "hello" or anything resembling a pleasantry.  It made me so sad because A) I was the ONLY ONE IN THE JOINT and b) this is a new place that should be taking great lengths to make the locals feel welcome.  This is a local place.  I am a paying customer.  With so  many new places opening on Van Brunt, I think Fort Defiance should be cognizant of their first impression on loyal customers.  I left, no one even noticed, and headed to my tried and true stand by...Baked.  Their coffee is actually tastier.
