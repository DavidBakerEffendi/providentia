Love it here! After going out to eat every night for the last two months- (literally eating everywhere) I finally landed in a spot that made me completely satisfied. After my first visit I ate here 4 times in a row. Yes, that good! The food is clean, flavorful, unique- simple, but not boring, satisfying- perfect. You feel like you are getting a homemade meal, prepared with quality and integrity- and leave feeling 100% content. The quality of the food and the ingredients are all healthy... so you feel good. The wine list is all organic and well chosen. The desserts are amazing (also homemade) The service is also very attentive and good. The vibe is laid back and cool, not pretentious, but refined. A must go for the perfectly cozy dining experience!
