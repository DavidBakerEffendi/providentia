From the decor to the 5 star pizza, lombardi's is a must go to. My boyfriend took me here a few years ago and he regrets it 'cause now i drag him out every week, they certainly beat artichoke on 14st, which has now become more grease than cheese, lombardi's plating is lovely and offers a nice array of pizza crust choices and family style plating. The walls have lovely framing and window seating is refreshing during the spring days
