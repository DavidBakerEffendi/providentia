New to yelp, but had to take the time to write a bit about this diamond in the ruff! Being just a few blocks away, I am elated to have such a fine place close by. However I would travel the distance to dine at the monkey. I've stopped in a handful of times since they've opened and always left full and satisfied. The ambience is romantic and fun while the service is always attentive and welcoming. There is this cheerful blonde waitress whose name I can't recall, that makes us feel like family each time we come in. She remembered our wine of choice the second time we came in! (The Malbec on their menu is wonderful by the way.) All of this combined with their delicious food menu make this a great place to check out. I recommend the shrimp curry dish!
