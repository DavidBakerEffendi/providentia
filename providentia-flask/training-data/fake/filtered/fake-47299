This place is owned and operated by the same bunch that run the dinosaur The Cornerstone in Hillsdale. Â Having had extensive interaction with one particular owner in the past, I can't imagine why this venue would be any better. No wonder the original place, Fairfield Tavern failed. They're not restaurant people, they're purely in it for whatever monies that can shake you down for. Same awful, sub-par food. Same clueless, vapid bar staff and the same untrained management.
