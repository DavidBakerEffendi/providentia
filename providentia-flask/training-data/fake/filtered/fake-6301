Another nice addition to the Vietnamese sandwich family of the East Village. I had the Classic and as far as the sandwich goes, it was delicious and right there with NIcky's, maybe slightly better. I need to have it a second time before I can come to my full verdict. It's definitely a bigger sandwich than the average banh mi, which I loved, as I find that I'm usually still hungry after Nicky's etc. The bread at Bon Mi Zon makes the sandwich as good as it is. Its small, but very nice and clean inside. The husband and wife owners are very friendly and talkative and find real joy in their cuisine. I will definitely be adding this to my list of regulars
