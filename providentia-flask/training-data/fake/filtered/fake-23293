My wife and I went here for our First Anniversary, and it was a wonderful treat.  We couldn't make up our mind on where to eat, had finally settled on the Cheesecake Factory, only to find it was a 70+ minute wait.  We decided to stroll around West Hartford Center, and came across Grant's.  We were told it was a 20 minute wait without a reservation, not bad for a Saturday night. My wife got a Dark n' Stormy, and I had the mojito with fresh native blueberries.  Both were excellent, and generous pours.   We shared the Northeast Artisanal Cheeses as a first course, and they were all wonderful, and elegantly presented. My wife had the Pistachio Crusted Idaho Trout, and a side of the "Creamless creamed corn."  Both were wonderful. I had the Roast Duck Breast, med-rare.  It was tender, juicy and flavorful; one of the best ducks I have ever had.  I paired it with a pink that I can't find on their wine list online, but was very pleasant. We were both too stuffed for desert, instead just getting a coffee and tea.  I wish I could have sampled the Scotch menu, which was full of most of my favorites, but I was too stuffed/sleepy to give them the attention they deserved. All in all, the bill came to a bit over $100, after taxes and tip, which is a great deal for the quality of the food, and the great service from the staff.   We will eating here again, at least for next year's anniversary, but hopefully before.
