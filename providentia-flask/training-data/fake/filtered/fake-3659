Along with all the great food and living up to the hype, here's what set them apart:  My friend and I had a great dinner and were chatting at the end of our meal.  Our plates were sitting in front of us for a while (but not a crazy amount of time) so I asked if they wouldn't mind clearing them.  When we ordered our dessert, the busboy brought out a second one (pecan pie sundae, which was AMAZING) and said that was because they didn't clear our plates quickly.  That was one classy move.  Other restaurants should really take that cue.
