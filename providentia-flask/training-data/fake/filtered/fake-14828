The ambiance of the place is very nice for the location. I went for lunch to finally try this place out since I drive by all the time before work. VERY DISAPPOINTED!! Soul Food is known for its delicious home-style feel and served in abundance. I ordered BBQ Chicken Mac&cheese and Collard Greens (2 Favorite sides), i noticed walking out the container felt very light but made no fuss about it. When i got to my office and opened it up i just shook my head. There was one bbq chicken breast and small scoop of both sides. The mac and cheese already looked like it had been sitting for days and they just decided to pop it in the microwave for me but i still gave it a chance. THE WORST mac&Cheese i've ever had served at a soul food joint. Played around with the chicken for a bit and ate the Collards but for the price smh I feel bad for the customers. I do not mind spending money on decent food ...this wasnt even decent. The waitress/host was very nice though and there was a bar and I've heard they make good drinks so go there for a few cocktails but def. dont go and spend Dinner $$ Sorry guys
