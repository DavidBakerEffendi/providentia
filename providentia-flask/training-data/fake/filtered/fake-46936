Maialino deleted my previous review, stating that they treat minority customers poorly. Hey Maialino, enjoy reading this and paying yelp to remove this review again. Went here last week.  worst service ever. terribly rude.  white supremacy extreme.  Do not be fooled by the average of 4 stars!!! If there is one think i hate more than Maialino, is liars.  Maialino, you are a liar! This place is completely overrated, does not deserve 4 stars, deserves -100 stars.  Seriously over priced.  not welcoming.  Very rude. Maialino doesn't even make fresh made pasta. Sincerely, Your #1 Hater
