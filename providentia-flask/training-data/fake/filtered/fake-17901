My family has been going to Giotto's for years.  It used to be much, much better. I'm not sure what has happened in the past year or so, but the quality of the food has gone down the tubes.  It is certainly not what it used to be.   For the best Italian food in the area... five years ago, we'd all say hands-down Giotto's.  Now?  It isn't even in the running.   Everything on the menu from specials to appetizers is just "eh... ok."  It's nothing spectacular.   When we want great Italian food... we go elsewhere.
