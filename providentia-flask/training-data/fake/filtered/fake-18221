Why 5 Stars?  Finally!  That's why!!  I've been living in this area for 15 years.  Compared to other pubs in the area, I really feel like it brings the whole package.  I've been going for a few months now.  So, I've become somewhat of a regular.  The food seems like it gets better every time I go in there.  I had specials last night:  The appetizer was Mahi Mahi Bites.  They were pan seared and had a perfect little kick to them.  The Filet Mignon was one of the best cuts of steak I've had in some time.     The service was top notch as well.  Kudos to AJ!  He knows I can be demanding, and always remains on top of his game.  Lastly, the beer.  I'm a beer guy.  I probably make it to the "V-I" like once a week.  Every time I go in, there's new and interesting beers there.  They have like 30 different beers on tap!  Right up my alley.  During football season, I was super-impressed.  There was always a pretty big crowd there. But, I never had a hard time getting a seat at the bar or a table. It seems like no matter where I sat in there, I had a great view of at least some of the TVs.  It's a great place to watch a game - definitely the best place in the area.  They just started doing a Happy Hour I know too.  So, this is my first Yelp review.  The "V-I" inspired me to make it!!
