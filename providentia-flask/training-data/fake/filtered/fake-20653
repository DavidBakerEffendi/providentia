A seat at the bar (assuming you are no more than two is the best spot). The lobster bisque was amazing - not too creamy, nice and hot. The black label burger is worth the $26 - get it as they serve it with carmelized onions and no cheese (I don't typically like onions but these were perfect). The spot was crowded but good vibe.
