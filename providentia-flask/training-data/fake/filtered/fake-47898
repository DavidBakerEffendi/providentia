If you are searching for authentic, exquisite Greek food look no further. This is a Mediterranean gem. Having vacationed in Greece numerous times I was  shocked to find something comparable in New Jersey. Offering a menu that boasts an array of appetizers that beg to be shared, fresh seafood, grilled meats, and traditional Greek dishes, there is something for everyone. Also please make sure to leave room for dessert, the pastries and cakes are as good as it gets...seriously.  The waitstaff is friendly and attentive. The ambiance warm and welcoming. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who has an appreciation for fresh, quality ingredients prepared the right way, you will not be disappointed.
