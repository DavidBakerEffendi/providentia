This was my first time coming here, I decided on the L.A burger. It was absolutely delicious, I also ordered onion rings. They were beer battered, thick, and lightly crisp. Everything was delicious, all the staff were really nice. I have to agree with some others that for a burger it was a bit expensive- that's why I didn't give the extra star. The plate it was served on was a little cheap looking and I expected a better presentation of the food for the price. I got onion rings a beer and burger for $15.00 which is ok but this place to me is like fast food still, despite the restaurant vibe, it's just burgers folks- made in 5 min. but honestly to get good service and enjoy a burger without comprising my environment , it's worth the extra dollars if you have it !
