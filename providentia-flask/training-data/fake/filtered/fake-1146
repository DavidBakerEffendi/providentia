So, 62 beers on tap......um yes please!  City Tap House is a great place for a great beer and a bite!  The beer selection is amazing, with the likes of Russian River Pliny The Elder, Brewworks Hopsolutely, and Hitochino, just to name a few!  The beer list is constantly changing, and they often have exclusive beers that NO ONE else in Philly gets! The out door fire pits are great for grabbin a beer and hanging with friends, but fill up fast (first come first serve). The food is nouveau gastro-pub and quite good.  Here are some highlights: 10 spice dry rub wings---AWESOME, slow roasted for like 5 hours at low temp, so they get crispy but stay juicy!  Served with a housemade Bluecheese Ranch dipping sauce. Calamari-Buttermilk battered with jalapeno peppers with awesome basil aoli and thai chilli dipping sauces. Sweet potatoe fries-They soak them in a vanilla brine before frying them so they come out candied!   Med Plate- Hummus, feta, roasted peppers, olives, cumin yogurt cucumbers, and homemade flatbread-a real winner with a big group! The Pizzas are also great made from scratch, my fav is the Tartuffo-a white pie with portabella , crimini, and button mushrooms.  It is topped with a open-face egg, has Tellagio cheese, and is drizzeled black truffle oil!  You can add Guanciale--High end Italian bacon (similar to pork belly) I highly recommend it! The Burger's amazing, housemade from shortrib and brisket and you can actually get it RARE to MED-RARE! YAY! The Grouper is delicious with a pesto sauce that can't be beat. The Ribs are quite good, dry rubbed and done in a calvados based bbq sauce served with slaw and fries. Always find out the specials, they do some pretty original stuff for such a large venue. (Duck Cassoulet AND Oatmeal Stout Braised Lamb Shanks) I find the best time to visit is during the week in the evening or on Sundays.   CTH definitely worth checking out!
