Came with a friend on some reccomendations the other night.  My friend is one of those people who always wants to modify dishes on the menu (less salt, different sides, degrees of cooking, ect.), but tonight she was pretty tame and just asked for onions on her burger, the chef was not having it at all and I didn't envy the poor watiress who had to deliver the news... It was mildly difficult to eat here as a vegan (but the place is called The Spotted Pig, so fair enough).  I ended up ordering a mixed vegetable plate which had beets in it (which I hate, but remember, no alterations...) but I thought I could just eat around them.  Wrong.  They were all cooked together and so the beets flavored everything else and I couldn't finish the plate.  Probably should have just ordered a bunch of sides for dinner but whatever...
