Very over priced.   I ordered  the lobster bisque. $9.00 and you have to order a bowl. It was watery and 2 little pcs of lobster.  I asked the waitress about it and she said they put other spices in it.  I would have asked to speak to the manager, but I was out with my niece and did not want to spoil her dinner.  I don't think I will go back.
