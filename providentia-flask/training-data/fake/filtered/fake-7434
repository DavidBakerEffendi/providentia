I was not disappointed. The setting has a very European look and feel. I was with a party of 8 and we all tried different appetizers and entr√©es. The prosciutto and cheese plate was absolutely delicious. We even ordered the pig face because we were curious about this dish. Yes, a whole pig face came out on the plate. I have to admit that it was chewy and a bit fatty. In turns out the name Maialino means "piglet". This now all makes sense. I had the rabbit and pasta dish. My pasta was overcooked but the sauce was balanced and the rabbit was very tender. For the main course, I had the roasted lamb and it was delicious. It was cooked medium and had rosemary and a touch of sea salt. i really enjoyed my meal. I didn't give the restaurant 5 stars because some of the other pasta dishes I tasted were overcooked. Otherwise, the flavors were great. The service was also excellent and it is a fun place. You definitely don't feel like you are on top of other patrons. This restaurant was well designed.
