I give it only three stars because my expectations were higher based on others reviews.  I was pleased that the place wasn't as pretentious or Brooklyny as I feared.  They obviously didn't waste money on the decor. Of course the food is the reason for going.  I had the fried chicken on a biscuit.  The chicken was pretty tasty, I like the hot/sweet sauce it was coated in and the exterior was crisp but still moist inside.  But as a southerner I have no problem telling you that the biscuit was pretty dreadful - extremely dense and tasted like nothing.  For the record, tasting like salt and butter is good, as is flakiness.  If they had better biscuits, I would give them 4 stars. Prices are good and service was good too.  I'm also excited to hear rumors about a ping pong table :)
