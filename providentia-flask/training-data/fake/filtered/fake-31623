RIDICULOUSLY DELICIOUS FOOD AND COCKTAILS! Blend on the Water exceeded my expectations and I would recommend it to anyone visiting New York (and I would go a little bit early, so you can take some pictures outside before you sit down). It's worth the train ride to see the view and taste the fabulous food by Chef Kevin. The restaurant is more than just a fine dining establishment - it's an experience and a feast for the eyes and the palette. The hospitality shown by Lance and the front of house staff was beyond, and we had some of the most amazing cocktails by John at the bar. Bring your appetite, because you will want to order everything on the menu, and believe me, you will finish every bite! I would highly recommend the Nachos, Skirt Steak, Salmon...and everything else. BRAVO, Blend on the Water, you truly impressed this foodie!
