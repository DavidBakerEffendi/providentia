Cookshop is my neighborhood (comfort zone) go to. Service is always reliable food is quite delicious. My only complaint now is getting a table these days with the influx of highline tourists is a bummer. Waiting 30-45 minutes w/o res and showing up early w/res hoping to get seated earlier no dice for dinner. I also love the lunch Chicken Salad is the best.
