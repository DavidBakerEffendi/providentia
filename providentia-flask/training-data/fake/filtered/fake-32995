Very nice staff, very friendly cozy atmosphere. Owner came right up and introduced herself and chatted. Food was excellent, amble supply of freshly made chips and salsa. Portions terrific. Prices decent. Would have given it a 5 but I dont give those out easily. Parking is fair and a little too small sitting space but that is also what makes it cozy.
