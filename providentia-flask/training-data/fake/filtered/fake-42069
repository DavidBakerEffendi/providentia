Worst pizza EVER!! I should have gotten a clue when they told me they don't have garlic bread. What kind of italian pizza place doesn't have garlic bread?? First, the pizza arrived cold. The pizza was soft and flimsy with cheese sporadically placed on top. Yes, the whole slice was not covered in cheese. I actually considered pulling out a slice cheese from my fridge and putting it on top of the slice. We also ordered a house salad..... I am not even going to get into that! I cannot believe this place has four stars.
