I love, love, love this restaurant for a delicious meal, but in the past year the service has gone from bad to worse. I live in the neighborhood and go about twice a month. The food is incredible but I really hope the management realizes there is a definite decline in service. There seems to be plenty of staff, yet no one has assigned tables or duties. And, I know this seems silly, but they no longer serve ice! Who wants room temperature water? Put some damn ice in my glass. So, overall, you will get an insanely good meal if you don't mind some insanely frustrating service.
