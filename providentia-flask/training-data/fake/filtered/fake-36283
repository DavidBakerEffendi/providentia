My group of friends had a great night here, better than the dinner plans that also go 4 stars on yelp. I didn't try the food here, but we stood at the bar all night with cocktails in hand and got to unexpectedly sing two songs. It was a great night! I'm taking away one star because I feel like our experience wasn't the typical treatment at this bar. We had a great bartender who made the drinks strong and snuck us in to sing the first song (even after they were telling people they were booked... which was probably around 11:30pm). After that, the karaoke guy came over and said "wow great song choice! you can sing another one if you want!" so we did... but I feel like everyone else's song got pushed back. If it wasn't for that one bartender and the karaoke guy our night probably would've been like any other night out at the bar.
