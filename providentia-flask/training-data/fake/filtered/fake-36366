Beautiful restaurant, and the food was very good. The wine list is extensive, but the first page lists "featured" wines, which I found helpful (although, at the same time I had to wonder if these were bottles they were trying to get rid of). We narrowed it down to two selections the waiter recommended, and then he brought us samples of each to make our final choice. The bartender recommended the raw yellowtail app and the black maccheroni, both of which our table ordered. Both were excellent. The yellowtail tasted light, fresh, and clean. The black maccheroni was the highlight of the evening. Delicate seafood flavors, just enough vegetable to brighten the dish, and exquisite pasta. We also got the famed spaghetti, which had very nicely balanced flavors, but the dish is perhaps overhyped. The sea bass entree was a little bland, with only 4 gnocchi, which seemed stingy. Overall, a really pleasant experience. I'd go back.
