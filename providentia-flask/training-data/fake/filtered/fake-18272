Orient Â  is the best Chinese restaurant in the upper valley ! I love General T'so chicken and there is a lot of variety to choose from. The service is good too ! I ordered the Sushi Deluxe and the waiter told me that I could choose any roll I want. I think that's a very good idea ! Try it and I know you will love it as much as I do !
