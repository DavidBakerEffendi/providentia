If you want a REAL cheesteak hoagie, this is the place to go.  I used to live only a couple blocks away and I really do miss the succulent chopped meat, melted cheese and fried onions sizzled on the grill to perfection a few times a week.  Now I have to take Septa to get there but I know if I want it done right it's time to hop on that bus.
