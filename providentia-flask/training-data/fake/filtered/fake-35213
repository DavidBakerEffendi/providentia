Gaia Italian cafe was great! The atmosphere was warm and cozy, and definitely reminded us of Italy, where we had recently been. The cappuccino was robust, served in a generous size cup, and cheap. The flakey crust pastry had a big burst of warm chocolate in it, and the cookie the owner brought to us to try was delicious. All homemade, as were the Italian-style sandwiches, which we did not sample because it was morning. This is an authentic Italian coffee bar, in the heart of the lower east side.
