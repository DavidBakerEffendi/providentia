Fantastic food. Was there with family and mom in law. She herself is a great cook. But she was amazed with the food quality that she has never had here in US. The Spinach Peas Paratha was a hit with my boys. Mom in law had Rajma with Rice. Me and my wify did Tandoorn Chicken, Keema naan and Mutton Kolhapuri. To top it all mango lassi. Was surprised to see how thick the lassi was. I remembered my good old days in Mumbai (Kailas Mandir in dadar). Have never had lassi that good in US. The food was a bit on spicier side. But I like it better than bland anytime. All in all excellent experience. Thanks Ravi for sharing the restaurant with us. Would love to visit again in our next trip.
