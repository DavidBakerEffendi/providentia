This restaurant is awful. The pub is even worse. Very unappetizing and not fresh looking, poor presentation and specials that really were not special...They try to change the special offers frequently because the business is doing so poorly. Be wary of some of the glowing reviews...I'm am reasonably sure they are of people that work there or are connected to the owners... Just awful...
