I think it is important to understand what the Corner Bistro is: an old school NYC dive bar serving really good burgers.   The package really works.  Now, it ain't fancy and it doesn't want to be. Stand alone I have had better burgers, but that's not it.  Note, it is not obvious a pure foodie who doesn't dig this type of atmosphere would like it.  Also, a few points to mention relative to other reviews: a) I sat at the bar so have no idea about table service complaints, b) At lunch was not crowded, and imagine late night experience would be completely different c) McSorley Dark was cheap, but original.   Best explanation to come to mind: Think about having a burger in a shopping mall food gallery and invert everything.
