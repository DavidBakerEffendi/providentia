I was there this weekend, with my two children, and husband. When i walked in, the hostess at the front desk was very polite! My server was Christine, and she was AWESOME! She was very informative about dishes off of the menu, including the signature drinks; and she was amazing with my children. The food was OK, the pad thai could've been better. However, My overall service was great, and my family and I really enjoyed it. Next time we will be trying the table top bbq!
