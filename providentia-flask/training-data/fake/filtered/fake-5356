Faithfully customer for 3 years. I just love this place, love the food, and the atmosphere. I just can't understand some of these reviews.smh You a 5 star in my eyes. I've never been disappointed. My favorites are the chopped bbq, the deliciously clean chitterlings, pig feet to die for, and the chicken and pork chops just melt in your mouth. And don't forget the cornbread, the best cornbread I've ever had. Greens made just right. Everything is so delicious.
