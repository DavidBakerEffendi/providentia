We happened to go there for dinner after walking around Church street.  What a nice surprise!  The service was very friendly and good paced.  The place is very charming and French looking.  The food was delicious!  Their  house butter which came with the bread was amazing!  It's a great value for what you get.  I would definitely go back!
