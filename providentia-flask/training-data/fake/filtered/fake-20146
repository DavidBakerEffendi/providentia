Went here a week or so ago with my wife we use to order the food but when received it was soggy and wet. Lately we have been receiving the food and it has been lacking in flavor. It tastes different from when they were in there old location. We went to the new location recently to see if the experience would be better. This place went from ok to horrible the lady at cashier gave the a bad attitude and they charged me extra for some tartar sauce. They say the food is fresh when it is really not. Everything is frozen. We definitely will not be going back. This place is nothing like the original chippery in Fanwood.
