My husband and I love eating at this restaurant.  The food is delicious and the service is friendly and efficient.  So when it was time to plan my daughter's bridal shower, I thought it would be fun and different to have Thai food for a home party.  After a great tasting, I ordered trays, which included chicken satay and tofu curry, which were perfectly prepared and came with jasmine rice, peanut sauce, pickled vegetables, etc. in separate containers.  It made a beautiful and delicious buffet.  Everyone raved about the food and kept saying it was such a nice change from the usual salmon and chicken!
