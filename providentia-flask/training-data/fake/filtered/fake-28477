The food was good.  The basket of bread came out nice an warm.  They were accompanied with good olive oil.  Yumm.  We started off with the sweet and spicy calamari appetizer ($12) because it received a lot of good reviews.  When we got it, we felt the breading was not refined enough for the price we paid.  It was also a little too sweet for our taste.  When it came to the main course, we ordered both of the house specialties.  They were the Rack of Lamb ($33) and the Duck Confit ($26).  Both were good, but for the price we paid, the food could have been prepared better.  For example, my lamb came out medium well instead of medium rare as I requested.  My boyfriends duck was very overcooked.  On the bright side, there was some charring on the outside of the lamb and duck, so we thought that was a nice detail.  Then for dessert, we had the rainbow carrot cake ($8.95).  There was nothing fantastic about the cake.  The only "rainbow" resemblance was the green dyed pistachio ice-cream and several blueberries and one sliced strawberry.  Overall, we felt it was good, but definitely overpriced.  For $105 (tax and tip included), we could have gotten a fantastic meal somewhere else.
