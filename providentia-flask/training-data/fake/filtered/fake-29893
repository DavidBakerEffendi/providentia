I wish I could give this place more than 3 stars but. I just can't. Although the food is amazing and it is one of my favorite Thai places, the service is just too slow. My family and I usually go there on a Saturday night before the rush comes in, 6pm to be exact and we wont leave until 9pm. It's ridiculous. So if you are in a rush I would say, don't go to this place BUT if you have the time and don't mind having a very long Thai dinner, this is the place to go. To add: I REALLY wish they had a parking lot, trying to find parking in Rutherford is really difficult during the dinner hours.
