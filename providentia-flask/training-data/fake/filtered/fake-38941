I am a regular customer. Waited for 30 minutes for a table outside. Had a regular dinner. Had the check. Finished our conversation for another 5 minutes thereafter, but the waitress asked us to leave as "we need the table and the kitchen is about to close". At 9:30 PM. Really nice. I'd rather call it rude and ridiculous. You better get a new waitress.
