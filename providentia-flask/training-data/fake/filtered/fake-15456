We were seated immediately, in a nice corner table.  Things got a little rocky when the food came - my salad wedge came at the same time as our meals.  My ribs were luke-warm, and my wife's salmon smelled fishy.  When we told the waitress, the manager came over immediately and made things right, offering another menu selection for my wife and heated ribs for me.  The waitress was very attentive throughout the process, so everythingthing ended out OK.
