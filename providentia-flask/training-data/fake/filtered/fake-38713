A wonderful and welcome addition to HK and 10th Avenue!  Took my parents here and had a great experience.  The entire staff is knowledgeable, kind, and entertaining.  Our server, Sarah, is especially exceptional!  All the food was fantastic and have no complaints!  Definitely recommend the fresh bread.
