Tried over 10 times to order a gift certificate for 2 for what I thought was a good price $400.  Tried their "gift certificate line" over a 2 day period and got no answer.  Spoke to  numerous people and all were nice, but useless.  They keep on referring you to the web site for gift certificates, but do not follow through.   Any body in charge here?
