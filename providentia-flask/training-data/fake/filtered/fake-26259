The good-ish news: I was drawn in by the bar and the cooking-as-spectacle. The air is stuffy and smells strongly because the kitchen is in the middle of the dining area, but that too can feel very authentic. The food they grill in front of you isn't bad either- sometimes its great- but thats all the do, take simple, singular ingredients and grill them, which seems not worth the money most of the time. The bad news: First off, if you can't sit at the bar, don't bother eating here at all. They made a big fuss about how long we had to wait for a table, when in truth the whole enterprise was just poorly organized- we walked by 5 empty tables the same size as ours when we were finally seated, many of which remained abandoned. The service was friendly but ignored us for long periods of time. I've eaten here twice and found the food exceedingly balnd, but this past time was the worst- my sister and I ordered 4 appetizers figuring that would be at least sort of filling. The fluke was tasteless, the dumplings were super bland, the cheese plate the most disgusting thing I've ever tasted, and the edamame mushy. All the portions we re miniscule, and we paid around 9-10$ for each (edamame $5). We've been fuming about our experience ever since. Not cool.
