This was the worst. I have never, NEVER sat at Â a restaurant for 20 minutes before ANYONE decided to talk to me. Not a busser, a waiter, or the manager, with the all important headset, decided to come over for a visit. The sad thing is, is that the restaurant was probably at 1/3 capacity - meaning there were enough people to notice who wasn't attended to, and not enough to be swamped. After the 20 minutes my boyfriend and I walked out (having only water) and not one person said anything to us as we left. Reading the reviews gave a false positive - it was the worst experience I've had.
