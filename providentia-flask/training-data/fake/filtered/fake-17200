to mary ellen l.  i happened to be at the next table with my wife and kids when u proceeded to abuse the waitress even while doing back flips to accomodate you.  i also had the pork chops (my favorite) which were excellent!!  you were loud and rude and the whole restaurant was talking about u after u left!! maybe u should learn to manners on how to treat staff in restaurants before you review restaurants. anthony c.
