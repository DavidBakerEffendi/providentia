Last night was amazing. I have been wanting to try them since they opened and this was the first chance. Would recommend to anyone who loves sushi. The fish was beyond fresh. The recommended appetizer special out of the ballpark. The service was impecible. Definitely worth the trip. Kim Wethersfield, CT
