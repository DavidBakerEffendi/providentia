How to make Totto Ramen a decent shack: 1. If you're going to serve pork with my ramen, put more in there than two wafer-thin silver-dollar-sized cuts of super-fatty pork. 2. Increase the noodle-to-broth ratio. I ran out of noodles about halfway down my bowl's broth. 3. Make it veggie-friendly. My sister's vegetarian bowl's vegetables looked very, very, very old. Like they'd ran out of ingredients and had some poor schlub run back to the walk-in and scrounge up anything that looked like a vegetable. Inexcusable, to me, when your restaurant is about a week old. The veggies couldn't be that gross already unless you tried! 4. For chrissakes, don't add a dollar on for an egg for a vegetarian bowl. You're already raping us with the $11 pricetag for broth with crappy vegetables. Man up and give up the egg. Overall, pretty darn disappointing, especially since I live literally 20 yards away. I'll give it another try in a couple of months, but for now - I'll stick with prepackaged Ichiban ramen for $.75 (and no 40 minute wait).
