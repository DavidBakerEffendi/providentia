Food is pretty good, service can be a little on the slower side. However they make the food fresh to order, so it's worth the wait! Chicken Tikka Masala is yummy though has been a little greasy a couple times, and Garlic Naan could use a little more garlic, but I'm a huge garlic lover so that might be part of it! Love that they have brown basmati rice!
