This is one of the few restaurants in NYC where I am willing to wait 2 hours on a saturday night for a table.  The service is always great and the food comes out pretty quickly once you get to sit down at your table.   As for the ramen...it is definitely my favorite in the city (sorry momofuku) and the same goes for the pork buns.  I find myself dreaming about those pork buns for a solid week after I eat at ippudo.  Pork bun addiction.  The noodles in the ramen are always cooked to perfection and the broth is always seasoned to perfection. I like how theres always a special ramen, not sure if its weekly or daily, but its always phenomenal!   No doubt that I'll be back, over and over.
