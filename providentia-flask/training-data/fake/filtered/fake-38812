Wow, what a great new addition to a mostly culinary challenged Brooklyn Heights.  This place has everything a Brooklyn cafe should.. laid back vibe, tin ceilings, cool friendly staff and most importantly great locally sourced ingredients.  I had a breakfast baguette and could have eaten 2 more.. not that it was small.  Just so delicious with hard boiled eggs, surryama ham, cheddar, homemade salsa on a crunchy italian loaf.  Can't wait to return to try some of their other sandwiches!  Bravo.
