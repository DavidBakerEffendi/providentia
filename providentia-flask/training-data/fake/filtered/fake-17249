I went to the DaVinci Room on Broadway in Bayonne, N.J. It was absolutely amazing! The atmosphere, ambiance, service and food was spectacular. Everything was so delicious and very reasonably priced. I had the $20 pre fix menu, which is an absolute steal when you consider the delicious food being served at this fine dining establishment. I have been there 3 times already and I am determined to try everything on the menu. I come from Staten Island, and it is totally worth the drive. the restaurants out here are not what they used to be. Manhattan quality food and atmosphere without the traffic, congestion and high prices. The DaVinci Room is a gem.
