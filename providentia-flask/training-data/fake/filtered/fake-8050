Can't go wrong here!  The crostini is awesome! Order all of them, there's only 7 to choose from and they're $3 bucks each.  All the pasta is fresh and homemade....and trust me, you can tell the difference between fresh pasta and boilded pasta.  Everything is so fresh, simple yet absolutely delicious!
