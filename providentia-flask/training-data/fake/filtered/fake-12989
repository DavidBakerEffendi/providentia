Integrity means everything. When I went to this place with my tourist friend, the waiter included tip in the first receipt without letting us know. And on the second receipt, it said "pre-tip amount" and induced us to tip them again. Had I not checked the first receipt, I would've tipped the waiter twice. I called the owner and complained it, but she did not even apologize. To check if they always include tip in the first receipt, I went there again with local friends, and they did not. I wonder how many tourist have been deceived to tip them twice which ends up about 40% of the food price.
