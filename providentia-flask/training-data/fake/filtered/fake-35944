Roberta's is undergoing a serious case of resting on its laurels. Having lived in Bushwick for several years, I'm grateful for any good place, especially one as ecologically and locally concerned as Roberta's is. However, I feel every time I go the food keeps getting more and more "meh". Recently, the always satisfying Bibb Lettuce salad was lacking on the toppings and the kick. The daily special pizza we had was basically sparse meat crumbles on a sparingly sauced pie. Also, the last few waitresses we've had have been almost annoyed to even be working. I get the cool, Brooklyn shtick but in a world where 20% is just expected, try a little harder. A smile never killed anyone. All this aside, its still a great hang out spot in summer. Maybe by the time the garden thaws, they'll be back on the ball.
