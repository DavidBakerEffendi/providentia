Every time we head up north to visit family, we stop at Rutt's Hut. I remember being intimidated by the look of a Ripper as a kid because I had never seen a hotdog that looked like that. These are absolutely some of the greatest hotdogs you will ever come by. The flavor combined with the crunch of a Ripper is an experience I can't describe, you've gotta try it for yourself.
