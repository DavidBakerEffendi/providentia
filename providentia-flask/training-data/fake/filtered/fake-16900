Those little dishes add up fast, but boy, are they good! I've been here for lunch several times and it generally averages about $20 -30 per person without wine. The dishes are on the smaller side, but I actually like this because I can taste more things. The Coq au Vin was delicious! The bread and olive oil were great. The lemon aid, especially with their add-ins was good. Tartines are little toasts with toppings. For $7 you get 2 pieces, the size of a baguette that has been sliced. Hazelnut pesto with orange zest was OK, maybe a touch dry and salty. The seasonal heirloom tomato salad was amazing. The beet salad was also outstanding. Carrot cake was fine but nothing special. I preferred the chocolate mousse with fresh, home made whipped cream. Super rich, great for sharing. The water glasses are tiny. Evey the carafe they give you (sometimes) is miniature, and it is a bit annoying to want some water but not want to bother the waiter (who can't be found anyway) to fill the carafe for the 4th time . Bigger glasses and carafes would be nice and would give the staff one less thing to worry about. The service is uneven, from efficient and helpful to MIA. One day I was there and got the full run down of specials but noticed the people who sat down at the next table did not. Jody Williams was a trip. She was yelling and directing her staff one afternoon but it seemed to result in more chaos and less service. Service can definitely be a weak spot here. But the food is a strong spot, and I'd rather have good food and lackluster service than bad food served impeccably.
