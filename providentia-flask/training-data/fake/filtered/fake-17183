Khasiyat....serves the finest variety of parathaas...they almost serve around 50 diff varieties...onion and broccoli being my favorite...never tasted this combo before...parathas are served hot and stuffing is real fresh..bhel and vada pav are my other personal favorites.Though the place is congested is worth visiting for its delicious food....:D
