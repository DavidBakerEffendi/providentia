I went to Soco with my best friend just a random lunch date. We waited about 30 minutes for seating. There was a very large crowd of people waiting. We finally was seated and we had a great waiter and he was very patient and helpful with us making a selection since it was our first time. I would lying if I said I remember the name of the drink I had but it had cranberries in it and a good amount of liquor. I ordered the red velvet waffle with the fried chicken which was great. The chicken was well done and the waffle wasn't to sweet. My friend ordered the the bbq chicken with mash potatoes which i did sample of course lol and it was great. We also had the bake mac and cheese which was bubbling hot when brought to the table and it was amazing. The only thing I'm not fancy of is the size of the restaurant it is very small, but overall i love this place.
