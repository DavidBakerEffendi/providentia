Relatively new place. Very clean (first thing I notice). Great waitstaff- very friendly. We had sammies- the bread is delish, and really makes them special. Despite the fact that it's NOT a Spanish food place, I had a whim for the Cubano. I was glad I did. Pork was marinated, juicy and tasted authentico. My daughter had a chicken sandwich, which was good,  but the best was an eggplant parm sandwich. Very tasty,not greasy, and  not overwhelmed with mozzerella and sauce. Will definitely come back for seconds.
