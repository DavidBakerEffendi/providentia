I LOVE this place!  Bright and airy with a very upbeat vibe! Their wood-oven baked pizza, superb. Thin crust, and created and baked right in the dining area.  Another favorite is their 'special' salad put together with field greens, pears, pineapple, goat cheese, dried cranberries, candied walnuts, finished with a raspberry-coconut water vinaigrette.  DELICIOUS!  Attached is a nice bar, with several hi-def TVs.  Also need to note that Vesta has very nice wine list, serving by the glass or bottle.   Service is good, attentive, but not over bearing.
