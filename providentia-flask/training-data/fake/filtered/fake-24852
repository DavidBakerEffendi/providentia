This is our go-to Mexican place. It's what my husband calls "greasy spoon Mexican" as opposed to "authentic Mexican" or "fine dining Mexican." Think "Chicken taco with refried beans and yellow rice" or "burrito platter with bottomless tortilla chips and salsa!" For what that is, it's fantastic. High cusine it isn't, but it's darn tasty and it makes great leftovers.
