This is the real deal Philly Cheese steak. Wit or witout, make sure you have your order in mind when you step up to the plate. Authentic south Philly spoken here. Look for the imprint of Sylvester Stallone's footprints in the sidewalk....No trip to Philly is complete without a taste of Pats. BTW the hot peppers are really hot!
