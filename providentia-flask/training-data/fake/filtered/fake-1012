In short, horrible. They are always out of something because the new chef is "perfecting" his recipe. The pork ribs are dry and tasteless, although fatty at the ends. Burned on the outside, too pink on part of the inside. ZERO flavor. The mack and cheese is mush and flavorless. The cornbread, averge at best and cold. The chili--ugh! Even the pecan pie was mush topped with pecans. The best thing on the menu was coleslaw. Wost was the corn. I think it soaked in hot water for an hour and had a spice sprinkled on it. Truly AWFUL! Who can't do spicy corn? Go to Cuba Cabana if you want good food. Their corn is FAB! And skip that "Caribbean" place a few blocks up on flatbush, on the corner by Carlton. Seems these new places in Park Slope are for those rich yuppies who want to eat "ethnic" or BBQ, but want it bland. If you like real BBQ, do not go near this place. Â The waitresses are nice though. Also, portions are small--good or bad depending on what you want.
