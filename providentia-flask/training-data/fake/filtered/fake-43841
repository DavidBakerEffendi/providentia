This diner's food is average for what it is--not really offensive, but nothing special either. The service was a little slow, but I wasn't really in a hurry. It really shouldn't have been a terrible experience. The real issue was the decorations. I'm at a restaurant to eat in a nice atmosphere, but I'm generally not that picky. However even I have my limits, and giant pictures of naked women dressed as monarch butterflies is not my idea of appetizing decor.
