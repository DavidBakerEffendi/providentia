Ate at Guild last week with a friend, I had notice how busy it seemed to be so a mid week night seemed like a good opportunity. The fit up inside is top notch and the space does not seem as big as it actually is A plus,but the noise is a different matter. It is noisy! I suspected it would be pricey & it was. At first the service was great. However having order my steak black & blew it came out medium rare. It went back a long with most of my sides I had put on the plate. When the new steak arrived, it was rare all right but it seemed as if it had not been seared properly on the outside. There were no new sides brought! At this point I just ate the steak & left. At the price point it was a disappointing food experience. If I want to go to a lively upscale restaurant with lots going on I might go again. If I just want a great steak I will go else where, there are many better restaurants in the area that offer way better value for money. Mike
