My boyfriend and I live right nearby and have been stopping by since they opened. Overall an excellent restaurant that we use as our staple because we know we're getting amazing quality and service when we're not in the mood to try a new place and risk a negative experience. A great spot for getting together with friends and family, with exceptional food. I personally recommend the frico and the mussels. The waitstaff is charming without being overbearing and the manager is very inviting. Think of it as ilili quality food without the stuffiness.
