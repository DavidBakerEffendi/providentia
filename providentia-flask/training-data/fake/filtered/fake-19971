Overall a positive dining experience. My boyfriend and I wanted a romantic dress to the 9s kinda night which was appropriate there, an eclectic, but nice dress among diners. He had the Wasabi crusted filet and I the pad thai. We had the crab and lobster dim sum to start. Although the food was delicious, it didnt have the value to back the high prices. I recommend the Zen-gria to drink, light and delish. Service was attentive and up to fine dining standards. As well, the restaurant is close to 2nd street and some great choices in bars for later into your evening.
