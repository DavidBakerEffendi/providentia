By far one of the best Halal Food Carts New York has to offer. I would have midnight munchies with friends and we would drive down to the city to grab us a platter of either a lamb, chicken, or combo. What makes it so tasty is the free pouring of sauce. When given our food we get to put the right amount of sauce in our platter before sitting on the side to eat or sealing it for later. The white sauce is delicious and a little hot sauce. There's also BBQ sauce if you want that sweetness flavor. They have been a popular choice towards new yorkers as well as foreigners who wants to see what the fuss is about. Best to go after drinking or when having the munchies for halal food. Enjoy your visit.
