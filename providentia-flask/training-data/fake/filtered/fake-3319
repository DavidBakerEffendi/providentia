This place lives up to the hype. The food is great and the place runs like a well-oiled machine. I live really close by, so I've tried just about everything on the menu at this point. Burgers, hotdogs, fries, corndogs, shakes and concretes are all amazing. Worth checking out if you're in the mood for some fast food!
