The fact that he restaurant is open 24 hrs a day is a great thing, and the inside of the restaurant looks clean and great. Was not impressed with our food at all...my friend's waffle was served called, my other friend's mozzarella + tomato plate was gross, and my first order was not cooked well. I had to order something else, and only to be served something that looked like it came out of the cheapest diner :( Very disappointed and would not recommend this restaurant to those who are used to good food!
