I was visiting my brother in New York for a couple of days and we decided to go out to eat something. As we were driving I asked my brother if he knew a place with a good atmosphere, and he recommended Sanford's. I was not disappointed. As soon as we got there we were greeted by a very friendly and polite staff. I ordered a chicken sandwich, and I have to say, personally it is one of the best I have ever had in my life! Everything was cooked to perfection and I felt like the staff really cared about our experience. I was so overwhelmingly astounded that I decided to make an account on Yelp just to write this review. Go here, you won't regret it! 5/5
