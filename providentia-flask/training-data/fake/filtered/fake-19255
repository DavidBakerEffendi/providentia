The tako wasabi is the best way to eat octopus in this city - so simple and delicious, it prepares you for the flavor explosions you will get with their ramens. Whenever I go, I always try one of their special ramens, and make sure the Classic is also on our order. I also love how welcoming they are, despite their extreme wait times, the staff are always friendly, and sitting at the bar with sake and edamame makes the wait always seem shorter. This is a great suggestion to bring guests from out of town - it is Â a great New York City dining experience.
