This was the worst Cheese Steak I tasted in Philly. If you are from Philly, you do not go here, unless you are pissy drunk in 2:30 in the morning.  Also, they are too expensive.  Off the cheesesteak topic, I also don't like how they have treated some Philly citizens.  However, they have the best marketing team!
