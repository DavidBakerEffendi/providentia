There are few restaurants that lead me to write reviews, but such a poor dining experience has led me to put pen to paper so to speak. The ambience of the restaurant is good and the restaurant is accommodating to children. The appetizers of a wonton chicken soup, Chinese broccoli and veggie spring rolls were all pretty good. However, the entr√©es were very bad. We ordered spicy lemongrass soup. The soup was not spicy and worse, the chicken was bland. Upon asking the waiter about the soup he said it "was not spicy" despite spicy being in THE NAME of the dish. When we asked the waiter to take the dish back, he did so quickly and did not ask if we would prefer another or if he could do anything to help. We also had beef dishes that were better, but still bland. I recommend searching for another place to dine if flavor is your prerogative for the evening.
