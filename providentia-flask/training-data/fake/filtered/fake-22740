Sat at bar for 5 mins never greeted.  Bar tender chatted with every other guest and never even said hello. I was the o my black  patron there at the time. I will make a former complaint.  Time was 10:57am  tues Mar 26 th.  she even asked the guy near to me if he needed anything else as she proceeded to wash glasses As if I was never there.   Racism still as exist and I will not stop reaching the top management until the matter is deal with. I am a very frequent t flier with with hundreds of thousands of miles logged and I have a lot of people who work for me and they are no longer permitted to dine at Champs o my expense.  I look forward to a letter from the manager and I shared my disappointment with other patrons entering and they too turned around and left. A real shame.
