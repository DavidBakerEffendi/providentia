Ive been to this restaurant/wine-bar 3 times. My first two experiences were fantastic. The staff were friendly, courteous and attentive. The food was delicious complimented by some very nice wine. I recall their short ribs being some of the best I've ever had. This weekend I committed the grave error of bringing my parents. I recommend not bringing anyone here over 30 yrs old on a Saturday night. The restaurant-bar had very loud, bothersome music. We couldn't hear each other at a small table. The table they gave us had two of us sitting on the window, about 1/2 foot higher than the other two people at our table. It felt very awkward. It seems that they only have one small oven. Our food was brought to us out of order, appetizers after our entrees ! It took an eternity and the temperature of the food was not very hot. Also, my dad's short ribs apparently were very fatty. He had a very unpleasant look on his face while he ate. Then they didn't accept MC and Visa. which is ok when you are not spending too much, but to have to dish out hundreds of dollars in cash is just annoying. We had to run to the ATM when we got the check. I'm sad to say that I don't think I will return.
