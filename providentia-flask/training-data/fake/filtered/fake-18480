If you sit at the bar, you stare at a lot of bottles of red wines.  If Mr. Meyer were that concerned about hospitality, he would not insult his customers by serving them warm red wine either by the glass or bottle.  Storing red wine at the proper temperature is an elementary wine basic.  Does not Mr. Meyer with all his years as a restauranteur not know this?  Or does he not care and cynically avoid spending some money to properly store his wines?  Either way the customer is doubly gypped by paying for warm wine and being bombarded with the message that this man care so much about their dining experience.   The food is fine.
