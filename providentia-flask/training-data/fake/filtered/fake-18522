Well done. Food is reasonably priced and cooked with skill. Ingredients are obviously quality. Service is on point. A fine selection of wines/spirits/cocktails. An atmosphere that hits the right note between too relaxed and too stuffy, and one that makes perfect sense with the menu. A nice bar. Stylish patrons, a mix of ages, who aren't trying too hard. A few tiny missteps (e.g., some entree portions are smaller than small), but overall: much to like here. The place has been going strong for a while and doesn't show signs--at least to me--of falling off.
