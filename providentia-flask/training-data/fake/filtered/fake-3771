Where to begin....big disappointment! Granted that the expectations were low, just wanted Â a quick mid-week dinner. We got seated and waited for a waitress to appear, although there were only 4 other tables of patrons. Ordered food and drinks, waited an unreasonable amount of time. My husband's fajitas comes out, no sizzling plate, as per the waitress, lack of heat was for our safety! The steak was cold and rubbery. We just had to send it back & risk the potential of extra seasoning of spit. I ate my dinner which was average, while my husband sat and waited, only for the food to come back, obviously just microwaved & even more rubbery. The manager, Craig, apologized of course at this point, but no attempt to retain our patronage by offering free drinks or dessert. Don't waste your money, you can have a better meal at Chili's or Longhorn Steakhouse across the street.
