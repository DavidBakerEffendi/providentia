Getting food from here is sometimes an event. They are no doubt popular which is why you end up waiting a little bit on line. But it's ok... While you wait they sometimes give you a free falafel ball to eat and pass the time. The food is good...wouldn't say the best ever ... But quite good. I do recommend highly.
