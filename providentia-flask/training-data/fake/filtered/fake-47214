This is a great restaurant.  We went there over the weekend and first were greeted by a courtesaus very enthusiastic staff.  The restuarant decor was great and fit the theme.   The food was phenomenal.  I had the lamb shank special which was amazing, and everyone else loved their entrees as well.  Even my mom who is a very picky eater.   Highly recommended.
