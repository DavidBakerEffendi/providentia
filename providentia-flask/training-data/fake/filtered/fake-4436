I just experienced robbery by the owner.  A friend and I wanted a light meal, nothing too big, so we decided to stop in and split an entree and an appetizer - something normal people do at restaurants all over the world.  We aren't cheap, just didn't feel like downing 2,000 calories each.   When presented with the check, we see an additional $8.00.  I ask if they accidentally added on a dessert or something, and the owner points to some fine print on the menu that says "$8 sharing fee" and says I should have read it. One, this isn't a credit card, I don't need to read the menu front to back to look for tricks like that.  Two, the waitress didn't bother to tell us.   I don't care about $8, I'm writing this because the owner could care less about customer service and who knows what other cheap tricks he has up his sleeve.   Give your money to good people, not to hustlers.  And the food is good but overrated.
