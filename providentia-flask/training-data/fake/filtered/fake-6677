One word: terrific. Went there last night and the caipirinhas were good and well priced and the food was so good I wanted more even after I wiped my plate clean. My gf had the moquequa, a shrimp stew with rice and it was great. I had the quail, which was perfectly cooked and the crispy spinach was unlike I've ever had - literally melt in your mouth. I'm looking forward to the fejouada Saturday special. My recommendation for this unassuming corner spot couldn't be higher.
