Having arrived in Philadelphia for the first time and finding ourselves checked into our hotel, we took off down Chestnut street from 18th and ended up at Penn's Landing. Frustrated with no clue where we were, and starving, we happened upon Moshulu.  Moshulu was like finding water in the desert! We had no trouble finding a seat within a few moments, sitting down to a quiet meal with a view of the River and being doted on by a knowledgable and kind waiter. The entree's were fantastic, mine being proscuitto wrapped chicken breast with risotto and a side of mac & cheese.  The dessert was so-so, but hard to go wrong with apple pie and cardamom ice cream. We drank up the coffee liquors and took in the ambience of our welcome to Philadelphia. The ship cured our ills, helped get us back on track, and thank goodness we found it - the rest of our trip was smooth sailing from here! (AAA rated, four diamonds. We got an awesome discount.)
