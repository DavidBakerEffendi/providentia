My friend's husband has been raving about this place for years.  I've been poo pooing it for a while, but he finally convinced us to accompany them for a visit.  Now I see what he was talking about.  Food was excellent (don't bother with the salads, I saw them and was glad I passed).  Go for the lobster bisque or the garlicky fondue bread, anything but the salads.  Our waiter was older than Moses, so I am going to refrain from critiquing his service.  We all were having a great time, so I did not see the point in making the older gentleman work any faster, besides his recommendations were on point, and it was entertaining just listening to him (reminded me of Ricky Ricardo). The 16oz boneless strip steak blew me away.  Excellent seasoning and char.  Will not hesitate to entertain guests in the future.
