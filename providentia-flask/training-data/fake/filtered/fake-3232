1. Food was not so good only kid's foods were okay 2. Restaurant was smelly, I asked for some freshener no body cared 3. Service terrible, I went on Tuesday evening, not much crowded but still took a lot of time before somebody said "Hi" 4. Whole night felt all the discomfort Will NEVER EVER go back here again...
