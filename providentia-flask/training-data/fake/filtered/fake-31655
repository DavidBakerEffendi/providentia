I am going to keep it simple- I have a book to write. As a struggling writer,when my books take off, I WILL be in the wonderful establishment during brunch with my laptop, in some corner doing what I adore doing. I adore this place-it's interiors- the windows- the sophisticated crowd. Pretty awesome. Monument Lane is the intellectual's version of "The Cafeteria"- and just as adored. I kind of what this place to blow up-become super successful, but not really. It's perfect as it is-those in the know come here to congregate with like minds, delicious,creative food and WONDERFUL service. BTW- The bartender- some handsome black man- was STELLAR very attentive. My ONLY complaint is that they have very little vegan or vegetarian fare. But my server always helps me with soups and delicious salads as well as other 'culinary concoctions' that are spread across their small but fabulous menu. I always leaved pleased. I know this sounds some what 'elitist' I ONLY eat here when I am in the city. Â It's now 'my place'. In case if your wondering - yes Monument Lane WILL be in one of my books. The setting is perfect for a sexy mystery.
