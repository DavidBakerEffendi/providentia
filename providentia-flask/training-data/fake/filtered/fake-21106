Service was very slow.  After over an hour, our entrees finaly came out.  One was the wrong order and one was cold.  The pasta was like mush and the sauce was bland.  The pasta you serve toothless babies is firmer than what they served.  I have been to Lounello's in Little Falls and it seems only the name is the same.  This is not good italian food, many better choices in the area.  I think my favorite part is when my waiter told me "Its not your fault, you only came in here for dinner.  We are having lots of problems in the kitchen tonight."  Why did he think I thought it was my fault? Manager seemed to be busy socializing and not overseeing the operations.  The manager only became aware of the problems after we complained.  She should have known there was a problem in the kitchen and been dealing with it.  This place needs adult supervision.
