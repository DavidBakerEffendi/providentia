This is a simple business with no flavor but it is truly a Grill Master. The salad was a two heads of lettuce, 7 olives, 1 half rotten tomato, 4-5 swirls of onions and a chopped piece of chicken. Though the chicken was good and it always has been, they should remove salad from their menu. No salad dressing was offered, no eggs, no salt, no pepper, no cheese, no croutons, no bacon bits offered. It cost $10.17 and I feel robbed. The customer service as declined over the years. The gentleman was simply collecting money and taking orders, didn't say "greetings" nor did he say "thank you". I understand that we all have bad days, both food and human wise. A BIG PAN OF LETTUCE.
