Came here for the first time yesterday. The 24 beers on tap is what drew me in, and surprisingly they had some of my favorite craft beers there! The food was great as well, we had the Bruschetta and Risotto Balls. Both were perfectly crunchy and seasoned great. We spoke to the owner and he really cares about feedback and what he can do to make the place better for his patrons. The head Bartender (forgot his name) was really cool and can tell he has a lot of passion for his craft. It was fun seeing his concoctions and his flair while making them. The interior is also very inviting and has a very NYC feel, just a great place to sit for a while and have some good drinks and Italian bar food. All in all, I will definitely be back. They also DELIVER!! Just need a $10 minimum.
