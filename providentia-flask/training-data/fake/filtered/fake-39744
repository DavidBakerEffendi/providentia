I am rarely inspired to comment in forums such as this, but Linn L's lack of acknowledgement for one of the finest dining experiences available, brings out the muse to counter her lack of enthuasim. I have been fortunate to dine at Talula's Garden twice while in Philadelphia on business. I can remember nearly every bite. The sauteed mushrooms still inspire me to recreat at home - the smoked sturgeon was amazing - The sweet breads - the best I have ever had. Bon Apetite brought this restaurant to my attention as one of the best in the country, and it is well deserved. I feel sorry for Linn L. and her poorly developed palate - fortunately for her Piccadilly is still available. On learning that I have to return to Philadelphia for business, before booking travel, car, or hotel I made sure that my reservation at Talula's Garden was in place. The only regret that I have is that I am only in town for one night.
