My favorite date spot in Philly. I've been for dinner, but even if you only go for drinks and gaucamole, it's worth it. The cinnamon pineapple margarita is unlike anything I have ever tasted and is amazing. I never would have predicted how well those two flavors work together and the bartender must be magic, since my attempts to recreate it at home have never come close. The guac menu is stupendous, especially the De La Hoya. Again, I don't really associate roasted garlic and avocado, but the combination is beyond tasty. I'm vegetarian and there are only a few dinner options for me to eat here, but I'm almost grateful that there are only a few choices, since otherwise I would be overwhelmed by so many amazing looking entrees. It helps narrow down my choices. The entrees I have ordered were fantastic and the side of fried plantains I always get is wonderful. Desserts too are scrumptious. Literally one of my favorite restaurants ever. Oh, and the old school photo booth is great!
