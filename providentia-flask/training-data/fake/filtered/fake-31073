I could have given this place 5 stars if it wasn't for the poor customer service.  I just moved to Philly and was told that Grindcore was THE spot to go to for a decent vegan sandwich and stellar cup of coffee, so I went in for lunch.  I walked in and there was a short line.  Typical for a lunch crowd.  The music made the wait pleasant.  Then I couldn't help but notice that the cashier (a woman with short dark hair and glasses) was incredibly rude to customers- just really short with people and talking down to them.  I work in retail so I'm used to dealing with customers being jerks, but I didn't think anyone was being difficult. I ordered an Emma's Delight (Tofurkey, spinach, mayo and tomato) and an iced coffee.  I was as polite as possible, but that wasn't going to help the cashier's attitude.  It was the first time in 4 years that I didn't leave a tip. The guy who handed me my sandwich (blonde hair and a plaid shirt) was friendly and the sandwich was really good and filling.  I hate when places skimp on ingredients!  The iced coffee was pretty good, if a little watered down. I definitely plan on going back and I'd recommend this place to others, but you might want to peek in first and see if that cashier is working or not.
