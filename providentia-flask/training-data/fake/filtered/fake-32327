Good food, portion and  price! I had the chicken over rice which came with a little salad and a small Falafel. The chicken was moist and thankfully not spicy, the rice could have been better and did not look like Basmati, but was yellow- the falafel was not the best I ever had , in fact I think I make better falfel at home! It was kind of hard and over spiced! I wouldn't buy the falfel here but will go back to try the rest of the menu! I went there on 9.29.2010, shortly after he won the vendy award which he has literally placed on a pedestal next to the cart lol!That was the topic of conversation amongst the folks waiting for food. I tried to talk to him and get him to pose for a pic but he was conversating with a couple and the line for food was growing so I  ordered, I got my food and caught the bus home to Woodside.
