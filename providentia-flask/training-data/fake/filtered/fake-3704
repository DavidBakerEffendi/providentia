Many have told me I have to try this place and now I know why. I was quite pleased with everything, the service was great. It's small yet cozy. We shared the muscles, which are a MUST have here! Â In addition to our entrees we also gorged ourselves with their wonderful garlic bread and rapini aka broccoli rabe (also a must if you like rapini) I too will spread the word about Piccolo Angolo and will be back again! Thank you, Renato for a delicious meal!
