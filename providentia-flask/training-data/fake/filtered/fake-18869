I have never posted on here but frequent this site for advice. I am writing in regards to artichoke in the meat packing / Chelsea area on 10th though I have been to other locations. Six of us bought a few slices and were eating them outside. A random person that appeared very shady started yelling and screaming at us that we were in the way and blocking the side walk. We were just standing eating pizza not doing anything. We were very skeptical that he did not in fact work there. We asked him to get the manager. He went inside and a guy in a black suit came out. He stuck up for the shady man and told us to quick causing a scene. The shady guy started yelling that he placed his private parts on the pizza we were eating. He then said that he was going make a call to have us " eliminated" and " taken care of". He proceeded to get on the phone, give his whereabouts and a description of us. We walked away, very confused. As we were leaving we walked back inside just to say that as a paying customer we felt that they were being inappropriate. The manager stated that the " shady guy " didn't actually work there but they were trying not to cause a scene. Instead of sticking up for paying customers the management took the side of a very sketchy man whom was yelling that he wanted to "eliminate us" and " placed his private parts" on our pizza. Very poor taste. Poor management. Think twice about going there. Definitely not worth the hype. A disgusting establishment.
