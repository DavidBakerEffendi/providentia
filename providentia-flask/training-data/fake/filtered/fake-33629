I labsolutely love the food at himalayan yak. The best Nepali n Tibetan food in town. Great music, service, food and staff. I am here every week for their delicios juicy momos and amazing Thali. Their gyuma sausage and aloo dum are the best you can ever find. Love the decor too...very nepali/tibetan! i give yak 5/5 since the food n service is excellent!!
