I remember when you got 2 slices and a coke for $2.00 at Di Fara.  This was expensive back in the 1970's.  My friends and I would shop around back then and get 2 slices and a coke for 1.50.  Back then there was a great pizza shop every other 3 blocks.  All the old time italians used to make great pizza.  Too bad you guys never had Armondo's on Kings Highway and East 16th street.  Best pizza in the city back then.  Well Di Fara is the type of Pizza you used to get all the time in Brooklyn.  But thoses days are over.  Enjoy it now.  He's an old man.  When he retires there will be no one left who makes pizza this good.  His pizza is 5 stars.  I give him 4 because 35 years ago he chased me and my friends out of the shop with a long butcher knife.  Thank god we were faster.  He still gives me dirty looks. :-)
