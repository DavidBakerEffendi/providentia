I came here to celebrate my friends birthday and I have to say...what an amazing experience!  From the moment we arrived everyone was friendly and courteous.  Our server Alex went above and beyond. She was knowledgeable about the menu and even made suggestions. The food was delicious!! We ordered the Churrascos and the Branzino...omg! We'll definitely be back!  By the way....the birthday card is a great touch! Keep up the great work!
