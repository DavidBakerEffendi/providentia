This is a great Italian Market. My husband and I shop here each and every Saturday for Cold Cuts, Breads and Raviolis. Their Chicken Cutlets can't be beat. The service is great and the quality is excellent. My favorite is the homemade mozzarella. They even went out of their way for me...making it fresh to order on a day that we were celebrating my daughters birthday! They're nice people.... and the place is immaculate.. Wish all retail shops had it down like these people do!!
