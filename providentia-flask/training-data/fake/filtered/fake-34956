went here over the weekend and found it very nice. you have to walk through an alley to get there and they have a lot of dead animals on the wall. being a tourist, i thought this was really cool. but the best part of the place was the food and service. they make everything really good and thought out really well. the detail in the courses were really good. however, there was a dish we didn't like and they simply just took it off our bill, how great was that? definately a 5 star for service. i'll be coming back on my next nyc trip. oh yeah, the artichoke dip and the egg bacon skillet were amazing!
