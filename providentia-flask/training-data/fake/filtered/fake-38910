Saw mouse scurrying across the dining room floor...dropped my flat-bread, grabbed my boyfriend's hand and ran out the door...only to see a huge gapping hole in the front of the building leading to the dining area. Wanted to visit after seeing so many great reviews, but will stick to King of Tandoor!
