I ordered a coupon deal on grubhub, two 14" pies with one topping each for $16. I called after an hour and 24 minutes had passed, the man I spoke with told me that my pizza was already on the way, which was reassuring, as the place is only a little under a mile from me. 26 minutes later it arrived. That timeline is exactly correct, I double checked my grubhub and phone call times as I wrote it. Â  The pizza was still close to oven hot when it arrived, so they must have not seen my order and then rushed it out when I called. That doesn't bother me, it happens, whatever, but it would have been nice to have been told that so that I wasn't wondering what happened again. As far as the quality goes, it isn't artisanal hipster masterpiece cuisine but it is $16 for two pies, I got what I expected and I was not disappointed. That and the very friendly delivery guy kept the place in three star range.
