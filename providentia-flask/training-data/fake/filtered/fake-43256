This place is absolutely amazing. I had been looking for a good bbq place in the upper valley for a while to no avail. I'm glad to say that my search is now over. This place has some of the best bbq I've had the joy to taste. The pulled pork is to die for, it has the perfect (i mean that) amount of bark (the burnt layer) to tender juicy meat, the sauce is just right, not so much that it overpowers the meat flavor, but enough to bring out the best in the meat. I had the pork on a "12 roll, that they toasted quite nicely, and stuffed with meat, cheese (which was melted by the meat), onions, and pickles. I plan on being back there often. The taste is amazing, smokey, meaty, not too salty, no one flavor overpowering the others. Second best part, is that they have an amazing ice cream (soft serve) 24 flavor selection. So for dessert, my wife had a smores sunday, and I had a maple creamy root-beer float. With fresh made ice cream and local micro-brewed root beer. Couldn't have been better. Lastly, as it is a country store, it also has the benefit of having an amazing selection of local fare, cheeses, pastries, wines, etc. I picked up some chocolate raspbery red wine for my wife. You definitely have to check this place out!
