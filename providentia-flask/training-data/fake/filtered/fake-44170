Hands down the best steak house ever! I know this is a chain restaurant but it not like other chain restaurants. They don't have nearly as many as other chains and they really care about their food. They are situated usually in nicer areas with a higher clientele that appreciate steak. This location in Princeton, NJ is no different. You walk in there and you can tell it is not a t shirt and jeans place, it is a nice button down and slacks place. The ambiance is very laid back back but distinguished at the same time. I am a total steak guy and have been to many steakhouses but none compare. I always get the same thing. For appetizers the sliced tomato and onion, the tomato is always firm and juicy and the onion has the perfect bite and crunch. Next up my favorite, the NY Strip cooked medium rare with a side of whipped potatoes. How can you go wrong steak and potatoes. The steak is always, always cooked perfect. In the end if someone asked me where to get a good steak, I will always say Ruth Chris
