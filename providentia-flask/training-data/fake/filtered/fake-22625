Excellent, high quality Italian food with unbelievable service. We visited Primavera while staying at the Wilshire Grand Hotel and I must say we truly enjoyed ourselves. My pasta and shrimp was delicious and my wife absolutely loved her salmon. The staff is beyond attentive and caring and make sure your meal is perfect! Can't wait to eat here again soon!
