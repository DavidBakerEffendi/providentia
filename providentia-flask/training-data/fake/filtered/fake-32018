Not very impressive. Dark and cramped...maybe better in the summer, when you can go outside. Had a problem with the manager Carlos. My wife and I tried the restaurant using a very generous gift certificate she received. We had dinner for two and wanted to leave a generous (20%) tip with the remainder of the gift certificate, but were told that we could not. Nothing on the gift card indicated otherwise. Won't be going back there again.
