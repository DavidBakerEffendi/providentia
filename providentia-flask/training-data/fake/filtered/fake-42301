Amazing !! The first time I came here I got the pan-fried pork and chive dumplings and the sesame pancake. It was delicious and worth the wait! My husband got steamed dumplings which were good as well but the pan-fried is definitely the way to go. My husband loved the sesame pancake so much that he ordered another one as soon as we finished the first. I came back a second time because I wanted to do a taste test of all of the top rated / most talked about dumpling places in the area. I went to 4 including Prosperity again and Prosperity surpassed them all. I ordered the pan-fried pork and chive dumplings at all places. This time I also ordered the sesame pancake with pork inside and it literally changed my life! Perfectly warm and chewy and crunchy and soft and salty with fresh veggies and slightly sweet pork inside. I will be dreaming of this. Definitely worth the wait even in the cold. It is a tiny spot so be prepared to get your food to go or if a spot opens up, sit at the counters on the sides with people squished in hovering over you. Also it is cash only.
