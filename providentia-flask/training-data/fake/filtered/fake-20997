I give this 3 stars only because the restaurant is adorable. If it was based on food alone, I would go for 2 stars. We started with the dips, choice of 3, babagounash was bitter, sundried tomato was chunks, not a spread. The pumpkin hummus was good. Next came the watermelon, feta, and mint at home. It had the same quality that I would pull together at home, and with 2 mint leaves, only 2 bites gave the full flavor profile. This would have all been ok, had the entree not been fried lamb. Crusted should not mean breaded and fried. Having moved to Philly recently, this is the most disappointing restaurant I've been to so far. For a more detailed write-up,wp.me/pAp5c-iy.
