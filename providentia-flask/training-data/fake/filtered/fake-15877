We stopped in around 10 pm after dinner for some of the famous cheesecake.  Definitely worth it!  We went with the raspberry swirl and it was by far the best cheesecake I've ever had (and I'm a girl who loves her cheesecake!).  It was the perfect temperature with a great spongecake "crust" and big enough to share.  To make the experience even better was our extremely nice, prompt and helpful waiter.  We'll definitely be back!
