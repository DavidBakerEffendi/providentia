I was lead to this establishment by my sister, She said she used to frequent this place when she was a kid and how great the double dogs were... Well I had my expectations way up there...and found myself a Lil disappointed ..the dog was a little more than I bargained for it has potatoes, cooked onions & peppers plus ketchup and mustard in this pita style bun (the bread was incredible, by the way) but as a whole it just wasn't the dog I was seeking! Â Dog gone it!
