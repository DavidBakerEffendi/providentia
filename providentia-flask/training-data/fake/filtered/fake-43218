Being new to the area and in search of a good waffle along with a quality cup of coffee so I wanted to give Grid Iron a shot. Let me tell you I was totally impressed with Â the originality and freshness of the waffles and the excellent cup of coffee that me and my wife both enjoyed. I highly recommend a visit to this fine establishment and will be returning there myself.
