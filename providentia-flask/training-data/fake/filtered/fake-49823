Went for dinner on Sat. 7/12 and it was delicious and innovative.  The neck of the goat entree was incredible.  Our waiter Kyle or Kal encouraged us to get that and we were so glad we did.  Tasty food and excellent waiter great suggestions fun sense of humor.  Go immediately if you have not been yet.
