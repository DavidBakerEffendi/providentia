Had a wonderful experience last night and highly recommend this restaurant!  Food was delicious especially the risotto balls.  Two appetizers, salad, two half portions of pasta and four entrees among four of us was perfect.  The servers and help were friendly, accommodating and much better than expected based on the picky people that post negative comments.  If you enjoy spending quality time with family and friends and aren't in a rush this restaurant is delightful....glad to have this option in yardley.
