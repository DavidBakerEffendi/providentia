once in a blue moon i go to claires for comfort food and Â the location. But I am also annoyed with aspects of this restaurant. the prices are too high. the coffee is the highest in town and is not anywhere near the best --some of the best coffee anywhere is in new haven. I don't know if the counter people actually get the tips in the tip jar --anyone know? Someone told me they go to a charity.
