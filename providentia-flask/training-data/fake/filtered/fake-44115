My first sushi experience was at Mr. Sushi, back in 2002 (when they were still in a little spot next to ShopRite in Lincoln Park). I was in love. The lunch specials were incredibly inexpensive and the all you can eat special for $20 was unbeatable. Yes, the service was sometimes downright rude. However, at other times the husband would come out and throw us some little bonus salads and teasers. Either way, I never let my feelings get in the way of an amazing value. I've moved to two major cities in the past two years and I have never found another sushi restaurant that comes close to Mr. Sushi. I make my pilgrimage back each time I come home. Seems like other reviewers have a problem with the wait time. I would rather wait an hour to have a plate full of artfully prepared made-to-order specialty rolls than go to a restaurant where they fling sloppily made low-grade sushi onto a conveyer belt (yes, this is real). Do yourself a favor; If you're starving, go get fast food. If you want to experience a delicious, quality meal without breaking the bank; Grab a bottle (or two) of wine, a few good friends and head to Mr. Sushi for a relaxing evening of good conversation and sushi you will dream about. (Err...maybe that's just me) It really is one of the best out there. Believe me. I'm looking.
