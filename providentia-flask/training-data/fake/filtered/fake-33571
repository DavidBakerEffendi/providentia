The food is delicious, and can be considered as authentic thai cuisine. The food may be a little more on the expensive side, but the food is fine. However, most of the staff are pleasing to be around. but I was recently served by this waitress. She was incredibly rude, she gave us dirty looks and I was not impressed. She nearly tossed our plates to us while serving the meals we ordered. The food was good, but she completely ruined our meal. I would've highly recommended this restaurant, until the recent service I've experienced. Please replace her. I don't think i will be returning for food, unless it is take-out.
