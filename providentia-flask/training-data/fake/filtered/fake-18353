Blue State has decent coffee and espresso, not the best in the world, but pretty good. I used to go there every morning, and have even gone so far as to purchase a pound or two of beans from them. Additionally, they are in an excellent location and have the perfect captive audience of medical campus and hospital people. That said, the coffee is not enough to keep me coming back to take lashings from the rudest, snottiest baristas I have ever met. There are, of course, exceptions- some of the staff are just fine. But I would definitely rate this place high on the existential crisis having, too-good-for-you barista scale.
