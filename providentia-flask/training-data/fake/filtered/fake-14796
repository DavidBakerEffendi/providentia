Centro Grille, you guys are the best one that has ever been in that area. This was our first time in Centro Grille since the turn over of the other restaurants and our overall experience was amazing. We walked in the front doors to be greeted by a lovely hostess, Haily. We asked her how the business was going and what her favorite entree would be. She said that they were doing well and there was more to Centro Grille then just a restaurant like Thursday Night Live Entertainment for example. She then stated that the Soho Burger with the fries. After sitting us in the dining room, the atmosphere was beautiful with light trees and candles all around, it felt very welcoming and cozy. Our server Jen was very attentive and made sure we had a great first time. They had a wide variety of beers and wines, along with different combinations of drinks. I had ordered the Soho Burger and my husband ordered a Salmon Entree. Both came out in a reasonable time and was the best Burger and Salmon we had ever had. With the wide variety of desserts, even though we were stuffed, we had a Chocolate Dome that was decorated very nicely and had a great presentation. Overall, Centro Grille is one of our favorite restaurants and the reviews below give the wrong impression of such a great and friendly place. We will definitely be back again and again!
