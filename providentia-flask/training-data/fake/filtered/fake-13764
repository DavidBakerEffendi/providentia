DO NOT ORDER if you do not like LEFTOVERS. At first I thought $16 for the Chicken Fajitas was a bit steep... but I had so much food it was enough for 2-3 servings. I say 2-3 because I ate it in 2 and was stuffed after each. (Btw... I'm a woman... with a big appetite if that helps.) The food was excellent... I felt like I was eating at the restuarant. It came with chicken strips smothered in green bell peppers and sliced onions, Rice with pinto beans, sour cream, salsa, guacamole, cheese, and 6 soft fajita wraps.  I enjoyed every bite!  Oh and I didn't feel sick afterward... you know... the sick most people get after eating Mexican food ;) lol I hate coming on YELP and seeing such mixed reviews, but this place seems to be consistent with over 90% of the reviews saying: GREAT, GREAT, GREAT. So order, and make sure you leave your review. In fact, this is the first time I've ever written one.  I can't wait to try another dish.
