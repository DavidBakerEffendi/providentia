Massive Farmer's market - check.  Tons of cool people shopping - check.  Fair prices on a HUGE variety of pretty much every kind of food you could ever want - check.  Only downside is the popular stalls can have long lines, but that's part of the price you pay for such a big, awesome outdoor market.  Do NOT miss this place.
