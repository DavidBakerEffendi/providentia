In my opinion the best Banh mi in the neighborhood. After having to suffer through some pretty sub par sandwiches from others, I'm glad I found them. Their bread is crisp, fresh and the perfect compliment to the chicken or pork. I haven't tried anything other than the sandwiches, but based on how good they are, I'm sure the rest of the menu is on point.
