Delicious sushi and always fresh! The waiters are extremely courteous from the moment you step inside the tiny restaurant. 'Steve'is one of the waiters and there is also a Steve roll on the menu. On several occasions I've gone, they are always giving us complimentary desserts or rolls. Lunch menu does not disappoint. Do give it a try.
