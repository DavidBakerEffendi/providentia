Was searching for Dim Sum in area and found Peony Pavillion. Gave it a try and loved it.  Everything tasted as though it was made from scratch.  Have experienced in other restaurants (locally, Hawaii, California) some heated up prepackaged dim sum items. The dim sum items, and we have sampled most of them at Peony, are fresh and delicious.  The wait staff is happy to accommodate and answer any of your questions.  It is a pleasant experience in a very elegant style restaurant.  So happy they opened up in our area.
