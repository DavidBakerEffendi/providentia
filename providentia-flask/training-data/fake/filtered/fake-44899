I became a regular; maybe the best value for bucks Italian restaurant in NY. they serve real italian food, simple and tasty so do not expect fancy topping on your pizza or fettuccine alfredo (it does not exhist in Italy!). Pizza is excellent, several choices of home made pasta. Good and easy wine list with decent bottles priced in the low 30. I prefer the tables in the front; the back can get loud sometimes. If you do not understand the menu, order randomly, I never had a bad dinner
