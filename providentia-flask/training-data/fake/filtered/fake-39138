I went here with some coworkers (a couple of times) since the food was pretty good.  The second time I went, when I ordered something and the cashier placed the wrong order (when I finally received my food), I told him that this wasn't what I ordered.  The owner/ manager gave me a huge attitude on how it was my fault.  Then he charged me more for the inconvenience.   Summary: The owner/ staff was rude and a jerk.  Never go back
