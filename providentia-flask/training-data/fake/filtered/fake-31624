3 Gentlemen behind the counter "looking" busy and no one in the queue to our delight.  We enter and are greeted with silence, both oratory and visual.  No eye contact or warming smile, fine.  Maybe the product here speaks for itself!  (Unfortunately I can not say, as this story does not end as such.)  As we look up at the jumbled chalk board menu still no one acknowledges the two customers awaiting to spend cash money at this establishment.  After a few minutes of feeling like HP in his invisibility cloak we decide to dip and have a very pleasant human experience two doors down.  Can't review the product sorry, because we did not get to try it. Zero stars for customer service and general friendliness.
