BEST Chinese Food In CT After trying all the rest in our area, we FINALLY found the best! We first tried China Pavilion about 10 years ago because of the incredible annual Zagat ratings... and were we ever pleasantly surprised! We've loved every meal!  The chicken & broccoli is my favorite!  The chicken is tender the broccoli fresh and the sauce is very light, savory.  My husband is in love with the kung pao chicken... again really tender chicken, fresh, tiny pieces of celery and peanuts.   The pork egg rolls, spring rolls, wonton soup, scallion pancakes, General Tso's chicken, orange chicken, pork fried rice, pork ribs and beef % broccoli all have our two thumbs up! The dining room was recently remodeled and expanded and the Asian décor is inviting and comfortable but we mostly order take out.  The only drawback to their delivery is a $3.00 fuel charge but considering gas prices and manpower it's worth it!  Our food is quickly delivered HOT and with a smile. The wait staff has ALWAYS been attentive and helpful.  Annie, the owner, pays careful attention to EVERY customer and EVERY order.  She works hard and never forgets a face!  It was a happy surprise when we walked in the third time and she asked us how we were, by name!  Not bad considering we were only ordering take out up until that point!  :) I can't say enough positive things about the China Pavilion and their scrumptious food.  The Zagat ratings don't lie, this is worth the drive from anywhere!
