Great food, service, portions, & prices. Complimentary Chips and salsa/pico de gallo were good. Appetizer: shrimp caviche. All the ingredients seemed fresh, and it was packed w/ shrimp. Dinner: The lady got the enchiladas w/ the green salsa. She loved it and couldn't finish half of it. I got the chicken lava bowl. Excellent and just looked really cool. Again left with plenty of leftovers. Drinks: The x rated margarita seemed appealing,but it was happy hour and couldn't pass on the $5 house lime. Good enough for the cost. Coronas were only $3 as well. No room for dessert. For one appetizer, two entrees, a margarita, two beers, tomorrows lunch and decent tip, it only set me back $70. Minus one star because the size of the place was on the fine line between demure and just plain tight. I would go back anytime.
