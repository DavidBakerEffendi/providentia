First thing first, our bread was cold, and we got packaged butter instead of dipping oil and warm bread like all the other tables. Our food was very good, but the service was unbelievably poor. After our main course dishes were removed from the table, we waited around for over 20 minutes for our waiter to come with our check. My husband had to ask for it... if he hadn't I don't know how long we would have waited. Worst experience I have ever had. I will not return here again. I will not recommend this place to anyone that I like.
