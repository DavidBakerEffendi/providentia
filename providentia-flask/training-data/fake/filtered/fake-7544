If you are looking for some tasty weeknight fare, look no further. My "tried & true" favorites: 1. Szechuan Triple Crown 2. Dragon & Phoenix 3. Beef Lo Mein 4. General Tso's Chicken I have not found a more consistent take-out restaurant since this gem opened on Farmington Ave. Big fan of the whole concept of Black Bamboo. It's the type of food you eat, you enjoy and feel content after. Not bloated or regretful. It's always packed and calling ahead is a must on popular dining out nights: Friday, Saturdays and Sundays. It's a small but bubbling place, and Sonny Chen, the owner, is a class act! Added bonus - chocolate fortune cookies... Major plus: it's located right next to one of my favorite package stores... Harvest Wines & Spirits and their famous "Beer Cave".
