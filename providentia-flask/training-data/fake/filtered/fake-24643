We had an 8:30 reservation and were not seated until 9:15. There wasn't room to sit at the bar, so we just stood there for 45 minutes. The staff were not apologetic, and did not even acknowledge that we were waiting for so long. The food was good, but nothing special that couldn't be gotten elsewhere. It wasn't worth the hype.
