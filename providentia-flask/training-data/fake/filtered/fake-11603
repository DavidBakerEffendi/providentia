Wow. Wow. Wow. Diamond in the rough. I went to El Rey Monday with a some work buddies and caught the end of happy hour.  $1 tacos, empanadas for $2, and great drink specials. We were able to sneak in an order before happy hour ended and it served as a great appetizer.  Tacos are authentic and unique. Each one has loads of flavor. We all happily ate those empanadas as well. For dinner we were recommended to try nachos (which our server, Elan, alleged were the best he'd ever had) and to split a short rib fundido as a first course.  Elan was not lying. These nachos were legendary. Layers of flavors and toppings!  Our server also claimed that the fundido was like a Mexican cheesesteak in a pan.  A great and accurate description. The onions played really well off the meat. For dinner we each happily had our own entrees. My choice: the ribs. I loved the combination of tropical fruity flavors with fall off the bone ribs.  I also tried a special that my friend got the surf and turf tacos on truffle corn tortillas. I stole one and was one happy dude. I love this place! Can't wait to go back!
