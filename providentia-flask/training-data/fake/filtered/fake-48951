ASSHOLE owner! the service was slow and he was the only guy serving. overcooked the pie. at the end we tiped him 10% and when we left he called on the smallest girl in our group that she left some change. When we went in to see what was taking her so long, he was demanding she pay him more tip - double what we pay to be exact!!! he's lucky we didnt punch his sorry ass. DONT EVER DEMAND A TIP!!! thats a privilege not a right!
