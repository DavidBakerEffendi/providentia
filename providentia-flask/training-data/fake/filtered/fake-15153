On a Sunday evening I ordered delivery at 5pm, it took 50+ min. I live 2 blocks away. I will not be returning to this location for take out sushi! I ordered the tempura appetizer and there was such a small portion. The sakura roll was very tasty. But that will not make up for the 50 min wait for 2 items.
