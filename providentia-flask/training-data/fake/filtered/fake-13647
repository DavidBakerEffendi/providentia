First, I made my reservation online for the next evening, and received a phone call confirmation within a few hours of making it. The staff were extremely professional when we arrived for dinner the next evening. Our waiter was able to provide us with excellent drink and food recommendations that were spot on. The food was great and the mojitos were superb. The room was Â a little dark and so it was hard to see our food. There was the expected level of background noise for a Friday night, and we were able to have a good amount of dinner conversation. I would definitely go back!
