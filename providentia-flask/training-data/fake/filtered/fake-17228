It took 1 hour and 45 minutes to have my salad and two sandwichs delivered when it was supposed to take 35 minutes. Fries were ice cold but the portions were good. Service was horriable when they called me and the delivery guy basically threw the food at the door and left w/o an apology for being so late.
