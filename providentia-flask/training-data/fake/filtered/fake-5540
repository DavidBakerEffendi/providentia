I have nothing but good things to say about Hu Kitchen. We ate here almost every day of our trip to nyc and never had a disappointing dish. It's definitely a great choice for a paleo eater, and I loved not having to think or ask about sugars, grains or dairy here! But my non paleo family also loved the food because its simply delicious and of high quality. The fish cakes, roasted cauliflower and chia pudding were particular favourites of ours, and the mash up bar is simply genius. It's a shame so many reviews focused on price, because eating organic, minimally processed food simply does cost more. But it's so much better for you, and what price are you going to put on your health? I realise it does restrict some people, but the small meat and veg bowl at $7.95 is filling and comes with a grain free bread roll. Given the low GI and high protein content of the meals, you stay fuller for longer too, so less snacking = less expense across the day. Thanks to all the lovely staff for letting us try everything before buying, and made us feel so welcome. Its great that they all know about and care about the food they serve! We look forward to coming back on our next trip :)
