This place is the best!!!  This pizza is actually "healthy".  it's not that greasy and there are always so many vegetarian options.  They have regular crust and whole wheat crust too!  It really is PERFECT PIZZA.  And they have BAR!  What more could you want?!  i have eaten here probably 100 times literally and I keep going back.  The outside seating is a plus and the pizza maker Marco is really sweet and cute!  It is the best neighborhood bar/pizza place around.  :)
