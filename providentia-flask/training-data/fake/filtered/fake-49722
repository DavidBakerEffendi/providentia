This place is everything that you want a Bar-Restaurant to be: * Great service (this one Latina waitress was so nice and prompt) * The burger was perfectly crafted and delicious * The ambience was like something out of a photographers studio with all the "in vogue" photographs of models on the wall * The drinks are practically free! I would most definitely go again.
