My experience here on Wednesday finally pushed me to sign up for yelp. Terrible!  Got to the restaurant and was greeted by a relatively rude hostess.  Sat at a table with a skinny waiter with a buzz cut.  He was sooo rude the entire night.  My father and I ordered pork chops and they were both hammered.  We complained to the waiter and he very abruptly grabbed them from our settings.  No apology.  No visit from a manager.   Food was really mediocre at best.  I had a pumpkin salad that was good.  I had the chicken to replace the pork chop that was uninspired and served with boring mash potatoes and green beans.  The crazy noise level and uninspired food wouldn't have bothered me so much if the service wasn't so bad.   I think we left a 10% tip but it should have been left. WILL NEVER RETURN!
