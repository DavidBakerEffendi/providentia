I went to this place today. Very nice restaurant. Me and my friend were the only people having luncheon Dine in. Few people were having Take out orders. I guess a lot of people in the area does not know that they have a fancy Dine in arrangement on the left corner all the way on the back... Food is delicious and came out well cooked and on time. I ordered General Tsao Chicken and my friend ordered Eggplant with shrimp. Hot n sour soup was like gravy and not watery..perfect for my taste.....Food was yummy...will go back again.
