This place is awful. Our waiter was Â clueless and when our food finally came after 50 minutes, our daughters' food was missing even though we had explicitly ordered for them. The manager was rude and insolent. Don't waste your time here. There are plenty of great restaurants on Montclair. I have never been to such an awful place.
