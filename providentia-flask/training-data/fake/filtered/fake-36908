This is the best Italian restaurant in West Haven, CT.  I've been there many times,  the food is delicious, freshly cooked and worth the wait coming from a true Italian.  During the summer, the outdoor dining is open on the weekends with musical entertainment, dancing and the wonderful sea breeze from the ocean makes it a romantic evening.  The staff and customers are very social and friendly. All there to have a great time and eat!  Bon Appetite!!!!  GREAT PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
