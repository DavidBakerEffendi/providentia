This was one of the worst meals we have had in a long time.  Slow and inattentive service (after telling our waiter at 5:45 that we needed to be out by 7:10 to make a 7:30 concert, we were chasing him around trying to give him our credit cards at 7:15), disgusting food that was greasy, overcooked, tasteless and unappealingly served, dirty wine glasses and flies, we decided never to return.  There are too many other wonderful restaurants in New Haven to waste any time or money at this lousy one.
