What a loud, rowdy, unpleasant, dirty place! The service was just ok. The waiter didn't smile once. My boyfriend and I order two items - salt baked squid/shrimp and salt baked tofu. Both were not good at all. Too much salt or something... I'm not sure how people can like this place! Why doesn't the staff at least keep the place clean! Our table cloth had stains in them! Eeeww! I'm never going to this place again!
