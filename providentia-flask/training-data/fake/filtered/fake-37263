The food was extraordinary.  The ceviche was fresh and alive with layers of flavor. The cod fish entree was perfectly cooked - flaky,moist, and the sauce completely accented the flavor of the cod.  Loved the TacuTacu.  My wife is a vegetarian and she loved the preparation of their (unfortunately) one vegetarian entree option - hopefully the number of options will change.  Can't wait to go back and try the dishes I watched go by to other tables.  The ribs, mussels, and fried oyster dishes looked fabulous.  The ambiance is casual and everyone had a very good time.  Reservations are a must.
