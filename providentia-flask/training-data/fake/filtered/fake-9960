I went to Yellow Plum early on a Saturday evening. To say I was greeted warmly is an understatement. This was not a Wal-Mart greeting, this is a "hey we were waiting just for YOU" kinda greeting. Funny thing is EVERYONE gets that greeting. The menu is varied but if you're a pork belly aficionado this is The Pork Pavilion. Chef Lukic has an innovative and imperial vision of pork belly, without the imperious prices. The menu has pasta, fish, steak , vegetarian dishes oh and yes, pork belly. Go for an evening cocktail and prepare your eyes for a feast. The artwork is wonderful and flows with everything, there is truly a presiding eye in this venue and it belongs to Co-Owner Dennis Lukic. I must mention if you have a sweet tooth, it will be satisfied by an order of FRIED BROWNIES and peanut butter ice cream!! Go to Yellow Plum they will take into consideration all of your food concerns and make you feel like a "regular" customer.
