I love this place, let me tell you. The food is INCREDIBLE. My husband took me here on our first date, so yes it does hold a special place in my heart. However the customer service is TERRIBLE. Its a constant situation. I would rather bring the food home and have it be cold than deal with waitress or waiter. It take forever for someone to come take my order bring my food ans the check. I always have to track someone down to say hold on I will grab someone that can help you. Does it really take a village to bring napkins, the check, or refill my water? I really hope they improve this. I also have to say its only at this location that I deal with this problem. Save yourself the hassle and go the other locations it worth the trip. TRUST ME.
