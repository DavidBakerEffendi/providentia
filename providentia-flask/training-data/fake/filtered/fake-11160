We had heard of this place so we thought we would check it out while visiting the city. We brought our 12 year old as well. The concept of this is really great but the set up is terrible. It is so confusing. Unless your a regular you have no Idea how this works. Most of the folks at the restaurants were not much help either. I really felt like I had to ask too many questions. No place to sit and have a cocktail ( unless your in one of the restaurants) only wine. I paid $69 for 2 wines, a martini and orange juice. We had to stand the whole time waiting and after a long day in the city, not what we really wanted to do. We did end up eating there almost 2 hours after we arrived. Once we got in the food was pretty good. Almost worth it. Pricy as well. What would help is to actually have a map with an explanation as of where to go and what to expect along with people available to direct you for your best experience. I would have loved to really explore but it was all too much and uncomfortable.
