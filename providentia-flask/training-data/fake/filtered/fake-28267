The only redeeming quality about this place is the crepes. They are pretty good. Aside from that, I haven't found much to be impressed by. There are always extremely long waits to get a table, and service can be pretty slow. The coffee's not great, either, and it's pretty pricey considering how long you have to wait to get inside.
