Just got back to S.F. from a trip back East to visit family and friends. I had a couple of opportunities to visit Llama Tooth and loved it. The chef and his kitchen staff do innovative and sophisticated takes on some comfort classics. Their mac'cheeses ( seared ahi, truffle, bbq pork, crab) are all great. I loved the kahlua infused sauce on the "Java Steak". Desserts such as peanut butter pie and a chocolate concoction which is just the right cross between fudge and a flourless cake are nice finishes. Add some great beer, a really nice margarita and a comfortable outdoor patio decorated with Haitian inspired murals and you've got it made!
