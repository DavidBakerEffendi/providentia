Ward III is fantastic. Went to this bar by chance while waiting for my friend to get out of work. 6PM on a Monday the bar was packed with a few empty tables just behind it. I wasn't expecting that. Nevertheless, lucky for me -- I found a stool in a short amount of time and met Ward III's owner, Kenny. Complete sweetheart. Even though he was busy making orders he kept up small talk with me. I always enjoy talking with seasoned bar tenders, so I appreciated this. As for the drinks: I tried the Bespoke Cocktail I heard so much about from other Yelpers, but I had no idea what I wanted. Kenny delivered a great drink, regardless. Strong, very strong. Next order was the bar signature, a Ward III. It looked amazing when the guy next to me ordered it, so why not? Loved it. Kenny is an excellent mixologist. I definitely recommend trying this drink. The bourbon made me skeptical yet it was a pleasant surprise. Also worth mentioning: this bar has a great vibe. You walk in and get the feeling you have been transported somewhere else. I love a bar that can take you in like that. Bottom line: The drinks were expensive -- absolutely worth it, though! P.S.: Finally got an account on Yelp just to post this! It was that good.
