I had a party of 6 for lunch at Amada yesterday.  The tapas was great and the presentation beautiful however two of my guests never got their lunch.  The waiter never came back to check on us and sitting at the very front (in the rocks) put us out of the servers view.  Finally we asked and he told us they were made wrong and they were redoing their order.  After a long while he brought their lunch out in a shopping bag and they had to take it back to their office.  Definitely not the service you want if trying to entertain.  They took those two meals off the check but offered no apology for the mishap.
