Unfortunately I have to rate it a 1 star because it wont let me submit without it. This restaurant is HORRIBLE!!! I wouldn't even let my DOG eat there. I had a quesadilla    and it was greasy and fatty. When I opened it up, it looked like the ends cut off the pork and just thrown on there. My husbands beans were cold, old and nasty. No taste what-so-ever and he almost threw up. They didnt take it off the bill. I do not think that they should even be open because their food is probably a health code violation.  The cook had to "step out" so our food took 45 minutes to cook. The waitress who was HORRIBLE said that she would give us chips and dip for the inconvience. We thought that was nice until we saw that all she had to do was open a bag of lays potato chips and mix a small amount of salsa and cream cheese in a bowl. Really? My 3 year old could do better then that! Their bbq sauces were nasty, not bbq at all.     We stopped going back home to Maine and were extremely hungry from driving and wished that we had stopped at McDonalds or Burger King instead of this place. I dont know if what restaurants can get away with down there but someone needs to call the State Health Inspector because that place is just NASTY!!!!!!!!!!!!
