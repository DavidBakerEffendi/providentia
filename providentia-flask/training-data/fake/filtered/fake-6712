I am absolutely obsessed with this place.  A friend of mine told me about it, and after I haven't been there for a month or two, it starts floating back to my mind. First of all, its location is gorgeous and picturesque.  The restaurant itself adds to this atmosphere - I usually can't stand small spaces, because I just feel like others' are on top of me and I can't even think straight.  Somehow, Gitane manages to keep it peaceful and cozy, as opposed to chaotic. And, of course, the food is to die for.  I have not eaten one even "okay" thing there yet.  It's my total go-to place for people visiting the city, and no one has ever complained!
