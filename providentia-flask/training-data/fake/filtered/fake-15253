The food was respectable, but the service was absolutely appalling. Took over an hour to get entrees, then when they were delivered they were minutes apart from each other. And when we then asked for the vegetable side we had ordered, we were told it was coming right out. They finally delivered it 15 minutes later, just as we were ready to leave. Truly one of the worst experiences at a supposedly respectable restaurant I can recall. We would never go again -- and warning off everyone we know as well.
