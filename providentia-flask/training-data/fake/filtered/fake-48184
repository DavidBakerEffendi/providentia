this place is amazing, i never knew street meat Â would taste so good. I like the white sauce, its delicious and to die for! i didnt like the chicken as much as i thought it was a bit dry and not flavorful at all. The experience is what makes it so great, waiting 45 mins on a line.. that was the best part!
