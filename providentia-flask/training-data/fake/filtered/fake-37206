If you are in mood for a good burger (although a little greasy with all the sauce that they add on the bun), some tasty artichoke dip or some falling off the bone ribs , captured in a cool, low key comfortable setting then this is your spot.   You can't go wrong with the food here, the menu a small but everything on it is very good.   The only downfall of of this place is that they don't take reservations and the waits can often exceed 30 minutes.
