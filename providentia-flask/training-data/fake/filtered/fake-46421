Amazing amazing amazing!!!! we were seated almost instantaneously, as the seating is communal there. The open space in addition to the open kitchen which wraps the perimeter of the restaurant makes for an awesome environment. They have a cool twist on the traditional pork buns. they are the best I have ever had. The noodles were also the best I have ever had. Everything was exceptional! Highly recommend.
