Okay Baby Blues BBQ... I thought that I'd surprise my elderly southern born and raised mom for her birthday by picking up a pulled pork platter this evening. I was totally disappointed with everything. The pork had two big clumps of soggy skin mixed into pork shredded pork... gross. There were clumps of pork that were so thick that they looked like pieces of beef stew. I'm not kidding, it was bad. No time or effort went into pulling that pork.To make matters worse, the seasonings were severely lacking. The mashed potatoes were a tannish color and spiced with cayenne or some other hot substance, they tasted bad as well. The cole slaw was dry. My mother made me laugh because she said, "There is no way a real southerner cooked this pork. I need to show them how it's done. And at 88 she still can. Famous Daves has nothing to worry about if this is the quality of BBQ Baby Blues is pushing.
