so i've been meaning to try this place out since i live a few blocks away.  i finally went on a wednesday night and have to say i was pleasantly surprised. i've never had "balinese" food before so i asked the friendly waitress for some recommendations.  she recommended the beef rendang and caramelized bluefish which both me and my date ordered.  the beef was super yummy and the fish was amaze!  seriously, there were so many spices and flavors going on i don't think i could pinpoint what i was tasting, but i (we) really liked it.  oh yeah, we also ordered the chicken wings for an appetizer and we pretty much licked the plate clean.  i must say, i am super stoked to have such a gem in my corner of greenpoint because lets be honest, i am sick of the standard selection of chinese/sushi/deli sandwiches.  i'll be back selamat pagi!
