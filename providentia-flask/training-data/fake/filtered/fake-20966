Awesome beer/liquor selection and really affordable happy hour for a pretty decent restaurant price wise. Food is always good and service is pretty good. Never complained yet. One of the many good restaurants on Ditmars Astoria to go to. Greek of course is none the many however I would recommend this one for happy hour and eats.
