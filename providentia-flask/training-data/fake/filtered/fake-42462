Great family style local Italian Restaurant! I am happy to say we are here often and never disappointed. Try the Tony Salad with meat! It is addicting! The pizza is awesome! great tasting crust- the meatballs are one of my favorites too and all their sauces are really tasty. It is very inexpensive and BYOB!
