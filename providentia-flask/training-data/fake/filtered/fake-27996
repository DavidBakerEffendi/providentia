Never have an event here. I have come here a few times for brunch, so I thought an event here would be great. We were told we would have the front corner, upon our arrival they had people there eating, and they stayed there for an hour into our event. Their selection of appetizers is minimal at best, and they were out of half of the items that would serve as finger foods for a standing party. The owner ignored us for most of the evening and didn't explain how the pricing would work to the clueless bartender and in the end they tried to not honor the pricing. He was very rude and dismissive during our conversations. We will never again enter this place. If you do decided to have an event, make sure you get everything in writing.
