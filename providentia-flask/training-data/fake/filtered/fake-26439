We just had the most fabulous dinner at Parc.  I had the trout and it was perfectly done, the almonds were amazing .  One daughter had short ribs and the other had the  Saturday veil special. One was better than the next. The onion soup was as good as ener, as was he tomatoe tart. We had a lovely table by the window and looked out on the Park. It was a back to school celebration for us and I couldn't have asked for a lovelier evening.
