My wife and I had our wedding here and from start to finish the service was impeccable. We booked with Angelo and Sheila few months ago, who were both attentive, friendly, knowledgeable and responsive to questions and needs. The night of, our ceremony ended a lot sooner than anticipated a quick call to Angelo and he said no problem we're ready to go. We were greeted with complimentary cheese displays, the entire staff was there lined up to greet us including the chef!!! The room was set up exactly as planned, decorated beautifully with seasonal d√©cor, bar tenders were attentive, fast and very friendly. The food was great, prime rib cooked perfectly, everything was hot and fresh, a waitress had the chef make 2 plates up for my wife and I so we could finally sit and eat and so our guests would not have wait for us to go thru. Talk about service!! Not at one moment thru the entire night did anyone have to wait for anything our drinks were never empty, buffet was full, servers were taking care of all of our guests all of whom commented on how great the service was. I've been in the food service / hospitality industry for close to 15 years and there places few and far between that understand the importance of great service and how to deliver it, and to everyone who was there that night can agree that Angelo and his team get it and have mastered it. huge thanks to Angelo and his team once more and if you're looking for a place that has great service, great food at a price that's fair for everyone. Look no further.
