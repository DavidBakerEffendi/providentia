This place is awesome. It doesn't get as much press as the other Garces joints (it seems like) but it deserves it. So European and relaxed, and the quality of the food and market items is high. We went for dinner recently and shared the deep-dish pizza and cheese plate (yes, we went on cheese overload). I've never been to Chicago but I love GTC's version of a deep dish pie. Not sure if it's authentic but I'll take it any day. And I love the extras that come with the cheese plate -- the honey, quince paste, yum!! We had a really awesome time here and think it's a great addition to the neighborhood. Hope it sticks around!
