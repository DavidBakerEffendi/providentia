I went to Hummus and Pita last week and I absolutely loved it. The service was great and the food was fresh and delicious.  The chicken was tender and tasty and the falafel was perfect. Another great thing about this restaurant is the pita and laffa bread is made on site so it is warm and ready to be filled with their variety of ingredients. If you aren't familiar with the ingredients they are offering you don't have to worry...the staff is extremely friendly and will explain what everything is and even how it is prepared.  Not only is the food great but the restaurant is clean and has an extremely comfortable environment. The only negative thing that I can say about this place is that it is not closer to where I work!
