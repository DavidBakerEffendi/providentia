The service was great and the ceviche is outstanding!  Definitely try the rainbow ceviche if you stop in.  They have great happy hour specials at the bar for food and drinks.  And their mojitos are delicious and refreshing.  The prices were a little high especially compared to the specials that were running at the bar during the same time that we were eating.  Next time, I will probably stop by for happy hour instead of a sit down dinner.
