Henry Street Deli is the only place I've ever been motivated enough to write a review for. It's is a true neighborhood gem. I live right across from Willard St. Market, but I always go the extra block or so to get the real deal at HSD. The food is awesome, the service is quick 'n dirty (in a good way), and the price is right. Coffee and an egg sandwich for under $5. Bring your own mug for super cheap Vermont Coffee Company brew.
