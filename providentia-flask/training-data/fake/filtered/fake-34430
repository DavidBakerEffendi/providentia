I've been going to Baja's since it first opened in 1992 and have found their food to be consistently top notch and authentic. I usually avoid going on crowded nights and especially Cinco de Mayo, but we decided to go this year to soak up the ambience. And we were not disappointed. Baja's fish tacos and shrimp fra diablo were to die for. There are other shrimp dishes that are just as good, but I seem to always settle on the hotter ones because Baja's knows how to make a hot sauce just hot enough, and very tasty. The shrimp were plump and not overcooked as can happen on a busy night. The salsas are also terrific, home made and fresh, with a nice variety ranging from very hot to mild. The tortillas served with the shrimp were hot, fresh and just chewy enough. The were the best I've ever had. I also love Baja's quesadilla baja with carne asada. This is a dish which never disappoints; the portion is large so i always take some home. it's just as good the next day. You don't go to Baja's for fine dining--it's the food, the ambience (if you've ever been to taquerias in Northern Mexico/Baja, California you know what I mean) and the friendly service that combine to make this a special place. If you want fine china, table cloths and a prestige location, then you're definitely in the wrong place. But I haven't eaten better Mexican anywhere else, and I have eaten at all of the Mexican establishments in this region.
