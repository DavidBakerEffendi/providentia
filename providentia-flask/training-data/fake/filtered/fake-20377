Yum! Definitely ranks among the best Indian food I have eaten in the US and specially in the NJ/NY area. Quick and attentive service. Only problem is the size of the place. Teeny weeny tiny room. That may also because it was packed really tight on a Sunday evening. Also, they made us sit right next to the door on a really windy/chilly evening. Every time someone opened the door, we felt uncomfortable. Other than these minor issues, the experience was great! I had the lamb curry and Madras chicken along with the (pretty standard) Navratan Khorma. Reasonable quantities. Right spice and looked like fresh ingredients went in to making the curries. A lot of Indian places go wrong because of using old condiments (read that word carefully) and possibly deep-frozen shredded coconut. The naan, garlic naan and the roti were soft and fluffy. Somehow they knew exactly when to bring in the next order which is extremely helpful when you go in hunger and expectation with a couple of kids in tow. I try and choose my restaurants carefully, so as not to put my kid through a lot of discomfort (there is all the time in the world to learn politeness at the table and putting on a generally agreeable behavior - 2 years is not that age). However,  invariably a kid at the adjacent table means a lot of pain to people sitting around us and to the servers. In this case, except for an annoying old couple who kept looking at us every time the kids as much as breathed heavier than usual, no one seemed to mind. The noise levels matched the spice levels but  there was a general atmosphere of happiness and contentment - now, what better tribute can you pay a restaurant?!
