We found Vitae by looking at Yelp, and were so impressed! Â We called for a table last-minute on a Friday evening, and were able to get right in. When we arrived, the first impression was Wow! Ultra modern, clean lines, beautiful lighting, tables nicely spaced -- just lovely. The service was even more amazing. From the first greeting to the hugs when we departed -- we received attentive care from, I think, 5 different people, and all were professional, friendly, and just plain wonderful. The wine list was good, though I would like a few more of the buttery Calif Chardonnays -- my personal favorite. The manager did point us to a good wine choice, though, and we were happy with it. The menu was artfully prepared, and the food was equally artfully executed. The three of us had: Seared Diver Scallop with Cauliflower, Golden Raisins, Cashews, Thai Curry Sauce for appetizer (shared), duck breast (superb), Alaskan wild salmon (an unusual preparation but nicely cooked), and Grilled Mayan Prawns (appetizer - delicious) paired with a small serving (nice idea) of the Maltagliati with Lamb Sausage, Baby Zucchini, Roasted Tomatoes San Tumas (different and quite good). We enjoyed a chef offering of a small bite-size risotto ball in a divine sauce, and after dinner another chef-offered bite of meringue with raspberry filling. We also shared two desserts: Rosemary-Honey Panna Cotta with Blueberries, Peanut Crumble, and Churros & Chocolate -- both delightful. This chef-owned restaurant has only been open five months, and in our experience a new restaurant often under-delivers - at least for the first year or so. This one was superlative on all counts, right down to the "Vitae" printed hand towels in the bathroom. We predict it will gain rapidly in popularity. Not sure if we will be back on this trip to NY, but for sure it will be on our list for any future visit to this city.
