Went there last Friday with family. Started at the bar where we were completely ignored by some oblivious female bartender who wouldn't serve us because we weren't ordering big bottles of Brunello di Montelcino. The gentleman behind the bar was very attentive. He had to be due to the fact that his partner spent all of her time planted in front of some blinking fool, flirting, and doing nothing. While the food was better than average, the service was not. We were going for multiple courses, however, the waiter and food runners just threw the first 2 courses on the table together at once. That night being a special occasion due to my sister being home from her deployment to Afghanistan, I didn't want to make a fuss. It was so loud, my words would have landed on deaf ears. Literally. More than half a dozen times I had to ask for water. Both water and wine glasses empty for prolonged periods. When both courses were brought to the table, it was like an auction house. "Who got the sweet breads?" "who got the acorn squash?" I felt like I had to work there that night. Instead of getting tipped, we shelled out $600.00 for service that would have made a diner server blush. Oh, and if you're diabetic, don't go at all. They'll fight with you about fruit for dessert, make you wait 5 minutes after the table has been served to receive your bowl of cut up Granny Smiths and pears. Then they won't offer to bag up your cafeteria fruit lunchable. Never going back.
