I used to swear by this place.  I used to recommend it highly.  As they say in Israel  "NEVER AGAIN" I ordered a tongue tip sandwich and a celery tonic The manager came up at my request.. I asked "Did you reportion your sandwiches?" He said "Yes, they made them a little bit smaller." I said "A little bit?" and showed him half of my sandwich. I asked him "What weight were they and what are they now?" He said "I'm not supposed to tell you that." WTF? He charged me for a "half meat" sandwich, but why didn't the waitress notice how small it was when she brought it? I'm also suspect because he didn't offer to bring me a "full meat" sandwich, which would have been the proper way to handle the situation. Something is fishy (besides the lox) Plus, I bought a couple of "bagels" to go. They are kaiser rolls with holes poked through them, completely devoid of all the wonderful crustiness that makes a bagel a bagel.  They should close the bakery and buy the bagels at Stop and Shop around the corner.  Yes.  they are THAT bad. I took a photo of the sandwich they served me and the sandwich displayed on the video signage inside the place.  I can't seem to be able to post it here.  Here is a link to the facebook post: facebook.com/photo.php?f… The time before this my tongue sandwich was served cold in the middle, but at least I didn't leave hungry.  My old Yelp account which I can no longer access was under the name "Betty P." to hide my identity from a psycho hairdresser.  If you look at that review, you can see that Katz's has gone from 5 stars to 1.
