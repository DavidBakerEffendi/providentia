My wife, Annie, and I are visiting from CA.  One day during our visit, she had a craving for pizza.  I asked my  son, who lives in Brooklyn, and he suggested Lucali, but said there had been a recent altercation involving the owner, and he did not know if it was open.  I checked the website and read some of the reviews.  Some were excellent and others were really bad.  Annie and I like to make our own decisions, so we decided to take our walk and check it out for ourselves.  Upon arriving, a gentleman was standing outside taking orders and handing pizza to people who had called for pickup.  I determined that this gentleman was the owner Mark.  He immediately took us inside and seated us.  Within one minute we were greeted by Alex (Alexandria), an adorable, charming young lady who announced she would be waiting our table, and presented us with our choices of food.  We ordered and were promptly served the best thin crust pizza we ever ate.  Although a bit pricy, it was laced with quality toppings, fine, thin crust and bursting with flavor.  It is a BYOB, so I went to the corner and bought a couple beers.  We found the place dripping with atmosphere, an efficient kitchen, open to the public.  All toppings are cut and shredded individually for each pizza.  They also serve calzone, and we intend on going back, with some wine, prior to our return to CA.  Simply excellent service, ambience and food.  Arthur and Annie
