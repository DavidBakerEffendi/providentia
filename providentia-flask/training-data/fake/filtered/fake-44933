Honeygrow is great-- affordable, tasty, and seemingly healthy.  I say "seemingly" because there's no nutritional info posted anywhere in the store or on their website, so there's no real way to be sure.  Management: please, please give us the info-- doesn't have to be a fancy calculator. A simple PDF with calorie counts for each ingredient will get you 5 stars from me!
