The food here is very very good.  That cannot be denied.  I will be back - for take out only.  However, I think it is important to let people know that this is a take out place - not a sit down restaurant.  There are literally 3 tables.  I don't think it is at all clear from their website that this is a take out place - especially as it is more expensive than one would imagine a take out place would be.  But the food is very fresh and it is yummy so the prices aren't that outrageous. There is no bathroom.  We sat down at one of the tables and all of the tables were taken (again there are only 3 of them).  Someone came in after us and the staff suggested they ask someone to share a table. When the person asked to sit with us based on the staff person's suggestion,  I felt really put on the spot to share the table.  At Angelicas Kitchen they have a table reserved for sharing and you can decide whether you want your own table or not.  If there is a table sharing policy then that should be made clear with a sign and info on the website.  We were very rushed out - to the point where the staff put a salad I was taking to go into a bag while I sat at the table.   The food is very good...but this is not a comfortable place to sit and eat.
