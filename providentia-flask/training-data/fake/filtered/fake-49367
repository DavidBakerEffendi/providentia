I have been going to El Vez for years now, a few years ago I would have given this restaurant 5 stars, but now all I am going to say is get the guac, skip the meal. The chicken tacos used to be delicious, they recently changed the menu, and I am not sure the chicken tacos are even chicken. I felt myself questioning whether they gave me pork by mistake, and then after further inspection, I felt myself questioning if it was even mammal meat at all. Seriously El Vez, go back to your old chef and your old amazing chicken tacos.
