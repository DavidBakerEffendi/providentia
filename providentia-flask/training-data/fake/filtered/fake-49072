During my experience at the Crabby Shack I felt like I was on a holiday at the beach. You will come out of there with your hands dirty, crab all over your face but with a gigantic smile. I was there with 3 friends and decided to try out most items on the menu. Everything tasted fresh and amazing but if I had to chose the best dish I would go with the shrimps and their amazing sauce. I should also mention the the BLT crab sandwich which was also out of this world. In some other comments I read people complaining about the portions but I cannot think of any other place in NYC where you can have such good quality at such a reasonable price. Yes they could make the crab rolls bigger and charge you ten dollars more for them but they seem to be too honest there to do that. After we finished our meal, one of the owner came and asked for our opinion and she seemed genuinely interested in what we had to say. What a refreshing attitude in the sometime "know-it-all" NY culinary scene. Overall, I only have good things to say about this place and I will be back again and again and tell as many friends about it as possible because this place deserves to be known and appreciated by everyone.
