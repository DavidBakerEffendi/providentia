Reasonable prices, quick & friendly service, cozy & low-key. Shared the Vegetarian combination ad Firfir with two friends; the amount of food was just right. It was so delicious and flavorful we devoured the entire platter pretty quickly. The Tikil Gomen in that was part of the vegetarian combination was really good, and the Firfir was a tad too spicy, but actually really good for a cold snowy day. Sealed the meal with a divine cup of caf√© Voltaire. Definitely recommended if you're looking for a low-key, decent priced Ethiopian joint. They also have other American foods like sandwiches, wraps, and salads- but you can get those anywhere. The Ethiopian dishes at this place are the real gems.
