I love penang. Always very happy with the food. Large variety of different shrimp dishes. Great presentation on some as well. Sweet and sour shrimp is great, its not the typical Chinese type. And there is an appetizer with shrimp inside alittle fried pocket thing lol, I forget the name but they are really unique and delicious.
