I always enjoy my meal here but I also always wait in a ridiculous line (whether at lunch, for groceries or at dinner). I've decided not to go back for a while unless a friend tells me to come by and their food is about to be served. ha The rooftop: cool but something needs to be done about the huge pit next to the beer garden (I need to be able to look down on people if i'm on a roof) As far as quality of products are concerned Eataly is killing it.
