I have been a customer of the watching deli for a couple of years. The food is awesome and the place is so clean!  Love the Chicken Cutlet wrap with fresh mozzarella....it's the best.  It's worth the drive from West Paterson!  The owners are always there and love to talk to everyone.....would recommend this place in a minute !
