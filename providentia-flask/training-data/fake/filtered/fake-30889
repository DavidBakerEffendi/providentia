I have been hearing about this great spot from some friends who live in Montclair. They  were so right.    From the minute you walk in you get the feeling you are in a cafe in Paris or some other spot in Europe. The ambiance is great and the friendly welcome from the owner added to the charm. The  waitress recommended the Portuguese French toast...wow was she right! It was tasty, moist and the favors came through as advertised. the coffee was some of the best I have had , forget Starbucks... So I would say that the recommendations were 100% right and I will definitely come back to try some of the great lunch items I saw on the menu. Highly recommend Le Salbuen!
