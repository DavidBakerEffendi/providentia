If you want the classic "midtown bar" experience, complete with millions of TVs (to the point where it feels like the inside of a video game), you're going to love this place. The food is definitely above average, but it's also kind of pricy. Again, midtown bar. Why anyone would choose a place like this, I have no idea.
