This place is cozy, trendy, live music on Fridays and Saturdays.. I was there two weeks ago with clients, Luis and Claudia to celebrate closing on their coop apartment in East Elmhurst. The decor is warm, inviting.. delicious food! Music invites you to dance.. Highly recommended! Ione Costa Queens Real Estate
