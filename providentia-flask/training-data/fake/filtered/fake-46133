I have been an SPG member for quite some time and vary on the places I stay. But, this hotel, by far the worst hotel I have stayed in other than the Red Roof Inn that I was forced to stay in due to a blizzard on the road. The room I was in was rust stained in the tub, sink and under the sink; brown water spots and mildew smell were in the ceiling; the furniture was spotted and not clean; and the adjoining room that I was next to was so bad that my headboard was apart of their activities. Actually the walls were so very thin, the couple may as well of been in my room! The staff is horrible with having explanations as to why they don't carry out things that they are asked to do (Gopala Young), in addition to not responding to the numerous emails that I sent (Elise Carbajal). This hotel should shut down until they are up to an SPG standard.
