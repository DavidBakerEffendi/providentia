We reserved the back, semi-private space of the Bluebird Tavern for our small wedding reception dinner.  The staff was exceptional throughout the planning process and on the evening of our wedding.  The food was delicious and the service was fantastic.  Tara helped us coordinate the event and menu, and was extremely professional and accommodating.  Chris helped us select bottles and wine and a bar menu to suit our guests, which was a great experience.  Jim, the evening manager, was there on the night of our event to make sure things went off without a hitch.  He was so willing to go above and beyond to make the night special for us.  We could not have imagined a better experience and are so thankful that we went with the Bluebird.  Now when we visit Burlington, we'll be sure to stop by to remember our wedding and to support such a wonderful restaurant.
