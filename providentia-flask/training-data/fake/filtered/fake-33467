We were initially attracted to this place because of the open layout and extensive beer selection.  However, like an STD carrying dime piece hooker, looks can be deceiving.  Ten minutes after being seated we still were not approached by a server, only given water by the hostess (and the joint was not crowded.)  We finally had to prompt the hostess to send a server over to take our beer and food orders.  With all of the beers on tap, the one my hot date ordered was not available - of course.  First round o' beers was enjoyable.  Food came out looking tasty.  My burger, despite ordering it without cheese, came with cheese, along with that doggone duo of lettuce and mayo - not mentioned on the menu.  Overfall, food was good, but made my hot date vomit - seriously - as a result of how fried and greasy the chicken was.  After leaving the table again to fetch a beer menu, neglected again by the service, the second round of beers arrived after our glasses sat on the table empty for another ten minutes.  My $8 beer tasted like soy sauce.  No joke.  Had to choke it down in order to justify the price - no way was I going to leave a wounded $8 soldier.   Cliff notes: - service was terribly neglectful and unknowledgable despite the amount of servers on staff and slow nature of the night - don't get the $8 soy sauce beer - or the chicken snitzel because you may have an up chuck reflex - setting was cool (pillows were available to nap on) - large beer list to choose from (beware, your first choice may not be available!) - service sucked hope this helps!
