I went there for lunch and this place blew me away. I had the crepe and I decided to have it with sausage, cheese, and mushrooms. It was out of this world. After lunch i split a chocolate crepe. Like everything else at this restaurant it was great. This is a true French restaurant and yes the food takes a while to come but I sort of enjoy that. The waitresses are very friendly and helpful. I don't know what this place is like for dinner or breakfast but it is the place to be for lunch.
