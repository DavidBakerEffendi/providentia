This was by far the most bizarre dining experince I have ever had.  My husband and I eat out 3-4 times per week.  After the gym we love to grab a salad or burger with a cocktail.  Love to sit at the bar.  I checked this place out...looked cool and different and was looking for a change from our usual spot.  it was late and the place was dead...therefore service should have been top notch.  We sat at the bar and had to ask twice for food menus.  My husband asked for a certain type of alcohol and we were told we needed to " go to delaney's" if we wanted that.  uumm whatever.  he came up with an alternate and she made two drinks.  PS i already had wine and did not order what he was having.  Bartendar seemed flustered and confused with a whopping 5 people in the entire place.  it went from bad to worse as she kept talking to her self while stocking the bar ( clearly annoyed over something) our food took almost an hour.  really? i could have jumped back there myself.  but the best part was when she literally told us under her breath to "run...run far away" food was just ok, but the experience was out of the twighlight zone
