Ive worked in the area for 8yrs now and used to frequent this place 3-4 times a month for coffee and breakfast/lunch and over time Ive seen things drop off in regards to customer service, food quality and increased prices. I understand that coffee is like gas when it comes to prices and sometimes the market dictates it. However the food prices have really gone up as well. Ex.  Got a breakfast wrap 3 ingredients.egg,cheese and 1 link of turkey sausage cut up. The online menu said 7.25, got to the shop and the menu on the wall  said 8.25. Ok I figure the online  menu was old...real price 11.75. I ask about the price on the wall shoulders are shrugged and I'm told " oh yeah we have to get around to updating those prices". I walk out thinking why am I coming here anymore I just paid $16 for an egg sandwich and coffee, the high price coffee is just ok and it isnt like you walk out smiling because of the nice customer service and great food.  Coffe shops are a dime a dozen in old city and N. Liberities....bye Cafe Ole time to move on.
