This place came recommended by other friends who have discovered it a few months ago. When we went on a Sunday evening the line was long and we did wait for an hour! The 3 stars is because the doorman was grumpy and the staff not 'fantastic' and I did think it unfair that take-away people had to wait in the same line. But the pizza if 5 stars in my book and worth the wait!
