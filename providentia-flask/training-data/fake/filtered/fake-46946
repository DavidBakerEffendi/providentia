My husband and I eat dinner often at the restaurants bar since we rarely make advance reservations. We walked out of Maialino  last night after the "service" bartender poured half a glass pours for two  martinis up and less than a 5 oz pour of wine and didn't even take our full order before walking away and taking care of another customer. There is nothing worse to a bar customer than to get half a drink. Charge more and pour a 6-7 ounce glass of wine and a full martini. Never even tasted the food and I wouldn't ever return.
