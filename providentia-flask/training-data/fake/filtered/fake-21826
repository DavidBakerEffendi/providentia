To be fair, I have never eaten here and have heard good things about their food. I have been here a few times, as a friend of mine is in a band that frequents here, and every single time I love it more and more. This place attracts a crowd of genuinely nice people who like drinking, having a good time, and music. The upstairs where the stage is located is great. There is a bar there as well, making it easy to access drinks. JB's also has a nice selection of craft brews and cheap domestics, so depending on your mood you can get whatever you want. If you are in Fishtown or like good music, be sure to check out JB's!
