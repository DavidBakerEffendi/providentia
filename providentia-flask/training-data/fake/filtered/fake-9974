I've had good experiences at Sabrina's before, but the last time I was there was terrible. I ordered a breakfast burrito and the burrito came out with a large chunk of the tortilla missing.  I don't expect immaculate food at a brunch place, but I expect at least a little bit of pride in what is being sent out to the tables.  Whoever was in the kitchen that day obviously lacked any sort of pride about their food. Beyond that our waitress was some Hollywood Hipster who seemed too cool to talk to us any more than she had too.  She only spent enough time at our table to take our orders, and the one or two times she did show her face at the table she didn't care to look us in the eye as she talked to us.
