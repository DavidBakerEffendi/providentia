First off, this is my favorite spot in the area and my go to for dinner or drinks. I discovered this spot on a whim as I was looking at an apartment in the neighborhood, and cannot deny this place influenced my decision. The bartenders are great people and very attentive, and waitstaff is experienced and friendly. I have celebrated birthdays and have so many great memories at this spot! I go there at least once a week, so I can attest to their consistency. Get the pork chops!!!
