This place is awesome!  The food is delicious and imaginative, with lots of house-made specialties. We ate lunch one day and brunch another day.  Everyone on the staff greeted us with a smile which tells me the management knows what they are doing. The servers were knowledgable and made great suggestions. I will definitely come back any time I visit NYC.
