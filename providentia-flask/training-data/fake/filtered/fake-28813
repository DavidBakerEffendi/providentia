We found the Hourglass as we strolled trough the area after deciding not to go to a neighboring  restaurant had walked into. What a gem!! The atmosphere is very inviting with the exposed brick walls and warm decor. We ate on the 2nd floor in the bar area where the bar tender/owner took fabulous care of us-a friendly establishment with great food. We had pasta dishes and a wonderful chocolate cake dessert.  I will be back in the area in a few weeks and will surely make time to stop by again!!
