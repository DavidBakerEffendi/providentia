this place is a great spot to meet up with friends on the weekend. it's also a really good place to go if you need to study or read a book in the afternoon. not kidding! it's so spacious inside, if you go before dinner (like around 4pm) you can relax and sip a beer and clear your head. it's almost like a public park.
