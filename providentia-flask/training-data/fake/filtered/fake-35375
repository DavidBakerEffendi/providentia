Our worst dining experience in NYC. By far. Ridiculously overpriced, the food has rather little, if anything, to do with real, authentic Italian cooking; at best, it should be characterized as 'misunderstood Italian'. If you want to pay this much for (real) Italian food, go to one of the top Italian restaurants in Manhattan. They may be overpriced too, but at least their quality is much more in line with pricing. Notning we tasted was particularly delicate, memorable, or anywhere near justifying their prices. The numerous 'specials' -- not priced so obviously a sneaky way to increase profits -- add to an already overly long menu, which by itself raises a red flag; a good Italian restaurant never has a menu this long. The pizza was awful too, prefabricated, don't let the wood fired owen fool you. This is a restaurant where the ratings are completely detached from reality. A scam. It only gets one star in part because the app seemingly can't leave that field blank and in part because the service while not great wasn't as bad as the food and the prices.
