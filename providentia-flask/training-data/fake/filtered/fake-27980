Went to the renovated Gusano's last night for the first time. Happy to see some old favorites like the chicken burritos on the menu, which are mild, but I love them. I tried the Chef Irvine shrimp burritos this time, with trepidation, but they were delicioso! I could taste the fresh lime and garlic and I enjoyed every bite. The Â salsa verde, cilantro cream, queso fresco and black beans were yummy. The chips were light and crisp, and the salsa was nice and spicy. We declined the spicier green salsa - a good sign, as my husband usually needs hotter salsa than is offered most places. The new decor is lovely - on TV I thought it looked too bland, but in person it is cheery and casually elegant. I am happy to see more authentically flavored Mexican food, which is fresher and more subtle than Tex Mex ( which I sometimes enjoy, I'll admit). Dad says the fajitas taste the same - he always orders them, so that is a good thing. My husband cleaned his plate, so the Taco Trio was very good. Mom said lobster tacos were too spicy for her - but my delicately flavored shrimp was also deemed to spicy. She will happily go back to her quesadillas, I'm sure. I look forward to trying more of the new dishes, and the drinks look fun and colorful too. Allergies prevented me from trying them last night. Dang goldenrod. The service was as friendly as it's always been, but you could sense the new pride and the attentiveness was noticeably top notch, yet non intrusive and welcomed. I'm annoyed by overly attentive service, but these folks are low key and genuinely warm. Hooray for Gusanoz's!
