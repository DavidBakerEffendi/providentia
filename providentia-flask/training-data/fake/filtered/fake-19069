This is what New York Pizza should be all over town. AMAZING! Fresh, hot toppings, the crust is perfect every time. The price is a little more than usual but I can taste where my extra money is going. I love everything about this place. But here is the but, you knew it was coming. The wait is long, not so long to make me leave but long enough to make me huff. The restaurant is small with almost no where to eat at. So hopefully with time this guys will get a  new space and continue to make there amazing pies. YOU HAVE TO TRY THE CRAB, melts in your mouth, seriously.  So I say to hell with Ray's and any place that lets good pizza sit around and good bad.
