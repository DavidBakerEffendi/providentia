My suggestion for PYT diners: whatever the chef's cooking for the burger of the week - jump in.  Have it. The burger of the week was the Elvis: burger, fried banana, bacon, and peanut butter on Texas Toast.  Sounds potentially gross, but it was delicious.  The shakes are also great - we tried a chocolate, peanut butter, banana and they gave a generous helping of whipped cream.  For dessert, we tried a special: the chocolate cheesecake pierogies.  Ridiculous?  Maybe.  Delicious?  Yes. The general manager stopped by our table to check in and we wound up chatting for a bit.  He offered us a free shot of whiskey and a pickle juice chaser on the house!  Actually not bad at all. If you want a little adventure and a big indulgence, check out PYT.
