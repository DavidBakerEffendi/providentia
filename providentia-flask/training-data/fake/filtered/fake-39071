After reading the reviews, I thought I'd give this restaurant a shot. I have to say, I was disappointed. It is such a chaotic environment. From the yelling manager to the confused staff and the average food' it is not the place to have a good time. Even though the servers did their job to the best of their knowledge, and they were as respectful as possible, I think the management lacks some professionalism. The food could be improved as well.
