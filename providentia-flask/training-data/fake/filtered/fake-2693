This restaurant is amazing find and truly different. The food is unique to say the least. I've had oysters with PopRocks candy on top (remember that stuff from the 80's that crackles in your mouth) and sardines and seaweed pizza amongst other fascinating dishes. The atmosphere is laid back and very cozy. Also, the owner and head chef, Jehangir, is extremely friendly and helpful.
