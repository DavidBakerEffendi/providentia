I just visited Cubanu for the first time this past weekend, and I must say, it's excellent! The food was delicious, and the atmosphere was really nice. Driving music buzzed in the background, a nice lighting, and voila, you've got yourself an unforgettable dinner. I highly recommend that anyone in the area drop by; it was one of the best nights of my life! PS: I highly recommend the "Gordo Victor"; a massive skirt steak that tastes great!
