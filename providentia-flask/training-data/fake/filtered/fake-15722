I've been excitedly waiting for Saigon Pho to open and it did not disappoint.  I ordered the Saigon Deluxe Pho and Beef Satay.  The Pho was excellent.  The broth was flavorful and not salty at all, lots of meat, and the right amount of noodle to meat ratio.  The Beef Satay was flavorful, but I would have liked a little more sear/ caramelization to it.  Price was about 1-2 dollars more than what I would pay in NYC or Brooklyn Chinatowns.  But considering gas and tolls, I am ok with paying the extra 1-2 dollars.  Restaurant is very clean, but we will have to check it out once it's been open longer.  Will definitely return!  Pay in cash in a bill over $30 and get 10% off, reservations have an 18% gratuity.  Table of 5+'have a 20%g gratuity.
