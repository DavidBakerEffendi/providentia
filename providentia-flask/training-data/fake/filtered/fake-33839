My family and I have been patrons of this lovely restaurant for years. Put simply, the food is delectable-  fresh, tasty, exquisitely presented, and incredibly reminiscent of Old World Italy. Ambiance is equally as impressive. It's a family affair at La Riviera, which certainly adds to its appeal. Chef Franco and his son Antonio go the extra mile in preparing each meal, while wife Danica and daughter Maria make sure that each guest leaves satisfied. Wait staff is professional, friendly, and attentive. While I've enjoyed everything on the menu that I've tried, the Strascinati with leak sauce continues to be a favorite (and a MUST for any pasta lover). We've also utilized the private party room, most recently to celebrate my college graduation. The set-up, the wait staff, and the multiple courses of food were nothing short of perfection. Despite usually avoiding seafood, my one friend couldn't get his hands off Franco's calamari. Bottom line: In an area where sub-par Italian restaurants abound, La Riviera  stands out as the place to go for a consistently delicious homestyle Italian meal.
