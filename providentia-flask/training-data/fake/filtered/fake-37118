I visited Trumpets tonight for the first time and I am posting this (my first and only) review in the hope it might offset the negativity found in some of the reviews posted on this page.   Trumpets is a very nice venue for both performers and audience.  Quite comfortable, good sound, and the Vinny Valentino trio was superb.  I received maximum value for my dining and entertainment dollar. I have to wonder why the folks who knocked this place identify themselves as jazz fans.    Have they ever actually set foot in a jazz club?  Based on their complaints, I doubt it.  The club does not "smell" nor does it appear to be stuffy and outdated. The crowd was a nice mixture of young, middle-aged, and older couples.  Some of the posters complained that they observed people with "hearing aids."  That doesn't sound like any jazz fans I know.  Ha! Rare, if it even exists at all, is the music club where the food is the attraction.  Trumpets has a simple menu, with limited options (it's not a diner!), and if you listen to the staff, they will steer you to the better options.  I asked for and followed the waitress's suggestion and ordered the Louisiana shrimp.  It was exactly as described and very satisfying.   Please support live music and the musicians who give it to us.  Go and visit Trumpets with an open mind.  If you do, you will enjoy the professionalism of the musicians and the joy that they bring.  And ask the staff to recommend a dish before ordering. Finally, before posting a negative review, please think about the consequences that will befall any business owner who is unable to respond to your complaint, but must suffer from your negativity.
