The Cambridge has a great ambience, gorgeous outdoor seating areas, and a very attentive staff. One thing it does not have is awesome food. I got their pulled pork Mac and Cheese. It was SO salty. Whenever I see Mac and Cheese on a menu I never fail to order it because who can possibly mess up Mac and Cheese? The Cambridge can! I wouldn't recommend this place unless you were stopping in for a quick brew or a salad..
