The food was great but the service today was horrible. First, the lady server was so rude and embrassing because it seem like she was rushing me through my food. Even gave us the check before we ask for it and after i pay she cont.. to discuss with me  her service after i said i didn't want to talk. I informed the host but she couldn't get a manager and she informed me  that she always get people complaining about her.  If you go their make sure you ask for the MEN server stay away from the women server.
