We went to Grill 21, last saturday night, after my daughter found it on some app she had. This was our first time with filipino food, and it was outstanding!! FIVE STARS! We had chicken sotanghan, Pork Adobo and Leche Flan, which was the best I have  ever had. The owner, Henry, came and sat with us, the entire meal!  He guided our choices, and i have NEVER seen such an amazing example of an owner LOVING his food, restaraunt and staff! We will travel back, from Madison CT, to this outstanding dining experience, again and again! Thank you!
