I purchased a groupon for Mcladdens in 2012.  Unfortunately, I let it expire so I could no longer use the promotional value but the original $15 I paid for the groupon was still valid.  I decided to go ahead and order take out.  When I got to the McLadden's, I went to pay the almost $30 bill.   I handed over my groupon and the rest in cash. The waitress came back and informed me that my groupon was valid only for dine in.  While I understand why this policy is in place when there is a promotional value (i.e  $30 worth of food for $15), I do not think it is a fair policy if the promotional value has expired.  If I purchased a $15 gift card, McLadden's would not dictate how I could use my gift card.  I see this expired groupon purchase as the same thing as a gift card (I am not getting more than my original investment).  I tried explaining this to the manager but he would not budge on this issue.  So I ended up not being able to use my groupon and having to use cash for my take out.  On top of it, the food was a disappointment. I will not be going back to McLaddens.
