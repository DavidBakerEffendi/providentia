BXL Zoute is a great place to have lunch or dinner and I surely enjoyed a good belgian beer here. They have a wide selection of draft beer and good knowledge of each one which they happily share. They even stored my luggage during the day and gave me a good and fast lunch before heading to the airport. Service was excellent. When I'm back in NYC, I'll go back for sure, love it there!
