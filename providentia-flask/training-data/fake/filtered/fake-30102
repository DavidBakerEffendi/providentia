This is the only restaurant my husband will eat at in the city.  The service is outstanding and they never rush you (like most of the places in the city).  Have taken my daughters, their husbands and even grandchildren here for dinner.  Never had a negative comment about the food or service.  Great place to eat before or after the theatre.
