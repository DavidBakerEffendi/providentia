Finally made it out here on Monday night after having it  on my "to eat & drink at" list for months.  First big score for this one was when my date showed the slightest hesitation about sitting in the middle of the first floor dining room (basically sharing a table with another couple), the hostess quickly found us a spot upstairs with considerable more room and comfort.   As other yelpers mentioned, this is a GREAT spot for wine drinking.   There are numerous affordable offerings on the 1/2 bottle list , which allowed the two of us to try three different wines throughout our meal.   As for food , I was pleased but not overwhelmed.  The warm goat cheese profiteroles with herb and roasted red pepper salad was definately standout and the french onion soup was among the best I've ever had.  A strip steak entree was common and left me with little to mention, however the braised lamb shank was tender and tasty , and brussel sprouts with lardons were also great.  Also, the entree portions were massive ... The $3 dessert option is the 2nd best thing (next to the wine list) about this place and perfect for those of us you like just a small sweet at the end of a meal.
