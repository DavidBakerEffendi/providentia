Rybread is by far the best sandwich shop I've ever visited. They remember your name, greet you with a smile and make incredibly yummy sandwiches, coffee and desserts. If you go during peak lunch hours be prepared to wait a little bit but trust me - its worth every second. Plus, knowing that the staff is working as hard and as fast as they can to give you an amazing sandwich experience makes the wait oh so worth it. If you want fresh ingredients, you have to be patient. Try the Tuscon - it's amazing!
