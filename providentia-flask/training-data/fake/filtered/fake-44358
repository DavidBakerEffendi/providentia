Their strong point is sauces, I've probably could eat anything with such a tasty sauce. I prefer eastern cuisine for its spicery. Of course you should have a skill to prepare all this dishes. Once I found a recipe of their speciality in the Internet and tried to make it myself. My dish was far not so tasty as theirs. So I have stopped trying to do it myself and just prefer to visit them on weekends.
