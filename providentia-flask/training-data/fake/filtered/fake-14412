I tried Lena's today for the first time and loved it!  It smelled so good when I walked in and everything on the menu sounded so appetizing that I had a hard time deciding what to order.  I chose the Nono sandwich (proscuitto, sopresatta, roasted peppers, fresh mozzarella), and asked them to add pesto to it and grill it panini style.  It was delicious - I wouldn't change one thing about that sandwich - yum!  I also ordered some meatballs to bring home for dinner and couldn't resist tasting one right when I got home.  Sooooo good!!!  Lena's is such a cute little place with delicious food.  The owners were really friendly too - I will definitely be back!
