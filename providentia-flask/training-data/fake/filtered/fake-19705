For this neighborhood, this is probably one of the only decent full-service restaurants. Their take-out is actually what I prefer because their service is not always on point. For brunch they have a strange policy not to take any guests after 3pm, which the owners should seriously re-consider especially since there are always at least 50 people willing to sit and have brunch between 3pm and 5pm. Get and extra guy in the kitchen to prep the night shift and have your servers work a longer shift. After all they only open at 11am. The food has always been great.
