Coming from just outside of NYC to Burlington VT it is hard to find good Chinese in Burlington. Hung Tao has not failed to deliver in all the times i've ordered from them. Always hot and delicious, great flavor and pretty reasonably priced as well. The only negative thing i can say about this restaurant is that they do not accept credit cards for anything under $5. The limit can be a little annoying if you just want a few egg rolls or maybe a box of friend rice for lunch.
