Without going into too much detail, Russet was a culinary marvel from start to finish. 15 plus ingenious courses of magical and sublime flavors. Attentive, yet friendly service, definitely not stuffy or pushy. A rather demure dining space without embellishments or artwork. The star here is the food. A one off experience for our July 4th weekend getaway. The best meal we have ever had.
