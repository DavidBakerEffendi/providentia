Hidden Gem?  Keep it hidden!  From the moment we stepped into the establishment to the moment we left, we were uncomfortable.  The owner, Angelina, made it clear that she was not in the mood to play hostess with the mostess.  She was rude, abrasive, downright nasty and literally told us that she was ready to leave the business.  If we were not with others who were elderly we would have walked out. While the food was good and the portions were generous, the owner's demeanor was less than gracious.  We actually thought that perhaps there were hidden cameras and someone was playing a practical joke on us!  Nevermind the mishmosh of eclectic decorations, or the brashness of the owner's waiter, who flew in at the last moment to help out, that woman needs to close her business!  Overpriced food and unprofessional behavior towards paying patrons makes for a rotten dining experience. Never Never Never again.  Too bad, if the owner knew how to treat people it would be a goldmine.
