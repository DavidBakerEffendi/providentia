i heard about this place from a friend. very cute trendy restaurant. it smells like chocolate heaven as soon as you step in. the lighting was dim and romantic. it wasn't too crowded when i went.    this is def a good place for a first date or if you just need a little alone time. the drinks are a bit pricey for a college girl like myself... i think my milkshake was 7 or 8 dollars but it was really good! :)    oh yeah small portions.. if you're use to the huge cheesecake factory portions this is not the place for you. you wont need a doggie bag unless you ate before you came.
