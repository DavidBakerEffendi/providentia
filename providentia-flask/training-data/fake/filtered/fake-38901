Came here for my boyfriends birthday. I give 3/5 for the experience and a 4/5 for food, because it was delicious and dessert was amazing But I was dissapointed a bit at my first time visiting becco. The restaurant called the night before to confirm my reservations and when asked i specifically mentioned I didn't want them to sing when the desert came aroud which I guess they didn't note down. Luckily I managed to stop them before too much embarrassment. And the second dissapointing thing was when ordering I mentioned I wanted to add the 3 Unlimited pastas to the meal I ordered which the menu did say I could do, but apparently they forgot that too. I ended up just having the meal which was delicious. But for the great ratings this restaurant received I did expect our night to be a little more pleasurable
