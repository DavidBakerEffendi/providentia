The City Tap House is a great place to go to sit back and watch the phillies game. They have a wide range of beers on tap including Aventinus, one of my favorites. I have yet to eat anything here but when i look around at all of the dishes everything looks...mediocre. I enjoy the bartenders most of the time however there are a few that can be a somewhat pretentious when you mispronounce the name of beers or don't quite know what to order...(mostly the female bartenders.. cough cough). I manage a restaurant here in Philadelphia and like to enjoy a beer at CTH at the end of the night while my crew is cleaning up. One really neat addition to the restaurant is their outdoor seating with a number of firepits that anyone can cozy up to and hang out all night long. Overall i enjoy going to CTH but i feel like the service staff could be a little friendlier. Â Well, i'm headed over there for a beer now so lets see how this turns out. Thanks for reading and Happy eating and drinking Philly.
