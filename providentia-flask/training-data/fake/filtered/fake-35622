Penny Cluse is reliably deliscious. Â It is a favorite when friends from out of town are up to visit. The only thing I don't enjoy is the really long wait list, but that only goes to show how popular they are (for good reason). The service has always been good and I love the sunny atmosphere. My favorite breakfast place but it's a special treat to go as it can be a tad pricey.
