An East Village staple, this all-Belgian-Fries establishment is a must for anyone who hasn't checked it out yet.  Their menu consists of small, medium and large-sized fry cones.  They have over a dozen different sauces that you then smother you fries in.  Be careful not to combine this tasty treat with a trip to Paul's Burger Joint later in the day or you might not get out alive.  But please do yourself a favor and go there...now!
