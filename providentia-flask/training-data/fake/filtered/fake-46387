I am from Tokyo and Ippudo is one of my TOP 3 ramen places in NYC. (others are Zen 6 and Totto Ramen) The recipe for the broth is a bit different from Ippudo in Japan but it certainly keeps a traditional flavor. Unlike, Ippudo in Japan, the locations in Manhattan offer a very tasty selection of appetizers. Goma kyuri and edamame are some light ones to snack with a beer while you wait for the ramen. If you feel like some heavier starters, Samurai shortrib and Hirata chiken wings are super tasty. Don't forget to try the Hirata Buns (they are a must). *Both Manhattan locations are very popular so rsvp is recommended.
