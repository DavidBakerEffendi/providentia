express auto at 2 prospect st metuchen with mike as president set my car on fire . the mechanic was not experienced enough to do the work correctly. i took the buick to an experienced mechanic at buick and he charged me $ 1300 to rewire it. then i asked mike to change the trans filter and the mechanic did not add any trans fluid and trans burned out. then mike said he would put a jasper trans in the car for a payment of $ 215o in cash and guarantee it for 75,000 miles. instead he took the car to a cheaper place and put in a fixer upper which lasted 10,000 miles. finally, mike put me into a car with no brakes and i rolled down the incline in front of his shop onto rt 27 traffic where i could have been killed. he owes me $ 4,500 plus int.
