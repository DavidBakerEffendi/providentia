Fun to visit this new addition to 23rd Street, BUT super-expensive. I can buy most items from my neighborhood grocery stores for significantly less money. If buying to take food home, you're basically paying restaurant prices to purchase food to prepare at home. The items I looked at were at least 20% more expensive than the local supermarket or TJ's. Good for taking a date or visiting relatives there, but definitely not for your daily shopping needs.
