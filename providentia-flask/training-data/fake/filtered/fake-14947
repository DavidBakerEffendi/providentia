I'm amazed at the negative comments regarding the owner at Mamas. I've been in Philly for almost five years and have never been treated better. While I hate the term old school, this what you get here. Every time I've gone to Mamas I've been  treated with respect and kindness. The Pizza is abesolutely the best in Philly, second best in my life.  I'm going to add another story. Almost two months ago the owner was at the 30th street post office waiting to pick up a package.  I knew him, the line was long and he wasn't mailing anything so I told him to go in front of me. He didn't want to, afraid of offending the other customers. In a somewhat unexpected occurrence, everyone let him go to the front. I mentioned to the six or seven customers he had the best pizza in town, and to my surprise he offered everyone a free pizza.  I don't know if anyone took him up on it, but is this the gesture of someone who's rude?  He's old school. Use common sense. Don't walk in with a chip on your shoulder, respect the staff and you'll have an evening of great food.
