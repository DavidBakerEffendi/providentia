Just the sort of place you'd hope to find in a town like Hopewell. Excellent food (we had the crab cake sandwich, butternut squash soup, and ham & Brie quiche). I also bought chicken pot pies which we enjoyed for dinner. Â All was excellent, fresh, tasted like the best of homemade. It's small, and definitely had a crowd of regulars, but we didn't feel put off by that. Pricey, but no more than I'd expect for quality ingredients and good food. Portions are generous.
