Management, management, management!!! Lacking!! Had dinner here on the first Saturday night of its opening week. Management was more concerned about talking and seating with friends rather than new customers. Hostess was terrible. We were told it was an hour wait. Decided to have a drink at the bar, overlooking dining room with empty tables. After we realized people were just sitting themselves, we decided to sit at a table in the bar. Waitress was good but service from bar and kitchen was so bad it made her night hell. Worst part of the night was that the management would have discussions about customers, shortage of food, and bill issues on the restaurant floor in earshot of patrons, not very classy. We love the nutley location and hope this one grows better with age.
