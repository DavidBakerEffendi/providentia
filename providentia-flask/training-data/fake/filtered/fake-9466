This place is great. The food is wonderful, the staff is friendly and knowledgeable, but I will never spend money here again. We made a reservation for today, 3/22/14, very early in the day for 8:30. We called again to confirm our reservation in the early evening and were told everything was fine. We arrived at 8:20 and left after we weren't seated by 9:15. No apologies, just "2 more minutes" for the better part of an hour. Complete incompetence. I have spent a good deal of money here in the past few years and have recommended it to countless people, but I won't be back. I will also tell anyone who will listen to never go here.
