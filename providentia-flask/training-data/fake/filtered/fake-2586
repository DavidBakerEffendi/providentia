My favorite restaurant in the UES. We have dined here a lot and the experience has always been consistent. Any time we visit, the restaurant is buzzing. The indoor space appears slightly cramped but it's nice and cozy. The outdoor garden is great both in summer/winter as it has space heaters. The menu has great variety, however as of late we go on Monday nights for their meatball specials. I cannot flaw the food, the portions are perfect and at very reasonable prices. Service is great and the waitstaff have always been very helpful and attentive. Every time someone visits me in NYC, I make sure to bring them to Uva!
