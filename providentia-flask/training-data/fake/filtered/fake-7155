This was the truly worst meal I've ever had--or almost had, as I was unable to eat very much of it. Everything I ordered was fried (tonkatsu is the specialty of this place): calamari, squid legs and a shrimp-pork combination. However, instead of a delicious, light, panko coating on fresh food, tasteless, cardboard-like proteins were densely coated with tasteless breading. The diagnosis: cheap frozen food cooked in bad oil. What looked like a 2" wide butterflied shrimp was 1/2" of shrimp and 1-1/2" of the ghastly breading. Even the plain rice was mushy. Most of our party had sake, but one person ordered a glass of the house white wine. It was as sweet as a blush zin and to her, undrinkable; but they wouldn't exchange it, despite  the fact that we were 6 people ordering lots of food and drink.  I wouldn't give this venue any stars at all. To watchers of Gordon Ramsay's "Kitchen Nightmares" TV show, the cuisine here fits right in with the venues he visits.
