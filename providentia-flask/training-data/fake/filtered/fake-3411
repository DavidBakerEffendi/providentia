half way through my meal after eating 3 half peices of toast i realized the crust of the toast was thick with mold. I couldn't eat another bite. told the waitress she said im sorry and gave us the bill anyway didn't offer to take the meal off. i told the manager while paying up front , he asked me if i ate the omelette part said yes i ate half of it, so they took 3 dollars off the 8 dollar omelette...i should have threatened to call the health department if they didn't remove the item from the bill atleast, i don't like the idea paying anything for a meal that had mold on it. i wont be eating there ever again
