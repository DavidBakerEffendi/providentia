May be my taste buds aren't sophisticated enough. My impression of this place is that it thrives on name and reputation. Like many people, I've been meaning to visit this place for some time. I understand that when a place is as well known as this, you have higher expectations. I have to report that the food was... eh. It wasn't *bad*, it was slightly better than average, but was it good? I can't even call it remotely delicious. Keep in mind that this is based solely on the food so far. If I were to incorporate the price, my rating of this place would be much lower. Oh, and for those of you do not eat meat or seafood, your options are scarce. The service was great, though. The interior decorating was beautiful.
