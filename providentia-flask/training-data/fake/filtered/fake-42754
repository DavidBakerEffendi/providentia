This place is awesome. I love the Korzo restaurants but didn't realize this was affiliated until now. The Jalapeno Margarita is amazing, refreshing with a kick at the end and the pickle plate is super good, my cauliflower hating boyfriend was trying to steal the pickled cauliflower from me (plus everything is farm to table, and the farms they work with are listed right on the chalkboard) The decor and ambiance is rustic-y cool- copper piping in the bar, soft lighting and music, huge chalkboards- a place you would expect to find anywhere but here. The place is exactly what Bay Ridge needs- between this and the owl's head, it's starting to feel like there are actually places to hang out in the neighborhood.
