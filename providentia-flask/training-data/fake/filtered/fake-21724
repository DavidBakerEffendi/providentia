Felidia this is not.  The layout is cramped and stressful as no one has a good table.  I cannot tell you how disappointed I was with this.  It seems like they crammed in as many tables as possible.  The food was frankly embarrassingly like The Olive Garden and I went with friends.  I know it's sacrilegious for a foodie to say something like this but I'm kinda super pissed about the low quality and the restaurant layout. Additionally, it was so loud we couldn't even talk.  Very embarrassing took a client and was fully pissed when I left.
