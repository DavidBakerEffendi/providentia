This place is without a doubt the beat bagel shop around!   The food is always fresh and the portions are always huge.  The staff goes out of the way to ensure all your needs are met every time you go.  The Italiano is my favorite sandwich...  I am a true regular not only because I love to support local businesses but I chose Boonton Bagel because I'm treated like family every time I walk through the door and I'm always full when I leave. Boonton Bagel - THE BEST AROUND
