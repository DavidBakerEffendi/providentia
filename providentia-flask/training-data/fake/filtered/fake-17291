It's easy to get annoyed with the waits here (I had to wait two hours or so pretty much every time I've been), but it's well worth it. The pork bun appetizer is so good it's tempting to skip the entree and just order a handful of them, and the ramen is some of the best in the city. Just make sure you find a good place to kill some time off at while you wait for your table.
