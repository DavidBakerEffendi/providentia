Ate at Sripraphia for the first time last night (2/14/11). Waited 30 minutes for a table while getting jostled by the crowd of frenzied, Zagat-wielding "foodies." Drinks Thai iced bubble tea: Delicious Pineapple juice: it is what it is. Appetizers Mee Krob (fried vermicelli with shrimp): two piles of sweet fried noodles, each topped with one little shrimp. disappointing. Not worth the price. Bean Thread Chicken Larb: smelled and tasted like a baby's dirty diaper. plus, covered in knock your socks off HOT pepper sauce, though there was no star on the menu indicating it was spicy. Inedible. Main Courses Drunken Noodle: good but not as good as chicken basil noodle at my neighborhood Thai. chicken was minced, with bits of gristle throughout. Green Curry with Duck : Delicious. Best I've had outside of Thailand, though duck was mostly fat and skin, not that much meat. Dessert: warned off desserts here by multiple reviewers, plus it was Valentines Day so brought in a piece of heart-shaped chocolate cake. My wife and I were quickly pounced on by the dessert police: two different waitresses, loudly remonstrating us in front of other diners. Yeesh! Verdict: Will stick to my neighborhood Thai.
