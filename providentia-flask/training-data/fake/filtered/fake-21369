absolute worst! ordered a boars head bbq deli chicken, ham, yellow american and mustard sandwich on a roll and when i get back to my office i open up a hot grilled chicken sandwich with bbq sauce, melted ham, melted yellow american and mustard on a roll. call up they apologize and say they will deliver a new sandwich to me. great. sandwich comes 30 minutes later, i open it up and its boars head deli chicken with bbq sauce, ham, yellow american and mustard. talk about gross. call them back up and the woman who answered the phone immediately had an attitude like I messed up the sandwiches. she puts me on hold and i can hear her yelling in the background 'someone else betta talk to himmmmm, im not going back there, IM NOT GOING BACK THERE'. than another woman gets on the phone to try to tell me that when i called back the first time to tell them of their mistake that they told me they didnt have boars head bbq deli chicken and that they would give me regular deli chicken with bbq sauce. excuse me? who would want sliced deli chicken smothered in bbq sauce and mustard? not me. too many other delis out there to have to deal with one who treats their customers like this - especially repeat customers.
