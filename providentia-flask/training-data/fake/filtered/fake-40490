Stopped in to Bridget Foys on 9/18. Â Party of 3 adults. Ordered some of the Restaurant week selections and were very satisfied with the appetizers (crab corn chowder, lobster rolls, and Philly cheese steak croquettes), stuffed pepper entrees, and dessert (apple empenadas). Good prices and great service. From out of town and would go back again. Ari
