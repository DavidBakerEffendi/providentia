Atmosphere Piolin Jr restaurant has spacious room to enjoy Peruvian food with family and friends, nice place to meet friends after work for an excellent Happy Hour. They have 2 rooms for dancing. I have been there several times and have never been disappointed.   Menu I love Peruvian food, specially the Arroz Chaufa because it is similar to the chinese food.  I also tried these dishes that I love Lomo Saltado, Biste a Lo Pobre, Cebiche (Leche de Tigre)... and the prices are reasonable. Service The service was excellent! Our waiter was very friendly and attentive at all times. The owner and manager is very friendly. Please try their delicious Peruvian drinks like this my favorites (Chicha Sour and Pisco Sour) hmm... just delicious!  I will definitely return to this restaurant and I will refer to my family and friends!  Excellent restaurant.
