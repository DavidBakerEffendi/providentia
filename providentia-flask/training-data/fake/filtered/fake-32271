First of all, the reviews preceding mine are spot on.  I found this place on yelp looking for a BYOB restaurant to celebrate the engagement of some friends with some champagne.  I got a reservation for the same night.  The owner/waiter is a weird dude for sure.  We might have been offended but it seems to be part of the whole experience of the place.  My friend ordered the goulash and the guy made a weird face.  She asked if he had a better recommendation, and he waved his hands and said "no, no, no."  She actually really liked the goulash.  My steak frites was perfectly delicious though a teeny bit gristly.  The mushroom cigar was great, but the chocolate mousse was amazing.    Definitely opt for dessert.  The final bill was suprisingly low--byob is great! On the downside, the portions are strangely varied.  The goulash was small, the tuna was tiny.  The chicken was large and I had so much steak, I shared it around the table.  The mushroom cigar is only about 4 bites.  The mousse was plenty for 2 to share.  Then, of course, the place is tiny and cramped and the service was definitely odd, though we had everything we needed in a timely manner. My overall advice is definitely try this place.  Make reservations, bring cash and wine, and bring a happy, open mind, and friends or a date. Added-perk--  the shop next door has a shop window full of the cutest puppies in the world if you get there before 8pm.
