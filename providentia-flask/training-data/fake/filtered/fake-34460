Stopped here today, after foliage season and were happy with our choice. New owners have really cleaned this place up and it shows. Even the bathroom was clean.  (duh)  DH ordered the roast beef sandwich on rye. It came out nice and rare, stacked high. Very tasty, he said.  I had the grilled cheese sandwich which was good but not awesome.  The bread could have been grilled a bit more and the combination of swiss and cheddar would be better if they just left off the swiss.  We both had the famous tomato corn chowder. It was good but unimpressive........like thin tomato soup with a few kernels of corn thrown in.  We like corn chowder thick and creamy but to each his own. Service was really excellent.......Kate, the owner was friendly, informative and right on the ball. All in all, we would go back. And we wish them success in their new venture.
