I was there recently for a party and let me tell you it was awful. There were approximately 25 people in the party; had to bring your own beverages.  The owner charged $30 per person and here's what we got:  three to four orange slices, celery, and carrots on a plate with a dip that was tasteless and watery; two pumpkin ravolis in a bland sauce, ravolis were clearly frozen and were cold; tomato and mozzarella with what tasted like steak sauce; tomatoes were limpy and cheese was crumbly; a tart (frozen) filled with what tasted like cottage cheese; one small piece of cold fish in a watery sauce and a spear of  cold broccoli; dessert was a paper thin slice of cake; no coffee or tea.  Everyone walked away hungry.  A total rip off.  There are many better places to eat in Sunset Park. Stay away from Cafe Lore.
