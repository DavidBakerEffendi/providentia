After shopping at ABC Home we stepped into an unexpected gem of a restaurant.  Later found out that it was a JG effort.  Food was sensational, choice of the Beckman Cabernet was perfect and the atmosphere though a bit youthful for us was tres chic.  However,  we were totally annoyed by the political announcement on their guest card, "this card 100% post consumer, processed chlorine free and green certified, made with wind power."  Although I would return, for the great fare, I find it offensive to have to submit myself to a politically correct diatribe while enjoying an otherwise fabulous meal.  Think I'll send the card to Ricky Gervais and Dennis Miller for stand up material.
