Every time I think they've thought of it all they amaze me again.  I just had a focaccia pizza sandwich from pizza one and it was absolutely incredible.  I will never go to another pizza place as long as pizza one is around.  Everything from their menu to staff is excellent but their creativity with pizza is absolutely phenomenal.  If you haven't tried it I feel really bad for you.
