Went for brunch yesterday and had a wonderful meal.  The new addition to the brunch menu, Eggs benedict was delicious.  A friend who went with me had the sweet potato hash and was very impressed.  I have been there several times and have never been disappointed. Worth a wait if you want some good, hearty "comfort" food and a good menu selection.  I look forward to going again.  Great wait staff as well!
