The perfect spot to grab a bite. Friendly service, great food, good prices, and a large selection (plus breakfast foods!). Everything I've gotten from them has been tasty: cranberry turkey melt, chicken fingers, salads, sweet potato fries... It's my go-to spot for take out, but the place is bright and well-kept enough that I wouldn't mind eating in sometime.
