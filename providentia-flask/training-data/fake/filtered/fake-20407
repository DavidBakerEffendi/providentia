Great Thai Food. I went here recently for the first time and went back the following day. I am really happy that the have a vegan menu. I do wish it was spicier (despite asking for it extremely spicy it was still disappointingly mild), but the flavors were great. I'd recommend take out over eating in, though, as the service received in the restaurant at lunch time was less than friendly or ideal.
