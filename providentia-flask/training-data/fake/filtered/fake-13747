Here is the short version:  My wife and I were staying in Manhattan over the Christmas holiday in order to celebrate our 20th wedding anniversary.  We had planned on eating at the "original" Grimaldi's in Brooklyn because we enjoy frequenting our Grimaldi's in our hometown of San Antonio, Texas.  While waiting on line at Grimaldi's a  "local" lady walked by and started a conversation with my wife.  After telling us the story of Juliana's we decided to check it out.  Man, are we happy we did.  From the moment we were greeted at the door by Mrs. Grimaldi we knew we had made the right decision.  The pizza was in a word, "fantastic."  The dough was cooked perfectly.  The cheeses blended magnificently with the sauce and the flavor of the fresh basil was out of this world.  Eating at Juliana's was memorable in itself.  However, having the Juliana's staff and owners treat us like family made it (as Nat King Cole would say) "Unforgettable"!    We cannot wait to go back!
