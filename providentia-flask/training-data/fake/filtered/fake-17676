Had a fantastic dining experience here last night! My friends and I ordered two of their specialty pizzas (the Solar Flare and the Better Buffalo) along with two salads. Everything was delicious! Their Caesar salad is made with polenta croutons (a revelation!) and the dressing on their green salad (a sweet vinaigrette I believe) was just as our waitress described: drinkable *yum*. Speaking of our waitress, gotta give a shout out to Paige- she was candid, pleasant, well-informed and attentive. She definitely added to the overall experience. And not to forget the pizzas- generous toppings (locally sourced I believe), light and fluffy, perfectly crispy crust, and more than enough to go around! Their beer list is extensive and has great variety, and they also offer a nice selection of wines. Overall, we were all extremely pleased with everything and will most definitely be going back!!
