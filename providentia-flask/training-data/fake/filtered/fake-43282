It's 2pm...hadn't eaten lunch yet...I'm not sure whether to go for some cheap-o Rocket Joe's pizza (which is not nearly as satisfying when you're sober) or Vanessa's (awesome) Dumplings. Enter my friend Hil Phavery!  He recommended Cheeky Sandwiches based on word of mouth alone, i.e., he had never even tried it himself, and was essentially sending me out on a "guinea pig" food testing mission. I'll simply just say it was absolutely worth walking through the pouring rain and passing the place twice (because it's so small and crammed between two stores in a very unlikely location...adds to the charm though) before actually finding it, in order to taste these uniquely prepared, and overly satisfying sandwiches.   Perfect blend of flavors and personality and price. Very interesting doorway too... ;)
