I went to this Cafe for the first and LAST time today. We have breakfast at another place every Sunday........ but thought that we would try something different today. The waitress was really nasty....... she yelled at my 70 year old mother for no reason! When I told her that it was totally unacceptable for her to speak to ANYBODY like that...... especially my mother....... she tried to tell me why my mother deserved it and then rolled her eyes and walked away. You have GOT to be kidding me!!Now the place was busy and the food was good.......... our check was about 9 or 10 dollars more than we normally pay for the same meal............ they don't offer eggs benedict and have a very very small and limited kids menu............. but the food was not the issue.The nasty waitress was. This is a table of 5 that will never walk into this place again.
