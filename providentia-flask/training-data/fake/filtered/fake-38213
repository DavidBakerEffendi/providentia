Let first day that I've been coming to Greek Lady since 2004.  I go there for several reasons:  1. The restaurant is super clean!  2. Great customer service...3. The food is great.  4. Same cooks an staff throughout the years.  That means they are good to their staff which is why the 1st three things exist.  They are the best!  I drive across the city to eat there.  I got a lot of my friends going there for all the same reasons.  My choice consistently.  Why would folks eat anywhere else?
