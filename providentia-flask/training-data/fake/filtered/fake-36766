I'd heard rumors that this was the "best restaurant in Vermont" and was anxious to try it out, but was underwhelmed by the experience. We were there on a busy Monday and it was slow, slow, slow. It was an hour and a half between when the first and last dish came out -- and we only got food for two. Also, maybe we ordered wrong, but the food was decidedly Meh... the special dumpling looked more like a sliced up corndog (I know, it surprised me that that was even possible) and the special Spicy Szechuan Beef was so non-spicy that I'm not even sure they brought us the right dish. And it was expensive! I just can't recommend it.
