2 words! Taste GGGGGoooooooood!!! Real Deal!!! I get my Malaysian food FIX here for many years already. Try many other Malaysian restaurants and can't seem to beat this place. When you go Taste Good, you know Malaysian Food. Taste Good is on my speed dial. The place is quite small but not the portions of the food and my appetite. Got to try dishes- *Beef Hor Fun (wide flat noodels) with brown gravy-delish!!! *Hainanese Chicken RIce-got to eat with the condiments. *TOFU in SIzzling Plate *HOkkien Fried Noodle KL style *Beef Rendang -Tender Tender.. *Curry Yong ToFU *Singapore Laksa *Kang Kong Belanchan *Roti Cani (Indian pancake-curry dip) *Satay (meat on skewer) *Singapore Curry Noodle (Signature dish) *Singapore Fried Noodle The list goes on.... The restaurant is next to Hong Kong Supermarket. You won't miss it. The husband and wife owners are very friendly and hands on. They are always there.Don't hesitate to ask them to recommend their dishes. Enough said! Bon appetit! Chow Down now!!!
