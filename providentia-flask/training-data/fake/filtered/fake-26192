My third  time here. WHAT A GEM.. The first time was for Dinner and it was one of the best Bass I ever had.  We came with 4 guests for brunch Sunday and everything is top notch. From the Service to Food. I love their decor. They really paid attention to detail. Definitely worth all the hype that the plaques from ny times and nj monthly stated about the whole experience. They have cards on the tables that say they are Green restaurant certified. They apparently source there food  from a 300 mile radius as our waiter Matt explained. We started with The Sausage en croute it was a special and they were great. I had the crabcake which was wonderful. It was a nice smokey flavor and a nice size with two poached eggs, melon and These potatoes in these awesome little jars. They also had some peppers and onions and were a "country style" texture. My friends had a sandwich and burger which was equally as good.  All in All This place is Just a great addition to the area.....
