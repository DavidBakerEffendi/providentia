This restaurant I would give a higher score, however, I had a bad experience on New Years Eve. I know, I know, it's a busy time, but that no excuse to be rude! The hostess were not organized with the table they wanted us to sit at and it took a long time to clean. Our group brushed this off and ordered our food, which was great as usual. Then we wanted to give some cash towards the bill and then put two pizza on two separate cards. The waiter was short with us and told us to write out the amount with separate tax to do the math for him. We did and he still made a mistake twice, charging tax twice and then doubling the amount. No apology or anything. We were figuring this out for at least fifteen minutes. We had to have another waiter figure it out and because of this we didn't leave a tip.
