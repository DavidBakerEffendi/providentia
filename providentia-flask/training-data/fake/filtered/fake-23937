Loved the smiling, courteous service. Loved the Puri-Bhaji I ordered, and the Kulfi that followed. The restaurant is very clean and pleasant. The prices are very reasonable. It's really nice to be served Indian snack food on china plates rather than on paper plates. Will be back to try out the other delicacies on the menu.
