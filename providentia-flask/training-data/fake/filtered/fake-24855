I am a San Diego native that moved to NJ over 20 years ago. All that time, I have tried many different Mexican places looking for that shangri-la that would take me back to the now-closed Casa de Bandini in Old Town S.D. Toro Loco is it! The margaritas, the salsa, the atmosphere, and of course, the food... Outstanding. Just got back from another delicious lunch. I had a combo, hubby had Tacos al Pastor. It was like heaven. Service was attentive and prompt. The flan was the best we've ever had (and hubby knows his flan). The only place for improvement would be the tap water... Sort of tastes like it came out of a garden hose... But that's pretty minor in the grand scheme of things, IMHO. Love this place!!
