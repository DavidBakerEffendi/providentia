CICIS Pizza 2431 Us Highway 1, Ste 4, North Brunswick, NJ 08902 From the very start this was the worst experience I have experienced in a restaurant.  From the beginning, we ordered our drinks.  When given a clear plastic glass it had green debris on it. We should have requested our money back at that point and left.  But we requested clean glasses and moved on.  We went onto the salad bar, and picked up a salad plate. It was stuck to the lower plate with a thick layer of dried on crusty food "GROSS!!"  Spoke to the manager and he went through the glasses, plates and silverware.  We couldn't help but notice the amount of eating ware he took back to the kitchen.   One more thing, which needs to mention is the salad bar....  The selections were atrocious, the pineapple, spanish olives, and several other items were poured right out of a can "yuck".  Typical salad toppings were not to be found, such as tomatoes, cheese, or FRESH vegetables.  We are always looking for a good value, but you need to be able to EAT THE FOOD... MOST IMPORTANTLY With the breakout of diseases these days the eating ware needs to be CLEAN/SANITARY.  This CiCis is Gross...
