The quality of the food was average.  The restaurant seems to have trendy appeal because of the descriptions/names of the dishes that are supposed to be funny and some creative infusions on their cocktails.  But the taste of the dishes was not outstanding and some of the flavor combinations were not very balanced.    The typically expected dishes were okay (ie: spicy tuna roll etc) but the more creative dishes I tried didn't seem to work well in terms of their flavor and texture combinations.
