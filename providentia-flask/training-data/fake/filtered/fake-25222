4 stars?!? These ratings are obviously padded, based on my experience at the restaurant. I'm a New Yorker and have eaten at restaurants receiving - AND deserving of 4 stars on Yelp. This place, however, was NOT one of them. Gastropub? Hardly. Better beer selection at one of the many places down the street. Or in my fridge. Food? Nothing to write home about. I could cook up a better burger at home. And it would cost me a heck of a lot less than the amount they gouge you for here. That being said, I don't mind dropping cash for a really great burger, but that's not what I got here. Service? Maybe if my table set on fire, I would've caught the attention of the waitress. Otherwise, she was in no hurry to do her job and serve the tables. I also expect service to be without attitude.
