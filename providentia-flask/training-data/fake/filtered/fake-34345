Kerry has done it again!  This time his very own restaurant.  You can't go wrong with Salute.  Inventive, unique dishes that we all know but have just never seen prepared the way they prepare it.  Great staff.  Ownership works the floor every day and even runs food out.  Be sure to make it out to try this restaurant...you will not go wrong.  Tell Jerry Ralph from 4Sixty6 sent you!
