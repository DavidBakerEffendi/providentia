A Â friend and I were ignored while other customers were served at the counter. After I asked for a menu and placed an order at the counter the food took forever. And we were there at 2 pm so the place was not that busy. We were not offered refills on water. I went back to the counter to order coffee. She served it without offering sugar or cream. When I retrieved the sugar bowl there was an encrusted spoon in it. The sandwiches were merely adequate--no garnish or utensils. I think we had two monosyllables from the young woman the entire time we were there. I won't return
