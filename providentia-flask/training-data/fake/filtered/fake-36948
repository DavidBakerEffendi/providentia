Such a pleasure to have French food right here in Bay Ridge.  Kat, the chef, is trained in French cooking, and uses organic ingredients.  She is a supporter of using local farms, and the result of all those fresh ingredients is a delightful meal.  The staff was very nice, attentive but not overbearing; knowledgeable but not haughty.  Definitely will go again!
