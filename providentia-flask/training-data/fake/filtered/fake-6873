My husband and I went there with some friends for a Sunday brunch around 12:30. There were quite a few people there, but no wait for a table. My husband and I shared the duck trotter salad and the smoked trout melt, and both were delicious! The duck was well-seasoned, and the smoked trout was on artisan bread, lightly toasted with just the right amount of melty cheese on top. Had a side of chickpea salad with the trout, which had a light, clean flavor. The chickpeas weren't amazing by themselves, but blended well with the rest of the food so as not to overwhelm the flavor of the main course. Cost about $34 for the two dishes plus one coffee (excluding tip). I really enjoyed the meal, but deducted one star for the service. I concur with some of the other reviewers that the service was slow, but since we were chatting with friends we hadn't seen for a while, I didn't mind that much. However, my husband arrived to the restaurant before I did, and said several staff members walked right by him and another couple who were also waiting to be seated without even acknowledging them, and they had to flag someone down to get tables.
