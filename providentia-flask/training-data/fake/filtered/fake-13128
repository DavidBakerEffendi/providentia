Ok, the endless and undeserved praise needs to end. To start, this establishment did not invent the hamburger, though they act like they invented food itself. I have eaten burgers all around the world, and the one I was served was good. However, it was also the incorrect order, served without any side. Of the 4 customers inside, "Lou" didn't have the courtesy to walk 3 feet to drop the order from the 3 item menu off. There was nowhere to sit, and both bathrooms and the ATM were broken. The bottom line, this place uses the gimmick that it is somehow historical to provide minimal service and small portions. Nothing special, and certainly not worth around $20 to bring a disappointed date.
