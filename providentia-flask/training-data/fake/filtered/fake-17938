I have dined at Fricassee just about weekly since it opened and have yet to be disappointed. Fresh ingredients, creatively prepared and presented, ample portions and modestly priced. It is a BYOB establishment, conveniently located across street from liquor store. I heartily recommend you try it if you haven't, and am dining there again tonight
