Don't waste your time or money.   Had dinner there last night and while the decor was beautiful and our waitress was great I had to send my drink back twice to get it made properly.  Our steak was undercooked, we had to send that back too.  Once that arrived for the second time the sides were cold.  Had to send those back, they came 15 minutes later after we just ate a piece of meat by itself with a $120 bottle of wine and then they arrived.   Presentation of the food was poor.  We asked our waitress to have the meal split and it was explained to us that "really pisses off the chef", he doesn't like to do that.  Hmmm, don't want to upset the help, right?! Asked to speak to the manager who I'm pretty sure was a meth addict with no customer service skills.  Explained to him the situation over the course of dinner and he said "Well, what do you want me to do about it?  You've got your food now and your drink too?"  I couldn't believe it.  I suggested he buy our drinks and he said well, you didn't finish that one so  I'm not going to buy it, but comped the other.  I'll never go back there again.  It's a shame because the restaurant is really cozy and unique inside.   Oh, and on the way in and out 4 people, likely a hostess or two and maybe kitchen workers were hanging out at the host stand.  Not very professional.   Prediction - out of business in 6 months.
