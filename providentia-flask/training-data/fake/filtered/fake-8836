Love it!  Menu is not very extensive but there are a variety of options, all of which are tried and true.  Ok, I haven't tried the Haggis, but I've heard it's good.  They have the most delicious soups, in particular the Cock-a-Leekie (sp?) which is a creamy chicken soup.  The tomato cheddar soup is really yummy too.  I order the chicken pie almost every time.  The atmosphere is small, dark, and pub-like, with lots of beers on tap.  Servers are friendly.  Slow service during busy times; has been a little better recently.  I like the outdoor seating added last year.  It is an intimate setting and can be hard to find a large table if you have a big group (bigger than 4).  Not the greatest place for kids because it is small, tables are crowded in, there are tempting candles on each table, and no highchairs available,  but there is a kid's menu if you ask. Desserts are yummy.  Love the Scottish accents, too!
