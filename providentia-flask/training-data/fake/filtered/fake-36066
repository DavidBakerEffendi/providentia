This was our second time at this restaurant. The first time with absolutely fabulous. Both times we used a Groupon special. Tonight was a whole different atmosphere. We were limited on the type of salad, the type of appetizer that we can choose from and the first time we were there we could choose anything we wanted on the menu salad, appetizer and dinner. I argued with the server about the pizza that we wanted to order, since they have 15 to 20 different varieties and they allowed us to choose from 3. He believed that part of it and we did get what we wanted unfortunately on the salad and on the pizza the tomatoes that were supposed to be fresh we're still green in the center and almost impossible to eat. had tried a bite of veal parmesan the first time we were there and it just melted in your mouth. That was my choice for dinner tonight and it was dried out, very thin, very tasteless, and drowning in cheese. They also charged us sales tax on the Groupon which is something that I have never done it before. I can safely say that if this Groupon becomes available again we won't be going back.
