Lived up to expectations!!  Fresh squeezed orange juice . . . nothing could be better.  Buscatini pasta special was lemony and tangy and I liked it. Maybe not for everyone but gnocchi with spinach and lasagna and panini and arugula tomato pesto salad were fabulous.   And, the espresso at the end was perfect.
