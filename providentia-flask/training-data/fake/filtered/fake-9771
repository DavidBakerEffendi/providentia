I am never, never disappointed when I go to Cafe Goodfellas. The parking is great (on the street as well as a parking lot right across the street), the service is always quick and friendly (after going there a few times, the wait staff, and hostess remembers me!), and the food is like something my Grandma would make. The meatball salad is absolutely one of my favorite appetizers, and the seafood risotto special is to die for! Also, they have live music certain nights and the bands are always fabulous and a Ladies Night special, that a group of girlfriends and myself always love to go to- our favorite part is eating the lounge, its such a fun place to sit and eat! I absolutely recommend you check this restaurant out!
