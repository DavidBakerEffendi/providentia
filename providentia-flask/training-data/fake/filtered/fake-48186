I'm not sure why this place gets raving reviews.  The fries have the quality of a bag of fries you would get from the frozen food aisle at a supermarket.  They are served to you in this paper cone which is cool, but the fries are on the soggy side.  You than procede to dunk the fries in the glorified mayo, I mean sauce of your choice.  Completely overrated.
