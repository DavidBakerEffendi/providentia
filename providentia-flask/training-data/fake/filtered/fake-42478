I lived down the street from Lulu for about four years.  I tried going there twice, two years between attempts.  I found it to be an unwelcoming place for newcomers, almost cliquish.  After my second attempt, a friend told me that she stopped by before work one morning to pick up a coffee to go.  The door was open, so she went in.  Before she could even say a word, she was loudly reprimanded for coming in before they were open.  Neither of us ever went back after that.  I don't care how good the coffee was - there are several independent coffee shops in New Haven with great coffee, friendly service, and that WANT my business - why would I go back to Lulu?
