this place was recommended to me because im venezuelan, boy was i disappointed. First of all the actual restaurant is so small my girlfriend and i were sat right by the door we were basically on top of the table next to us. when the waitress took there order her butt was in my face... when she finally decided to take my order she couldnt hear me and had the audacity to say i had a speech problem (all said in spanish.. she didnt know i spoke spanish as well) the shrimp dish i ordered had a very strange oder... not pleasant when i complained about it the owner basically said i knew nothing about food. bottom line i would never go again
