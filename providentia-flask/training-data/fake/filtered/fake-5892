The Cookshop Menus have had entrees on them that reflected their state of preparation since man invented fire and menus. Hip eateries like the Cookshop are no exception flamb√©d charred and blackened are expected to be on the menu but not used to describe THE menu. It is so ridiculously dark in this stylish setting (at least I think it was stylish. - it was too dark to tell for sure) the menu should have been in Braille! Paper menus returned to servers with char marks, blackened and rolled into little Tikii torches is always a clue that something is wrong. My companion was reduced to ordering what "that woman at the table under the wall sconce had". The management even manages to defeat the time honored fall back for these romantically lghted venues (a.k.a. dark) of taking the menu to the bathroom to peruse by having the low lighting in the toilet too. The poor woman who emerged looking like the Joker after touching up her makeup was not amused. I like to enjoy the presentation of a meal. Sadly this was not possible except by the light of a very useful cellphone APP called the "torch" which helps to illuminate menus, makeup and dishes at the Cookshop. It is a harsh glare. I guess they don't want you to see the prices on the menu or the short pour on the wine either.
