Just went for drinks and small bites at Marathon last night. The wine list was well rounded and interesting, offering varietals that inspire a wine lover without intimidating the "average Joe". I'm still thinking about the absolutely sinful artichoke dip that we devoured and the crispy french fries with some sort of yummy remoulade. Am I alone in my new appreciation of Marathon on the Square where I don't have to worry about hanging with amateurs and can order a drink from a cute bartender sans the attitude?
