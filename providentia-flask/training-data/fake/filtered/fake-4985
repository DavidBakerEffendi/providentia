I would give my experience today 0 stars if I could. I ordered a plain pizza well done for pickup. After waiting entirely too long, a female staff members finally asks to help me. I tell her my name and she proceeded to walk away, restock items, talk to fellow coworkers and ultimately not help me at all. After a bit, another female worker asks me if I am being helped I tell her that I guess not. Get home- the pizza is not even made the way I ordered it. Customer service makes or breaks a business, I will not be returning and well tell others to do the very same.
