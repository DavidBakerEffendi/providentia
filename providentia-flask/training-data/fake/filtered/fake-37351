Cafe La Maude is one of my favorite brunch places in Northern Liberties.  My girlfriend and I stumbled in one morning when the wait for Honey's Sit n' Eat was too long (which is the norm).  And I am so glad we did! The food is delightful, the decor is warm and the owners are wonderful.  I wish they were open for dinner!  I would recommend for everyone to go and enjoy this gem in Northern Liberties! My recommendations:  If you get a breakfast sandwich, elect to have it on a baguette.  If the Croque Madame is on the breakfast menu, get it!  That said, you cannot go wrong with any of the choices.  For lunch, the Nicoise salad and Halloumi Press are on the top of my list.
