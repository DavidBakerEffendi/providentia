My husband and I ate at Montmartre last Wednesday evening after reading the rave review in Departures Magazine.  While we agree with positive reviews of the food, we were quite put off by the horrible music that we endured throughout our meal.  It was a loop of heavy American rap, played loudly.  We asked out waiter to please turn it off or down, but he assured us that was not possible as all of Stulman's restaurants play the same recorded loop of rap music.  What gives? a lovely french restaurant with that for background music! we propabely won't go back because of it.
