I have been in to Posto on a few occasions in the last few months. The pizza is very good, but not great. This would be a solid neighborhood pizza joint (albeit a pricey one), but for the people who work there: The vibe in this place is that the customer is very lucky to have the opportunity to sit and watch the folks who work there chat amongst themselves. It's as though they are doing you a great personal favor by taking your order. When you need something as simple as a drink refill or a fork, you will have to wait a long time and then the waitress will likely roll her eyes or mutter under her breath upon taking your request. The pizza just isn't that good, nor is the restaurant that special to suffer these people. As for delivery, you will be greeted on the phone with: "Posto - Hold." You may have to hold several minutes...I didn't wait, so I don't know how long delivery takes, BUT - When I was dining in one night, I witnessed the order taker greet a caller with the typical greeting, put the caller on hold and resume a five minute conversation with the waitress who was not bringing us our drinks, which were sitting on the bar. Oh, and we were one of three tables in the restaurant at the time... Bottom line - these people truly feel entitled to your patronage and let you know.
