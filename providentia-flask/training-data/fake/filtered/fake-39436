They have the worse customer service ever. I called @8:10 pm to reserve a table for 1. When I arrived they said I will be seated soon however I waited 41 minutes for a table. During my wait a group of 4 showed up and was seated immediately. I asked the hostess if they had reservations and he said no. He said he was not going to seat me because they were a bigger group. I explained how displeased I was with their customer service and they said it was their policy to seat bigger groups first due to the table size. I did not get a response when I said that policy is not written in the menus. The food did not taste like "real" Vietnamese food which I am accustomed to. The pho hardly had any meat and the egg rolls were tiny. I hope they learn to build rapport.
