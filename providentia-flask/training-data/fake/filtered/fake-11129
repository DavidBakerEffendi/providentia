Just a note for the record -- kudos to Frank for the high level of customer service for my birthday party on Nov. 29. It was great, perfect Â party in no small measure to Frank -- from food to drinks to entertainment to hospitality to the planning, Both upstairs and down we (some 40 people -- many of whom were there for the first time) were all were made to feel very welcome, And Frank working to bring in George Baker for the music was above and beyond the call of duty! Thanks to everyone at Anna Liffey's!
