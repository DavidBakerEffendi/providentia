My boyfriend and me were visiting New York and looking for a nice Italian restaurant close to Times Square. We found this one via Yelp and were not disappointed! The service was super nice, and food just plain delicious. We got a selection of complimentary olives and among those one of the best types I ever had. When I asked the waiter how they're called he even gave me the name of a shop where you can buy them. We didn't order any starters but I had the pasta trecolori and it was awesome. My boyfriend had some kind of meat which was also very good. Afterwards, we shared a pouched pear which was incredibly good. All in all - when I visit New York again, I will make sure to stop by here.
