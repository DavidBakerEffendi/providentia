I really liked the place a lot. The atmosphere makes you feel like you're in one of those diners in the movies. The waiters are nice, and it has a wide variety of breakfast items for a pretty reasonable price. My only complaint is that the pancakes were a bit tough, but that could just be because of the person who made them, and it could always get better. If you are in the area, and you are looking for breakfast, I definitely recommend Effie's Place. And it most definitely deserves 4 stars!
