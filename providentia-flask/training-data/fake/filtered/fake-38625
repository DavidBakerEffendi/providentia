Disappointed after being thoroughly excited to dine at a sustainably-farmed fish restaurant.  We came on a busy Saturday night, and had to remind the server to bring us bread. We also had to ask for specials.  Also, we couldn't hear the server, because it was so loud, perhaps the loudest restaurant I have ever been in, and he spoke softly.  We asked for a variety of oysters, he brought a variety, and we could not hear what the variety was. The server did not seem to care. The servers were running around like crazy.  The front of the house needs major work. Food: not that good.  Escarole and white beans are a cheap way to dress up fish, this is what comes with almost every dish.  I know, because I cook with these things myself, because they are cheap. The fish itself (I had the barramundi, husband had swordfish) was a bit slimy and again, not great.  The whole experience was meh.
