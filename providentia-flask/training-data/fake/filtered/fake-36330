This has been a tough decision to make about writing this review.  However, after my families last two visits to Scarpetta's I felt the need. If you are looking to pay top dollar and be rushed out the door for excellent food this is the place.   The food at Scarpetta' is excellent.  It's the lack of care for the customer that this review centers around.  This is a place where the whole order must be placed at once.  This they say helps the kitchen stay in balance.  This I say is how they rush you out the door.   Its funny that the staff says the kitchen can't handle the first course being ordered and eaten.  Then the second course ordered and served.  If you go to La Masseria on 48th and 8th in the theatre district, with the crowds up there.  They accomplish without a problem and make you feel welcomed. In our last trip the staff said they would slow service down so we could enjoy our first course and allow for some space before the main meal.  This was not the case.  As soon as the fork hit the table when the first course was finished the main meal arrived. This is the one time i would say the food was off.  The pasta was under glass domes to keep it warm as it was most likely cooked and done before we finished our first course. If you want to go to a place with a chef on the food network then i would go to Scarpetta's.  If your intent is to relax, eat good food and not be rushed i would think of another location. For $500.00 for a family of 4 to be moved through the place in just over an hour and 15 minutes is not for me.
