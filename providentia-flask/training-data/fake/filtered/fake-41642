We were headed to the new Bloomfield Schuman's deli but it was closed Monday night, so we decided to try Naatiya next door, since we both love Indian food and are quite familiar with it. Granted, it was a slow Monday night but the place had a somber feeling and although the waiters were friendly enough, they seemed disengaged and not thrilled to be there. Ok, the food: no papadam with the side sauces we love; we couldn't really understand our servers reason why and if it was just temporary, but they brought us (only when we asked, we sat for awhile and nothing was brought to us but water) instead some phony (although not unpleasant) fried bits reminiscent of my some chemical potato Â product I loved as a kid. Tasty, but nothing you want to waste calories on and definitely not real food stuff. I ordered tandoori chicken and there was no sizzle whatsoever coming from the plate and NO ONIONS! I'm sorry, but that's the best part of tandoori...the crispy onions, peppers, etc, that you scrape off the bottom. The chicken was tasty, but it was served with a scoop of some mayonnaisey thing they dubbed "stuffing." It was potato salad, my husband said, who ate it, and proclaimed it good, but I couldn't touch it. They did include other vegetables, unusual for that dish, but nothing made up for the disappointment of no onions. Also ordered garlic naan (bread) and not only did it seem like old leftovers, there was scarcely any garlic to be seen or tasted. My husband ordered a spicy version of tandoori chicken and asked if it was on the bone, they said yes, and it turned out not to be. Still, he thought it was flavorful, but agreed with me that the entire experience was disappointing. Lastly, their prices are way higher than other far better Indian restaurants in the area (although if we knew we were going in advance we would have used coupons we'd seen). There is absolutely no reason to return to this restaurant!
