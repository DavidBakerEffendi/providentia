I had some out of town guests come and wanted to take them to a place that is cozy and intimate so that we can talk and catch up. The restaurant is not big but very intimate and perfect for a party of 6 of us.  The place exceeded my expectations.  The staff was so friendly and helpful. Our waitress suggested the crispy duck which was Korean barbequed and came with organic, local swiss chard and kakdoodki and a soy jus. It was the best duck I ever had.  At the end the chef and the owner came out and spoke to us which was a nice personal touch.  They mentioned that  they would be running a $23 tasting on Wednesdays in the summer. I will definetly  will be back and reccomend this restaurant.
