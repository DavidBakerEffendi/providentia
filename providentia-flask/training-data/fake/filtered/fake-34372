I wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone. To say the service was unsatisfactory would be a compliment. I would hope being a hostess in Manhattan would make you semi-competent, instead it made me question everything I know about this city. She had no idea how long it would take a customer to eat a meal or a clue how to comfort a disgruntled customer. A bottle of wine is no compensation for a 2 hour wait in my opinion. My friends and I were told if we sat outside at a table in the 20 degree weather we would be seated quickly. An hour and several appetizers later we were seated at the restaurant next door. The system that is used to seat guests is beyond backwards. We had a missed call from the restaurant and called back within the minute. Within the minute our table was given to another party. This policy is absurd and seems unreasonable to a party that had already been waiting an hour at a local bar (recommended by the hostess). Someone would have to drag me here by my hair in order for me to give this place another try. ( rated 1 star because negative is not a rating)
