I grew up on old fashion  pizza. Original Grand Appizza, Palm Beach. I've tasted Modern, Pepes, Salleys ect. and truly this is the BEST. Just looking at it you could see the freshness.  We ordered a pepperoni and sausage. It was to die for! I loved the mozzarella. Our server Rich was awsome. He was on top of his game. I thought he was part of the family business . Great atmosphere , great service, great food. Give it 5 STARS. Definitely found a new pizza spot. Hope they stick around.
