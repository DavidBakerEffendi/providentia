Incredible pizza and honestly even better then in Italy! The pizza's are huge so one is plenty for a small croud and you absolutely have to taste the artichoke one! At first i was sceptical at the idea of artichokes on my pizza but it was gob-smakking. The crust is crispy and the toping is delicious and generous. Not a lot of sitting down space so you'll have more luck buying a slice and enjoying it while you strole around the city.
