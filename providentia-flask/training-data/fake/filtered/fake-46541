I dined at gencarellis today and the service was HORRIBLE!!!! worst service i have ever had. i will never recomened this resturant to any young couple took them 15 minutes to get water while other people came in after us and got served before us. i had to get up and order my own food at the counter. The food is never consistent, i have ordered their food before and its never the same. if you feel like getting bad service and terrible food go to gencarellis i wouldnt recommend it.
