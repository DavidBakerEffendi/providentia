Miya's is by far the most forward to thinking restaurant in new haven. They don't serve traditional sushi rolls you could get at any other sushi joint. Instead they make their own delicious creations! You can't get their rolls anywhere else. I even of my favorites is called kiss the smiling piggy (sweet potato, mango chutney, and pine nuts). The staff is also very friendly and helpful. If you have any questions about their large menu they are always happy to help. But the best part about Miya's is that they try and make the healthiest food the cheapest. A bowl of pumpkin miso, a char and avocado, and a salad with fresh greens from yale farms would cost you about 12 bucks. They have such an amazing selection of rolls to choose from. If you are in the new haven area I highly recommend Miya's Sushi.
