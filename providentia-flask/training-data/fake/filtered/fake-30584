Fast, friendly service and tasty food. NOTE: CASH ONLY! The Good: Atmosphere - cool wooden floors and low stools for the bar; picnic style tables line the sides of the room with an open space in the back for larger parties.  Very open, airy, relaxed and cozy feel Food - The Broth was the best part.  I got the Shoyu Ramen and a side of Kim-Chi.  Kim-chi was good (sour and a little spicy like good kim-chi is supposed to be)  The noodles are cooked al-dente and the pork belly was VERY tender; soft boiled egg was cooked nicely, and the bamboo was soft but not too soft...the way I like it.   Service - Service with a smile; Very happy, offered a discount because I was there for lunch and wearing my badge for work (Hospital and Student discounts).  Took my order and the food was ready in under 3 minutes.  Kim-chi brought out right away with a glass of water.   The Bad: I went during lunch, so it was very empty and I waited a few minutes to be seated just because everybody was in the back and couldn't see the front door; a buzzer or bells would take care of that problem, as when I was greeted, the waitress apologized and told the bar server that he should have helped me out.. no big deal at all. I would recommend this place in a heart beat; by far the best Ramen in Philly.  I have tried a couple other places, but the broths just arent right.   Definitely check this place out!! If you are looking for a quick lunch, then Hiro is a good choice.  I haven't been there for dinner, but I can only guess it would be just as good if not better with a crowd.
