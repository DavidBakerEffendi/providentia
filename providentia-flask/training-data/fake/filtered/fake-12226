I am addicted to Miya's. Whenever I visit New Haven, I have to go get my fix of curried cauliflower rolls, the curried eggplant rolls and the "Three Singing Seaweeds." The "Oolala Mitzvah" roll is also good. I've only ever tried one roll here I haven't liked. The waiters are kind of goofy, but friendly and helpful with suggestions. When we had a really bad experience with the bad roll Â (it was the one featuring chunks of squid- avoid it. I like squid and even I couldn't handle it), the waiter brought us a sake sampler. If you get there early you can avoid the hordes of noisy, self-consciously hip undergrads.
