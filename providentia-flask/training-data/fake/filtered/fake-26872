I'm the 'double meat' guy and I've been going to this place for quite some time now. Why is that? Because not only is the service top notch- friendly employees, really fast service - but also because the food is so amazingly tasty and fresh. I usually get the Steak Â Plato, but I've also tried the chicken and pork. They are ALL good. The cut of meat that this place uses is superior to all other places I've tried. They have a huge line going out the door, but that line usually moves pretty quickly. What impressed me most is the care and attention to detail, not to mention the painstaking work the employees put into making your burrito or taco or plato. This place has gotten very popular through word of mouth for it's fresh ingredients and great service and simply delicious food. Very very deserving of the 5 star rating.
