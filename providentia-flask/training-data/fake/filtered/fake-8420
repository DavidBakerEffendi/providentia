La Fourno Ristorante Trattoria was amazing.  This was probably one of the best dining experiences I have had in a really long time.  I finished work with a friend and we were looking for someplace to eat on a Sunday night.  It was really by default because we didn't want to walk too far from the car and it was directly across the street.  It wasn't crowded but the ambiance was very quaint and cozy.  Lots of candles and great music.  The staff was excellent and the food was even better.  I ordered the lobster ravioli and she had the chicken Alfredo.  The pasta was fresh and the portion was phenomenal.  We had Italian margaritas which were the best Ive EVER had actually.  I cannot wait to go back.  I agree with some of the other reviews and groupon but that was not my experience at all!
