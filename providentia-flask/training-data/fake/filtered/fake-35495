I too, was really looking forward to dining here.  Unfortunately, my experience did not come close to expectations or the other reviews posted here.  Maybe because it was just before Valentine's day, or there were trainees in the kitchen, but... The service was great.  The food, however, was not.  I've eaten at many nice restaurants.  There's definitely something wrong when I need to chew my filet mignon as if it were chuck steak.  My husband's scallops were wonderful, but neither entree had any sort of tasty potato or vegetable accompanying it.  The deserts were maybe two spoonfuls and just so-so.  The main gripe I have with all this is that it is way overpriced for the quality of the meal. AND...we always tip 20% anyway, but the 20% tip was automatically added to our bill!  Maybe patrons are paying for the view, but there were tables off to the side, against the far wall, with the main view being the doors to the kitchen.  I felt sorry for those diners, probably expecting great romantic atmosphere and getting that.  Valentine's night we were lucky to get a table at Grant's in West Hartford.  The meal was great as usual, much better than On Twenty, and the total was $25 less!!   Won't be back to On Twenty.
