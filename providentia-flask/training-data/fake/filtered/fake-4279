I read the reviews before going to Fernando's Grille and many recommended the mushroom bisque. Of course, that's exactly what I ordered and it was delicious! It's worth the 30 mins. Â drive from Jackson. I will definitely be returning to this location. The waitresses were very sweet and accommodating, especially when there were 16 of us at the table. Food came out quickly and steaming hot.
