The place is super crowded, The food is good, But not as good as it is said. 1. Soup dumplings. It is worth to try. But nothing different than usual. The price is a a little bit too much though. $310 for a 8 people diner. 2. bake fish. I think it is the best dish here. I will probably order again. 3. Mongolia beef: it is nothing better than the delivery restaurant on street. Generally, I would recommend to try it at least.
