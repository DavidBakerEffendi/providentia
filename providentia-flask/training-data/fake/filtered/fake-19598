Way way way overrated. Had lamb shawerma. You wouldn't even know it's lamb. Almost no flavor. Definitely no flavor of lamb. DUH. What's the point? Bland, borrrrring. The bulgar the same. Another big nothin' in sleepy Forest Hills, the world's capital of Big Nothin' restaurants and pubs. Some of 'em get raves...they don't deserve 'em. It's just that they're in Forest Hills...where everyone's desperate. Try food like this elsewhere...where it has, y'know...flavor. Was really looking forward to a lamb dish. How is it possible to eradicate all flavor of lamb? Forest Hills is the worst for food. Service was okay...food was meh. Won't be coming back. Don't believe the hype just because you're desperate to go out in Forest Hills.
