As soon as this food truck moved into "food truck alley" at Drexel, it became my favorite. The food is super cheap for the amount you get. In the past I've ordered the curry ($5) and made three meals out of it. The menu is small, but everything on it is delicious. I'm not a coffee drinker, myself, but the Thai coffee is super delicious and I order it almost every time I eat here. The staff is super nice and they take the time to get to know you on a first name basis. Since becoming so popular, the wait is a bit on the long side, and sometimes they run out of food and/or drink before 3 PM. Still, it's always worth the wait - you won't be disappointed by Cucina Zapata!
