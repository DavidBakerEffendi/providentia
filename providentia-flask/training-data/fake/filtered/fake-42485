I travel from Exit 15W to Exit 12 on the NJ Turnpike to visit this little pizzeria at least 3-4 times per month.  What the strip mall restaurant lacks in décor, MAKES UP in customer service and TASTE!!  The GARLIC KNOTS are the best I have ever tasted in my life.  K C's Pizzeria ALWAYS has COUPONS available at the counter in the take-out menu available to ALL customers (eat-in or take out).  Many different style pizza varieties which will satisfy anyone's taste. K C's is attached to a CHICKEN restaurant---also very DELICIOUS!!!  I am so disappointed to read the unpleasant reviews....they seem to be more concerned with the PARKING LOT than the restaurant itself, customer service, FOOD and YUMMY experience!!  I am a REGULAR customer and I pay $7.20 round trip in tolls to EAT THERE!!
