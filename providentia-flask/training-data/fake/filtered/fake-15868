This review is for the cheesecake because that is all that I've had from Junior's.  It is always too crowded and long of a wait to consider trying to get a table and sit down for a meal.  And it's mainly diner type food with burgers and fries and there are a ton of places in the city where you can go, better places for that kind of fare.   BUT....there aren't a ton of places you can go to get cheesecake that is as good as theirs.  So I'll have my meal elsewhere and head over here for the dessert.  There's an adjacent little shop for take-out and the line moves a lot faster than the restaurant.  I like the standard plain cheesecake with strawberry topping.  It's out of this world, perfectly creamy, crumbly, sweet and rich that it just sends my tastebuds to heaven every time I take a bite.  So grab a piece, go find a private little corner somewhere away from the chaos and share and enjoy!
