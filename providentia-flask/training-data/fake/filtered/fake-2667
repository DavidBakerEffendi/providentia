Great service and nice environment. The standouts were very good but the rest was just so-so We ordered: green mango paneer pickled ginger scallops zucchini hummus pizza green chili shrimp eggplant buns truffle strawberries w/ pepper ice cream The paneer to start with was delicious. Paneer generally has a mild flavor but the flavor Chef Mehta infused into this made it really burst in my mouth.The naan that comes with it was also quite tasty. Â  Scallops were also great. Amazingly tender and a great, strong flavor. Zucchini hummus pizza wasn't bad... but nothing special about it. It seems a lot of people order this, but I'd say save your money for something else. The texture was nice, but they had to add the wasabi peas on top to actually give it some flavor, and that's mainly all I got from it. Green chili shrimp was pretty disappointing. I was looking forward to this most but it was ultimately a letdown. The sprout and daikon salad underneath was alright but the shrimp was pretty flavorless. Our waiter warned us that it's a bit spicy but I wasn't getting that at all. The eggplant buns were AMAZING. Best thing I had there. Every bite oozes with the amazing spices that went into it. I could eat 20 of these, it's a shame we could each only have 1. Strawberry dessert was alright. The pepper ice cream on top was great, but I became a little dissatisfied when it quickly melted into the warm strawberries that I would have rather had as just plain strawberries in retrospect. Overall, it was pretty good. I'd definitely come back, but you should know what's good to order beforehand
