The Wood-n Tap? AWSOME!  Lets talk food first. Their wings are terrific and I get an extra order to take home with us, for the next day.  Sweet potato fries...how can you say no to those. Bison bites... always medium rare... delicious... Bourbon Sirloin is a favorite... medium rare again,  at the end of the meal.. smiles all around and we always walk away full, happy and with left overs that are just as wonderful the next day.   The real treat about "the Tap" are the servers and bar staff. Buildings... as pretty as this one is inside.. is still just that, a building... It is the people that run the place that really makes the business... and the Wood-n Tap in Orange is the perfect example of how good people enhance a business.  They are all an amazing bunch of people.  The bartenders are skilled... fun to watch and up to the challenge of an unusual mixed drink and their beer stock is amazing.  The servers are a group of smart, friendly individuals who take their jobs pretty seriously... make our experience at their restaurant a terrific one... It is a warm inviting place to sit and spend an afternoon or evening.  I recommend it regularly to my friends and family.  Just great food and great people...
