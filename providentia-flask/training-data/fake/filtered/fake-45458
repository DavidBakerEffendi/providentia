On first hearing that the prix fixe menu would be at the chef's discretion, we decided to order from the regular menu.  The chef appeared and said he would consider our preferences, fish, in our case.  The meal that emerged was outstanding and he presented us with signed copies of the choices he made for us - on terre a terre stationery.  A wonderful keepsake for a memorabel meal.
