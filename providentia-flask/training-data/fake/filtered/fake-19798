This is the first time I gave good review about the restaurant that i really enjoy my time and food there. The first experience I had in indian restaurant in new jersey. Most of the indian restaurant there had same food but here in guru palace is different. The food is typical north indian food which you can get it in India. I ordered the Guru Spinach Kofta curry which looked like malai kofta but it is totally different. The texture is so soft and tasty.The price was so reasoanable too. I will recommend to all my friends wherever they want to eat indian food just only dine in in Guru Palace
