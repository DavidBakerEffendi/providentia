OUTSTANDING! My wife and I venture out once a week and restrict ourselves to restaurants we have never been. As a Montclair native, our family highly reccomended Fricassee. We WILL be regulars. The food (highly reccomend the lamb shank for dinner and mussels for an appetizer) and service are oustanding. Thank you Fricassee. We loved everything!
