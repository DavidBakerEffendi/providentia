I had some doubts coming into this place, since it's a Stephen Starr place and I'm a broke 20-something. But the atmosphere is great in the courtyard with bars all around you. It was a little pricey but they have great micro brews and local beers. And many of there beers are available in liters! Aww yeahhh! But I did find it strange that they do not let you open a tab. If you pay with a card, you need to close it out with each purchase. I'd definitely go back again, but only if I have some money to blow. ohivedonethat.blogspot.câ€¦
