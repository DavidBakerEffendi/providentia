Chose this restaurant from the NY Dummies guide and was not disappointed. Called to reserve a table and got told 2100hrs, however when we arrived in good time had to stand in the very crowded bar area. They recommended a very good Rose wine, and we were seated a short time later. Was a little intimidated by the menu even though it had a glossary on the back and had to ask the staff for recommendations, they were very understanding and helpful and put us at ease. Food was good and reasonably priced, and even with the above comments it was overall a great experience
