Excellent! Tink's features extremely creative dishes with nuanced flavor combinations. Reading the menu we wanted to taste one of everything and fortunately my group was big enough that we almost could. My friends were out of superlatives to praise the meat dishes. I don't eat beyond fish on the food chain, but had no complaints, to say the least, since the beet with goat cheese and gnocci (with some amazingly-seasoned mushrooms and roasted brussels sprouts) were shockingly delicious, as was the whipped cod (I had never heard of this preparation before). Highly recommended.
