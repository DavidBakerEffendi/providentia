Went there for my birthday dinner on a tue evening with my husband and kids. Luckily I brought my stroller Bc they didn't have any high chairs:( other than that the food was great and so was the service. We ordered the calamari which was ok, the tuna tartar which was TO DIE FOR. We also ordered the swordfish(liked but didn't love), the braised short ribs which was awesome and my husband had the tomahawk steak (also very delicious) which was large enough to share with my 8 year old. Â  I would definitely go back... minus the kids.
