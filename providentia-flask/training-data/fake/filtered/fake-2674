If not for the size, this would be a 5 star rating.... The food was awesome, the service was awesome. - I felt like I was in a sardine can! This restaurant is 400 square feet tops & that includes the kitchen folks. The chef has to stop cooking for a patron to use the bathroom. If you're claustrophobic, this is a NO GO - If you're not its a MUST GO - All small bites - "Eastern Indian/Asian" Influences.. All glasses of wine are $ 8, All bottles are $ 25 (Go for the bottle - the pours aren't that great.... And small bites - but we were satisfied with about 5 items, dessert and a bottle of wine and the bill was under $ 100 before tip.....
