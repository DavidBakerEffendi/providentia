We travelled from Baltimore in search of a different taste and I must admit...I was very impressed with the food here. I m very critical about what I eat. This place was the exception. My fiancee and I loved the grub. The cheese steak egg rolls were simply delicious! They could have substituted for an entree but as an appetizer they were great. The terriyaki fillet mignon and wasabi mash potatoes was almost perfect with one exception...portion. I am not a fan of banana but the Midtown Monkey was excellent! The drinks were mixed perfectly, and the atmosphere was great! The second floor gets a bit crowded but the food and drink...mixed with the ambiance, staff makes for a great experience. If my lady who is stickler for quality is highly impressed then it must be nice.
