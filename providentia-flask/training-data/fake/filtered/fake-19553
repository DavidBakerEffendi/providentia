My husband and I have been frequenting this restaurant for over 10 years. It's by far West Hartford's best kept secret! The food is fabulous and the service is prompt and friendly. The Seafood Risotto is the best I've ever had. Whether you're looking for something quick like a chicken Caesar wrap or something more hearty like Chicken Parm or Roast Prime Rib - Angelo's on Main has something for every taste. The balcony over looking the golf course provides the best outdoor dining space anywhere in Greater Hartford. Avoid the high prices / traffic / and NO parking of West Hartford Center - Give Angelo's a try - you won't be disappointed!
