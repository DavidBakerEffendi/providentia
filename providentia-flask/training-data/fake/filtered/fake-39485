The customer service here is the WORST.  The staff is very dismissive and not personable at all.  It is almost like they are doing you a favor by speaking with you and/or providing service. The poor dismissive service is both on the phone and in person. No one seems to know how to speak to the specials they post so grandly out side of the restaurant. It made me feel like all they are concerned about is make money, make money, make money.
