The Dolsot is absolutely delicious. Let that puppy sit and burn to a crisp at the bottom of the bowl and it's crunchy deliciousness. The bubble tea is also the best in the University City area. However, the location is a little bit of a hole-in-the-wall. If you can look past the drab interior and the unusual location, the food is worth it.
