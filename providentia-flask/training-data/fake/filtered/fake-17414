Enjoyed the Pizza very much.. feel a bit rushed when deciding what to order. First time I went there I placed my order and was given something else but it was fine.. I really enjoyed it. The second time I went one of the ladies taking the order who happened to be the one that messed up my order the first time was very rude. I think if they were to work on their customer service a bit more the place would have gotten a 5 star from me.
