I've bought almost all my suits there over the past ten years or so.  Not the biggest selection as far as styles and colors, kind of hit and miss, but very reasonably priced.  Good suits for working-class guys.  If you have the opportunity to stop in every couple of weeks, you may find what you are looking for, maybe even find that exceptional suit.  After experiencing lousy service at Tates and Mens Warehouse, this place is actually quite decent.  The salesmen don't hover over you, if you want to try something on, no problem.  Soft sell, we used to call it.
