Stay away from this restaurant!   Save your money. What an unfriendly, non-service oriented restaurant. Wait staff looked stressed and very unhappy or arrogant. Definitely not engaged in the art of serving. No sense of graciousness or excitement. I guess they are either brow beaten or think that the customer should be honored to get a table here? We had brunch in the bar...were not offered other options. Food is good but certainly not great. The predecessor restaurant was there for over 100 years;  doubt this place will make it if they continue along this hit or miss track with food and awful service. We will not be back!
