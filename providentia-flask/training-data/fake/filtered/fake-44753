I had the pleasure of eating here last night with one of my clients. As a senior executive I, unfortunately, travel much more than I'd like. So, its really important I find restaurants with good food and good service. Yerba Buena did not let me down. Upon entering I was immediately greeted by the manager, Angel, who made a point to be conversational without being pushy. He immediately directed us to the bar area and highly recommended we try their mojitos, which we did. They were very very good. Though he only spoke to us for a few minutes he made sure we felt very comfortable. When we finally sat down to our table our waiter was equally hospitable. He explained the menu and made recommendations. We started with empanadas as an appetizer.  My wife is Colombian so I consider myself an experienced empanada eater. I certainly was not disappointed...they were delicious. For a main course I had ribeye steak which was hot, tender, and juicy, and was accompanied by tasty yucca fries. My client loves fish, so he had the black cod with a miso glaze. He loved it!  When our plates were cleared, Angel stopped back at our table to make sure our both our food and service was good.  Though we were going to skip dessert because we were full, Angel insisted on buying us dessert. We split the Tres Leches, which was absolutely heaven on a dish. I can't say enough good things about Yerba Buena. Food and service were just great. Probably the only negative was the small bathroom, so I had to wait 5-7 minutes.  But it was well worth it. I'll definitely be visiting here again.
