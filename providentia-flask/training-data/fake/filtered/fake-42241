I came here in September for my boyfriend's surprise dinner with a reservation. The restaurant was located in the South of Williamsburg, right across the Williamsburg bridge. The atmosphere was perfect- intimate, romantic, and casual. There was an open kitchen (fragrant aromas traveling around) , indoor seating, and an indoor garden patio. We were seated in the indoor garden patio, which was decorated with shimmering lights. Our waitress was very friendly and explicitly explained what each of the mouth-watering items on the menu entailed. We ordered several of the tapas, the local mozzarella with pomegranate and yogurt, crispy pork belly, seared scallops with butternut squash, crispy glazed confit wings,sweet potato fries with sliders and the amazing bacon donuts. Let's say all these dishes are to die for. The mozzarella infused with pomegranate and yogurt was a delicious twist on the conventional fruit and cheese dish, the seared scallops were tender and greatly accompanied by the sweet and subtle tastes of the squash. My boyfriend had the bacon donuts as his birthday cake. He loves bacon, so the thought of bacon and donuts harmoniously concocted into what's called the bacon donut was exciting enough. I recommend that those who are heavier eaters should eat something before or you might be still hungry. We ordered around 7 dishes and we still left a bit hungry, hence unless you're willing to pay the price, be prepared. It is on the expensive side, tapas ranging up to $17. However, it is definitely worth it, and is a MUST try list if you are ever in the South of Williamsburg.
