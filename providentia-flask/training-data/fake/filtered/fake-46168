Went here last night with my best friend and my girlfriend. We were pretty psyched to get in at 9pm on a monday night after only waiting a few minutes. I had always walked by longingly and went in several times only to be dissuaded by an extremely long wait. The ramen was good but not over the top. Nothing compared to the Momofuku I had last week for the first time. The pork bun was pretty medicore. Good but not great, too much mayo. The tofu-green tea desert was amazing though. The craziest thing happened when my girlfriend asked for one of her veggie buns to be boxed to go. The waitress said "we don't do that because it ruins the quality of our food." What kind of tyrannical policy is this? Who are you to determine what I can and cannot do with the food that I rightfully purchased! I asked her if we could have a napkin instead and she refused. She said "No, because I know what you're going to do with it." THIS IS CRAZY!!!!! Spare yourself the insanity and eat some better Ramen, go to Momofuku or Minca.
