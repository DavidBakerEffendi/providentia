**I am editing this review as since the below review was posted they have dramatically improved their delivery times and inclusions of common sides given with food. We've not had a problem with their delivery or missing items or sides for several months now so bumping the review to 4 stars.** Old review: The food is good and creative, prices are average. Where the problem lies is in the service and delivery. They consistently take over an hour to deliver and never make any mention of it. Usually deliveries are more between 1.25 to 1.5 hours! Â But to top it all off, when you get your order you are 95% guaranteed to have something messed up. They almost always forget the included side of toast with your platter, they almost always forget syrup and butter with their pancakes, etc. And when you call about it they ask why you don't have butter and syrup in your house!!!!!! Really??? I am paying for this, not plain pancakes and I want my toast that you specify is included. They also forgot our two large coffees twice in a row. Next call I had to specifically point it out and we finally got the coffees with our order. And I don't want to wait an hour and a half, at least not without being told it will take that long. Good food, poor service and management.
