We were staying in Philly and ordered takeout from here. The food here is awesome! Dumplings were great.. Â Kung pao chicken, and Szechuan pickled chilli was spicy and absolutely the best!! The food tends to be on the spicy side including the noodles we ordered. They deliver within 10 block radius... The restaurant looks good but we were in mood for takeout and didn't visit this place. Absolutely will order again from here.
