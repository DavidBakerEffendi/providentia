We've never been disappointed with the food at Leone's. Their chicken parm sandwiches are delicious and filling, but not so heavy that you feel like you're going to die afterwards. Their pizza is good, too. We always take a walk there & grab our food to go, so I can't vouch for the table service, but we've always been greeted with a very friendly "Hey guys!"
