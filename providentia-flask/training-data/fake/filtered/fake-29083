The one to order is omakase. There is a decadent feel to eating some of the best sushi and sashimi around. We were there for business and while the food was up to spec as one must expect at these prices, the service and general ambiance was not something that I could recommend very highly. The waiter we had was not terribly forthcoming when we asked questions. I think a place of this rank needs to be on top of its game in all departments. With minimal furnishings the staff need to cosy up their approach if I am to feel truly welcome. A few tweaks here and there and this could be truly great restaurant. Come on now and get it together SY.
