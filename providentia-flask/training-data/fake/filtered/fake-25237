Very, very, very good.  The Tofu Benedict is famous, or you can "Get Scrambled" and have the supergood vegan scramble and ask them to chuck in whatever faux-meat, veggies, etc. your heart desires.  The only thing I've had that isn't so good are the muffins (okay, I got the cheap "yesterday's muffins", because I am a sucker for discounts), but you probably shouldn't have room for those in your belly anyway after you eat half of the menu.  The coffee is good and cheap, too.  The servers are very friendly, probably because they get to eat this food a lot and their customers are always so happy because everything is so delicious.  Be prepared to wait 30 or 40 minutes for a table on weekend lunchtimes, and I don't know what you'd do with a group of more than 4.  It's a tiny diner and there is always a throng of eager people outside.  While I wait I like to secretly catalog the menagerie of tattoos.
