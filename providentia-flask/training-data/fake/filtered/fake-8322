My first visit was a year ago.  Great food and greater service.  The waitress was awesome and engaging!  Did not catch her name during this visit.  Relocated to Philly in January and returned to the same location as I needed familiarity in my new life.  Same waitress!  This time I got her name...Holly!  She again was engaging and made me feel as though I was a guest in her home.  This started a Tuesday tradition where we would call it a "Holly-day" which was code for an evening at C&Ps.  Every return visit we would request Holly's section.  She then introduced us to her peers.  Again, they all treated us as part of the family.  Summer came and so did changes to our social schedules.  Occassionally I would return solo because I was going to Holly & Randi's house.  Great recommendations on food and local happenings.  This team is truly a group of Philadelphia Ambassadors.  It has been months since I have been back to visit (oh, and get something to eat/drink too), but I miss the staff and especially my Holly & Randi!
