I moved to midtown 4 years ago and found this hidden gem of a restaurant with a friendly and welcoming staff, great menu and excellent wine list tucked away next to the Broadway theaters.  This was an unexpected surprise, as most theater district restaurants are over-priced with mediocre food and questionable service, but Trecolori delivers delicious, freshly prepared food with professional, courteous service.  The staff and management always seem to be on top of things, ensuring that each guest receives great service to match the great food they will encounter here.  A must-visit destination if you are going to see a show or in midtown for whatever reason.  Call ahead for reservations, as they are always packed during pre-theater times (matinee days are crazy), but there's a reason for the full reservation book- repeat and loyal customers know they will always be satisfied with a great meal at Trecolori!
