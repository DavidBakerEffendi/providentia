I have a lot of great memories of my Hungarian grandmothers and my aunt cooking wonderful Hungarian meals.  I went to Barbara's and all those memories come flooding back.  My wife is not Hungarian but she loves it too.   The dishes seem very authentic.  I usually get the cabbage pasta (kapustash Testa)(sounds funny to most Americans, I am sure) to start out, then I get either the Hungarian gulyas (Magyar Gulyas) or the stuffed cabbage (Toltott Kapusta). My only issue is that you get a lot of food, so I do take it home, but it is not a good place to go if you are on a diet. I love this place.
