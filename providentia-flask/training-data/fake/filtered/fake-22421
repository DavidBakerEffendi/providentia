I went here for dinner from a friend's recommendation, and was pretty satisified. The service was efficient, and overall has a simple, good menu. If anything, i wish they had a few more entree options, possibly a few more pastas. The pasta I had was OK, i wasnt too keen on potatoes through it, thats carbs with carbs, haha. However, great dessert and a pretty good wine list. I would definately go back.
