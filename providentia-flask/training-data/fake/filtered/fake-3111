To make this long story short, I love the place. Found it by accident, but I'm glad.  THe place looks great and the service is friendly. Food was awesome, but I'm colombian, so WHat  do I know about real cuban food.  I enjoyed all their appetizers and awesome mojitos.  I would highly reccommend it.
