I went out to Fogo de Chao for the second time last night and enjoyed a really great dinner.  The place was packed, but the service quick and well-mannered.  Fogo de Chao isn't your standard restaurant, so to judge it by a sit-down and be-served mentality isn't quite applicable.  The appetizer bar was delicious and well stocked (salmon, mozzarella, lovely crudités, etc.) and the meat cooked to perfection.  I am a big fan of the lamb, so I guzzled that down with abandon.  My eating companions enjoyed their dinner and had a wonderful time as well.  My gin on the rocks were of a healthy size and the entire evening a little clamorous, but that's to be expected.  I would absolutely recommend!
