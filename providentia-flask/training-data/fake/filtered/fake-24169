A.C. Petersen Farms absolutely hit the spot. It had everything I was looking for: great service, great atmosphere, and most importantly, GREAT food. Sitting outside on their patio on a cool summer night is just about as good as it gets. I started my evening off with a hot, creamy cup of delicious New England Clam Chowder, and followed it up with a perfectly cooked ACP Burger. After such a pleasant meal, I had high hopes for their much-hyped ice cream, and it did not disappoint. I had a two scoop sundae with one scoop of graham cracker and one scoop of cookie dough, and I can honestly say it was one of the best sundaes I've had in years. What made it great was the fantastic HAND WHIPPED whipped cream that was piled high above a warm river of rich hot fudge. All this combined with great service from our waitress, as well as relaxing, family friendly atmosphere, made my experience at ACP one to remember. I can't wait to go back for another meal.
