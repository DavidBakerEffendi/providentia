They are great, and hands down my favorite place for take out. The Sicilian pizza is the best, and I end up eating it for lunch 3 or 4 times a week. I would eat it 7 days a week but I am on a diet(my kind of diet). The desserts are spectacular, and I could go on and on about the entire menu. I agree that some things can be a little more expensive than other spots, but I would rather pay the little extra and get something this good. They get my vote
