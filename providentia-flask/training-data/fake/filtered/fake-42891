We were surprised to stumble into this gem just by chance. Great food at decent prices, and the service was superb. The waitress helped us convert a steak special to be more like the steak dish on the menu, since the special was somehow larger but also cheaper? Weird circumstance but we appreciated the assistance and ended up with leftovers to take home. Though there was ample seating when we strolled in around 7:30 on a Friday night, the place was getting busy by the time we left about an hour later, so you may have a wait if you are seeking to sit in primetime. Two big flavorful entrees, two tasty sides and two drinks came to just under $60. Worth it.
