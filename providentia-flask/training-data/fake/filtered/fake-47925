As a last minute plan we came here on Mothers Day. Needless to say it was packed. Having no reservation, our table of 6 were seated in the patio area which was devine as the weather was perfect. I'm presuming the male host was the owner as he couldn't have been more accommodating and helpful. The brunch menu was surprisingly very appealing to the adults and the kids, with lots of healthy options. The kids had the grilled steak and mashed potatoes. It tasted so good and I immediately could tell it was not from a packet! The owner recommended Baileys Burger - DELICIOUS! The large burger was cooked exactly to my request and was so juicy. My husband who is difficult to please thoroughly enjoyed the lobster benedict. The wine list is amazing - lots of varity and very good value. They also have a fantastic selection of draft beers here, I will be back to sample a lot more. Little on the negative side only my own preferences. This place is a great family restaurant with good food in a comfortable environment.
