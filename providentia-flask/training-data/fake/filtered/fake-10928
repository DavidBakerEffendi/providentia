I visited Buon Appetito 3 times; twice with my family and once for a business dinner.   All three times the food was excellent; we always tried the daily specials and the servings plentiful.   The staff was very friendly and attentive.  After each dinner I left feeling that I had a great dinner, a good time and I got more than my monies worth as we always carried our left overs home.
