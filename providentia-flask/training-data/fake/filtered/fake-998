Brothers Moon was a pioneer when they opened in Hopewell many years ago. Hopewell was a culinary desert.  Cheers for that.  But now there are several in town. Brothers Moon has  been going a long time and it's getting tired.  Maybe it's time for the owner to reinvent himself.   No disrespect, it's a solid choice but restaurants have a short half life.  Time to hit the refresh button.  You will come out stronger and better.
