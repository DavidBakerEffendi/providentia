Absolutely scrumptious! I went on the recommendation of my sister and it definitely lived up to expectations. Between the three of us we had some mac and cheese, fried chicken, salad and the meatloaf - all of which tasted as good as the next. Service was perfect and we were sitting up at the chefs table so could see two of the chefs preparing a lot of the meals. They were friendly enough to chat with us and answer questions as well as checking on how our meals were. It was so worth the visit and I'll be sure to recommend to my friends who are coming to nyc!
