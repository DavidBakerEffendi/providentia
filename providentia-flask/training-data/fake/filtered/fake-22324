The rotisserie chicken was absolutely delicious - moist and flavorful! Â The owner, Joe Brancaccio, was so determined to ensure I was satisfied that he was kind enough to throw in a couple of extra yummies! I would definitely recommend this place to anyone (it was worth the trek from Bed Stuy) for the food and the great customer service.
