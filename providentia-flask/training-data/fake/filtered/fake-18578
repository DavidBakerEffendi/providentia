All right - so here's the deal.  The reality is that Gramercy Tavern is about the bar any night of the week ("eating in the tavern") where the cocktails are great, the food is solid, and the bartender Mon-Thursday is one of the best - ever.  If you drink whiskey - or seriously drink, leaving las vegas seriously - get "the flatiron" even if it is off the menu.  Also, everything you've ever heard about the service is true - and in NY that can't be more rare.  The food in the back is phenomenal (shy away from the rabit unless thumper is your thing) but you are inevitably surrounded by a series of event dinners (anniversary, funeral, first orgasm - its always got to be something) and the meal will leave you in the prix fixe coma.  So unless you need to entertain the prospective in-laws, eat up front, talk trash with the bar (marvel at how they can move that many people that elegantly around the restuarant)and drink some of the best cocktails in america (and try some rare german wine with your meal) and get out for under a $120....  FYI - this is no singles joint.
