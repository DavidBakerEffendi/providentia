OMG, can I give this place 6 stars?  It's my favorite restaurant in the world since forever.  I don't live in NYC but I make a beeline for this place when I visit.  It's best for 4 or 5 people.  If you all share (the most fun) then you get just one bite of each dish.  The way I like to eat!!!  Once we asked what dish was the favorite on the menu.  The answer:  the brussels sprouts.  Well, I don't know about you, but when I was a kid, I'd go to bed hungry rather than eat my brussels sprouts.  But....this was Alta....and everything was so unusually yummy. Well.  I am here to tell you that brussels sprouts ROCK.  (But maybe only at Alta.)  I have no idea what they do to them.  But we eat them there like candy.  Other faves:  those little goat cheese balls with lavendar, fried cauliflower, grilled eggplant.  Oh--and the desserts.  Save room.   Great.  Now I'm hungry.
