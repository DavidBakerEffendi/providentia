Square One has some of the best coffee in the city. Â I'm a barista and I make the trip from my own shop to stop at Square One. Their roasts are excellent and so are the espresso drinks. The baristas definitely have skills and are super friendly. I'm pretty impressed! The new shop is also fun with it's Lancaster-barn theme and pretty wood tables. I recommend this place, it's absolutely worth it.
