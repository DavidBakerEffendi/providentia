Awesome! I'm a fan. Decided to try Tria out after passing by many times. It is a very well designed space and has a really nice curb appeal. My only reluctance to come to this place. was a man who sits on his stoop drinking coffee and smoking cigarettes. We decided to avoid him and come down 12th instead of spruce. He REALLY gave me the creeps. Anyway, back to my Tria experience: the wine selection was absolutely wonderful and the beer selection as well. They even had my favorite sour by the bottle I was uber excited. There was a young gentlemen tending the bar when we arrived ordered some draft beers from him but he seemed very unhappy at his job so we decided to sit at a table in their outdoor section. GREAT decision our server's name was becky I believe and she made us feel so special we didn't want to leave. The service was incredible and the goat cheese outstanding. The only complains I have are the management they don't seem to treat their employees with the respect the should. I would definitely come back to tria for a late night drink or even after leaving the office. You should too.
