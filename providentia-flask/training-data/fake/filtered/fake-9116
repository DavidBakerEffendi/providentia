This restaurant is one of the few in the immediate area, unless you walk down a few block across Houston, and I stumbled onto it with a friend.  We got 4 plates. The first was listed as a special - Asparagus with marconia almonds in some kind of dressing.  It was literally 2 pieces of asparagus cut into a few pieces and green sauce to make it look like more was on the plate.  That was $13.  We were making jokes about it all night, so I guess we got our money's worth for the comedy.  The croquets were good, and what filled us up the most, there were six balls of them.  We got the shrimp in a garlic type sauce, about 9 very small shrimp.  They tasted slightly undercooked.  This came with a big piece of bread on the side of the dish because you would still be hungry.  We got a hake fish with clams - also very tiny, about 2 inches of fish, and 4 clams the size of small mussels.  This tasted good, but still smaller than an appetizer you would normally get.  If it weren't for the croquets, we would have left and gotten pizza next door afterwards.  I am giving it two stars because it had a pleasant ambience, the service was good, and my friend enjoyed the Sangria, but it was way too much money for way too little.  Next time we'll go to little Italy and get a real meal!
