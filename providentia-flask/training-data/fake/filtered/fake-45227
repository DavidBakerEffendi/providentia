I had been wanting to try this place for awhile, and although I do not know much about ethiopian food, I found the food to be very tasty. I ordered the vegetarian platter and enjoyed all of the samples, especially the potato and cabbage portions. People are spot on when they call ethiopian food an earthy version of indian food Our server was very helpful and pleasant. He gave us suggestions on which beers to try, and guided us in how to eat our ethiopian food, which is with your hands. The food came out in a timely manner and the water was filled consistently. Other reviewers have commented that the service and atmosphere is not very professional, but one must remember that this is small, local, family owned environment and that the same service from a high class 5 star restaurant can not be expected.
