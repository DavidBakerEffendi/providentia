I went here with a close friend earlier this week just to try it out!  The empanadas were really good!  Someone on this site earlier did a review of all the items and raved about the cheese empanadas and I agree!  That is the best one!  I also had the churrasco for the entree and I was a bit disappointed, it was well cooked but it was doused in olive oil and garlic which took away from the flavor of the meat!  The dessert I had was the Alfajor, which was surprisingly good because it was unlike any other dessert I've ever had and it just looks weird but very yummy! The other thing I didn't like was that they only served alcoholic drinks except cranberry juice and I was driving that night so ...  But overall the wait staff was pleasurable, and the food was very tasty, and the ambiance was just right! Four stars for Tabare!
