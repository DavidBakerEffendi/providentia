If you're in the bayonne/jersey city area you have to check out andews cafe. This place is truly one of a kind.  In a town overflowing with pizza and deli's, andrews is a true original! The menu has a wide range of unique offerings that all have one thing in common. They are all Fresh and delicious! Andrew specializes in organic and vegan dishes that are not only wholesome and healthy but amazingly tasty! The soups are the best I've ever had and a must if you stop by.  He brings years of experience as a well known and respected chef ( even cooking for the likes of President Bill Clinton!) to a cozy downtown eatery on broadway. Definately don't miss out on this place!
