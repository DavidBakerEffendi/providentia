HORRIBLE PLACE TO HOLD AN EVENT.....HORRIBLE!!!!!!! Was here a few weeks ago for my college's Senior Night/Graduation Party and it was a complete disaster! First, and worst, of all was the fact that they ran out of food with in minutes of our arrival. No exaggeration....it was literally 10-15 minutes before the buffet was empty and we were forced to wait on line for upwards of 45 minutes. At that point they began filling the trays with chicken fingers and sausage, neither of which was on our preset menu (and neither of which were very good). The drink specials that we were promised never materialized and the staff seemed to be at a total loss for answers when we confronted them with these problems. Had I not been with my classmates, some for the last time, the night would have been a complete FAIL. And for the sake of the junior class I hope they find somewhere else to hold the party next year.
