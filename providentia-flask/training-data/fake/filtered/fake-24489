Service at this place is horrendous and this wasn't just on one occasion.  I've tried to look past the terrible treatment because of their xiaolong bao(soup dumplings) but after my last visit I'm never going back. The teacups were sticky and one of them had lipstick on it.  We had to wait 20 minutes for our appetizer and this was when there were only 3 groups of people in the restaurant.  Their food is not good enough to tolerate the extremely poor service and filthy drink ware.
