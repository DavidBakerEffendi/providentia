I hope they lose their lease. I hope they close. I feel badly for the employees but maybe yale can rent to a new owner who will hire them. This company is abominable, inexcusable. From the way they treat the homeless outside their doors to their wage practices, paying workers nearly half the minimum wage and working them ungodly hours. No wonder they swipe the change from your $20. Now we know why. State DOL is all over them and they are picketed by protesters. Â  Oh and icing on the cake - at Christmas they fired the four totally underpaid workers who reported them to the DOL in retaliation for their report, according to news reports. I wouldn't want the owners of this place to be my neighbors. As property managers and landlords, yale is truly clueless. The store is actively being boycotted.
