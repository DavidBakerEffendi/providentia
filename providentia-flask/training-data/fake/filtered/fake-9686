Really good food, but it's not enough to make up for the terrible service.   We should have known it was going to be rough service when our waiter barely knew the menu (and i's a relatively small menu and very limited brunch menu - also a negative).  He was inattentive, never checked in for beverage refills, and never explained why our orders took so long.  He also never offered any bread, which we wouldn't have cared about had it not taken so long to get our meals and had we not seen other tables get the bread without prompting. All in all, they did not have their service together, but the space is cool and good for groups and the food was really good.  I'd go again, but it certainly wouldn't be my first choice.
