Grand new opening @ 216 Grand Street!! Same old staff, same amazing food as the original restaurant on Bayard. FIVE stars for food, service, price and cleanliness! This small, authentic, not to mention AFFORDABLE Bo Ky does an amazing job drawing attention on Grand Street. Their famous duck and curry are GREAT!! A MUST TRY!!
