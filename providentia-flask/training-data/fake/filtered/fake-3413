I finally had a chance to sit down with friends and have a nice meal here. I ordered the seared sea scallops with a side of the "loaded mashed potatoes", which are potatoes "loaded" with a variety of seasonings, spices and bacon bits. We ordered a salad appetizer enough for the table consisting of little "balls" of fresh, crispy lettuce, quartered, topped with bacon bits and a thousand island-style dressing.  It was very yummy. The sea scallops were cooked to perfection, but just a tad bland... thankfully they did include a little sauce on the side that made them very enjoyable. The mashed potatos were quite tasty as well. They had a very soft bread that came with a very soft, creamy warm sweet butter spread that was quite good. My friends also ordered Calamari, which I tried - it was very crispy and yummy. Overall I will stick to my original 4 star rating.  It was a bit toward the pricey side, but the food was very good (but I wouldn't say amazingly good).  The presentation was nice, and despite the restaurant being packed - it wasn't obnoxiously loud and all the other patrons made for a fun and enjoyable atmosphere. The decor and ambiance is quite nice. The staff in the place were all excellent, and we had a very good, professional and polite waiter who didn't intrude on our experience, but always made sure to bring the food out fast and top our water off - so I would say the service was fantastic.
