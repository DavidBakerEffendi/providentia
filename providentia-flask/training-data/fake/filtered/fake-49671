Subpar food and rude/unhelpful staff.  I came here the other night with two others, and the young woman who was bartending looked at us like we were crazy when we asked for a drink menu.  A supposedly fine dining Italian restaurant with no wine list?  Yikes.   When our cheese plate came out, the waitress literally threw the plate on our table and didn't tell us which cheeses were which.  She was very short with us when we asked what they were and couldn't have been less welcoming.   The food was underwhelming, and the whole dining experience was extremely disappointing.  Not to mention the bartender had two male friends talking with her loudly about very crude topics that my elderly mother even overheard.   By far the worst dining experience I've had in New Haven.
