Great for delivery and take-out, I never bothered trying to get a seat at one of their few tables when I lived in the neighborhood.  It's pretty simple: almost everything is delicious, with varying degrees of healthiness.  If you take the more traditional routes like beef, chicken, you can't really go wrong.  Some of the options like cheeseburger, cheesesteak, pepperoni pizza: all delicious, but you will be able to feel your heart rate slow gradually with each bite.  The chuleta empanizada is quite good.  I would even go as far as to say they should call the place Arepa Mama... the arepas are fantastic. The dessert empanadas are a world of their own.  The Elvis is a perfect combination of peanut butter and bananas.  The Belgian chocolate and banana is also delicious.
