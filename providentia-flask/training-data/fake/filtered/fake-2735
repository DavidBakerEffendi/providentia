Make Sure You make your reservations before you go here, Specially on weekends this place gets packed. Â I am giving 5 star just for the food and service. It was jam packed when we were there, but still there were able to customize the food for us. Ordered grilled calamari for appetizer and Chilean Sea Bass both were exceptional. Others ordered various things including Oyster all were perfect. No room for dessert because we were stuffed.
