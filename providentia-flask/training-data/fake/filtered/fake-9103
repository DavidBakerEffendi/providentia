My husband and I celebrated our anniversary at PRINT this year and it was amazing. I can't believe we haven't heard more about this hidden gem! It's 11th Avenue location is surely to blame for its place off the radar, but don't let the walk cause you to miss this one! The menu changes daily, so everything is fresh and the ingredients are obviously of the highest quality. I started with the calamari, which had the perfect balance of citrus to tenderize the squid without overpowering the flavor. My husband had the roasted carrot and yogurt salad, which was also very good. For the main course I had the Berkshire pork chop - it was amazingly tender and moist with a ton of flavor. It was topped with hazelnuts and vegetables and was as close to a perfect dish as I'll probably ever have. He had the coq au vin, which he also really liked. The ambiance is very soothing, trendy and clean. The restaurant is spacious enough that you feel comfortable and can have a conversation without screaming. The service is top-notch - friendly, prompt and subtle. Basically, PRINT is everything I've ever wanted in a restaurant.
