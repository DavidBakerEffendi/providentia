I was in Philadelphia to visit friends and I heard so much about Noir that I had to go there.  Owner/Chef Marco is great!!!   His potato gnocchi was so light that it practically floated off of my fork like a cloud going by in the sky. Everything that we tried on the menu was A-1.  I cannot wait to go back.  If you have not tried his food you are missing a great experience.  My boyfriend is a chef and he loved everything.  (As everyone knows, the chef's know where to eat when they go out).  His staff is very friendly and efficient and accomodating.
