I absolutely love this place, i am very impressed with the rustic yet elegant decor, the food is amazing, i was really intrigued by the bone marrow dish, so i did order it as my appetizer and it was surprisingly delicious, my friends ordered the ceviche and the risotto, they were both yummy. I was really impressed with the entrees, so far my absolute favorite was the chicken, we still had some room for dessert, the cheesecake souffle was delicious and the house did treat us with some ice cream topped with a shot of espresso at the end of the night. Overall it was a wonderful experience, i will definitely go back.
