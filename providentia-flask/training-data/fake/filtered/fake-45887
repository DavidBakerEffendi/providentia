I want to personally thank Chef Will Mooney, Josh, and the wait staff for creating a fabulous meal and memorable evening in honor of my son and daughter-in-law's rehearsal night dinner.  Each small detail enhanced the dining experience.  The room design was intimate and inviting, the food choices met the needs of a variety of guests and was exquisitely prepared, and the wait staff could not more present, attentive, and responsive. Timing of each course was impeccable and the guests licked their plates clean!!! I am truly grateful for the personal care and am confident that all of us will return for frequent visits!
