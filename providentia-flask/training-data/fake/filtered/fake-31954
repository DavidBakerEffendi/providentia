When you're in the mood for pizza but not really feeling a slice, this is your go-to-neighborhood joint. The pizza is thin crust and the array of fresh toppings is staggering. You can have whatever you like (just like the song). Anyway, Â the place is small so there's always a wait but who cares? The pizza is good and you can have a beer at the bar. I like it and so will you.
