Eh, this place was okay...I had heard a lot about it...but was not impressed. It could be that I am not a fan of English food....or the fact that I was really hungry but didn't want to pay $20 for a burger! I ordered deviled EGG with emphasis on egg...just one for $4. It was probably the worst deviled egg I've ever had...over use of vinegar comes to mind! We waited for a good 2 hours to get in to this place....and I left starving. Ended up eating at a street vender...which, in my opinion, was 10 times better...with out the wait! Initially when we put our names in they said 45 minutes...so we walked around the neighborhood taking in the sites (I will say the neighborhood is probably the only thing I liked about the spotted pig.) We came back about 45 minutes later....and still no room for us...in which we were told 20 more minutes. So we stood...outside...in November and waited 20 minutes....20 minutes later...still no place for us. We were again told 20 more minutes....well as I said we waited for a total of 2 hours. Not worth it in my opinion....very over priced...tiny and limited menu! I will not be back!
