One of my favorite local spots. I'll walk past 5 closer to home to come here. It's a coffee shop and a brunch spot and a bar, all in one. The food is tasty - the menu is wholesome and simple, yet imaginative. The ambiance is great, the decor is artful and budgeted. Nothing too fancy. And they finally got AC! The drinks are great ... and fairly cheap for NYC. $7 for quality classic cocktails. I'm looking at you, Mr. Margarita. Not you, Ms. Old Fashioned. For happy hour, they give you a free shot when you buy a beer ... usually $6. Everyone who works at Skytown is friendly, creative, open. I have yet to have a bad time. Ever. Even sitting by myself. Check it out, and you'll see what I mean. Bottom line: It's a terrific local spot to bring friends, or your parents - for brunch and for late night drinks. Bring your notebook and work for a few hours with a coffee or a beer in the afternoons, if that's up your alley. Been a bunch of times - at this point, it would take a lot to keep me from coming back. Top o' the pops. 5 stars. (Take Briana T's advice - don't order takeout. It's not that kind of place. Sit and be merry, or go somewhere else. )
