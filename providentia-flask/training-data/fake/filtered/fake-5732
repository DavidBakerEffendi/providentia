Great !! Place one of my favorites in Bloomfield NJ., Traditional Italian fare with some great highlights. The Bruschetta is awesome!! Great calamari. Our server Marcos is probably the best in the restaurant.. The Bar is ok , Bartenders are not really knowledgeable and know very little about wine.. A disappointment!! I come here often as it's one of my friends favorites places..
