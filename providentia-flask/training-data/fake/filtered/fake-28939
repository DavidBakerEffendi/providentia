I used to love Prime 16. You have a great selection of burgers, beer, and other foods to keep people happy. For large groups, you even take reservations. Last night, however, was my last straw. My server made me feel extremely uncomfortable and ruined an otherwise great experience. We arrived as a large party of 8 and were sat promptly. Our server took a drink order and brought water for only half the table. I asked for waters for everyone else, he brought 1 water for 4 people. So we asked for more cups, but that took quite a bit more time to deliver. One of my colleagues asked for more water and the servers rudely toned response was "I'll bring you more water when you need it." Another colleague was enjoying a diet coke, and when she finished the server took her cup without inquiring whether or not she would like more. The final strike was when waving at the server with a smile to make a quick drink order. Upon his arrival, he states "You don't need to wave me down, it is my job to come to your table and check on you." Of course the choice of words were carefully chosen, but he came right behind me, stood over me, and stated this in a rather unfriendly tone. I have never been treated so rude at a restaurant, nor have I ever felt so uncomfortable and compromised by a server at a restaurant. You have lost my business and frankly this server's employment should be reconsidered for bullying customers.
