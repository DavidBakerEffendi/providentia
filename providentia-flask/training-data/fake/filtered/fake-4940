Wow!  First of all... Thanks for the many great reviews by your Yelpers that helped  me decide to try this restaurant during a recent visit to New York.  Picolo Angolo is a wonderfully warm atmosphere and great food.  Come hungry, because there are many delicious items to select from.  The owners personal touch is what makes this  such a special place. I would suggest making a reservation prior to arrival.
