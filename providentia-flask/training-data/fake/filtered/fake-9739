Food: OK but not spectacular. As good as any other decent Italian restaurant. Ambiance: Good but can get noisy. Service: Worst, reasons below 1. I am not an Italian and will struggle with pronunciations, was ridiculed because of this. 2. Never bothered to explain about a dish when I asked, sort of either take it or leave it. 3. Never bothered to hear me for more than 10 secs, didn't even stand for 10 seconds. 4. I never felt like a customer. In short my day was ruined because of this restaurant and this damaged my general liking for stand alone restaurants. Avoid this.
