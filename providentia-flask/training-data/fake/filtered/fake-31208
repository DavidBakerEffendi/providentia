I used to love Eating at oh calamares it was an almost every weekend thing for me my wife and son, but the few times is been bad. The very last time I was there this past weekend it was horrible I order fried yuca with the same sauce I always get but the girl said they've never serve sauce with the yuca, I ordered 3 meals only two came I could tell they forgot to order one meal but they wouldn't admit it, my meal came out when my wife and son were almost done eating. I will never go back again is a shame the place used to be good.
