Here is what I think - it's in Wayne, not quite the food mecca of the world, or even tri-state area for that matter. I think the food is always suprisingly good.  I would say set your expectations for 'Wayne-area' restaurants.  It is a great place for a date, quiet yet busy, even if that date is with your husband or wife because you work and have two kids at home.  We like to go as a group, leave the kids home and stay for hours. I would also highly recommend it for parties, showers, rehearsal dinners, graduations and christenings - good food, better price, nice size room and good service. I really like it and would recommend it.
