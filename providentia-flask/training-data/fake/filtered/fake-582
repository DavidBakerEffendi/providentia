I'll start out like this. I've had cheese steaks at Geno's,Tony Luke's,and Pat's.They all are equally good in my opinion. I choose to support Geno's because of Joey Vento's public, pro American views.When in South Philly,I will support Geno's,only,because of this.I am proud to be an American as well!
