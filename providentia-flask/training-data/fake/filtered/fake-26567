My husband and I LOVE Mesob. It is the BEST Ethiopian restaurant we have ever come across and we live in NYC with tons of them.  This is a good 45 minute drive from where we live, but not only do we make exclusive trips to eat there, we have introduced Mesob to dozens of our friends who also now love it. The food is always delicious - we have been there at least once a month, for the last 5 years and the food has never once disappointed us. It's always (or at least tastes like it is) freshly cooked. I am a vegetarian and I always get the Veg platter - there are several vegetarian options to choose from so I am never bored. My husband eat everything and he particularly loves the lamb dishes at Mesob.  The injeras are to die for they always keep a supply coming (at no extra cost). The chocolate torte dessert is a perfect way to end the meal. I also love their tea and guava juice but the most amazing thing is the Ethiopian coffee which is served in a very unique way too. First the server will bring out the coffee beans just as they have been roasted - who doesn't love the smell of freshly roasted coffee beans. The filter they use is so organic and unique - you have to go there to see it. The service is prompt and excellent. It is a BYOB, and gives us the opportunity to bring in $15 wine bottles that may have been more expensive otherwise.  The decor is minimalistic with a few brilliant art pieces - it is not overwhelming and allows you to truly focus on the food, as it should be. We also love the owner Berekti who will come by and say hello -  you feel like this is one place where everyone knows your name :o)
