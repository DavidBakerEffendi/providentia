Delicious! I'd recommend the Barbecue De Maiale. We ordered the Vongole and Funghi as well. I'm told the Fughi was the best, but I'm not a mushroom person so I did not try. Service was excellent. Our waitress was assertive and the restaurant was accommodating to our party of 4 considering we decided to dine late.
