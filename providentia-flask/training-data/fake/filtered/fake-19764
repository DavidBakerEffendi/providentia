This is our new go-to Chinese take out.  I have lived in town my whole life and have also tried nearly every local place.  I agree that the food is not 'to die for', BUT...the place is CLEAN, it doesn't FEEL greasy when you walk in the door as do many others.  Don't get me wrong the food is GOOD, definitely the best egg rolls around (the closest I've come to my all time favorite egg rolls from Home Village - which is no longer 'really' there) , and even the fried stuff isn't overly greasy (I like egg foo young and it's ALWAYS greasy!).  Glad I found this place, it's more conveniently located to me when I'm in a rush than my other favorite, Gold Star. I have and would continue to recommend this place.
