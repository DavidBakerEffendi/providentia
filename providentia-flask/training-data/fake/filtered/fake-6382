A friend and I went there for sushi two nights ago - the outstanding roll and volcano roll were delicious and the same with our appetizers. I ordered the soft shell crab and my friend had the deep fried spring rolls. Service was pretty quick as well. The horrible part is, we both definitely got food poisoning within one or two days. I want to believe the restaurant was having an off night, or something was wrong with those exact plates. The verdict is still out on if I will return any time soon for hibachi.
