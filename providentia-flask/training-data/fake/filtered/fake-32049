My husband and I had a reservations for Valentine's Day.  We tend to avoid the crowded restaurants on Valentine's Day, but this year we decided to venture out.  Honestly, I was not expecting much.  Kitchen and staff are usually overworked on holidays like this.  However, this was an exception.  Gabrielle's blew us away.  Yes, it was busy, but our server was attentive, our food was outstanding and timely.  I am impressed and will absolutely visit again.  Thank you so much.
