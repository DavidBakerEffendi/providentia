as far as bars go. This ones top notch. The bartenders have great personalities and are friendly and get to you as soon as they can. Yeah it gets packed and loud but its a bar what can you expect. Good prices for what you get. Food was good for a bar. I came alone one night had a awesome bartender Ray who got me talking and made me feel welcome and got me talking to other people. Overall made my night. Would def recommend to others.
