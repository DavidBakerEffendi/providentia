Went on a three hour little road trip after hearing of this place in the travel channel. Before up and leaving we did a little looking into the back-round of this place. I'm sorry to say many poor reviews of the place is based of people not doing the same. Louis' Lunch still uses about one hundred year old grills to cook the meat as they did when it was first invented. The meat was not "as big" as many places you might go to length wise, it is however a very thick burger. Only toppings available are Cheese, Tomato, and onion with no other condiments (as would not be served one hundred years ago) and is served on toasted sandwich bread ("Hamburger" buns were not around 100 years ago). The owner himself was working he was very polite and a funny guy despite the overflow of people. Food was cooked well. Any other discomforts people may have experienced due to seating is do to the repeating theme of how it was established one hundred years ago. Great historical lunch, Good food.
