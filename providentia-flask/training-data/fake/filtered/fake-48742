I've been to the Yardley twice before and was not impressed. My date wanted to go this past week and what a mistake! Why make reservations if you have to wait 20 minutes to be sat? The service was the slowest and sloppiest I've seen in a long time. Actually you would get better service at a Ruby Tuesday's then at the Yardley Inn. It's sad to go to what's suppose to be upscale restaurant and the staff doesn't know how to serve wine... The food was not any better... The calamari was soggy and chewy! (not crisp and fresh) The steak was cold while my vegetables were too hot to eat? (How does that happen?) those on here giving good reviews are probably locals who sit at the bar after work because this is no restaurant I would ever suggest to anyone for any occasion. I Am just being true and honest!
