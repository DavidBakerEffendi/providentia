For many years, my Chinese restaurant of choice in the Montgomery area was the venerable Mrs. Chow's.   When Mrs. Chow finally decided to retire a few years ago, my wife and I were both very disappointed.  When New Meemah came in to the same location, we wondered if it could compare.  The bottom line:  It does...and admirably so. New Meemah is actually Asian Fusion (primarily Chinese & Thai but with a bit of Malaysian) rather than pure chinese but almost everything I've ever had there has been excellent.  Fresh, flavorful and a nice assortment of dishes without overwhelming you with the 10 or 15 page catalogs that some restaurants pass off as menus.  The Thai Basil Chicken ($12.95) is one of my favorites and the Fried Kway Teow (stir-fried rice noodles with shrimp, calamari, bean sprouts & eggs in home-made soy sauce) is an absolute steal at $8.95.   We've eaten in the restaurant a number of times but are more likely to get take-out.  The consistency is a little less reliable on the take-out stuff.  I've never had anything bad, not by a long shot, but I notice meal-to-meal differences more when I bring the food home than when I eat in the restaurant.  I'm not saying to avoid doing take-out here, just that you may experience some minor variability in the dishes. Eat-in or take-out, I've always found the staff to be VERY friendly.  Even the first time I went there, everyone made me feel like I was a regular customer.  Not just your wait-person but the hostess, the cashier, even the occasional chef who happens to be passing through the dining room.   I've never had a problem being seated but the place is small so if it's a Friday or Saturday night, you may want to call ahead for reservations (I'm not positive they take reservations but I think they do).
