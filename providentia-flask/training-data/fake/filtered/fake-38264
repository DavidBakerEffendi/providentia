Terrible. Very Bad service. Started a tab with them and they lost my credit card. After talking to the manager about this, he simply told me "These things happen" and continued to ignore. After trying to ask questions about where my credit card was I was kicked out. When i called my credit card they said that it was used that night at the tavern and I had all these charges from there. A bartender used my credit card for other customers purchases and tried to tell me they "lost" it. I do not recommend the tavern, service is very shady and they are not trustworthy.
