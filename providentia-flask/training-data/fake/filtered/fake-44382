Me and my friend was looking for some nice food and inexpensive ! As we was coming to the end of our travelling. That was when we stumbled across this place on yelp. The idea of 20 home made sauces is what really persuaded us. I got spicy chicken wrap with mozzarella and fries with jalape√±o chedder dip. The fries are amazing!! The best I've had whilst traveling and the wrap was delicious. Staff are very friendly.... The man in front order soup and a wrap (without fries) and the chef came out with his order with fries stating "I noticed you didn't order fries so I added some for you, I didn't want you to miss out" he then later came out to see what he thought of them. He loved them as much as us! The place was busy, a lot of orders from business men to take out. I will Deffinatly be returning here before I leave Philadelphia
