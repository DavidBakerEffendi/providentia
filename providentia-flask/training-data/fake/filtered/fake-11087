Ordered a calzone, a turkey sub and bacon ranch fries. Thankfully the calzone was good and big enough for two, but that was it. The turkey tasted over processed and the sub was dry with no oil or vinegar. The bacon ranch fries were covered in bacon crumbles and buffalo sauce, not ranch. I even checked the receipt to make sure I ordered correctly. After waiting an hour for delivery, I couldn't be bothered calling to complain. We tossed the fries and sub and shared the calzone.
