I came here for Restaurant Week with a friend who was running late and the hostess was very courteous and pushed back our reservation. The food was amazing here - everything was done to perfection.  You could tell the pasta was fresh and cooked just right.  It was easily the best pasta I've had in Philly.  I would definitely come back here!
