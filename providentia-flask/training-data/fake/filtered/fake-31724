I went to the Happy Rooster the other night with my wife. It had a great atmosphere and the bartenders and waitresses were very friendly and made the experience that much better..The menu was full of great choices and my meal was exceptional. My wife and I plan to go back very soon and I hear they have a karaoke night which would be a blast judging how great our dinner was. The bar was clean and the staff was great. The new owners have done a great job with the rooster
