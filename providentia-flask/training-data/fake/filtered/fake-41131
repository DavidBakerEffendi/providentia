Ramen is average here. I personally think its too fatty for my taste. Not worth the 1.5 hour wait. Finding out that some of the dishes are stored in the restroom totally grossed me out so I left with unfinished food. Yes I know the dishes are probably clean after they washed it but I just cannot stand the fact that it was from the restroom. If you don't like your dishes coming from the restroom, don't bother with this place.
