These are the best burritos I've found in Center City Philly and I've tried a number of places.  The longs lines attest to the quality of the place.  Thankfully, the people who work here are very efficient at keeping the line moving.  They seem to use better ingredients here than at competing places, and the price is right.  While I don't think burritos are an essential Philly dining experience, if you need something quick, satisfying, and tasty in the Old City / Washington Square District, this is your place.
