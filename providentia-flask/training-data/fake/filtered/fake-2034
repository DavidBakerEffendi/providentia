I was in Philadelphia for a couple of days this week and had dinner at North 3rd on Monday night.  I ordered Brook Trout with a Truffle Risotto (not the actual name of the menu item, but I can't remember exactly what they called it).  This was the most heavenly restaurant dinner I've enjoyed in years!  I dined at the bar, and the bartender (British-American gentleman) was attentive and friendly - provided wonderful service.  I can not wait to visit North 3rd again when I return to Philly!
