Had the margharita slice which was ok, and kind of like eating a slice and 1/2, which isn't too bad considering the price.  The artichoke slice just didn't look good.  It's the first time I've seen an artichoke slice with all that goop and dip on it, but something tells me that you would never see a slice like that in Italy.
