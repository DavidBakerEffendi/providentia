I feel terrible posting (what seems to be the only) a bad review, but this was my true experience. Met the owner, very nice, and proud of his shop. I had a roast beef sandwich of some type...but it was BAD. The meat was slimy, rubbery. Gross. I get better roast beef from Caton Market. The tea I had was delicious, though. My two friends I went with thought their food was terrible, too.
