You only get one chance to make a first impression and Guild failed miserably.  Waited 1 hour 55 minutes to get our entrees.  The bone-in ribeye, at $45, was mostly bone - very little beef.  And it was so tough it was difficult to cut with steak knives.  And, finally, to round out the evening, the side dishes arrived  cold.  I have eaten at some of the best steakhouses in this country and had fabulous meals.  I had hoped to have that same experience at Guild. If you advertise your restaurant as a steakhouse you better be able to deliver.  But it was not to be. Sad to say, it was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had.  The manager did apologize profusely and was gracious enough to comp us our entrees.  Perhaps it was an off night but for the prices charged, I'm unwilling to give them a second chance.
