I really enjoyed Oaxaca the first two times I went, back when they first opened. (And I"m a big fan of the owner-chef's two Thalis.) But my lunch yesterday was terribly disappointing. I ordered two chicken tacos. They were definitely worse than what I would have gotten at Chipotle. Bland cheddarish cheese, entirely unmelted. Bland grilled chicken. Pretty lukewarm, for that matter. To be clear about this: I am not that fond of Chipotle. I had tacos at one of the fantastic taco trucks on Long Wharf the other day. I know my tacos, at least to some degree. And yet I still think my taco experience would have been better at Taco Bell. I would add that the waitress told my gluten-free (celiac, not the trendy kind) friend that the general manager had told her that the restaurant has no gluten-free food. Now, I can understand saying something like, "There's always the possibility of cross-contamination in the kitchen." But to make this statement when the menu is bursting with gluten-free food, including the corn tortillas that I had, seems very odd. Again, not the waitress's fault; it's what she's been told to say.
