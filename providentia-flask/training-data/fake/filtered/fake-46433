Why is Ippudo not in west coast ??!! I expected a long wait but the wait time was only 20min on a Thursday night . The food was good - quick service , friendly staff and loved the buns . Absolutely loved the ramen and went back for lunch ( no wait on a Tuesday for lunch around 11:45 ) . The interior is different from other Ramen shop in town ,it looks like more like an restaurant than a ramen shop. love the vibe.
