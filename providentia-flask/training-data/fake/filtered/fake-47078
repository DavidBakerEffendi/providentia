Ordered small drip coffee ($1.50). Was asked if I would like milk/cream. I asked for a drop of cream. Charged $2.00. When I asked about the 50c extra was told "50c for cream."  What!?  In all my coffee years I have never been charged extra for a drop of cream. Usually it's there for you to help yourself. Adding $33%  for a small drop of cream in a drip coffee?      That's the last time I will go there.
