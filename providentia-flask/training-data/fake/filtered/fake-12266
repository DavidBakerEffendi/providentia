We had an all-around excellent experience here.  Eating out is a challenge for us because of food allergies. But chef frank was extremely knowledgable and accommodating. He prepared gluten-free, dairy-free barbecue ribs for our son with French fries (they have a dedicated gluten-free fryer!). Our meals were great too - I loved the menu with organic and superfood touches in some of the dishes. The setup was cool - nice well-stocked bar and good ambiance.  Staff were friendly and helpful and both the owner and the chef came to check on us during the meal.  Will definitely be back.
