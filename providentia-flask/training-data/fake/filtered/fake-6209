Having seen the reviews, I was expecting far better Sicilian pizza than what I experienced.  Crust was tough, cheese congeals + flavorless.  I ordered one piece w/mushrooms -- mushrooms were just added on top + slice was reheated for a few minutes, mushrooms still weren't cooked.  Would not return.,
