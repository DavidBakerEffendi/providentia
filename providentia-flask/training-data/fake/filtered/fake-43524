Absolutely delicious, we drove all the way from Albany NY and found this little gem. The owner is absolutely ridiculous NICE. I think he need to open up a school for the food industry. I got the mango lassi Â and Sam the chocolate raspberry which I did not like because of the chocolate. And he decided which chaat he would make he just ask if we wanted it with meat or not. We decided that we wanted lamb and chicken and he worked his magic and it was delicious. This guy is super friendly too
