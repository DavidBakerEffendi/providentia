This place is great! Seafood is fresh and excellent prices. $8.00 for a beer and 6 oysters, anytime. Great for groups or on a casual date. Occasional shell or sand, but for the most part really good. Lobster roll is pretty good. Oysters Rockefeller weren't the best. I prefer breadcrumbs incorporated with spinach and cheese. They do spinach over some bacon bits. Fried clams were good. Lobster bisque was really good! Clam chowder was good! Cod fish n chips were good! My go to place for a beer and seafood. Can't go wrong.
