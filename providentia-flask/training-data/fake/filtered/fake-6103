the food was very good. one of the best Thai Â fusion food in queens i have tried so far. truffle calamari is very flavorful chocolate rib was very tender sweet corn soup and mussle is aust try. I had duck confit for my entree. the skin was very crispy and the meat is juicy and tender. the chefs is really know what they are doing. definetly come back again.
