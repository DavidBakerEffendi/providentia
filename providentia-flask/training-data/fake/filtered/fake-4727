There are two young ladies who always appear to be very rude. One white with curly blonde hair, and another who maybe be latina with long curly hair. They are never making eye contact or paying attention to me when I am placing my order. I always say thank you when I recieve my order and there is never a "you're welcome or come again". Simple order taking customer service. Maybe its immaturity, bad trainging or maybe I'm asking for too much. But the food is always good and I only have that experience with those two ladies, which tend to be on the weekends. Pizza is great.
