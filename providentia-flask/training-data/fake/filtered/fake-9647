This is THE best sandwich shop in the Burlington and surrounding Burlington areas around! Do not be fooled by the posers around...The Vermont Sandwich Company has nothing on this place as it uses presliced bread and not homemade bread and still can't get the Red Onion Sandwich right! Try the Honey Oat bread with the namesake sandwich...sundried tomato mayo, house roasted turkey, bacon, apples, onions, smoked cheese...HEATED! and it doesn't stop there...all the breads are home made and if you can roast a meat it is done right on the premise. All salads, soups, bake goods, COOKIES!!!(TRY THEMl!) are made and baked there! Critics be warned, often times bakerie's say items are baked there, but are they actually MADE there? You need to go here not only is the signature sandwich always perfect, but the "normal" sanwiches are too (and the red onions "normal" sandwiches are still sooo phenomenal and large!!!).
