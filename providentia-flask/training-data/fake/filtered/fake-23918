I used to be a fan of bagel box until recently Oct 12th 2013. I usually go to bagel box with my husband and kids every Saturday morning for breakfast but what I saw in the store on Oct 12th made me think twice. The place was EXTREMELY DIRTY! Flies and ants all over the place! It was a nightmare. I overhead two teenagers talking about how disgusting the place looks. I hope they will read this review and make amends. I also have a problem about how their employees dress, we don't want to see your BUTT CRACK while toasting our bagels, pull up your pants ladies... I hope you guys will work on all these. I will be there this coming Saturday to see if any changes have been made and please don't rub your nose with your hands even though i see you have your gloves on... Thanks
