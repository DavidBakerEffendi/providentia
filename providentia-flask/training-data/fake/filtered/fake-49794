This well known Princeton inn has reopened. It is beautifully furnished, quaint, and located in downtown Princeton. The staff are friendly and welcoming. I am looking forward to the completion of the restaurant as I understand it will be exceptional. Nothing can beat the quality of this notable establishment. Jill
