The first time I went there I was impressed by the size of the place, but felt it was weird to see how empty it was. There was a large fridge that held a good variety of  beverages, and a hanging television. Oh, and for some reason they have an abandoned frozen yogurt station. I'm guessing all of those things are there to make customers forget about the poor service. For some reason, the employees think it's a smart business move to mess up simple orders (toasted plain bagel with cream cheese, tomato, and fresh lox) and then react aggressively when you correct them.  It's really no surprise that orders get done incorrectly because they go straight to creating the meal without waiting for you to finish. I've been there three times, and each time it was the same thing: I make a simple request, the lady speeds through it without waiting for me to finish, glares at me because I ask for extra meat, messes up the order and then gives me an attitude. The last time I went there, she took it upon herself to charge me extra for the extra meat--mind you the normal amount is two thin slices. I don't know about anyone else, but I actually want to be full after eating a sandwich. This is definitely not a place I'd recommend returning to. You're better off going to Clifton Bagels in Clifton, or Sunrise Hot Bagels in Belleville. At least there they treat their customers with respect.
