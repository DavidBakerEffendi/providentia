This place should be shut down. Health violations, terrible service, ridiculously long wait. I'll cut to the chase and say the final straw was watching the server pour used tea directly from an uncleaned table into the communal tea pot that was used to pour our drinks. Eating here is the "restaurant horror story" I tell to friends and is one of the few times I've walked out of a restaurant after ordering. We had a reservation for six, came in at the appointed time and were told to wait. We waited half an hour and were finally seated, despite there being plenty of open, large tables throughout the restaurant. There weren't enough cups set out for everyone, and when we asked for more were told there were none available. This made no sense since there were literally two other tables in the restaurant with patrons and an uncleared table next to us with plenty of cups waiting to be washed. Our food never came and we waited and waiting. Going on an hour, I asked for another cup of tea. Never came. Asked again, and again. On the fourth time I watched them visit the uncleared table next to us and pour the leftover tea from people's cups into the teapot. Then they tried to pour the tea from that teapot into our cups. At that point I said I would not drink used tea from a stranger's cup and asked how they could dare do that. They had no answer. Later, our food wouldn't come and their rude daughter, the waitress, refused to go get her father for us to complain about the tea and the hour and a half wait. We left and will never return. If you want Viet food in the Bloomfield area, I recommend checking out that place in the East/West shopping center instead.
