What a great restaurant.  My wife and I had a delightful meal here.  The food was very good and our waitress was very pleasant and helpful.   This location is a little bit of a walk from either Court Street or Smith Street but if you are regularly in the neighborhood for dinner or drinks, I would encourage you to try Bar Bruno.
