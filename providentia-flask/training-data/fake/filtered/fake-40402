Song is a very affordable and very yummy Thai option in the hood.  Its not the best Thai I've ever had, but it'll do!  I've had much of the menu, and you basically can't go wrong as long as you stick to the more "typical" thai entrees. My mainstay this past winter was the Thai house salad (as I was addicted to the peanut dressing), followed by the Massaman curry with chicken, as again, I have this thing about peanuts.   The downside to eating there, rather than getting take out, is that it can be very noisy and dark inside.  When the weather is nice out, though, it is enjoyable to sit out in their garden, eat, and drink a Thai beer.
