I read the NY Times article on Dos Toros and was intrigued. I can't state that I am a taqueria aficienado and frankly I don't really understand notion of a San Francisco burrito. What I do understand is good food. Now I must confess to enjoying Chipolte's burritos - they are filling and tasty - really hit the spot. At least that was the case until my travels took me to Dos Toros down by Union Square. WOW. Great carnitas that melts in your mouth, steak burrito that actually tastes like steak (no mystery meat here), hot sauce with zing, and guacamole that is neither too chunky nor too smooth. I have traveled throughout the Americas and can easily state that Dos Toros offers the real deal at a price that won't break your wallet. Wish they served sangria.
