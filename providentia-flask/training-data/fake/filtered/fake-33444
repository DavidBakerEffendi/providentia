I visited the Mix this past weekend with 7 of my girlfriends.  We had been walking around Philly for a few hours and were starving so we decided to come here because we read great reviews. I have no idea what they ordered because our food was horrible. There were a group of 10-15 girls who came in after we did and they all got their food before us. By the time we had gotten our food it was cold and we were miserable.  My friend's burger was not cooked properly (she wanted well done but received medium )  but she refused to send it back because she did not want to wait another HOUR for her food.  The waitress never came back to see how our food was or if she could get us anything. She refused to split up the check and said she couldn't do it for more than two people. The overall experience was horrible between cold dry nachos, undercooked burgers, soggy fries, overly salted ravioli's, and a snotty waitress I have NOTHING positive to say about this place. There are many restaurants around Broad Street and South Street that I would recommend over this place any day! I'm only rating this one star because it will not let me put anything less! *This review was from 2013*
