We haven't had a restaurant like this in years, truly an Upper West side gem. The interior is beautiful, the service warm and attentive and the food is incredible. Jacob is always there too, catching up with customers and ensuring that everyone leaves with a smile! My personal faves are the Fried Pickles (absolutely out of this world), Biscuits with Gravy 2 Ways and the Honey Chicken and Pickles biscuit sammy. The servings are large so I usually split everything. So yummy! You will not leave disappointed, this place is amazing!!
