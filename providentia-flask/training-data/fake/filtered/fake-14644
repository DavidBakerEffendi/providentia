There were four of us and the bill was over $70.00 without ordering alcohol.  We all ordered our burger medium rare and it came out rare.  The service was good, our waitress Jessica was able to tell us a lot of information and explain how to build our burger, so that part was also very good.  The flavor of the burger was very good. My biggest problem was the cost.  How can you charge such a high price for a burger?  I will never come back to this place.
