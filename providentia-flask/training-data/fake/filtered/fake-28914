Wear your sensible shoes...keep walking...yes down that dark ally...turn left...YOU FOUND IT! I love this place. The neon sign outside welcomes you. You've found the hidden treasure. A nice break from the standard Center City hang outs, McGillin's serves up great drinks, good food at a price you can't beat, and atmosphere you can't get anywhere else. Usually a nice mixed age crowd (a tad heavy on the college kids side) us 40 somethings always feel welcomed. The bartenders never steer you wrong when you want something different. Last week, at bartender suggestion, I had a pumpkin ale that was out of this world. This place has been around longer then your great-grandpa, so you owe it a visit.
