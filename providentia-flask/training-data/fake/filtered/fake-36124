I went here with my family after my brothers graduation from CCC. we had a group of eight including a child. We were seated around a couple of large groups where we didn't mind. At least for then. The waiter took every tables orders at the same time so you would think we would get the food at the same time. Wrongo. Actually the table that showed up 20 minutes after us got their food before us. The waiter didn't care about how our food was or how long it took. He showed up to collect his money at the end of our meal. Might I add a draft of beer was $5.50 for BUD LIGHT...AT A BREWERY!! we paid $16 for a beer and a glass of wine. Sad. I will not go back and do not recommend this restaurant to anyone.
