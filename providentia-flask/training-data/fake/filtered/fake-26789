My family of four stopped by this place after a tour of Princeton Medical Center at Plainsboro this past Saturday. The unanimous consensus - disappointed. We all like spicy food to varying degrees in my family, but why would you serve spicy salsa without a glass of water. My 11-year-old wanted to run to the bathroom to wash her mouth she was that uncomfortable. Just makes no sense at all. Is water that expensive these days? Ambience was OK - friendly, casual and relaxed. Service was good and prompt. Utensils (especially cheapo knives) had some stubborn watermark stains on them. Seating and tables comfortable. Now onto food. Salsa is a watery mush that resembles in taste its namesake. Border sampler was a major disappointment - nachos had a stale crisp to them, Chicken Quesadillas - I had better ones frozen from a box. The only thing that tasted palatable on that plate were steak bits. Guacamole was average. Shrimp & Crab Enchiladas a total disaster. Classic Chimichanga was OK. La Bandera - the meat had no flavor, the sauce was blend. It's Mexican cuisine restaurant - add a little zing. Everything tasted cookie-cutter mall-type-joint like. I am not making this up - my 11-year-old makes better refried beans Nachos than this restaurant. One other thing: one of the waiters dropped a used napkin right in the middle of the walkway. It took the 5th waiter to pick it up. We'll be looking for a better testing Mexican food joint.
