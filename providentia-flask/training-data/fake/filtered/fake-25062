We have been here a couple times.  Each time, the food was absolutely fantastic.  It's very fresh, different, and we always leave full and happy. However, the past few times we have arrived an hour after they should have been open and are greeted with a locked door and no sign of life inside.  After calling the restaurant, we talk with a person who sounds like they just barely rolled out of bed with a cold.  There is always an excuse as to why the restaurant wasn't open, but the doors are unlocked regardless and we are welcomed in.  Once we get in, the restaurant is cold (on account of the heat barely having just been turned on at 12pm).  The seating is uncomfortable and the decor is dated. We would love to visit this restaurant more often, but always consider other fantastic options as food is not the only important aspect of our dining experience.
