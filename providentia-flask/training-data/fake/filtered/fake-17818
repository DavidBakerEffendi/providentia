Ever since this place changed ownership a year or so ago, their bagels have been awful.  They claim that they make them fresh in the morning, but if you go there anytime after about 8am, they are stale, oddly shaped, and barely edible.  What a disappointment - I wish the old owners hadn't sold the place.
