I had the worse experience of my life at this bar. They are very disorganized and seated my group in a table that was reserved for an hour later. We had just ordered drinks and they decided to make us leave. The owner is a very rude and unprofessional man. They never apologized for their mistake. Instead, they made us pay for drinks we could not have and asked us to leave. It was very unfortunate because we work very close to the bar and intended to go there more often for happy hours. If you want to have a good time and be respected as a client, this is not the place to go.
