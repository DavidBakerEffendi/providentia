The food is great and the service is very fast and the waiters and waitresses are very lighthearted, but if you try to bring something from another area they start talking about a policy that doesn't let you bring foods from other food sections, like someone separating their plate. Example, my family and I were eating lunch at the pizza and pasta section when I go get a dessert with a family member at the dessert caf√© area, my father stayed at the table drinking his wine calmly and happily, when we get back with the delicious desserts, one of the female managers walk up to us and tells us, "sir, ma'm, we have a certain policy that doesn't allow you to bring foods from other areas of the supermarket." There are no signs, NOTHING, signaling this policy so that's when we started to go into a deep argument which doesn't have to be spoken of now but we ended not eating our desserts in the store because they would have had fallen bad In our stomachs. I personally would only pass by to get and Ice cream on a hot day, nothing else.
