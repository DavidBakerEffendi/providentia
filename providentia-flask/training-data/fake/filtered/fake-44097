The food here is high quality "scratch" (made from scratch) food. As a chef, I can tell they take pride in what they do. Everything has a fresh look and taste. Prices are reasonable for the area and for what they are offering. Service is friendly and familiar. The baked goods are remarkable. It took me a minute to realize that all the baked goods are really homemade, due to the professional appearance and consistency. Never had a bad experience.
