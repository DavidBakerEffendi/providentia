I can't wait to come back to the Kimchi Grill! My favorite is the chicken taco, but everything I tried was so full of flavor and interest. I was really not sure what to expect from mexican meets korean, but what i found is that it is the best of both! really good grilled meats and kimchi (love pickled foods!) combined with beans, rice and avocado. Oh, and they have really good sauces too. And everyone one that worked there was so friendly and seemed to really care what I thought of the food- which made it a feel good experience all around. I am definitely going back and bringing friends!
