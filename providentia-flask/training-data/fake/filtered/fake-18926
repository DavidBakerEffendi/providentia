Great Pizzas for sure but nasty people working there. I go there quite often but dealing with the fat rude Asian girl who takes orders and the snobbish/rude white dude who serves, is always tricky. May be they have hard boiled eggs up their asses. I wonder what their problem is? Aren't they not getting paid enough? Are the owners exploiting them? Who knows. Anyways they aren't the ones who make the pizzas. Mexicans at the back of the kitchen do.
