I love it that each time I come here I get the option to try something different and I'm never disappointed. Not feeling like eating two courses, tonight we tried the scallops with charizo and the risotto. Both were excellent. Finally Bloomfield is surpassing Montclair in the dining scene. If you haven't been here and consider yourself a "foodie" you are missing out. It doesn't get any better than: a nice atmosphere, good service, nice wine list and excellent food. Can't wait to see what I try next.
