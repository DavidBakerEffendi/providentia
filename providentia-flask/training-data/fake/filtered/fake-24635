OMYLANTA! If you ever come to NY, this place is a DEFINITE MUST!!! Actually, it is the BEST drunken munchie food ever!!!!!! Me and my friends loved it so much, we ate it 3 times out of the 4 nights we were there! Ok, so me and my 2 friends come here at like 3AM after a night of drinking...we don't really know what to expect but everyone has told us to try it! Luckily we came so late in the morning that there was no line! So we get our food and I see white sauce and red sauce....so it's hella stupid of us to try to be "health conscious" as we're eating this cuz we decide to put on JUST A LITTLE bit of white sauce once we hear that it's a Mayo sauce....and stupid ME to think that their red sauce was just like any other hot sauce that I smothered our food in it! I can usually handle my hot sauce but OMG, it was so funny. I did not expect this to be like the Habanero hot sauce and I think we almost died eating this....but it was THAT good that we couldn't stop eating no matter how hot it was! One of my friends was tearing and the rest of us were dying!! Â None the less, sauces aside, the chicken and rice was BOMB! This was seriously the BEST food I ate in NY (and our whole trip revolved around food) and it was only $6!! You CAN'T BEAT THAT!!! You must go to the cart on 53rd and 6th, because the third time we ate it....we came a little earlier and the line was around the corner so we decided to try the halal cart next to it. It was dry as a mother and the white sauce did not do anything to make it better! So if you're going to try this.....go to the one with the longass line....or if you don't want to wait...be like us and go at 3 in the daym mornin!
