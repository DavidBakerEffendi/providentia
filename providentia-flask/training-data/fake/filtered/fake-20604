After hearing the hype and waiting over two weeks to have brunch due to there tight reservations, I was dissapointed with the food. I also noticed there where many empty seats for a place that is very hard to get reservations. I ordered the Black label burger eagerly excited only to find it was nothing special. The fries where thinly cut which I like, but I found where pretty bland. The burger was overcooked, but luckily was not dry. My girlfriend ordered the Latkes, which was nothing out of the ordinary. We felt the salmon tasted a bit fishy but the rest of the dish was ok. The service was good, freindly and quick. The decor was nice also. All in all I would not go back or recommend it. I'ts one of those places I can say I tried and spent $26 on a hamburger.
