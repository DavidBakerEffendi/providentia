Love this place.  My wife and I get out for a dinner alone together every once in a while, and Witherspoons is our first choice.  we get to enjoy a Manhattan quality steakhouse experience right here in downtown Princeton.  Service is always great and food is superb.  We are big fans.  Try the Bent Spoon afterwards for a real treat.
