Terrific spot in West Village/Tribeca area. The space can be a great place to have drinks with a friend or have a cozy romantic dinner. The food was delicious. I had the Duck and it was top notch. I also tried the Hangar Steak and Pork Tenderloin that friends were having. They were all terrific as well.Wine list was decent and will certainly please most. This will become a go-to restaurant for me.
