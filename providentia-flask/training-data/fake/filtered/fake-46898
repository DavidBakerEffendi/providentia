IS We bought sweets worth $30and felt sick after eating it. The food is not fresh at all. The owner Vaishali Patel Â and staff were extremely rude and refused to grind the money. We left the food there and came away. Losing $30 is better than spending a night in ER with food poisoning. Maybe they need that money but there is no way we can eat that food. Very bad ., not worth any stars
