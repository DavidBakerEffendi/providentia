I'm not a Princetonian, but I visit for work every summer. I very much look forward to the Ivy! In the context of much pretentiousness and wealth, it is a comfortable place to have a few drinks and visit with friends. There is very little turnover behind the bar, so it feels like coming "home" each summer when I see Justin and Mickey and the gang. For more than a dozen years, they've been welcoming and warm. I know that lots of folks call it a "dive," but that's only in comparison to the more expensive places on Nassau Street. It is clean and, though, small, accommodating. It does get packed and loud after 10pm, especially on the weekends, and I can't say how it is during the school year. It is among my top 2 bars in the country, though. Consistent, reasonably priced, and friendly. If you like a good solid bar, the Ivy is a perfect fit.
