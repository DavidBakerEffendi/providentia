You can not get better for the money.  Food very very good and the service was great.. .nice décor also. Its amazing that some people complained about the service, they feel that they need to be treated like kings and queens when these servers work their butts off and the customers  don't even leave a descent tip. Cheap people complain the most.. I found the servers  to be pleasant and engaging. Lou and Martha were great.
