A group of my friends and I went to Ladie's Night. We had a wonderful time! The wait staff was excellent, catering to our every need. The food, the food, the food! Divine! I had the tomato and mozzarella with roasted peppers, which was very fresh and delicious for an appetizer. For my entree, I chose the chef's specialty steak and lobster with a gorgonzola cream sauce. I was a bit hesitant, because I'm not much of a cream sauce person, but it was light and delicate and not overpowering at all. Just right! The steak was cooked to perfection - medium rare, just as I asked, and so tender I could have cut it with a butter knife. I had the Goodfella's cupcake for dessert. Pure Heaven! Tomato bruschetta is complimentary to all guests, and the waiter brought out complimentary champagne for us to celebrate a birthday of one of our group. Nice touch. We also had a lot of fun talking and joking about the mob movies that were playing on multiple TVs (muted sound, captions), I will most definitely return!
