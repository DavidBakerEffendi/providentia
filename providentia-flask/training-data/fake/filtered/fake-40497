This place is beautiful and perfect! The crabbie fries are what dreams are made of! Our waitress was amazing and even recommended a delicious sangria. I had a awesome black bean burger and my boyfriend had a steak salad. Everything was delicious and our waitress was super attentive and polite. Will visit often!!
