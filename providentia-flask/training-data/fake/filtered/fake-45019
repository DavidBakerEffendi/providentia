I wanted to take a moment to respond to Kimberly T's review. We love the good comments Thanks!! We apologize for the smoking incident. The owners are non- smokers and have strict smoking policies, this employee was off duty and waiting for a ride, we agree it is not enjoyable to walk thru smoke and have spoken to all of our employee's regarding this! Thanks again for the great food quality comments!
