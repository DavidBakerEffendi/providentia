After a visit from Guy Fieri, I had to check it out myself. Although the place itself is a total dive, the food is AMAZING. The hand pulled noodles really are tasty - soft and chewy in all the right ways. The dofu is really fresh. The roast duck was a little cold but still delicious. Ate until I was stuffed - and then some. Plus it is INCREDIBLY inexpensive.
