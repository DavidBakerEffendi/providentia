Good evening ladies and gentlemen. I'm going to make this review short and sample. Listen if you guys happen to be driving in Newark on Broadway, and so suddenly your stomach started to growling for some food, do not head to burger king or Mc donals, cause that's not what you call a great meals. However if you looking for the good and great healthy meals, that would make you keep coming back for some more, please come on down to CINTANDER RESTAURANT it's a very cozy and layback environment to enjoy a good meals, and after that decision your stomach will thank you.
