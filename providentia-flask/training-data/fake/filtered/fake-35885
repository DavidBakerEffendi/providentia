This was our first trip to Canal Street Grille and this will not be our last. We went with friends from the area. The waitress was very attentive and we were able to speak to Chef David. The Veggie Moussaka was absolutely delicious and it came with the freshest Greek Salad.  Another had the crab cake which had chunks of lump crabmeat and was very tasty.  One of the fellows had the gyro and another the good old American Hamburger.  Everyone was pleased with the selection and we all decided that this place is certainly a "keeper".  Upon leaving we asked the waitress if the owner was there and we introduced ourselves to him and told him how much we enjoy the lunch.
