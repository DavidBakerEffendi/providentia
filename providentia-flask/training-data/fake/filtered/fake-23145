Don't order takeout without sampling before you leave.  I ordered three meals for takeout.  Arrived early to pick up.  Food came wrapped and stapled and bagged.  Paid and took home.  When I opened the bags the food was horrible. Medium burger was beyond well done and the bun was like a cruton. The wings were so overlooked that they were hard through to the bone; I also specified ranch not bleu cheese because my wife is pregnant and received bleu cheese anyway.  The panini was  made with a wonderbread-like bread and was the worst panini I've ever tasted (and seen).   I'm not fussy - this is the first time in my life that I attempted to return food.  I tried returning it and was told I cannot because no manager or owner was around to process a refund and to call the next day.  I have been calling the restaurant for over a week and neither the owner nor manager will return my call.   How can you run a restaurant that cannot and seemingly will not process refunds?   I have been to many restaurants and other food service establishments in the area from low end to high end, and this is by far the worst customer service and food I have experienced in decades.
