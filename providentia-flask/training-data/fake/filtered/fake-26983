PERFECT burger. This place is owned by the same guys behind the Farmhouse in Burlington, but this is their higher end shop. It's a classy steakhouse, but with a great bar menu. So... I had high hopes for my burger when I ordered it, and I was pleasantly surprised. It was even better than the Farmhouse burger! Juicy local beef cooked to perfection over hardwood coals... pair that with a Hill Farmstead IPA and you've got one happy guy! I'll be back, probably often.
