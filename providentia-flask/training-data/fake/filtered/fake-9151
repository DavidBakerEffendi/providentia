Based on the menu and yelp reviews I expected this place to be great but it was really pretty terrible. Went for dinner this week with a friend and other than the decor we could find nothing good to say about AA. The food was awful. Not disgusting just....very disappointing. After finding that the overpriced bottle of wine we selected was undrinkable, I ordered a pretty standard cocktail that was so revolting I actually spit it out. The waiter was polite but seemed very disinterested and could not give an opinion on anything on the menu. Not the wine or the food. He basically said...meh...try your luck..who knows. I live close by and was looking forward to adding another good spot to the neighborhood but...this isn't it. Take yourself to the other end of Classon and go to Speedy Romeo instead.
