Pretentious and unsanitary.  That is how I would describe this place.  Sat at the "bar" overlooking the people making our food.  Thought it might be a fun experience but what I saw disgusted me.  A sous chef or assistant went from plating up raw rockfish, to grabbing raw shrimp to put on the grill, to preparing a salad, to making a a dessert without washing her hands ONCE! In the almost 2 hours we sat there, not ONE chef/cook washed their hands.  I can't believe more people are not sick from their food.  Considering they are making the food so publicly, you would think they would be extra diligent.  On the other side, some of the dishes were okay, not great, but would never come here again.  Square 1682 not too far away was a million times better.
