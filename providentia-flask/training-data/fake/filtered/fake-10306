There are 2 kabob places in Boonton - this is the one closest to 287.  Their food is fantastic!  Their chicken tikka and rib eye steak are fantastic, and come with a great yogurt sauce, rice and salad.  The people who run the place and hardworking and passionate about their food!  A must try, and you will become a regular like I am!
