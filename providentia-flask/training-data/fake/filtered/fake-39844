Really really different taste of Thai.  Delicious and tasty.   Ratchaburi pork is my fave.  They come out with different specials and they are all must-try's.   Whenever we are in the city, Pure Thai is always our destination for a special lunch and dinner.  Small place but waiting is reasonable.  Groups of 5 or 6 is the max.  But we always come back.  Great good!
