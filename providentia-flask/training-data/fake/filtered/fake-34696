Sanford's is just amazing! I'm here all the time and even though the menu is larger than life I always end up ordering the same thing. Butternut squash ravioli and I share whatever protein my boyfriend orders!! There food is fresh. Servings are fare, service is pretty good considering they are always busy. My favorite part is the generous beer menu and their banana cheesecake dessert! It's a must have!!!! Couple notes the place is always busy so come prepared to wait for a table. Also, it always freezing in there. I make sure to bring a sweater and even wear jeans even if it's the summer. Otherwise I love this place is a great neighborhood spot for any casual occasion.
