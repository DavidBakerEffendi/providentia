I have been to Pig and Khao twice, the first time I had the tasting menu and it was phenomenal. I liked it so much that when I had friends from LA in town I made a reservation to take them here. On a positive note, most of the food was great. We loved the coconut rice, green mango salad, and shan noodles. However, the service was so bad that I was embarassed that I brought my friends here. We were seated toward the front of the restaurant, and it was Memorial Day weekend, so perhaps our table was forgotten about, or it was a smaller staff-but we sat at our table for 20 minutes being ignored while waitresses passed us. It was clear that we needed to be helped, we had our menus closed and we had been there quite awhile. We finally flagged down the hostess who took our orders very quickly, was not very helpful with our questions, and it was clear she did not want to serve us. It took another 20 minutes for us to get our drinks, and once we had finished those no one came around to ask us if we wanted another. The entire experience we had no waiter or waitress and had to keep flagging people down to help us. In addition, the hostess (not waitress) told us that she recommended 5-7 dishes for 4 girls. We ordered 5 and thankfully did not order more. The portion sizes are way too big to recommend that many dishes, and we only finished half of our meal. I really want to love this restaurant, but there are too many choices in New York for me to consider going back, after my second experience there.
