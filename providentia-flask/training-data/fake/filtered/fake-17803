Had dinner there last night and was highly disappointed as the menu is not the one that can be viewed online. It is now priced up there with fine dining as far as pricing and the choices are very limited. My friends ordered scallops and there were four of them- that's it! No vegetable, salad, only bread. I had a burger w/ bleu cheese and a small cup of sweet potato fries for $16. We ordered sweet potato fries to munch while we waited and they came quickly but to get the rest of the food took another 40 minutes. When I asked why it was taking so long I was told that the fries were the appetizer and they don't place the order for the entree until the appetizer is done. Also, they said a large party had come in and the kitchen got really busy (this is my problem how?). All in all I was very disappointed and will not return. When recounting this story to a friend today she had the same concerns and we agreed that, while the location is lovely, it is not the kind of place where one would expect an upscale, limited and expensive menu.
