A monday lunch yielded a great experience.  Dressed for walking and a bit underdressed compared to most patrons, we were seated immediately, and service was excellent.  By the time we finished, our party of three saw a wide range of customers, from tourists to business suits, so don't be too reluctant to give it a go.  Prices, although justified, are a bit on the higher end just as advertised. Ambience is good, and the energy in the dining area was notable.  Opted to go with the dinner menu, which offer plates that serve several, just as indicated.  So, we ended up over-ordering, but what a joy trying to keep pace.  Fried zucchini was prepared in chip size, which probably adds to prep but makes it so much yummier than spears! Chicken parm and spaghetti with meatballs were both excellent and the quantity overwhelmed the three of us.  Pasta, drinks and table bread were ok, but the zucchini, meats, and sauces are the story. Would definitely recommend.
