I had read a lot about the place and I invited a dear friend who was in town for the night. I thought would be a great experience. Got a reservation at 9.30. Hummus was ok. The mortar it came in was cool, but the actual hummus + bread was same/worst than Hummus Place on Saint Marks. Special salad (bunch of arugula + small pieces of goat cheese) is the same "special" salad that you find in every single restaurant in every single block below 14th. The famous brick chicken tasted funny, like coal/gasoline or something. not good funny. The orecchiette... oh well... why serve orecchiette if you don't know how that dish is supposed to even look like????? they were pre-cooked and re-heated and did not melt with kale/mushrooms. they were just there.sad looking. a lot of it. the waiter was trying to be super nice. but just because the people are Italian it doesn't mean you need to speak italian, especially if you don't really speak it.worse, Â if you manage to tell me you have spent a year in Rome, and then suggest I get orecchiette... well... I guess you saw/ate nothing in Italy!!! better suggest something else. the chocolate mousse is better left undiscussed. stendiamo un velo pietoso.
