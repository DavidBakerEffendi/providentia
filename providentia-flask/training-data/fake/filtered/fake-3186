Under $25 bottle of wine while we waited helped because the place was packed and I hate getting bumped into. We got a table in the back and our waiter was attentive. Apps. were good and I should've order the prix fix because everyone around us had it and it looked goooood. I ordered the calf's liver and as much as I like Â liver a full meal was too much for me. Both meals were delicious and the price was reasonable. Need to try this place again and Gallo Nero and see who wins!
