I was at pies recently and i was behind that dumb chick who reviewed never again she talked about the girls hanging outside dude she was the rudest dumbest girl  she took forever to order there was a line of drunk idiots behind me she asked all sorts of dumb questions i mean its a fried chicken place not pf changs i felt bad for the dude behind the counter cause she just kept going on and on he seemed annoyed but who blames them they must deal with a lot of dumb ass hipsters  as soon as that annoying girl put in her order i finally got to place my order the dude apologized for the wait i order the chicken biscuit and mac which was on point as usual the food here isn't five star but it is pretty damn good the only reason why i even wrote a review and signed up for this obvious asian invention was cause my girl said that dumb annoying chick in front of us bashed the place some people need to stay home
