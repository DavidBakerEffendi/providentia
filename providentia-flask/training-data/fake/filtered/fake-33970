This pizza is great.  You will probably have to wait in line (especially on a weekend), but unlike Sally's, it is a 'fair' wait....in other words, Flo (the owner) is not sneaking her friends in the back door for their 'reservations'.  So, when you go to Pepe's you will wait and when it is your turn you will be seated, then you will get your pizza.  And it is good.
