I love Teresa's--they serve excellent thin crust pizza and pasta. As a college student, Teresa's is a little expensive for my budget, but when I have the time and money, I love to splurge on dinner here. My one complaint: if you go at peak hours as a student, and expect to be seated, the staff can be unfriendly and seem eager to rush you out. In order to avoid that experience, I usually either eat at the bar, or, if the weather's good, order my food to go and eat outside in Palmer Square.
