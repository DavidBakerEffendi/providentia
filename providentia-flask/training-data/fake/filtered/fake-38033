I took my mom here for her Birthday. She is not easy to please and gets freaked out about everything. The staff was amazing and made her so comfortable (I think the owner was one of the folks that chatted with her a bit). I honestly cant say thank you enough or say how great everything was. Not to make the food the after thought but that was also fantastic!!! Thank you team Jacobs pickles. Moe
