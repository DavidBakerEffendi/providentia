Excellent meal and very good service. I have visited kanella on a Tuesday and was very happy with my experience.   It was fairly busy and not too loud and I still enjoyed a quiet intimate meal A had the goat stew which was great, a very good winter dish and my partner had the whole fish   It was a bass I think she loved it. Overall   very good time at this affordable BYOB
