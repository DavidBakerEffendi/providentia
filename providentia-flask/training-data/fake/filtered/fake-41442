Came here for dinner after reading all these great reviewed I thought we were in a little place in Cuba somewhere definitely not what I was expecting and not in a good way either.  Pretty old place waiters look as if they have been there since the building was built.  Food was cafeteria taste not pleasant. I've been to many Cuban spots and this is one we won't be returning to.
