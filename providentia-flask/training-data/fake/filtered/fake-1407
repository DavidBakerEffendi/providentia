OUTSTANDING food and service. Stumbled upon this gem yesterday whilst cruising around LES. Not only is the food incredibly tasty, they have a fantastic beer menu to boot. The ribs..... WOW. They must be the best in the city. The waiters were really laid back, yet still wonderfully attentive. Loved the vibe in this place, will definitely be coming here again.
