Nice layout and atmosphere. The  pastries are delicious. We  tried  breakfast  sándwiches  which  were  delicious  as the bread  is fresh with a  very nice  crust. Rather pricey  for  a coffee break place,  but  very nice. Some of the  wait staff  could use more customer service training! We have been here twice  and plan to come back again.  It takes  a couple of visits to understand their processes!
