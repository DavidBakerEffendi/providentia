I would like to extend a heartfelt gratitude for the hostess named Stephanie and our waiter Glenn. They possessed the nicest hospitality. Stephanie has such a bubbly character and Glenn was very attentive. I am fasting for the month of Ramadan and they respected that and served everything right on time. My daughter and I are very gracious. Thank you guys Samantha and Najla'
