I'm a bit shocked by the negative reviews because I consider myself a foodie. On the contrary to the past few reviews the pricing is phenomenal here. We've eaten here as a family numerous times and our bill is usually so small compared to everywhere else we go. Half prices wine Wednesdays? Gone out as a couple and once again had a few apps and TWO bottles of wine for an unreasonably low price. I've attended the Winchester for several of their music nights which were a blast. The staff seems to be very friendly. I've never had a bad meal here never been treated badly and I will continue to frequent this restaurant. The menu is perfect, enough selections but not a huge book, the kids portions are massive. My children always share one and we have leftovers. The bar is beautifully done! I can't say enough nice things about the place. I guess it's all preference maybe? Maybe more people should eat at Chilis or TGI Fridays? Anyway love the Winchester!
