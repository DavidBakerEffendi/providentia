Everything we had was underwhelming and over-priced.  60 bucks for four plates.  10 bucks for 2 artichokes???  Are you insane?  And they tasted like old lemon water, not artichokes and good olive oil.  I don't get it.  First Osteria is the cheap alternative to Vetri and now this?  A trattoria is supposed to be homey and everyday, i thought.  This wasn't close.  But, it was packed.  The flock has followed the shepherd once again.
