This place is awesome! You have a grill on your table and a vent above the grill. I can't believe there is such a fancy restaurant in this plaza. So we ordered a steak and pork belly BBQ, I know the pork belly sound bad, we didn't want it at first, but the waitress insist that it is good, after we got it, it's basically thick bacon, and it's the best stuff I ever tasted! The price is not much either, our meal for two plus everything is like 60. When I came in, I though I was gonna spend at least 100 here. You should definitely try out this place, the dining cooking experience is worth your life time.
