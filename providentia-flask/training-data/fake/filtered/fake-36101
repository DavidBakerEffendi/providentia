I have wanted to try La Fourno for a long time, partly because I walk by it every day and see the daily deliveries of fresh veggies and everything else.  The brick oven I can see thru the window shows that they make their own pizza and bread, but the actual menu is much more than that, lots of veal and sea food. The inside is intimate and comfortable and the owners and wait staff very friendly, but what got me is the food, really fresh and well prepared and delicious!  I love their pasta pesto and salmon and oh, my goodness, hot fresh bread straight from the oven.  I also like the buzz and music, nice when I go with girlfriends but also with a hot date.  There's room upstairs, too, and I plan to have a holiday party here this season. All in all, a great affordable place for a quick bite of soup and pizza or a more special meal with best friends.  Highly recco it for families and singles!
