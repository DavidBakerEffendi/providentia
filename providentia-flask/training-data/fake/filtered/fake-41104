LOVE IT. LOVE IT. LOVE IT. Great food, great wine, great staff, family owned and run, service was amazing!!! THIS IS WHY YOU LIVE IN NEW YORK CITY. The ambiance is wonderful for a date, night out, or just to chat with friends over a wonderful meal and spectacular food. Â Menu is simple, elegant and includes old family recipes cooked to perfection. The menu includes new items on the specials list that are fun but the pizza is divine!!! WIne buyer knows Italian wines and beyond. I will return again and again.
