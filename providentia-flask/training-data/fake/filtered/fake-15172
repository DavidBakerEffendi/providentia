Went there for lunch with some gf's.. They have a great beer selection.. The Lamb Lollies and Moussaka appertizer was delicious.. They didn't have Kangaroo and their deep fryer for fish and chips was down but overall we were all able to find a substitute.. The Mahi Mahi tacos were really good.. i'd def go back..
