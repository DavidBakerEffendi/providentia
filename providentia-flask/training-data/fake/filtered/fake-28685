This is a great neighborhood place, a craft beer bar with exceptional food.  The Irish chef had his own restaurant in Kinsale, and is a wizard with seafood.  The crab cakes are mind-blowing, as are the mussels and the fries.  And the house-made dipping sauces.  Great friendly staff, strong beer selection, nice space - and for the moment quieter and less crowded than the sister-pubs on West 3rd, Half Pint and Amity.
