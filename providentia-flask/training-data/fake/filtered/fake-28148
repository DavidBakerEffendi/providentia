Let me start this review by saying that the phone operator is complete garbage. I called hoping to be able to order my food with no problems but I was sadly mistaken. The women on the phone rushed me Â of the phone and refused to answer my questions. Id this place doesn't get their act together and fire this women. The food was ok, though.
