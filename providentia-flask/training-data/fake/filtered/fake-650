So are the other reviewers friends of the owners? Went to Old Canal Inn with my family tonight and it was terrible. The cheese steak was warmed over and tough, I barely made it through half of it and declined to take the rest home; my onion rings were dark and greasy. My daughter's french fries were limp and cold. Burgers were mediocre at best and that is supposed to be their specialty. Only saving grace was the iceberg lettuce wedge salad and the Â wine glasses are huge! We went to the Old Canal Inn because it is owned by locals but the owners really need to pay more attention to the quality of the food. What a waste of $75 for 4 people!
