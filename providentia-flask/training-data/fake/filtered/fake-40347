I used to love going to this place, but I must say that customer service is NOT this restaurants strong point. Food is cheap and good, but the service is horrible! We went last night for dinner at around 9pm was told there would be a 20-30 minute wait.... which we are ok with. We did not sit down at our table untill 10:15pm, on top of that multipe parties with that same amount of people that came in AFTER us were seated BEFORE us. After we sat down we were starving and the waiter did not come up to use for atleast 10 minutes, no apologies.... just attitude. Food came before drinks which made us not even want them anymore. Also no silverware at the tables when the food came, on top of us being starving we were not able to eat and just stared at our appetizers. After the check came still no apology from the waiter but he started arguing with us that the wait was not as long as we had claimed....Instead of arguing, just apologize and keep doing your job. Terrible experience, such a shame! Used to be a great place now I dread ever coming back!
