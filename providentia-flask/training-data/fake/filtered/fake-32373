We took a chance on this fairly new restaurant, it was EXCELLENT !!!! My Mom ordered the porterhouse steak and my boyfriend and I both ordered ribeye's. "The Meat Man" came over to ask how we wanted our steaks cooked, never had this happen before but it was okay. Our steaks were cooked to perfection !!! Both ribeye's were ordered well done (no pink at all) they both arrived as ordered and were still juicy and tender...absolutely delicious. The porterhouse was ordered rare, and that it was. But that's how Mom likes it. The baked potatoes and sweet potatoes just melted in your mouth. The macaroni and cheese had a Â "weird" taste to it? Wish they offered broccoli or string beans, way too many starches on the menu. Will definitely be going here again.
