While the food is good, the service over the years has gone from sub par to awful. On a Thursday at 11a, the dining room was not full, the hostess seated the 2 in front of our party of 2 and then disappeared. After 10 mins a waitress finally came into the waiting area to take names, since at this point there were now at least people waiting at their incredibly awkward and poorly placed hostess stand. We decided to sit at the counter, since it seemed with the half empty dining room they were having an issue getting people seated. While sitting at the counter being ignored by 3+ employees behind the counter, one of which was eating food out of a pan, we decided even with the food being good, this place is not worth it anymore.
