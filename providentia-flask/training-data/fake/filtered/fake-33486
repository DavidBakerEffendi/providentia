this company does have HORRIBLE customer service.I went there once to get a cookie. there was a really long line. When my turn came, the older man who was serving customers looked right at me, gave me a snide look, then asked the woman behind me if he could help her.She said to him,"I think she was in front of me" he gave me another snide look and then assisted me with my cookie. He then grabbed the paper took the cookie out of the glass container dropped it on the counter, and then told the younger woman who was in the middle of making a sandwich for another customer to cash me out. He did not bother to look at me again, but instead gave the nice lady behind me a huge smile and aks her how he could help her. I know im not crazy, and nethier did the nice lady behind me, beacause by the look she gave me i know we were thinking the same thing. it's not the 1960's anymore.
