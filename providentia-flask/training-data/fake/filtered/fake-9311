This was my second consecutive visit to Mac Attack! Last night I went during their busiest dinner rush and yes it was SO worth the wait. Tonight I went after the rush for more, to feed my new addiction. Yesterday I thought I might just play it safe and order the traditional mac and that's it. I took it for takeout and it travels fairly well still hot when I got home. I could not how amazing it was, so full of flavor and not at all heavy or overwhelming. Yes! I could not believe it too a non "food coma" mac & cheese. Because how amazing the traditional mac and cheese was I had to go back for more, and I didn't stop and just mac & cheese. For my second time here I ordered the southwest mac, manchego sticks, mozz sticks, and a Nutella grilled cheese (I know fat boy dinner). The southwest mac was another amazing discovery, creamy pepper jack cheese jalapeno corn and a corn bread topping it hit my taste buds with sweet and a light kick of spicy. Machego sticks- I didn't even know manchego cheese existed it was really good but the sauce that it comes with I can easily drink a gallon of it. Mozz stick- everyone in Jersey loves mozzarella stick but this place makes it in a way I've never seen before, they actually deep fry fresh mozzarella cheese I don't think I can go back to having a traditional frozen mozz. Lastly and yes I did have room, the Nutella grilled cheese, OMG its simple but I swear it's a bite of happiness that's probably the only way to describe it. Over all this a great place with great music playing bright fun colors cool art work and a cool friendly staff. I WOULD NOT MISS OUT ON THIS PLACE!
