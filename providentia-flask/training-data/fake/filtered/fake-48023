Spent a wonderful weekend in NYC.This place was great. The food presentation was lovely and the bar as well as the bathrooms were VERY clean. Very much enjoyed the outside bar. I would highly recommend this place and will visit many times over. Heather you ROCK! the best waitress and very efficient.
