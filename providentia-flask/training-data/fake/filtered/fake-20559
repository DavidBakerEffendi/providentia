Single best service I have ever experienced.  The dudes who run this place are the same who take your orders and personally recommend/explain their dishes.   The food here is out-of-this world, too: everything is a "best ___ you've ever had"--take the sable and challah, for example; that must be what a lox 'n' bagel post-enlightenment tastes like.  I will also especially recommend their lafa, a must, and their beef cheeks, which were potentially the single most flavorful and tender cut of meat I've ever eaten. One negative I see is the price.  That said, by coming here and paying for the excellent service, food, atmosphere, and overall attention to detail, you are truly voting with your fork.  Plus, we got tons of free stuff like a beer, iced tea, and a dessert! But I guess you just deserve that after paying $8 for two small (but delish!) iced teas...
