Was so excited when they moved into the old Pizzeria Uno's spot on 3rd Ave.  My friends and I went there a whole bunch of times when they first ordered.  Loved the beer battered string beans, the mashed potatoes, the bottles of water they give you for the table.   And then it got really popular.  It's obnoxiously loud, the food has suffered (a lot) and the politics involved in seating is more like being at a velvet roped club than a (formerly) cool, basically casual restaurant that can barely say it's "in" the east village.
