Meatball shop is great. The meal is delish and well priced for the portion. Only knock is that it's impossible to go in a group without having a long wait. If you don't mind that, everything else is nearly perfect. The service is good and the food literally comes out within minutes of ordering. Also in a great area to go out drinking and stumble into to have a few balls.
