Crappy lil hole in the wall! They sold me spoiled cake! I spent 7.22 on 1 chocolate and 2 coconut lemon and all 3 were rancid! I had cake there 1 time before and it was great. I don't know what the hell happened but they need not to do it again!!!! Only thing I will get for now on is a can of soda!!!!!
