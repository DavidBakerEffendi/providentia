Thursday, March 31, 2011 = Night of The Bouncer, Doorman at Cafeteria * 10:30 PM - party of 7 unapologetically could & would not be seated for dinner. * Bouncer, Doorman was rude and condescending, but he was just following orders from the unconcerned host. The hired-hand never made it to the host's podium before being told ,"NO" to inquire about seating our party. *After asking to split my party by seating us at different tables, I was still refused service and told, "you're not getting in." There were two empty round tables that could seat five!!!!!!! *A party of three of another race without reservations was seated immediately!???? Bouncer, Doorman said it was because "they're a party of 3." Therefore, I asked could my party be split to a party of 3 and a party of 4? His response was, "You're not getting in, so you can go somewhere else." Needless to say, I will never return to Cafeteria to be discriminated against, disrespected, nor dismissed.
