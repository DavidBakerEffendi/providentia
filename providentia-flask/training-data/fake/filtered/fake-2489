Amada is really delicious.  Great little plates, mostly with a spanish flavor.  Outstanding grilled meats, some interesting cheeses, good service, an all around great place for dinner.  You really can't go wrong with any item on the menu. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that I've been here for lunch a couple times, and it seems like their lunch offering is a distinct step down from what they do for dinner.  They have lunch specials, and it seems like they just crank them out to bring in the cash.  Dinner, though, is really outstanding...
