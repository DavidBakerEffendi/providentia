I can't believe this place even has reviews under 3 stars. Who can hate on a place that's delicious and totally locally supplied? The tortillas and chips are all housemade. My sister, brother-in-law and I went during Black Friday. We got the nachos as an appetizer and I had the beef tongue tacos (I always get the weird stuff). Sure, it's expensive, but it's all natural and all delicious. All the taste, none of the guilt.
