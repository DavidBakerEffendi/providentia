One of my favorite places on South Street, or in Philly for that matter. My husband loves the cheesesteaks but I always get a hoagie. The cheese hoagie is the best I've ever had. Fries are stellar. Loads of character, we love to get a seat inside and eat-in. Many concerts at the TLA across the street with food from this place to make a great nice.
