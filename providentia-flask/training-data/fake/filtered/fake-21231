I was told about Joses by a friend of who moved in near it. We ordered take out from there and to be honest I wasn't very impressed. I think it had to do with what I ordered. I went back months later and got some of the most mind blowing tacos I've ever had. If you want good authentic tacos then come here. Just like everyone says you need to get Chips and guacamole. Also make sure you get everything on the tacos with spicy hot sauce.
