I've been to KC Prime several times for lunch, Sunday brunch and dinner.  Every time I go I am always completely satisfied with my service and food!  Their menu has many options to choose from as well as daily specials that the server informs you about.  (I wish the daily specials were printed and handed to you so that you can see the prices...  there is also a lot of information to listen to and you can't always remember what each special has to offer, and I wish they weren't always the same.) I went for dinner tonight and ordered the lamb chop special, it came with bourbon sweet potato mash and sauteed spinach.  It was FABULOUS and perfectly cooked!  My portion came with 6 or 7 lamb chops, I shared with my brother and I was still able to take home half.  My brother got the full rack of ribs which were also very good!  For the two of us our bill was $111 for one glass of wine, two sodas, one soup, two entrees, coffee, espresso and two desserts.  The entrees included salads, so for the amount of food we got I thought the bill was spot on.  You definitely can't get that much food for the same price at Ruth's Chris! I have dined several times at the following steak houses: Ruth's Chris, The Palm & Capital Grille and think their prices and quality are pretty darn close. I love KC Prime and will continue to be a guest of theirs!
