Decent food, great service. It's your typical bar and grill with finger foods and standard American fare. They offer daily weekday drink specials, karaoke, trivia, and theme days/nights. Fun place, upbeat, decent food and reasonable prices. Two complaints, parking borders between horrendous and non existent. For the most part service is good unless you get someone like Dave, who's not a bad guy... Just a little slow with the service and somewhat inattentive.
