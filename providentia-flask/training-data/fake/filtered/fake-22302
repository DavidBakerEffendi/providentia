I've only dined here 4 or 5x but every time has been superb! Although I wouldn't call myself a pizza connoisseur by any stretch of the imagination, I am fairly choosy. I prefer my crusts to be just thin and crisp enough with light charring--but I also want full, rich toppings. Harry's manages to get the texture just perfect for me. You can always taste the freshness in the toppings, including the cheese. I never imagined that I would try any pizza with seafood but their clam pizzas and the Fra Diavolo (shrimp, scallops, and prosciutto) has me highly impressed.  But I would also recommend the pepperoni, sausage, and meatball toppings as well. It's a tiny restaurant, but the atmosphere is actually rather chicer and cleaner than one might expect from its location near the Big Y, several fast food joints, and a gas station. The wait staff can be a bit harried--but they are mostly very polite and occasionally generous. I especially enjoy the lemon ices they offer at the end of the meal.   No other pizzeria comes close.
