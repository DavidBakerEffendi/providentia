I have to admit.  The food here are above most of the restaurants in Chinatown.  My one star review is more for the service, or to be exact, to the hostess.  No warm greeting, no smile, not even an acknowledgment.  We had to volunteer the information and asked how long do we have to wait.  Maybe I shouldn't be expecting an upscale service in such an affordable restaurant, but maybe an "affordable" service and attitude, not just blank, mean and b*tchy stare?  I mean, hostess is the first impression of a restaurant for new customers.   We stayed waiting for about 20 minutes, just because it was late and we didn't feel like searching for another place.  Even though we did have a good experience with the food and our waiter was attentive, but I don't think we would ever want to go back to that place again.  On the other note, I noticed that the hostess tends to be more friendly and chatty to non-asians or non-Chinese.  Such a shame!
