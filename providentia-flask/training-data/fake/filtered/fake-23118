This place was surprisingly bad. My family and I went here last week and walked away very unimpressed. We where pleasantly greeted and seated around 5:45 on a Tuesday, the place wasn't very busy. Everyone (5 of us) ordered the restaurant week special after waiting for what felt like ages. Starters came out quick but after waiting for a loooonnngg time for the second course our waitress came over to tell us that the kitchen screwed up order and that it'll be a while longer. When the food eventually came out some plates were cold and all of them tasted mediocre, at best. We complained, nicely, and they said that they would discount our dinner. When we finally got the bill TWO HOURS after we sat down it didn't have a discount. The waitress insisted that it was discounted, just not itemized? what? After helping her add up the four set price dinners it finally dawned on her that they didn't give us a discount! She apologized and said that she'd be right back. 10 minutes later she returned with another bill. This one discounted 20% off of ONE of the $35 meals. Really? At this point I was just happy to leave...
