Yama serves some of the best sushi and sashimi in the United States! Our family has been customers for many years now and has found no other sushi to compare. Our daughter currently lives in Tokyo, Japan, and has told us that the "Rainbow" served at Yama is superior to any she has had in Tokyo. My wife and I have eaten in many restaurants in our 32 years together. The quality and service offered by this wonderful place is great!
