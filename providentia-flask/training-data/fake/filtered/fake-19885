both my boyfriend and I have eaten at Oasis over the past 2 years with no complaints and with the compliments youll read here (cheap, yummy, etc) but Both myself and he got food poisoning this week,     5/10/12,  from the falafel sandwiches.... intense vomiting, etcetc. maybe it was a bad batch,  i don't know.
