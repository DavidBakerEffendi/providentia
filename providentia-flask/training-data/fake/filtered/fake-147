not very impressive to say the least.. plain old bread with dry meat and a couple of slices of provolone cheese which was buried halfway thru the sandwich. And seriously, what's up with "cheese whiz"? don't see what all the fuss is about.. got a cheese steak sandwich from another place. Not going to name them but the name starts with an "a"... a much better sandwich. but I guess if some people really think genos is the best then im not going to say anything except that genos must be the only cheese steak they have eaten...
