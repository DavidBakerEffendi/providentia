Ponty Bistro is one of my favorite restaurants in New York City. The staff is super friendly and the food is always delicious. The mussels are to die for. I have yet to find better mussels anywhere. The steak is always cooked perfectly and the mac and cheese is good too. There drink specials are also a plus. Good for a date as well as dinner with friends
