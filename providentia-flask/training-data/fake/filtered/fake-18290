The other day I came into D'Angelo with my husband, who is Italian.  He is so picky about Italian food!  If it's not exactly like his mamma prepared it back when he was a kid growing up in Firenze, then it's no good.     However, my husband really liked D'Angelo!  And I did too for that matter.  We tried a pizza margherita and a pizza with goat cheese and slices of zucchini - the combination was light, and perfect.   We also had a little bit of the pasta bruschetta, made with pasta, mozzarella, tomatoes, and olive oil.  "Buonissimo," (very good) my husband said.   Lastly, we some items to go from the bakery section, like the cannoli (made with fresh ricotta) and the sfogliatelle.  They had many authentic Italian pastries. My husband was so happy walking around the store.  He saw many Italian products he hadn't seen since he moved to the U.S., and we ended up buying all sorts of imported products!  Olive oil, biscotti, smoked parmigiano, Italian chocolate, etc.   We'll definitely be back!
