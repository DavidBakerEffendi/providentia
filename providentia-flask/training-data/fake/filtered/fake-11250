I really love this place! The food is fantastic--we had the cucumber/watermelon soup, frisee salad, oysters, scallops, fresh ricotta and rosewater pavolva. Since we ordered all small plates, our server suggested splitting the items into four courses. The drink menu is also inventive and delicious. I noticed that some other reviewers complained about the service and prices, but I found them both to be a pleasant surprise.
