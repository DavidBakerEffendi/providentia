Wonderful dining experience we had this past Saturday night. We were seated upstairs at one of the booths. First let me start by saying the food was absolutely delicious, we ordered the assorted olives as an appetizer along with the fried calamari. My entree was the Chicken Picatta recommended by our waiter, and my husband ordered one of the pizzas. Both were excellent. Although the food is an important factor about a restaurant, the service is really what puts the "icing on the cake." Josh was a terrific server, not only by his knowledge and his attentiveness. He was compassionate, easy to talk to, and made our experience memorable. Oh, and the barista made an awesome latte! :-) We will be back in the near future.
