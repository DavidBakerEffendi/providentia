For approximately $15 not including tip and tax for a bowl of ramen, it better be pretty damn good.  In my opinion, Ippudo's ramen is just alright, of course, it is one of the better ramen places in New York.  The texture of the noodles is spot on, but the broth could use some help.  It is not as rich as I would like, lacks body, and has under-developed flavors.
