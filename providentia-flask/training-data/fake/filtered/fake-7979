I went here last weekend during the carshow happening on passyunk and found it to be a great spot.  The atmosphere was relax with a very nice decor. I had a coffe, a brownie and the cornbread waffle with veggie chilli.  The waffle is a sample of what is to become part of regular speciality waffle offerings.  I have to say it was amazing, it was so delicous and unique.  I can't wait to see what other waffle combinations are going to be available. The coffee I had was a local blend, and I had a fresh cup made in a pour over style.  I thought it was excellent and could really taste the frshness of the coffee.  It was great having it freshly made for me rather than having old stale coffee. The brownie was also fresh baked and perfectly fudgey and wonderful. I can't wait to the full menu is available to try more and will also make this part of my coffee routine.  I plan to hang out plenty and lounge with my laptop on some of those comfy chairs they have in the window area.
