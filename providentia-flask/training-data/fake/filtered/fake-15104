Its with a heavy heart that I would only give this place less than 5 stars, but I must. I am g/f, but my husband isn't. We had gone a bunch of times to get pizza (mine g/f, his normal) and one night he wanted to try the risotto. Seeing that this place is named after the freaking dish, one would expect it to be amazing or at least properly cooked, right? Well, no. Hubby looked disgusted as he took his first bite. Being the shy diner who never complains, I tried his knowing that I would say 'oh please its amazing you are just a food snob!' no no, it was hard as a rock, so we sent it to be cooked longer, it came back.. yup, not cooked through. Sent it back again, waitress looked at us like we were crazy (seriously, I have eaten TONS of risotto -- and I am NOT a food snob) came back and was more of less cooked but just not right. He downed one more spoonful and that was that. Nobody offered anything, even after we mentioned that the rice wasn't cooked. OK, enough bitching. It has tons of gluten-free options. The breadsticks (GLUTEN FREE BREADSTICK GOODNESS) are delicious, beer selection is solid.. I will say though, I am g/f but I try to be healthy-ish, avoiding refined sugars when I can -- and if thats the case with you, avoid the desserts (even though I can't always).. but it does make me wonder how 'healthy' the savory food is.. but at the end of the day, being able to order a beer and pizza is good enough for me, health be damned!
