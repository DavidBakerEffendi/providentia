I'll start off by saying I can never get enough greek food and I eat a lot of it. Stopped by Essex today after reading all the great reviews about this place. The pear olive oil cake was incredible, not too sweet, very moist and unlike any other cake I've tried. The owner was super sweet and the prices are reasonable, especially for quick, homemade and good Greek food in the city. Will definitely be going back!
