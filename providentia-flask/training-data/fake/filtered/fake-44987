I absolutely love Wings. It's my favorite place to order from, it's always fairly cheap, the wings are absolutely addictive, and the fries are usually amazing (sometimes they're overcooked, but I'm not revoking stars just because I personally only eat fries when they're super soft, so it's not their fault :P). I ALWAYS order either the hangar 1 or the hang glider. Boneless wings, honey BBQ sauce (or, occasionally, wimpy- but even that's super spicy to me!), root beer, and fries. The wings always come DRIPPING and soft and the sodas are always ice cold! The drivers are always super nice, they're always smiling and polite, and they're super relaxed too! If they forget something (which I think has happened like twice over 3 years, but, hey, everyone's human! :) ), they always get so apologetic and get it immediately. I hope they're getting paid enough! The only thing I should say is that if you order the hangar 1, you'll need to order an extra small blue cheese dressing if you want enough to cover the wings! But that's probably because I love to drown the wings in dressing! Also, be prepared for a wait! Depending on when you order, you'll have to wait anywhere between 20-60 minutes. But it's well worth the wait!!
