Place is run like a boot camp,what's on the wall is all they have,that's it.service is good but the food is kinda bland,People that I usually speak to say the food I'd delightful.I have had better food in a pizza shop.prices are ok but I think your better of trying it and making your own decision,I'm not busting down the door for there food any day soon!
