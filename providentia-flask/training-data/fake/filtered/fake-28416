Hibachi at Volcano is worth every penny.  The food is very flavorful, presentation and experience are entertaining, and the portions are substantial (plenty for leftovers).  I haven't tried the sushi here but I went with a large group and tried almost if not all of the hibachi entrees and recommend all of them.
