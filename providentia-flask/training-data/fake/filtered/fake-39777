Just went to London grill. The drinks menu is extensive and it has been done up really well. We ordered a variety of dishes.. but no one really thought theirs was anythng great (and at close to 30 bucks a head.. for just an entree not cheap as well). I ordered a steak which was cooked way more than a medium rare and burnt as well. Service was poor.. our waiter did not smile even once at us. Its sad because with the warm interiors I really wanted to like London Grill, and make it a place to go for wine and a nice meal. Anyway, if LG wants to be known as just a place with a good bar, it should serve more bar food instead of aiming to serve good steaks and lobsters.
