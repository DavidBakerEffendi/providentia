I think I must be missing something with this place. The reviews are mostly good but both my visits were mostly bad. The first time was sometime around October. I had the burger special, the burger is one of those things I will almost always get on my first trip to a gastropub, I mean, if the burger sucks then do we need to go further? It didn't suck but it was under-cooked and the bread was awful, like a over-sized stale cheapo burger bun. Philly is spoiled for good bread so no excuses. My girlfriend had the cubano which she loved. It came with a mountain of fries which were not so good, really salty and either overcooked or cooked more than once. I remember thinking the place looked great, the service was good and genuine, beer selection was above average. So we tried again. The food was again just ok. The oyster sandwich was dry and the oysters didn't seem very fresh. We split the thanksgiving balls which I think were vegetarian, couldn't find any turkey and couldn't taste the stuffing. Our bartender was mostly missing. It was quiet but still, we felt like we'd been left in charge, she was mostly downstairs and we felt like a bit of an afterthought. We went around the corner to the Abbaye to finish off our night out.
