Looking for a decent lunch before hitting the road home. Parking was a challenge, but then noticed Salute has its own deal with the parking garage right on the corner-SWEET. Owner himself came out and opened the gate, then had our table waiting for us--had children, no official kids menu, but they were very accommodating; pasta is a given, but we weren't expecting them to specially prepare chicken fingers and FF for the kids. Lunch meals were very yummy and affordable. Adults had lovely roasted butternut and pistachio salad, perfectly dressed with a lite lemon vinaigrette. Gnocchi with a pesto cream sauce, the roasted reds mixed in were a nice surprise. Fun apps, grilled sandwiches and lots of pasta options. Great portion sizes. But what was most impressive, was the service, Tommy, Lisa, and the others were so very welcoming and attentive. Even brought the kids dessert on the house, no not hoodsie cups but chocolate lava cake and gellato. Then packed biscotti for the parents to take with them. WOW! feeling spoiled. Awesome meal, affordable, and suitable for families as well as date night. GO!
