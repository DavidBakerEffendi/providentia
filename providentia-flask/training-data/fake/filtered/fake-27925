Went to Eatalia for dinner last night.  Arrived around 5:30 and was seated promptly and politely.  From the hot seeded bread, delicious antipasto, stuffed chicken breast, garlic mash, vegetables and unbelievalbe tiramisu and cream puffs, it was a wonderful experience.  I too enjoyed Bistro Juliani and I am pleased to have again in the neighborhood a delicious establishment to frequent.
