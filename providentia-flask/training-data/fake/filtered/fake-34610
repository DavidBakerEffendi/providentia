The reason for the 1 star is because of the valet parking and customer service (or lack thereof).  Honestly, why valet parking?  Had a nice time for happy hour at the bar and then got my car.  The valet guys moved my seat all the way back, adjusted the back of the seat, adjusted both driver and passenger mirror &the rearview mirrors and to complete it, had the AC blasting all the way up - and it was only about 70 degrees!  They also changed my radio station.  All of this so they can park my car 10 feet from the entrance??!!  To top it off, the valet could not care less - sarcastic & rude.  So I called the manager at Cielo - Joel -  and told him what happened.  He was apologetic and asked for my email address so he can do something for me.  It's been over a week and I've heard nothing from him.  So as far as customer service goes, Joel is not the guy you want to speak to if you have a problem.   Regarding the restaurant, it was nice at the bar for appys & wine.  Had the ricotta cheese appetizer (don't get just for yourself - there's plenty) and the carmelized onion pizza.  The place is LOUD so if you're looking for a quiet place to go, this certainly isn't it.
