I watched this place being built but hadn't had a chance to go and eat until yesterday. The decor inside is nice, a lot of old wood and warm colors.  They also have a market with organic and local products - I bought the spicy ketchup.  Because I like spicy ketchup. Anyway, I had dinner and I ate the hanger steak, which was solid.  Salsa was a nice touch. Also had the crab cakes, which were covered with kataifi.  I love crab cakes in general, but the kataifi gets a big thumbs up from me because it made them crunchy. I should have tried them with the spicy ketchup though.
