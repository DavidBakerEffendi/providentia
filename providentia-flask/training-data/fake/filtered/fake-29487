This place was rather disappointing. The service is OK at best. The food is WAY overpriced. Sweet potatoes were too damn sweet. Corn bread was nothing to brag about. Mac'n'cheese was good and the ribs were pretty much the highlight of my meal. Definitely not a place for a date. More of a quick stop or a takeout joint.
