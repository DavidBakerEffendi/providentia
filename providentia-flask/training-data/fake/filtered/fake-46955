This restaurant is the best part of the Gramercy Park Hotel.  Although the starters were excellent,  I could not understand why my dining partner raved over his pasta dish.  It was simple, homestyle food that did not warrant the high price.  I'm open to tasting more dishes at the restaurant, but can't say I'm dying to head back.   The wine selection, however, made both of us happy, as did our server, who was friendly and not overbearing.
