disgusting. I never order from EBAs especially for delivery because of horrifying expierences in the past i.e raw chicken. but it was the only place delivering on Easter so i had no choice as I was at work. It took well over an hour for my one sandwich ot get here, payed 15.00 for it and it looked like a 3 year old made it. it was poorly made and cold, it was suppose to be a hot sandwich. i think im so angry because it was so simple to make and it was complete junk. The only reason i settled on giving them any stars was because i had too and the delivery guy was pretty cool. I work at a hotel at the front desk,(they knew that because they delivered this crap to me) Â Im the person people ask for delivery options in the area, i know who I WONT be recommending, in fact I think I'll be recycling all their menus now.
