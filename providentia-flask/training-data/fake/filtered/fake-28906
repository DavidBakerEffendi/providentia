This is one of the coolest bars that I have ever been in--for the folks who work nearby, it is the perfect place to sit and grab a couple after a long day at work; for the tourists, it is a good place to go that is inexpensive and welcoming; for karaoke fanatics, it is very heaven. Â I love this place--must be the Irish in me.
