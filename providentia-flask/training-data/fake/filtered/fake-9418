Service was wonderful, quick and thoughtful. Food (we went for Sunday brunch) was fresh and filling. The view is stunning, and we will definitely make a point of coming back in the evening for a cocktail on the patio. The space is beautiful, open and modern, fitting for the building it's in. We were pleasantly surprised with their small but well-rounded beer list, and all the cocktails consumed were excellent and affordable (nothing over $10 for brunch).
