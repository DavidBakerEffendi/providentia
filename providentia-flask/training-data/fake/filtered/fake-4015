1. Overpriced! This has to be the worst sushi I've ever had. 2. The bouncer was sooooo rude (I guess because of the night I went) 3. The waitress was unpleasant and rude 4. You need to be all dolled up to even step foot in there without feeling "under dressed" 5. The people that go there are not very pleasant
