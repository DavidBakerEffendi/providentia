So I have been to knock many time and I have enjoyed myself each and every time.  This past Sunday my boyfriend and I gather all our friends for a brunch before the equality forum.  There was 13 of us, and being in the restaurant business I know about big parties and the trouble they some times can be.  I will also mention that more that 80% of our party are also in the the restaurant biz.  Of course getting all 13 people together on time is an impossible feat.  We made the reso for 11:30 and knew that people would be late.  My boyfriend and I showed up at 11:50, yes we were late and felt very bad for being late and understood if we had to wait long for our table.  When we arrived 6 out of the 13 of our friends were at the bar.  My boyfriend went to the host, Jim, to tell him that we had half the party and that we were very sorry for being late.  Jim rolled his eyes at my boyfriend and said, "Well I have angry tables that are complaining about the out door tables."  My boyfriend told him that we could sit inside if people wanted the outdoor tables.  Jim, in a bitchy tone, said "well i don't know what to tell you!"  We took the outdoor tables that they reserved for us and got everyone out there.  Jim did not bring us any menus and someone in our party went inside and got the menus for everyone. After that though we all had the greatest time.  Terry our waiter was everything we could hope for.  He was fun and delightful and was on top of everything we asked for.  The food was perfection.  Everyone at the table was licking their plates by the end.   I would say to knock to keep doing what your doing...but please give your host a lesson in kindness!
