I eat out daily and if you are in Midtown Manhattan, it gets pricey. There are ways to beat the cost. The food carts are nice, but for a skinny guy, I eat a lot and always end up getting hungry later. So, I start looking around and I found Uncle Gussy's. Now Uncle Gussy's is far from where I work. It's atleast a mile, but the yelp reviews have convinced me that it's good, so I had to do it. One day, just on a whim I walked to 51st and Park where it's located. And then I see the line next to the blue truck. The line doesn't move as fast as in a McDonalds/subway, but it isn't slow either. I ordered rice platter with w. extra chicken, spicy and very little white sauce. I don't usually get white sauce, cuz on the carts, it's just another name for mayo. But to my surprise, the white sauce from these guys is good. No trace of mayo whatever, and I later learned that this is called tzatziki and is made of sour cream (or I wish greek yogurt). Awesome.... My meal was great. The rice is nothing special, but the meat was just right. It's dark chicken and if you want white meat, I think it's $2 extra. I like dark chicken myself so no problem for me. And the extra meat for a buck is a bargain. I paid 6$ in total, and was full. Didn't feel hungry at all later. I love this place. If it isn't so far, I would eat here every day.
