LOVE this food! They deliver though and I wish I could order it for delivery. The one girl who brought it to us one time (blonde curly hair, loud annoying voice) literally WALKED IN OUR HOUSE while she was handing us food! Then started talking to my children telling us stories about her two kids! mind you, this girl looks like she MIGHT Â be 21, and she was telling me our children should get together for a play date!? It took me forever to shoo her out the door and even then I was afraid she was going to come back. Unbelievable! I want to order food from here so badly, but have avoided it because the last thing I want is her in the house again (delivery wise) if we do get delivery we just get maninnoes now. Their wings are very good too!
