This is great thai food in a family setting!  Sure the place is relatively small, but take out is a good option.  I had the drunken noodles (with tofu) - medium spicy...and it was well balanced. I was in town for a meeting and staying nearby at the Omni hotel.  Jeera Thai is about a 2 minute walk away and worth it.  Getting a seat at the big table meant excellent service and a chance to talk to the owner about the restaurant and her background for a bit.   I will definitely plan on stopping by again on my next visit.
