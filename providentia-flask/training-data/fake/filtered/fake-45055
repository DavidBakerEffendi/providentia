If you don't look like a "preferred customer" don't go to Mario's. I stopped by one night after work in plain clothes, ordered a large cheese pizza, and sat down across from the register. 10 minutes later a man in business casual walked in, ordered the same thing, and stood at the register. About 5 minutes one of the employees pulled a large cheese pizza out and the other customer prepared to pay. I stood up told him it was probably mine. He saw me waiting so he apologized and backed off. The employee "corrected" me, stating it was in fact the other guy's. How someone can order the same item 10 minutes later than someone else and be served first is beyond me. I guess the manager decided my time and business didn't matter. Now they don't seeing as I'll never go back. If my family wasn't waiting for me with the expectation of Mario's I would have left on the spot.
