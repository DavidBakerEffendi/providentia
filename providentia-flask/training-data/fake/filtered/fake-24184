I live in New York, was raised in NY, and grew up with a Jewish mother and grandmother and nobody makes better brisket than Hershel's. I brought some back to New York City for my parents and they want me to bring them more when I'm back this week. The turkey and pastrami are also terrific and my husband loves the cole slaw. The prices are reasonable and the food divine. Can you open a branch in New York? (BTW--I live four blocks from Zabars!)
