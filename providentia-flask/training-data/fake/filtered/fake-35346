Mighty Quinn's was a great spot.  My family and I arrived on a Sunday night around 5:30, and the wait was only about 15-20 minutes for food.  We helped ourselves to single servings of Brisket, Pulled Pork, Burnt Ends and Ribs, along with quite a few of the sides.  The brisket was good, the pulled pork better, the ribs were great (they make it slightly spicy and the meat just falls off the bone) and the burnt ends were incredible (doused in bbq sauce and perfectly cooked).   This wasn't the best bbq i've ever had, but it was pretty darn great, and considering the proportions and prices, a trip here is completely worthwhile.  I will caution though that by 6:30 the line had extended outdoors, and in cold weather that's just no fun at all.
