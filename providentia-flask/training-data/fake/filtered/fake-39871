Went to go eat at Frank Pepe's and line was too long on a very cold Friday night. Decided not to wait and ended up at the take out of Tony & Lucille's. Didn't look like much when walking in, almost completely empty and kind of old school. Cash only. Greeted by a cute, little, older Italian lady, could be Lucille? We ordered a Meatball sub and Chicken Parm sub (additional charge for mozzarella on both). We asked to sit down and were told that this side is take out only. Being from out of town we decided to eat in our car. When our orders came up and she brought it out on a plate she told us "come on, you can eat in this dining room with me. And if anyone asks, I'll tell them you're family from out of town coming to visit". We thanked her profusely and sat down to these great subs, with great big bread that was crunchy but soft on the inside. They were both delicious and we loved their sauce. Had some Cannoli's, which they make to order, and they were great. We will definitely be back to try their Calzones and regular slices. Not sure why there are so many bad reviews. But I do agree with the reviewer who said it was like eating at your friend's house.
