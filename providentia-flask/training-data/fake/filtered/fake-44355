I'm giving this place 5 stars because sentimentally it will never be forgotten. One bite of the wontons, the noodles, the soy sauce chicken or duck will transport me back to my childhood when life was simpler and I looked forward to Sunday mornings out with my hardworking immigrant parents.  It wasn't their day off by any means, they didn't have one. It was their only morning off.   We always braved the hoards of people who had no concept of a line. Somehow we pushed our way through the crowd and got a table, sometimes right next to another strange immigrant family.  And we always got the same thing, wonton noodle soup, fish porridge, soy sauce chicken with rice. And it always tasted the same, never deviated one bit in taste, temperature or price. Always good, always hot and always cheap. They were so busy that it was like a continuously running chinese food machine, cranking it out, stamping it out.  They get you in as quickly as they shoo you out, laying down the check when they bring the food. We would be in and out in 20 minutes, sometimes 15. I love this place because the food is always good but mostly I love it because it gives me just a little feeling, once in a while, of being a kid again. Here's to you Big Wong.
