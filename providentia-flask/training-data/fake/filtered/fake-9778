I'm giving Goodfella's five stars, loved the place.  The decor is very trendy and upbeat, they have flat screen televisions throughout playing mob movies (no sound, subtitles).  The wait staff are friendly, knowledgeable and fun.  Are waiter gave us a few suggestions for dinner that were right on.  The owner (Franco) introduced himself, what a nice man he is.  The food is amazing.  Classic italian cusine, we (table of 8) were given the option of of a family style meal by our waiter. What a great idea started off with broccali rabe and sausage, calamari prepared both classic and New York style (spicy), grilled shrimp.  Then had house salads (vinergrette was tasty), followed by pasta in vodka sauce.  For my entre I had New York Srip with mushroom and onions.  Steak was tender and had lots of flavor.  For desert you have to try the cup cake and icecream.  The meal ends witha small glass of Sparkling wine.  What a meal!
