We purchased a Groupon and tried this restaurant for the first time.  The restaurant was packed, which surprised us at 7:30 on a Wednesday night.  In spite of this, we were seated quickly.  We started our meal with drinks and my mango mojito was delicious.  We had a hard time deciding which items to pick, so we decided on Tapas for better variety.  We ordered 4 different dishes and each one was better than the one before!  My personal pick is the tuna taco. The tacos were loaded with a very generous helping of sushi-grade tuna that was to die for!  The lobster quesedillas with guacamole were divine and the crisp crab cake was perfectly complimented by the bed of fresh baby greens with mango and bean salsa.  Lastly, we ordered the chorizo which was relatively mild and served in a delicious smoky sauce.  We'll definitely be coming back soon - and we'll be bringing our friends!!
