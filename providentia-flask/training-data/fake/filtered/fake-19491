Saw this place on "Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives" and decided to try the food while in Philadelphia, recently.  What a disappointment.  They had almost none of the menu items listed on their website -- only the pork sandwich, so we ordered that.  It was as if someone had just boiled the pork in water and then slapped it on a bun -- watery, no flavor, no sauce.  The water (not juice) soaked into the bun, making it soggy and it fell apart.  An order of crab cakes smelled rotten and had almost no lump crab meat - just odd-tasting mush.  It's a good thing this joint offers 100 different beers because you'd have to be drunk to eat the food.
