Fun lively little spot, forgot what I had but I think it was shrimp tacos. Food was decent. We went here for my best friend's birthday and had a good time. We made reservations and were seated immediately as we walked in. Colorful place for pictures and there is a photo booth which my group had fun with. Overpriced for the caliber of food but an enjoyable experience nonetheless. I don't regret going but I would be fine if I never went again. It was just OK.
