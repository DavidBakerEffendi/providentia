By far the best diner I have ever been too. The food here exceeds regular diner food! I have been here multiple times and always order something different and have yet to be disappointed. If you want a quality restaurant experience but don't want to spend a ton of money then this is the place to be. The background music is always great and adds to the positive experience. The staff is always friendly and the service is amazing. The "specials" menue is different every day and makes the picking easy. Perfect for breakfast, lunch, dinner and even a late night drink. Don't forget to try the seasonal pumpkin cheesecake, it is to dye for! I can't wait till my husband and I stop in for our next visit! :)
