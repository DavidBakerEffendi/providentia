Make sure to triple-check your slip if you're doing take out. My work likes this place, but they've screwed up pick-up orders twice (out of 5), and this morning I walked in and asked for a cheddar and bacon panini and when i got to work and opened it I had something else (that I couldn't eat), with no time or inclination to go back and get the right food, I get to go hungry this morning Never again, even if they are the only place close in the morning. if I'm gonna go hungry I'd prefer not to pay for an over-priced breakfast sandwich for the privilege.
