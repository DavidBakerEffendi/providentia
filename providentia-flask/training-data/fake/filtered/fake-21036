It's hard to know where to start with this fabulous Mediterrean restaurant.  I've been with my husband several times and we just can't believe that the quality of the food, service, and ambiance continues at such a high level.   we are both vegetarians and are so pleased that there are excellent choices for us on the menu.  The sunday brunch has a number of excellent choices and the dinner menu does as well.  I love the Mousaka - always creamy and flavorful and my husband is a goner for the Makaronia.     Last week we brought in meat eating friends and they couldn't stop swooning over the cornish game hen and other special -- some sort of wild game bird served on a bed of delicately seasoned rice.    The starters are exceptional -- especially the dips of the day.  Anything served with fresh vegetables is always terrific - I can't believe they don't have their own veggie garden right out back -- sooooo fresh and always prepared in a tasty and surprising way.   Our service has always been fun.  This isn't a stuffy and pretentious crew - you feel as though you are family making an overdue visit - the service is just that friendly and easy-going.  On each occasion we've visited, the chef has come out to talk to diners - a special treat that reaffirms the family feeling.    There are so many exceptional Philly restaurants that we feel a little guilty about going to the same one so often but with Kanella, we just can't help it!
