yummmyyyyy!!! The hostess is kinda rude, but everyone else is cool. The waitresses are awesome and really good at helping first timers pick a good meal. The YUCA FRIES ARE AMAZING! I tell everyone about them. The drinks are delicious, especially Yuca Kiss. If you're waiting for dinner, it's worth it. The music is really good too, and the atmosphere is fun because you end up talking to the ppl next to you. ENJOY!
