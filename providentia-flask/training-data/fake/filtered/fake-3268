Memphis Taproom, you're alright.  I like the restaurants that are run by these guys.  They also have Local 44, Strangelove's, and Resurrection.  No nonsense approach.  Great staff that are either high as a kite or just the friendliest people around.  The owner is a bit of a loud mouth, but grows on you by the third or fourth time.  I don't think he knows he is loud or maybe he just doesn't care, but he means well and that has to count for something.   Beer list is out of hand and changes almost weekly.  Pours are right on and priced to move.  Food is mostly good, but can suffer a tad when they get very busy, which is inevitable.  It would be easy to call this a diamond in the rough, but it would be a serious beer bar wherever it was.  Stop by on a Thursday afternoon and watch the whole bar torment the bartender who seems good enough, but just brings it on himself I suppose.
