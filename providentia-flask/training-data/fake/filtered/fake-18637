After the end of a delicious 7 course meal, we were completely satisfied with the flawless food , and perhaps a little drunk, but not overly stuffed.   We were, however, very surprised to find that the check at the end of the meal was twice as much as we'd expected. For the duration of the meal, we were treated suprisingly well, especially after we had ordered.  I reckon the service is always top knotch, but our waiter was especially friendly.  We realized why when we noticed that instead of the modest $70 bottle of wine we thought had ordered, what we had ordered was, in fact, a $300 bottle.  Oops. So, this means that Gramercy Tavern was a painfully expensive meal.  But the room felt warm, the service was perfect, and although it's an upscale and especially sophisticated restaurant, it did not feel stuffy. . . which made the check somewhat more palatable.   We'll definitely be back for a special occasion.
