Worst sushi I've ever had. As others mentioned this isn't your average sushi, this is sushi made by someone who would clearly identify as a "foodie." That said, the excessive ingredients proved detrimental to the sushi rather than making it better and more exciting. The sushi was hearty, wrapped in seemingly 2 types of rice and grain and all kinds of random stuff. I could barely get through one serving. Also, the menu is a tedious read, it's like a J. Peterman catalog, way too many pages and all the items have a silly little story attached to them. Just tell me whats in it! Super slow service. Would not eat here again. Yuck!
