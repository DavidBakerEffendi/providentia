I was around the neighborhood with a friend and we had just experienced some awful ramen noodles simmering in revolting broth at an over-hyped joint. Needless to say, we were desperately aching for a last minute palette cleanser. Now scrolling down, I can assume that I'm not the only one that's had the special. But if you would please excuse my redundancy- YES, THE RED WHITE AND BLUE IS AN ABSOLUTE MUST! Half a dozen blue points and a choice of pbr, house white or red all for $8. In this economy? Wine and oysters? For less than $10? How incredibly generous. Fish is my poor man's resort to booze and seafood. I've also visited here (when my bank wasn't as starving as I was) and indulged on a whole maine lobster accompanied with a side of creamed spinach. Boy oh boy was I satisfied. Â  I think the term 'quality seafood' has been masqueraded enough by plenty of restaurants in NYC, but with Fish I can come here every time with relief that their raw bar and dishes are fresh and OFF THE HOOK.
