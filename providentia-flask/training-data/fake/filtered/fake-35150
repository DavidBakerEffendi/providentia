Not sure why this place is getting any good reviews.  I ate lunch there yesterday and it was not a pleasant experience: 1. Pizza Margherita had no taste at all.  I knew something was in my mouth 'cause I was chewing, but there was just no taste.  Red Pepper flakes were necessary for me to even feel the food. 2. I hate to say "Bad food - Small portions" since that's an old Wood Allen joke, but that's what is here.  $12 for a "personal Pie" OK, $12 for an "Ah Pizz" pie no way.  I ate it in 2 minutes. 3. Delay in cooking/serving.  I came here for lunch since I read that they are quick.  But it took 20 minutes to start my pie (you get to watch) and another 5 to cook and serve it.  25 minutes to get served lunch...too long.   4. Bad service/atmosphere.  Hey waiter, how about showing & shaving, you're in the food business! Sorry but this is a "once and out" place for me.
