If you like clubs that pretend to be bars then the shannon rose is for you. It has big crowds so moving around or finding a spot at the bar is a pain. It has ear splitting music that makes any attempt at conversation with anyone almost impossible. It has meathead bouncers who relish the chance to tell you to take your hat off and drool with anticipation for a possible fight. It has absolutely no authentic irish qualities at all And finally it has INSANELY HIGH PRICES. 5$ bud light ..Check 12$ yagerbomb... Check I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Save your money and go to a real pub and enjoy a good conversation over a good drink.
