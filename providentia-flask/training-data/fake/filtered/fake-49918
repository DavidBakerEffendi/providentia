Went for a Comedy show. What a great time! Food was great, beer was good (even though I am not a big beer drinker) The comics were great. Â They had us laughing the whole time! Once the show was over we tried to decide where to get next. After deciding on a bar down the road we headed up stairs took one look at the back room and stayed all night. We played fooseball, darts, pool and had a great time. I wish i could give 6 stars. See you soon! = )
