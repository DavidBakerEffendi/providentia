Exceptionally rude "mixologist." Have not encountered him before - typically, the "slash" looking mixologist is the one who's helped me... and he is great! P.S. the Slash description came from someone at Weather Up, which is where we promptly took our business after the aforementioned rude mixologist became unbearable...
