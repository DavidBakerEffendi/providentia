We heard good things about A's, and tried it on a late July Sunday afternoon. Got a quiet table in the back and had an interesting conversation with the neighboring table (frequent visitors). Drinks were a little pricey, but quite good sized. Had the arugala salad, calamari and one order of veal Adriana for two seniors- almost too much food. It was all delicious and the wait staff was attentive and engaging. Overall, a very nice experience and one we look forward to repeating.
