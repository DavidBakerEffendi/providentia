I 1st walked into the Star Tavern in October 1972 and from the 1st bite I knew that I found something special and have been going back since. That was almost 37 years ago. Ive grown older and Star has matured into an Icon. Over the years Ive introduced my kids, grandchildren, family and friends to one of the Worlds best Pizza, and I can say that with authority since I am a World traveler. I no longer live in New Jersey but when I do fly into my old homeground(I grew up in Newark) one of the first things I do is go to The Star for pizza and I bring any family and friends available with me. I always manage to bring someone new and Â havent yet failed to make a convert. Like it says above, " As good as it gets!"
