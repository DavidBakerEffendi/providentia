Thanks to Group On/ LS deals, but for which I'd not have known this existed or I might pass on seeing the look and size from outside. It's a great find, probably the best in US so far and have already been there about 5 times in the past 3 months, and would keep going. Tasted food close to home...Pakka andhra spice and style in the southern category. North Indian food is great too and the best Tandoori Chicken...Juicy and Tender while perfectly flavored. We tried Lunch Buffets and A-la-carte menu ordering for dinner and both were excellent. They are open late for Lunch Buffet's, but go in the right time or the food could get stale. I was not aware of Dosa's in lunch buffet as some one mentioned, as we awere not offered any. Wife and Kids love this restaurant, and we have recommended them to a friend for a part catering. Friendly and Cordial service every time.
