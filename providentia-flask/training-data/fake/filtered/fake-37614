I live in Trenton and this is my favorite restaurant. It is a little pricey but it is so worth it. I've never had a bad meal here. Love the salad with the crumbled blue cheese and the nicolo sauce is to die for. If only I could replicate that recipe. This place is quaint and adorable. I'm pretty sure Enzo's daughter runs the place now and is there all the time. Just love it.
