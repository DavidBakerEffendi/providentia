My guy and I had a dinner date at the Brindle room a few weeks ago and I was pretty impressed.  We were going to try the red head but we decided to give the BR a try since it just opened.   We had the potted shrimp which was listed under the SPREAD section of the menu and it was probably my least favorite thing we ordered, despite the fact that it was indeed tasty.  It's not really a spead at all as much as it is whole shrimp in a garlicy broth.  It was kind of awkward to put on the toast slices that accompanied it. We had the salt roasted beets with preserved lemon and these were fantastic.  I think they had walnuts and blue cheese in them.   We had to have the baked oysters with caramelized leek.  These were amazing; crispy on the outside, warm and gooey on the inside, fun to slurp out of the shell, and creamy/garlicy.  I definitely let my boyfriend have the last one =) And finally we had the duck confit poutine.  This is the sole reason the Brindle Room gets 5 stars instead of 4.  They had TONS of duck on them, and were just the right amount of salty and cheesey.  I seriously wanted to lick the plate.  Please don't leave the Brindle Room without trying these. Also, worth it to mention that the place is wine and beer only.  Though they do serve a pretty mean cider.
