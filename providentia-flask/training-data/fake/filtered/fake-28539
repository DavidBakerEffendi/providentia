The pizza is good, and we have previously had it delivered or picked it up. This evening, we ordered sandwiches and salad. The sandwich order was incorrect, and we were overcharged by more than 5 dollars. My husband had to sit on the phone with whomever was managing the place to total up the math, plus delivery charge and tax (and they told us the delivery charge was taxed - is that even allowed?), and only then did he agree to take the $5.00 back off our card. The online menu is outdated, as well, which they will admit to, so if you order online or by phone, make sure you know real prices.
