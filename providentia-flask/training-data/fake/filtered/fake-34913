Ever talk to a fascinating, beautiful girl (or man) and feel blown away?  Then, as the heat wears off, you realize they weren't so brilliant but really nice to look at?  That's how I feel about this place.  Devils on Horseback - weird and awesome.  Artichoke Dip - good, real good.  Entrees?  Eh.  For the price and hype, I expected more.  Just okay.  The filet was not a great cut, potatoes were just warm, the whole thing had a feeling that the kitchen was too busy and not really paying attention.  A real ny scene for sure, and I'd go back no problem, plus think it makes a great destination for visitors.  Cool location in back of an alley also.  But the reviews had me thinking boule.  The dinner had me thinking good NYC eatery, bar scene, but not gourmet.
