I arrived here for brunch on the cuff with my girlfriend, Michelle.  We ride so we locked up across the street in near what appears to be a scooter exclusive business.  Anyway there were several cliques waiting to be seated and the host was doing his best to accommodate.  He said 45min, we were seated in 20.   I ordered the (deconstructed) corned beef hash.  It basically is the furthest thing from corned beef hash you should imagine.  It's a plate full of mini chunks of steak and potatoes and I think egg too in there somewhere.  I wasn't too happy with my cuts of minis but luckily my love shared her B.E.L.T. (which is FRIGGING phenomenal and why I gave NSFC 4 stars).   I'd def try dinner or lunch sometime.
