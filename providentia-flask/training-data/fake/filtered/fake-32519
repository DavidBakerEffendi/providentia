Pierre's Restaurant in the past was a good value due their early bird specials. The food and service was only fair, but priced right. We dined (if you can call it that) at the revamped restaurant this past weekend. They have put in place a new a la carte menu for weekends, which is overpriced for what you get.   Six of us thought the food was average or below and the service was terrible   Price is not a consideration when I dine out, but if I pay fine dining prices, I expect good food and exemplary service. We had neither. This rating is for the restaurant only; not the deli, bakery or catering operation
