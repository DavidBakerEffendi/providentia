Perfectly cooked shrimps and crayfish - check! Perfect seasoning (garlic butter with old bay) - check! Fresh oysters - you betcha! Oyster sliders crunchy on the outside, moist inside - check! Good beer selection - check! Bartender who knows how to make a good Sazerac & Old Fashioned - double check!! All in all, it's a great place to eat and chill.  My party of four spent more on drinks (that tells you they make good drinks) than food.  1lb of shrimp + 1lb of crayfish with 3 apps = good enough food for 4...plus 10 drinks...=) Definitely coming back for me...very soon!
