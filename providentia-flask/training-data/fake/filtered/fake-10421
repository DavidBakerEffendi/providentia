I have eaten lunch and dinner at Zinna's Bistro and the food was sensational. I also had Thanksgiving and Christmas dinner catered from here and it was the best. The food was fresh and hot. I had my rehearsal dinner with 40 people here in January and everyone was very pleased with our choice. The food was absolutely fabulous. There was a piano player on that night which just added the finishing touch. We didn't feel rushed and the dessert was outrageous. It is a BYOB which we brought ahead of time and they set it up very elegantly. The owners Chris and Dawn are the nicest people. They are very accommodating and pleasant. They are very hard working people that strive for perfection in their restaurant. I definitely recommend this place and look forward to eating there again.
