I don't know, is it me, have I been spoiled, I did not find this place to be as good as all the reviews, there is no atmosphere to speak of, it is a bar with a side dining room, the portions were small but the prices were high Did I tell you the part where they sliced up 2 small rolls for a party  of 4 ?? I think Luigis in Ocean City nj  has much better food, bigger portions and lower prices plus it has atmosphere
