I had a great time here. I don't get to the city often but I found a new place to hang out when I do. The bartender Henry was hilarious, although crass and offensive, but that's part of the charm. I've heard that the food is pretty good, so I tried a few bar items, and they were great. They have a full dinner menu, which looked very appetizing, but I wasn't hungry enough for a full meal.
