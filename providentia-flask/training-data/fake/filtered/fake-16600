It was kind of cold outside the evening we went to Thomas Sweet Cafe recently, so I wasn't especially in the mood for ice cream (very rare for me to turn down Thomas Sweet ice cream) ... and, since it was a bit on the late side I didn't want to have coffee either.  So I ultimately decided to try their hot chocolate.  Wow, was that a great choice!  It might be the best hot chocolate I've ever had!   I highly recommended it.  As an extra-added bonus tip, ask if James is around to make it for you!  I watched him meticulously mix the ingredients together and prepare the beverage... and the result clearly spoke for itself.  Yum!  Well done James...
