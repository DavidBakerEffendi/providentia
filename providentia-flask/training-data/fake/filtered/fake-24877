El cocotero it's an amazing place I'll definitely go again. We went there past Sunday, and the food was authentic and overall tasty, the menu has an incredible variety it was so hard for me to decide. Our waitress was extremely friendly and she patiently explained the menu and answered all the questions I asked her. I've never tried Venezuelan food before, but I'm scared it might become my favorite! specially for the warmness of the place, its convenient location and the amazing staff. I highly recommend the watermelon margaritas and the goat, I was directed that way and I'll do the same with anyone.
