I wanted to go to an Italian restaurant in NYC and ended up going to Trattoria Trecolori.  It was definitely worth it. First of all, the service was excellent--the servers were always friendly and seemed to know what I wanted even before I told them!  The food was very good as well.  I had Calamari for appetizer and veggie bowtie pasta for my main course.  Both were delicious and reasonably priced.  Next time I'm in New York, I'll definitely visit this restaurant again!
