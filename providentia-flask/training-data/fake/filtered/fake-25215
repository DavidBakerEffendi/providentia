This is primarily a requiem for the legendary cinnamon rolls that once drew me in regularly. Champs' original cinnamon rolls were huge, billowy, soft, yeasty, syrupy, and extremely addictive. Alas, those disappeared months ago. Champs' new cinnamon rolls are much drier, much smaller, and not at all habit-forming. I understand the original c. roll baker (mentioned by some reviewers below) moved on to other venues. The muffins seem less remarkable than they used to be too, but I admit I haven't tried them in a while. I stop in every so often to see if the old c. rolls have magically reappeared, but so far walk out empty handed every time. On the plus side, this is good for my waistline. Further, I acknowledge Champs also changed from a bakery into a buzzing, cheerful full-service vegan restaurant, with a devoted and appreciative clientele. It would be mean-spirited of me to give this well-liked place a low rating because of the disappearance of a single beloved baked good. I took off just one star. Enjoy your brunches, everyone.
