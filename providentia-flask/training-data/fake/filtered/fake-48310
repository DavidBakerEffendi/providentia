Although we had been warned that both Pat's and Geno's are strictly tourists spots and not the best representation of Philly cheesesteaks, one of our friends wanted to check out Geno's since we were passing through Philadelphia so off we went. The lines for both restaurants were long so they went for Geno's and we went to Pat's. sad to say we both had the same opinion.  Horrible!!! Pat's Steak was overcooked, dry and had absolutely no seasoning.  I tried provolone cheese which was slapped on the bun and never did melt.  The only additions you can get are mushrooms and onions.  No mayo, lettuce, tomato or lettuce.  So I guess those are not typical toppings for Philly cheesesteaks.  Ketchup and mustard and some ridiculously whole hot peppers are all that are offered.  And these condiments you apply yourself from an outdoor stand where cleanliness is absolutely not a priority(allI can I can say is "yuck"). So needless to say $10 for each tasteless sub is way too much. I bought an extra sub for my friend that went to Geno's so he could compare and his opinion was that they were equally gross.   I can say that they serve you very quickly.  Although maybe they should take a little extra time to put out a better and tasty product. Next time I'll listen to the locals and try THEIR recommended stops.
