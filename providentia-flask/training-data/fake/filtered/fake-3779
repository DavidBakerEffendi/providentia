This was my first time at this restaurant as I live in NY and I have to say I wish we had one of these in my city. The decor was fun and I liked the tall tables. We had a party of four and it was a packed house. We were all comfortable. The wait staff was nice and helpful. Our food was flavorful and delicious. I had the veggie burger and fries. The frilled were also great. The prices were decent. I'd recommend this place. Can't wait to go back.
