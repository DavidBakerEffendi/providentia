Is this the best pizza I ever tasted?  Probably not.  Is this top 3 - yes.  My wife and I visited this place on Saturday, walked across the Brooklyn bridge from Manhatten - pretty cool experience.  We got to this place around 3pm and the line was pretty long.  We waited for about an hour and fiteen minutes before seating.   The service was okay - pizza came out in about 15 minutes.  However, taste was pretty excellent - we went with the standard without additional toppings.  It just melts in your mouth.  It's your typical NYC style pizza.  If I were to order again, I'd get the extra basil and mozzerella cheese.   Will I ever go back?  Probably and most definitely if I knew I didn't have to wait that long.  Next time, we will order 2 pies and bring one back. The place is Cash only so make sure you have enough.  The large pie without toppings was $14.
