By far the best macaroons available in the USA, that summarizes pretty much the entire store. On top of that they also have the best decor of any pastry shop, well at least for people with refined taste... Laduree has always been one of my favorite to go places in Paris and I was thrilled when I heard they were opening a store in NY. Though worried at first the quality would be different for this part of the world, I was proven wrong and their pastries and macaroons are as good as in France. For the people who complain about the price, they neither have the taste buds nor the understanding of what Laduree is offering. It's like going to a 3 star Michelin restaurant and complaining about price, either you understand refined and complex or you don't... If you don't, do not complain about price!
