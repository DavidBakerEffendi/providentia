We've eaten at Mac Attack a few times and love the food. The smoked chicken mac is so delicious, savory and wonderful. I enjoyed the nutella grilled cheese. It was a novel twist and a nice sweet. I like that their kids meals come with healthy choices like apple slices and milk or natural juices. I also like the seating area. It's nice to have some comfy couches as well as regular tables and chairs. The staff is super friendly!
