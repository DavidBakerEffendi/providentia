Yum! I loved the atmosphere and decor here, very retro. Roast chicken entree was perfectly seasoned and very succulent. The cocktail I had was fun (a spicy margarita i think?). Apple crumble for desert was huge, far too much for 2 people and it really good. All in all great place for a relaxed dinner, I will be going back soon.
