Delivery is the best thing they ever did!! Everytime I order, it's as delicious as perfect as eating it right after it's cooked! My favorite is the veggie lasagna when its on special, stuffed peppers, brisket on Tuesdays and their italian chicken panini! Â If you want Italian food, their vodka sauce and eggplant rollantini is a must!!! And for dessert, their brownie sundae or chocolate cheesecake!
