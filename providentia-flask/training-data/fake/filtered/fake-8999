The only bad thing about freemans is that its not near where I live. I love every bartender there. They have great cocktails and not cocky about it like other cocktail lounges. Â Food is awesome and the surroundings are amazing. Stuffed animals everywhere. I would say go check this place out, but anyone who has not been here is not a real New Yorker.
