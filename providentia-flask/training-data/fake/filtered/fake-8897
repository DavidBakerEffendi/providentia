Recently stopped by to try out their lunch buffet and food is good! They constantly kept refilling the buffet station so it was never really empty. Vegetable lo mein is good. They have this chicken covered in reddish-orange sauce which is my favorite, i think it was general tso chicken or something like it. And i just love the cheese wontons and mini bread rolls covered in sugar! i will definitely go back again or just order online from their website.
