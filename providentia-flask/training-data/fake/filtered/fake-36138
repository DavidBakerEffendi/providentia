My wife and I had a great meal here last night. Blue Cat is a really nice addition to the neighborhood. The Papas Rellenas were awesome.  I also enjoyed the Green Chile Con Posole and the Arroz Con Pollo & Chorizo. The shrimp and chorizo was just OK- though the shrimp were cooked well and accompanying veggies/water melon added a nice flavor. The banana cake (with cream cheese icing) was killer! This place reminds you of visiting a friend who can really cook!.The service was attentive and pleasant. Our only area for improvement is to space out appetizers and entrees a little. The meal felt very rushed   - maybe because it was a Sat night - but this is something that should get better as the kinks are worked out. The price was very reasonable.
