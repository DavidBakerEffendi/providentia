Was there last night with friends and it was ... just perfect..  smooth sailing! Relaxing atmosphere, easygoing music, great ambiance, excellent service, ridiculously good food, wines and cocktails.. Yes, we had a little bit of everything  and ... well, a taste worth more than a thousand words.. Vegetarians, pescetarians, meat eaters, wine lovers, manhattan fans (those bartenders and their secret ingredients), all was happy.. What else can you wish for? View on Empire State Building at night, priceless.. Overall, Porteño see you soon..
