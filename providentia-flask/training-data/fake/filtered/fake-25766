I read the other reviews and thought I would give this place a try.  When I arrived, there was a HUGE parking lot and only two other cars (strike 1).  Inside, I was the only customer and this was around 6:30PM (strike 2).  I asked one of the guys where everyone was and he said that it had been like that for the last couple of nights...  If they weren't making rolls for me, they were just standing there watching basketball.  The sushi was less than impressive.  I think that a lot of people are "sushi snobs" but this place was certainly below average, even for the average sushi guru, even for the price.  The rolls were chewy and the service was poor / strange (strike 3).  I was at You and I Sushi in LA a few weeks ago, same price for AYCA but so much better food and environment.
