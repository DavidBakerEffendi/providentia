So, for my first visit to blend on the water i must say I'm not easily impressed... but its kind of hard not to be in this atmosphere! I arrived during brunch which i wasn't expecting but it was cool nonetheless. The hostess sat my family and i down upon arrival, we got a nice window seat, with an amazing view! Our server (felicia) was there to greet us with a bubbly greeting, she informed us of the soup of the day which was a delicious sweet potato creamy soup my mother enjoyed.... for apps we tried the arepas which were a hit; even wanted to order some to-go but ended up too full to even try... the steak and eggs were delicious, i was a little upset they removed the red velvet waffles and switched them for mediocre buttermilk... i didn't even bother to try them. however the steak an eggs were a great substitute. Our server kept the laughs going, which my parents loved... its been a while since we went out and still felt at home.. i would have liked to see a better dessert menu though... & when the bill arrived decently priced, that was just the cherry on top! Million dollar service at blend on the water, id recommend it to everybody! kudos guys! Ill be back!
