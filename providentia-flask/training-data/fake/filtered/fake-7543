Way too much on the Menu and seriously lacking detail and thus quality. So many wastes of time from an operational standpoint. Beer selection is large but full of awful beer . Great decor but this place is doomed unless they train their managers, cooks (there aren't any Chefs) in the ways of modern Restaurant issues. Who needs two huge napkins at lunch.... Double the laundry bill. Â Loafs of things wrong... Short and sweet menu with fresher ingredients and an overhaul of the actual fatty stodgy menu items is the only thing that will save this place from certain doom..
