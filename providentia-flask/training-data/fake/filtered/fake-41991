Looooovee this place.There's only a few Thai restaurants that i can say had "soul". meaning, its not just spicy chinese food with mediocre service.The food is excellent, i can't pick a favorite because everytime i go there i try something new and its a hit every time. But i love their salads, curries are always a hit, and the whole fish with mango salad is a must try. Service is excellent, its very personal and they are always so accommodating. Â The place is decorated with beautiful thai art and paintings and candles. its cozy and warm, i love dining here...its a favorite of mine when i'm in Montclair.
