My boyfriend and I decided to try out Sanford's after having noticed that it is a popular brunch spot as it seemed busy with lots of customers. The food was pleasing, our waitress and runner were on top of their service. However, a cloud loomed over our heads as our entire brunch was ruined by the rude hostess. She was unprofessional with her inappropriate remarks that were unnecessary. The hostess was disorganized in the way she handles seating.
