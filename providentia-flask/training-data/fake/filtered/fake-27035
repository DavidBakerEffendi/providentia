I love this place! Food is excellent and they have a great beer selection.  I'd give the place five stars except for one thing that bothers me every time I'm there....  What is with Michael (if that's the host or manager)?  Seriously though, he hangs out at the bar with his laptop and chess game. He sits, drinks, surfs and jumps up every time a customer comes in. The seats at the bar are scarce enough without having a staff member sucking up two of them.  The last time I was there I stood so that my date could sit at the bar and Michael was oblivious to the fact that I was standing because he was taking up a paying customers seat. Just saying.... Other than that, I love the place!!
