The spaghetti alla carbonara is ok. I advise all to avoid the Maccheroncini; it is very salty. You can probably manage to eat your way through if your waiter keeps you well supplied with water, but otherwise it is near unbearable. The service is great at least when I was there with family. Great atmosphere and great wine list for the location. The wine list offered half bottles in addition to whole bottles. It was nice to have that option so we could have wine with dinner but not be tied down to a full bottle.
