Don't waste your time here I walked in and was waiting to be seated but all the waitresses were on their cell phones. So I ordered from the front and stood there. It was very awkward so I sat in the " dining area" but was never asked if I wanted my order to go or to eat there. They just handed me my pizza in a box and when I returned to the table to eat it, the waitress came over with an attitude and told me to leave. Here's a tip Santucci's, if a customer pays, they stay, even if they change their mind for take out to eat in. You show a little customer service and accommodate them. They charge you for every topping you order, even cheese and don't Â offer anything original for pizza. They actual offer very little pizza selection at all. The sauce was bland, straight out of the commercial can and it made the pizza soggy. I'm a buffalo girl, I know my pizza pretty well and this place was terrible. DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY
