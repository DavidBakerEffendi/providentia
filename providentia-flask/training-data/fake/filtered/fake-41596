Extremely BAD service.  We called ahead of time to make a reservation and order our tapas.  We arrived and waited forever to just get a menu and drinks.  Waiters were around and did not care for us. Manager should be fired, instead of taking care of customers wellbeing he just walked around smiling.and doing nothing.   We will never come back
