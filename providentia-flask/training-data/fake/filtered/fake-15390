I absolutely love this restaurant! My boyfriend and I have been coming for years and we maintain that it's the best restaurant in Williamsburg by far. The steaks are spectacular and our server Gemma whom we've had as our favorite server here for years, told us that all of the beef used is organic, free range and grass fed which is why it is so flippin good! The wine section is expansive with many malbecs as one would expect from an Argentinian restaurant and the desserts with Dulce de Leche are to die for. I've been seeing many negative reviews and I'm so confused as to why! We have never had anything but a pleasant experience, though I've overheard gripes from other tables who are obviously from Manhattan and seem to be what I would imagine is every server's nightmare. We have been here on the weekends in the past and I will admit, it gets crazy in there, so my advice would be to get there early or go during the week which is still busy but definitely less so. And to people complaining about the craziness, there's a reason that place is packed tight friday through sunday--THE EXPERIENCE IS THAT GOOD!!!
