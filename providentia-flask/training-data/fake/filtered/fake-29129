I ate at this restaurant and the food was fantastic. But then I had the shrimp. There was veins and the droppings were still in the shrimp!! I told the waiter to take it back to clean the shrimp. He said, ' we don't clean the shrimp here.' I was dumbfounded and disgusted. The rest of the food was delicious, but when I ate that shrimp, it just killed my appetite.
