I took my family out for dinner at Marsilio's Kitchen this weekend, upon the insistence  of a family friend who had been there for a recent private party.  We were greeted by a smiling hostess and inviting atmosphere. Decor is modern but very warm, hints of Italy throughout and they even have a rustic 'farm table' which could easily seat 10.  Our server Sharon tempted us with the specials of the evening, and was very nice and attentive throughout the meal.  We started with their eggplant rollatini appetizer, which was superb. The marinara is great here. All the entrees came with a house salad which was perfectly fresh and simple, lightly dressed with honey &balsamic. Entrees were piping hot when they came out.  My crabcakes, which were fantastic,  full of crabmeat served over a slaw in a light lemon sauce, were accompanied well by a side of rosemary potato fries. My wife loved their signature chicken cacciatore, and my mother said she was coming back next week to have more braised beef.  Even though we were stuffed, we couldn't pass up an espresso and their 'can't decide' dessert trio, including velvety house-made tiramisu. Prices were good for the food quality and portions were nice.  Overall, we had a great experience.  The whole staff seemed in good spirits and you could tell they enjoy working together. I will definitely have to try one of their specials next time I visit, which will be soon.
