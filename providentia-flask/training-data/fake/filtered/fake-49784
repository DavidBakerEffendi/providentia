This place was recommended by our friends when we just moved in the area. My wife and I are foodies. The price is pretty reasonable. Like other places we go to, SERVICE determines EVERYTHING from ambiance to taste! Last week was our first time to The Peacock Inn - and that was the LAST! Our first impression was beyond terrible! I was called a day before our reservation to confirm - a bit unprofessional as she was talking to another person when I answered the call. But we continued to confirm the reservation and I answered her question that this was to celebrate my wedding anniversary.The evening of the reservation I was excited to surprise my wife as I have never told her we were going to this place. We were late having to wait for our babysitter to arrive. At 15 minutes past our reservation time of 6:15pm I received a call and the lady at the receptionist told me she will put me at the bar for the evening. That was because I had missed the clock - her excuse was so they wouldn't have to rush me out since the table I reserved would also be used for another guests at 8:30. I arrived at the reservation desk at exactly 6:45, I knew the same person was the one who called me - did not greet us, did not look at us, did not say a word! There was a hostess there who then greeted and escorted us to our table. While she marked our table on paper. Again...no greeting, not even a smile! At that point the whole evening was shot! Food was OK, the drink/beer I wanted wasn't available. Our waitress however was nice. The next day I received an email from OpenTable indicating that I never came. Well, I guess this receptionist never updated the reservation. One star for the whole experience. If not because of the server and the valet guy, this would have been NO star! I told a few friends of mine who are more experience "foodies" in South Jersey and Philly not to bother coming to The Peacock Inn.
