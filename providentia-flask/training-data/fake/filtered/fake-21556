Just read in Matt U's review that Claire's now has CCTVs trained on its staff. Seriously? Wow -- knew Claire was a control freak but didn't realize it had gone this far.  Isn't that illegal? A friend worked for Claire's in about 15 years ago and told me about the low wages, bad conditions, and -- shockingly -- about having to pay for his own food, but still -- CCTVs??!?!? WTF is that all about! On the food side -- soups and bread are yummy, pastries tasteless, and Mexican food pathetic, a true insult to fine Mex establishments like Viva Zapata.  I lived in NH briefly in the mid-90s and went to Claire's a few times, and wasn't too impressed.
