Every time I've come out to Fuji, I have had a top-of-the-class experience. Besides the excellent food, their service is always prompt and very polite. They are very professional. I recommend their party trays if you're going in a group of 3 or more. Their Miso soup is always on the mark. There's a great drink list to go along. You can't go wrong w/Fuji. It's undoubtedly one of the best Japanese restaurants in Philly.
