I had recently come back from a trip to Hong Kong and was dying for Ramen.  It was after 1:00 on a weekday and there was a line.  I was in the city visiting a friend and had a suitcase, no problem, they stored it for me.  It's quicker to get in if you agree to share a table, no problem.  I had my hand in a splint and couldn't use chopsticks, no problem getting a fork.   I was ready to be disappointed in the Ramen after Hong Kong but it was delicious.  Mine cost a little more because I added egg and avocado but it was worth it.  I ordered spicy and it was just perfect.
