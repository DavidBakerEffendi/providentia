MY GOD these are delicious. So flavorful and full of bite and spice! I highly recommend the unda aloo roll (potato and egg), the smell alone will make your mouth water. You can request extra chutney or to make yours extra spicy, but I prefer them regular. They can be a little pricey if you plan on buying multiple rolls, but they are most definitely worth it. Kati rolls are so amazing and surprisingly filling (you always think two won't be enough but they stuff you up), and have them with a cold soda and you've got the perfect lunch. It's literally an Indian burrito from heaven, it's a must try!
