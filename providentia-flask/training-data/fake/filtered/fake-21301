I was visiting a friend in West Village. My friend suggested dinner at Market Table. It turns out to be a wonderful dining experience. The waitress was attentive, the ambiance was nice, it wasn't too loud and the food was delicious. It was pricey, but at least the portions were large. We started with the roasted beet appetizer (it had the most delicious goat cheese fritters). My friend had the lamb shank and I had the pan crisped chicken - both were divine. For dessert we had the pear/cranberry crumble with marscapone ice cream... it was piping hot from the oven and delicious.
