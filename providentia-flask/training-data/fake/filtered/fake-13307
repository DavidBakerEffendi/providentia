As someone who isnt a big meat eater, I found so many delish options at Maharlika to enjoy and didnt miss a beat! The Puqui Puqui is amazing - I selfishly decided that the leftovers were mine to take home and devour the next day. The Long beans were crisp and tasty, the eggplant and bok choy were heaven to my tastebuds. All these dishes are vegan - including the Garlic Fried Rice which I still crave. Â I had a bite of the tiger prawns in coconut sauce and I wish I had my own order of that dish. All in all, I can't wait to go back, and get more puqi puqui! The bartender was so nice and the owner made me a non alcoholic guava beverage with a cardamon syrup - do u hear the ahhhhh's of the angels?? I do!!!
