Went for lunch, which was inexpensive (9.95 for soup, salad or app, and entree) but not very good.  Both Tom Yum Gai and Tom Kha Gai were fine, although as usual the chicken was a little dry and overcooked.  I really liked the spring roll, light and peppery, and I think my companion liked his salad.  However, the entrees were pretty darn bad.  The beef in the red curry tasted distinctly sour and old, and the egg noodles in the bah mee moo dang looked as though they had been shaped the day before and left out to dry.  They were totally tangled and impossible to manipulate around a fork.  There was no sauce or flavor to the dish overall, except the pork was moist and tasty.  Service was pleasant but pretty lacking in actual skills despite a half empty room.  We had to ask for the check three times, and nobody inquired how we were doing during the meal (or commented on the meat piled on the side of the plate).
