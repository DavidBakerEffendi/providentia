I've been here a few times in the past where I have had their steaks which were good, but as previously stated are not the best to be had in the city or Lugers. However I went in the other night, wife out of town and just sat down at a table by the bar and ordered an Old Speckled Hen and the the Black Label Burger with a glass of red. Having heard that the burger is quite filling I opted out of any appetizer. Well I must say that the burger was indeed excellent. I will not go into the ingredients, preparation etc...suffice it to say that it is worth the price and should be tried by any meat or burger lover. The fries were good however their prep at Balthazar for fries is better and I don't know why this would be...still good. Next time I would order an appetizer as I actually thought the burger was kind of on the small side, could have eaten at least another half and I am not a big eater, or maybe it just was THAT good. After my dining neighbor from Germany finished his two appetizers, he just had to order one as well and concurred that it was the best burger he ever had as well. Finished with a cappuccino. The restaurant is a bit claustrophobic. Little Stevie loves it and says hello.
