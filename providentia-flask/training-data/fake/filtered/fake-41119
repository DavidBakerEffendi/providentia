Can't say much about their food, did not get to try it. Very rude staff. My parents and I landed up there around 4pm on a weekday and it was not busy. By the way, it's Â compulsory for every person to order a dish. Since my dad was not very hungry and did not want to eat then, they asked my father to leave and wait outside till my mother and I ate. How rude is that! We just cancelled all our order and left. Ippudo is way better!!
