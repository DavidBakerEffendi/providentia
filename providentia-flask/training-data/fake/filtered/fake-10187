Pros: The menu is large and affordable. The food comes out relatively quick (appetizers are out in a flash). The portions are hearty! They serve booze! And milkshakes. And most of the apps are delicious! You'll be stuffed before the meal even comes. Their claim to fame is the pizza and there are a ton of great varieties. Cons: The decor is very college oriented. I don't blame them; they're right in the heart of Yale University. The walls are lined with Ivy League themed knick knacks. As a result, it's not the place to have a stately, quiet conversation. Lots of big groups of Yalies. The pizza falls on the greasy side, so you're going to have to hit up the fork and knife.
