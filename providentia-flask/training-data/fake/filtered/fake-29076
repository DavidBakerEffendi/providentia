Found this place a couple months ago and it's my go-to for when I'm around Union Square and hungry. Delicious! I have never experienced the pulled pork to be dry (although I hear other folks have), and the brisket was, frankly, overwhelming in its abundance. YUM! Sandwiches have a great balance of flavor, heat, spice, crunch, and overall zest.
