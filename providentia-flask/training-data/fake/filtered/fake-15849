My favorite dessert is hands down Red Velvet cake, and to this day the best RVC I've had is in the famous Junior's bakery. The slices are dense, gigantic, and worth every cent and second it takes to indulge. Each visit to NYC HAS to be topped with a visit to their bakery as well! I would definitely recommend visiting at least the bakery to any tourist looking for something sweet and symbolic of NYC.
