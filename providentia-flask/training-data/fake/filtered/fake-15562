I was at montville pizza tonight and the food was bland and cold. The person behind the counter was rude and even cursed out a girl who clearly ordered a slice Â but even though he sold slices, he made her a whole pie and the threw it in the garbage and cursed her out when she said that she only ordered a slice. I had clearly heard her and she was correct but he cursed her out and kicked her out too. When i told him he was wrong and very rude to her, he said he was the owner and that i could get the *%#%* out too. I live in Montville and will never go there again! You are better off going to Joe's up the street which has much better food than some bastard at montville pizza that makes lousy food and makes a girl cry and threatens her.
