I have found Abner's to be an unexpected cheesesteak jewel. From the outside, it looks like just another restaurant that serves ok but not great junky food to university students. However, they make one of the best cheesesteaks that I have had to date. The place has got a classic vibe to it, and I found the service to be quite friendly. When I ordered my steak, they cooked the steak right then and there, resulting in a fresh, steaming hot product. The ratios of the meat, cheese, and bread are all satisfying, and the price is great. At the moment, Abner's is my go-to place for a delicious cheesesteak, and I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a delicious cheesesteak at a reasonable price.
