My favorite lunch spot! Super cheap ($8!) and every item is amazing. I always opt for the pork noodle bowl, but my friends are more into the pho, and they swear by it. The summer rolls are also great. Don't be intimidated by the long lunch lines. They usually go pretty quickly and even if they don't, the food is worth the wait.
