Growing up in Brooklyn and Staten Island, I've had some awesome pizza throughout my life so I was pretty stoked to finally go out of my way and try this holy being that is the Sicilian pie at this place...My party and I got there and was greeted by a snooty older hostess that sat us. Ok....we go on to order some broccoli in oil and garlic, calamari and of course the pie. First, the broccoli was simply amazing, extraordinary to be exact..not oily, perfect amount of garlic and the broccoli had a nice crunch. Next, the calamari was decent at best. Light and airy but too chewy for my liking...Finally, after waiting what seemed like forever, the pizza! We ordered half sausage, half extra cheese. Their sausage is great, thinly sliced, very flavorful. The pizza on the other hand was SUCH a let down. It was over powered with so much romano cheese that it made the slice just wayyyy too sweet! I'm not a fan of sugary sauces/pizza although some really enjoy it. I will say the Spumoni is out of this world though! To make a long story short, not impressed at all in regard to the sicilian. Spumoni and broccoli off the charts and the service could use a ton of improvement. It pains me to see how many people obsess over this place because there are sooo many more local joints throughout the city that deserve so much more credit than this place. I just think the publicity this place gets forces people to love it but this native New Yorker ain't buying it!
