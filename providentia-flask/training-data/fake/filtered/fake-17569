this place was very very unpleasant. besides the fact that we felt like they were kicking us out tthe entire time we were there, the waitresses were rude. they would just forget to give us utensils. and the overpriced food didnt taste good at all. i was considering giving it a 2 but i changed my mind when i got FOOD POISONING. ugh. rude rude rude and then they serve me bad eggs. will definitely not return.
