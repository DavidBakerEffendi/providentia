I used to live near Chinatown in NYC. Now, I live nearby this restaurant, so I went to eat Dim Sum in there often. It's amazing that we have a Cantonese restaurant in NJ that serves better food than most of the Cantonese restaurants I could find in NY Chinatown. The price of Dim Sum is normal for Dim Sum restaurants in NJ, but it is not certainly as cheap as some Chinatown restaurants. This restaurant is getting crowded and crowded. I had the Chinese New Year dinner there, and starting to see them making service mistakes and food quality getting lower. It's forgivable on such a busy day, but I hope they can keep up with quality.
