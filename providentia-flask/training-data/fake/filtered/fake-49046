Made reservations for 8 oclock. Place was completely packed, everyone waited over an hour before being seated at the hibachi table. When we finally sat down at the hibachi table, it was another 45 minutes to get a hibachi chef. We didn't eat until 10 oclock. Food was moderate - nothing great. Appetizer dumplings were clearly frozen. Nothing was offered for the extra wait - in fact, the manager could care less that all of his patrons were disgruntled due to the long wait. Decor is nice, but I would never recommend anyone going there.
