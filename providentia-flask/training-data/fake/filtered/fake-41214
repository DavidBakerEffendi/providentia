It's a little ways away from the heart of time square. I was three people so it took longer then most to get a seat, but it was well worth the wait. The most amazing bowl of soup I have ever tasted. I had the spicy ramen and I am a soup de jour chef as a profession and I haven't made a soup that satisfies as this did and many flavor points. I am definitely going to try and replicate this on my own.
