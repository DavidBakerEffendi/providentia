Confessing that, as a native Californian, I am anything but a cheesesteak aficionado - as in, I had never had one before (even the Jack-in-the-Box knock-offs, heaven forbid)--i had it stuck in my head that I must, simply must, have a real Philly cheesesteak since I happened to be in Pennsylvania for some business for almost a week.  Seriously the whole flight over from the West Coast all I could think about was getting a cheesesteak.  I was seriously obsessing. Anyway, meandering around in my rental in South Philly, a wonderfully traumatic experience in itself - I expected Rocky Balboa to emerge from around the corner - I was intent on going to Jim's Steaks since the online reviews I had read were most complementary, I never made it that far.  As it happened that evening East Passyunk Ave was blocked off a bit north of Geno's and Pat's.  I said to heck with it, turned around (quite a feat in that neighborhood), barely found a parking spot at 9pm on a Sunday evening and indulged in my first Philly Cheesesteak ever at Pat's. I got a cheese wit out and American.   It was, to exaggerate only slightly, a religious experience.  The taste of the cheesesteak is fabulous and the bread was soft, slightly toasted.  In short - I loved it.  My only mis-steak, so to speak, was not ordering two as frankly after a long flight and days of yearning for cheesesteak one was really not enough.  Or at least an "extra cheesesteak" with the extra load of meat might have been enough. The line truly is fast, fast, fast - it just whips.  Seriously, in seconds you have your cheeseteak - it's that quick.  As for those asking if they take charge cards, I don't believe they do, probably mainly to keep the line moving.  I didn't see any Visa/MC/AMEX signs around so I went to an ATM just across the street.   Overall, a great eat, worth the experience of going to South Philly and eating the genuine article.
