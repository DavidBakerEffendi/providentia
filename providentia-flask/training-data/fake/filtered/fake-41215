We're visitors from the Left Coast and complete foodies! Found out about Totto Ramen on Yelp. Read the WSJ and NYT reviews so we had to try it. Arrived about 9:30 pm on Monday night. About a dozen people waiting ahead of us. Despite the light rain falling, our party of four decided to sign-in on the clipboard and wait. About an hour later, we got in. It's a very small place. About room for 20. Two tables for 4, 1 table for two, and about 10 stools at the counter. Initially, we split up. Two at the counter, two at a table. Then two adjacent seats opened up at the counter. Asked the waitress if we could all sit together. She was cool, very accomodating. Our wait was deliciously rewarded. Our party ordered 2 spicy ramens, 1 miso ramen, and 1 mega-ramen. Bowls came out steaming hot and as far as a simple bowl of noodles are concerned, visually appealing. Absolutely delicious. Rich, savory broth, noodles al dente with just enough "teeth." Char siu pieces with just the right balance of fat to lean. Scallions just mild enough, not too much "bite." Adds to the play on textures. Miso color and taste just right. Spicy ramen had just enough heat without overpowering the noodles and broth. Mega-ramen had a little too much garlic. Liked that we "porked it up" Â though. Still, earns 5 stars. If you have the time and don't mind the wait, you'll be rewarded. If you're starving, you can go to Lucky Burger next door and nosh on an order of fries. Just save your appetite. It'll be worth it.
