My family LOVES this place. Counter people are always nice when I order. I usually have the food delivered. My kids cant get enough of the food. I myself love the mudslide fries and cheesesteak. My kids love the Taylor ham sandwich. Â Weve tried lots on the menu and the food is always delivered in good time and the food is hot. No complaints. Prices are right on. Very clean establishment. I highly recommend ordering from here. You will not be dissappointed!
