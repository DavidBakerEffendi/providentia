I first came there and it was really modern.  The price ranges are very moderate and reasonable.  The service was great.  The bathroom looked cool.  The chairs and menus radiate fancy delight.  The sushi tasted very different from sushi from a buffet!   There was this different and distinguishing taste that was very yummy.
