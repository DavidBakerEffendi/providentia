My oh my ! After dining with blend on the water, I just had to go out of my way to get a yelp and let the world know what they have been missing ! FIRST AND FOR MOST, the time and effort this place puts in to making your stay memorable is beyond me.... It was my birthday, and they made a special birthday card just for me! Not only that, the food is scrumptious ! So much so I had to tell my server Felicia (whom had awesome recommendations) to give my compliments to the chef! And before departure I got the chance to personally thank Chef Nelson for my meal as he came out to thank me for dining with this fine establishment ! We had the arepas and the corn to start, truly one of a kind appetizers to say the least! We also had the red snapper which was phenomenal! The salmon burger exceeded my expectations for a burger! Truly blew me away with the chicken fried rice ! I'm a big fan of spicy and it had a delicious and perfectly spiced jalapeño sauce to compliment the dish ! As if that wasn't enough, we had dessert despite how stuffed we were-- the dessert platter is out of this world ! Not only that, they got the whole staff to song happy birthday which made me a little teary eyed as I never really celebrated my birthday in the past. It was truly a magical evening! I can't wait to come back... THANK YOU FELICIA AND THE REST OF THE STAFF AT BLEND ON THE WATER FOR THE IMPECCABLE AND VERY ATTENTIVE SERVICE ! You filled my night with laughter and joy and my family and I really appreciate the energy !   Ps. Please get a frozen piña colada soon !! :)  I love the happy hour special, but the blender at blend is a must ! ;)
