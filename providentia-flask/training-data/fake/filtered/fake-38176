Although that food is great, the service is HORRIBLE. Today i ordered a the grilled chicken Cesar salad when my delivery came, turned out to be a hoagie. When i called i didn't get any apology but the girl who answered stated my salad was free and that they was going to fix it. Who wouldn't want a free salad but i still was to upset accept the offer. the "manager" eventually got on the phone and tired to argue with me saying things like "we've been here 30 years, what do you like we're going to do to with your salad".....like excuse!? who does she think she is, that was so unprofessional. I just kindly hung up her. 5 min later i received call form the delivery guy stating that he was here with my order, when i got there my order was NOT free as promised but $5 ore than want my order was on the menu. OH REALLY THEY ARE NOT GETTING ANY OF MY BUSINESS!!!!!!!!! Signed, A very hungry lady who still didnt have any lunch today!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
