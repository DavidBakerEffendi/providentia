OK so I was in the Cafeteria Friday night and despite the rainy weather it was packed! Some of the more brave people huddled under the awnings in the outside seating and ate. I decided to take my food to go, Chicken and Waffle. I could smell the aroma of the food thru the containers and Cafeteria bag as I walked up 7th ave. to 34th st. About half way to 34th st. I couldn't take it anymore!! I think I was on the corner of 28th and 7th, with two bags in one hand and umbrella in the other, I tore into that chicken!! LOL...OMG it was soooo freaking good; finger licking good. Nicely seasoned & tender and the Waffle was mmm mmmm good. I think I've found a new after work spot for dinner. MMmmmm!
