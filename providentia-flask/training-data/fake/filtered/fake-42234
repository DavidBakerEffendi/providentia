This is what eating is all about. The menu is interesting and absolutely delicious. The seared foie gras with maple and fingerlings is somwhow familiar but like nothing you've ever had. My fiance and I were told the menu changes daily, which we find to be a good thing. The food is always fresh and seasonal, even if favorites go away. When the food is this good, you're forced out of your confort zone to try new and exciting dishes, and Traif has many. The staff was friendly and helpful. We sat in traffic to get there and missed our reservation, but they took good care of us and made the agrivation disappear. The only knock is that the place is small. The counter bar is not a bad spot to eat, but there is no place to have a drink while you wait for your table. But wait. It's well worthit!
