Absolutely awful. Given the paucity of good steakhouses in N NJ, we have relied on Strip House often, despite marginal service and food. After tonight however, we will not return. Portions are invariably meager and exorbitant, and the quality mediocre. $15 for a wedge salad with 1/16 of a head of lettuce started the debacle (and I should add that we are NYC steakhouse connoisseurs who do not typically balk at the prices at places like Wolfgang's or Porterhouse due to the superb quality). Sides were also crazy small. Shrimp was still slightly frozen. A small $50 ribeye appeared which was tepid and overcooked. The manager (the smarmy bald guy if you are interested) finally attuned himself to the fact that we were unhappy, but rather than try to acknowledge the disparity between quality/quantity and price, he proceeded to challenge us and was over-the-top obnoxious and out of line. Incensed, I lost my appetite for the sizeable remainder of what was left, and asked for the check so we could leave. Never, ever, again....and they just lost a regular, good customer.
