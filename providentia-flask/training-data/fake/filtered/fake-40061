Such a wonderful place from top to bottom....  The food is cooked to perfection.  I'll admit that I've never tasted Moroccan food before, but it's really delicious and combined with the decor,  I truly felt transported across the sea to the actual city.  I've been there twice now and both times were excellent.  I've had the cucumber salad, beet salad, house salad, eggplant salad, green bean salad, couscous and the chicken and olive tagine twice because it's just so good...   The staff members are SO down to earth and friendly and that just adds to the overall wonderful experience you get when you're there.  The second time I went, my friends were taking me out for my birthday and the waitress started playing a bunch of birthday songs overhead and they brought me delicious little Moroccan pastries for the table...  They are lovely people doing a lovely job.  I just moved here from Manhattan and I guess I'm a little spoiled because I feel like the restaurant scene in Bay Ridge is really nothing to write home about -  until I came to Casablanca.
