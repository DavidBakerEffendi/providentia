Delicious, reasonably priced and really sweet staff. I've been for dinner and brunch, and both are great. The brunch is especially good with the all-you-can-drink deal, but dinner is great for yummy homemade pasta and a warm atmosphere. It kind of feels like a hidden gem--rarely super crowded, although brunch can be a little more popular.
