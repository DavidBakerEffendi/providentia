I came here for lunch this past Saturday when I was visiting New Haven. I love soul food and rarely get a chance to eat it much. The restaurant was cozy and lounge-y inside...good vibe, and a modern style. The service was excellent, very friendly, prompt. Everything on the menu looked good to me. I wound up ordering fried chicken with a side of potato salad and fried okra. Order came with cornbread. Fried okra was perfect, and they'll fry it to order. I got mine crispy. Fried chicken was juicy inside and nice and crispy on the outside. Peppery...gave it a nice zing, but not too overpowering. Cornbread was moist and buttery. The portions are very generous. Desserts looked good, but I was way too full. Prices seemed reasonable, coming from a Boston point of view. I would definitely come here again. Also, parking was easy, and there is a huge, organic supermarket across the street.
