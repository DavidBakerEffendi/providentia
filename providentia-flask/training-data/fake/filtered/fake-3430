We had a 30th birthday party for my wife here this past weekend and we couldn't have been happier with it.  Everything from the planning to the decor to the staff to the food and drinks was outstanding.  Edit, the lady I dealt with, was amazing.  From my first encounter with her till the very end of the party, she was attentive, caring and on top of every aspect possible.  She really made the party very easy to plan.  All the staff there were amazing.  The birthday girl had a full drink in her hand at all times.  Actually almost every guest had a full drink at all times.  The staff there made sure of it. The decor and setup of the party was amazing as well.  Almost every person at the party asked me how I found this place because they loved it.  We had a group of approx. 40 people and the space in the back was perfect.  It was a specific area set aside for our party.  It was comfortable and nice.   The food we ordered was very good as well.  Everyone had plenty to eat and drink.  I personally loved the mac and cheese tartlets.   And lastly, the price was very reasonable.  We received a very detailed description of everything we were paying for and all prices were acceptable considering it was a Saturday night in Manhattan. I would highly recommend this place to anyone for a party or even just a nice night out.
