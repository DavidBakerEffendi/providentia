Love their prices. I always have the same thing. The half chicken, sticky rice and mango salad plate listed under the salad category. Large portions for only $8.99 any time of the day. Delicious, but since I have been having it for many years, I realize that it recently is not as flavorful as it used to be. Also,the music is really too loud so it makes it uncomfortable at times. But I still go back!
