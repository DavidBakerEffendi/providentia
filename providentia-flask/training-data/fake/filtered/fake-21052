The food is not the worst I've ever had, but close. The paper plates are soaked in grease. Eating with plastic utensils and drinking from paper cups is not my idea of a sit down restaurant. This stuff is best served from an outdoor cart. The dining room is dark, dank and smelly. The windows haven't been washed in years. Bring Mylanta. These folks own several residential properties in New Haven within just a few blocks of the "restaurant". They refuse to maintain their rundown properties. Garbage, mud and unkempt vegetation abounds. In one backyard a large pile of wood twigs and branches screams out "fire hazard!" If the way they keep their properties is any indication of the cleanliness of their kitchen, WATCH OUT! The city has admonished them on several occasions, but still they refuse to clean up their act. This family has no interest in New Haven other than taking your money and running back to their compound in suburban Durham. DO NOT GIVE THEM YOUR MONEY!
