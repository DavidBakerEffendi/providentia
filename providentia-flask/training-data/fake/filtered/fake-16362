I was in Joplin, Missouri for two months, and got to know real southern BBQ.  Let me tell you, Uncle Willie's meets or exceeds the quality of any of the joints I visited in Mizzou.  If anyone rates this place as anything other than 4 or 5 stars, then they don't know good food.   And the prices are right!
