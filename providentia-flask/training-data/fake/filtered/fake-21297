Hubby took me here for dinner. This was my first time but not his. I was really impressed. From the outside it looks like a house and on the inside its really cute and cozy. They also have a back area that's nice! I had the rib eye which was cooked perfectly and my hubby had the bluefish, which was also great! White wine for me and red wine for him can't remember the brands but they were awesome!!! Will definitely come back to try the rest of the menu. Oh yeah, the staff was friendly as well! Can't beat the great food and romantic ambiance!
