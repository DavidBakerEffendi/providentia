Greenpoint has so many coffee shops.  Ones with gardens, ones with Colombian coffee specials, ones with Polish treats and now it has one with a cool piano!  This place is cool because it has super nice promoter-girl as barista, friendly Italian owner,  vintage style leather couch, and books from ceiling to floor.  I have also heard that once the grass is in they will let people lay blankets down on the mini-lawn. The iced coffee was killer and am going back for my morning latte.  Oh yes, it's nice and quiet and the backyard is so peaceful.
