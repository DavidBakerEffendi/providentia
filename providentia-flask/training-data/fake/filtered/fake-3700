Great food by great people.  I think you can buy the pepper jelly that is served on the chicken biscuit by the jar - I could drink it, it's so good.  I've heard people complain that it's a little pricey for the size of the potions, but I disagree.  It's the perfect amount of food, and worth every penny.  Try it!
