Great nachos, original combination of ingredients, haven't had any quite like them before. Thought the menu was simple at first, but everything we ordered is very well made. If you are in the mood for simple delicious fare this is your place. Agree that French fries were also great. Jean pocket holding the check at the end was a cute unique touch. Staff very friendly and accommodating.
