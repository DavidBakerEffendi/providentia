Hello everyone, Just finish eating brunch at this place and I am extremely disappointed because of the following: Service is very bad, the waiter was rushing us every minute to order and my friends and I haven't been sitting not even for 2 min. The waiter came with the food very quick but was so rude that he just put the plates in our face expecting us to carry the plates and deal with it ourself. He asked if we wanted pepper and one of my friend said no thanks so he was leaving and I had to say 4 times that I wanted pepper and he gave me a nasty look. Now the food review is the following: Order 2 plates with egg Benedict and the poach egg was over done and too much vinegar on it, not runny at all. Not to mention the hollandaise sauce was extremely thick. The fries were too greasy. The gravlax salmon was of bad bad quality which had a weird taste to it. The French toast was burned but still tasty. The bacon and cheese omelet was ok except that the bacon was over cooked.
