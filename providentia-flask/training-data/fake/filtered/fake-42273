Came to this restaurant after finding a good review online. The staff there were a bit on the rough side, lack of customer service was definitely present but if you are looking for something really quick, cheap and extremely delicious, this is the place. We ordered four large items and paid $9 We go here everytime we visit New York. it is one of my most favrout restaurant in this area. i always love this place. this is very special for me and i can't live without going there if i am in that area. its not depend that for what sort of work i am there????????? everybody knows some things are very special for them and special things cant paid always....
