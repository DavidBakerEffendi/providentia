Last night was my first time going to Toro Loco.   First off the reviewer that said the food isn't authentic is clueless.   The food is authentic and its really good.  This is coming from a guy that grew eating at the best mexican restaurants in Arizona and New Mexico  The guacamole is excellent. The chicken in my chimichanga was juicy and not dry and blend like many other Mexican joints in the area.   My wife's shredded beef on her California Burrito Loco was so moist and flavorful I was very impressed.   Last but definitely not least important, our waiter was super helpful and was kind.   I only wish he would've checked on us a bit more.   I had to wait a bit to refil my margarita on rocks.   I know right,  first world problems.   All in all we will definitely be going back and by far the best Mexican I've found in NJ.
