So nice to have a different option other than fast food near where I work.  The Chicken and Shrimp Teriyaki is good, but the sushi is great! My favorites are the Spicy Tuna, Spicy Salmon, and the Snow Ball rolls.  There's a good variety of food to pick from and the pricing is pretty good. Usually lunch/dinner runs me about about $4-5 for 8 pieces, not bad.  The place is clean inside, you can see the cook making your food, friendly staff, they do deliver, and the food tastes very fresh.
