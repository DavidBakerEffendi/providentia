Great Maitre'd and waitress. However when we ordered a dessert and asked for 2 rather than one scoop of ice cream we were told we would be charged for it. This after already ordering $200 of food and drinks for 2 people. It turns out they were going to dock the waitress several dollars for an 8 cent scoop of ice cream. . The chef would not see me and sent this charming Mexican sous chef who could not understand most of what I was saying) was insistent that they were going to dock the waitress. Apparently the owner is not often there. I left the waitress a 35% tip and can say that the owners of this place do not deserve your business.
