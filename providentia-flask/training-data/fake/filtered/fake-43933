My husband and I went to Basta for the first time this weekend, on the basis of others' recommendations.  I'm a little surprised by the "meh" response here, as we were pleased with everything! The service was excellent, and the bread was fresh and tasty.  One thing to know: the portion sizes are HUGE.  We ordered the Sicilian calamari appetizer, which came out in a massive bowl that we could only finish half of.  Then our salads were practically mountains of lettuce in huge bowls--definitely a pleasant change from those restaurants that charge you $10 for a dozen lettuce leaves, but still too much to get through.  We'd split a salad on a return meal. I had the Caprese penne, and my husband had the Sunday Dinner meal.  Both were delicious, especially the meatballs in his--Basta rightfully displays signs about winning Best of CT for them!   My only criticism is the bottled water, which was ridiculously over-priced.  Tap water is just fine!
