Yelpers,this is the place to be. I've been living in Rahway for about 10 yrs and I'm so mad I didn't try this place sooner. My wife and I brought the kids for a family night out to try this place and I'm glad we did, it was great. They had a little play area for the kids with coloring books and toys so my wife and I talked and relaxed while keeping an eye on them. Chips came out hot and fresh and the salsa was probably the best I ever had. My wife had fish tacos that looked amazing. They came out with a slice of orange on top that I thought was a little different. I had the steak fajitas and I thinks my biggest complaint is that there was way to much. I wish we tried this place years ago. The service and food were awesome!!! Thanks to all see ya soon.
