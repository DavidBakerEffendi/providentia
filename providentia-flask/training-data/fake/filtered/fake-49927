My colleagues and I were in town for the past week.  We've eaten at City Steam several times.  Dominique and Virginia are outstanding servers who are courteous, friendly, and efficient! We've tried a number of items from the menu and they've been consistently delicious. We'll definitely drop by when we return to the the area.
