Amazing Gumbo. Coming from Lafayette LA and moving to NYC was one the best decisions I have every made, but you do miss what makes Louisiana special. Having stumbled upon the Gumbo Bros at Broadway bites, I have finally found the gumbo I have been looking for in NYC. Adam and Clay are great guys who have brought amazing cajun/creole food here. Highly recommend and looking forward to seeing what the Gumbo Bros accomplish going forward.
