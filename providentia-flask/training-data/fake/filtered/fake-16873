The food was great.  We had a party of 20 and they took care of everything.  Not one order was wrong. Ruby was outstanding.  Amazing, above and beyond. Sunday Brunch, we will always come back. Being from Houston we were surprised that the gratuity was not already included on the bill. Loved it. Will be back. Thanks Ruby!!!
