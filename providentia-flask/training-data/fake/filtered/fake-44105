I have been to Mr. Sushi twice now and had two totally different experiences.  The first time I was there was on a slow Sunday night. I had the all you can eat.   It wasn't that crowded and both the service and food was amazing.  The second time I went was on a Saturday evening, there was a large group party and this time the food was O.K. and the service was TERRIBLE.  I am a very big tipper, but the service was so horrible, that I actually refused to leave a tip!  I truely think that it is best to eat at this restaurant on a slow and empty night.  Then you will be able to enjoy what it really offers!
