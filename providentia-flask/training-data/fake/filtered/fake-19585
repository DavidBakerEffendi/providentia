I really like the food here and appreciate a casual BYOB environment. The menu easily pleases everyone. Every plate I have tried has been tasty and well portioned. The Staff has been the stand-out to me; they are extremely friendly people and I always have an extra enjoyable time when I'm here- no matter the size of the group. They never rush us or keep us waiting, and are helpful when it's hard to narrow down the options. It's a reliable casual spot that I am happy to have in my neighborhood. 6 of us ordered mains only and our total including tip was $70- can't beat that.
