After hearing so much about people feeling it was worth waiting for 1 to 2 hours to get in...it was a terrible disappointment.  While the service was excellent, it was really a tourist trap.  They charged an extra $2.00 for a tiny second ramekin of maple butter syrup.  2 tablespoons of syrup is not enough for a serving of pancakes.  They know you'll need more. The same is true for charging $2.50 for 2 strips of bacon and $3.00 for a cup of coffee.  We'd never go back.
