The best thing about visiting my good friend Don in Bayonne (beside the visit with Don) is a meal at Andrews Project. I have now eaten there twice. Each experience has been a delicious, healthy joy!  This past summer we were treated to dining in the delightful, backyard area. The cooler weather brought us indoors on my last visit where the vibe is always positive and friendly. The menu, my friends, is awesome. I love the selection of organic dishes and an amazing organic juice mix was worth the visit alone. I am also sure that no one masters the salmon like owner and chef, Vasantha Perera!  So many intriguing, organic items on that menu guarantee that I'm heading back to Bayonne very soon. To visit Don too.
