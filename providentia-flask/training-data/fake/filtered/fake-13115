HORRIBLE!!! Ppl need to wait at least 1h to get so-called burgers (which is actually only white bread with moisty beef). During the long long long waiting time, I observed the following phenomenons: 1. in that tiny tiny dark room, there were lots of ppl, all packed. BUT, NOBODY was eating. They were all waiting for their food and staring at each other. 2. lots of ppl were waiting to order outside. When they held the door for a little bit longer, they would be yelled at: GET OUT OF HERE and shut the door. very impolite! 3. When some ppl finally got their food, I heard one lady said "this is not even a burger." Some of them even just had a few bites and took off. 1h waiting + 2 min dinning time, AND pretty pricey, that is not what a customer deserves For people who are amazed by its old-famous-brand, believe me, an actual historical bar/restaurant can do much better. Compared with the oldest bar in the US, McSorley's Louis has so much to learn. Tourists, wake up!! be a reasonable consumer! Â Or bring ur pillow and extra food to Louis..
