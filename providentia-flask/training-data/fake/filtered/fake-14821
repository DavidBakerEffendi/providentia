I've been dragging people here for their first taste of Hungarian food forever, and everyone I've brought has wanted to come back. The owners are friendly, and the restaurant feels, like many other people have said, like you are in your grandmother's kitchen. The dining room consists of country-style kitchen tables and chairs. The walls are decorated with pictures of Budapest and various types of traditional embroidery. The food is delicious, and affordable. At this point I've probably tried everything on the menu. The food always comes out fast. The cucumber salad offers an interesting mix of sweet and garlic flavors to start the meal. The main courses are heavy, filling, and full of flavor. My favorites are the Chicken Paprikas with spaetzle, which my friends and family concur is the best in the area, and the Stuffed Cabbage. Â The Hungarian goulash and beef goulash are also frequent selections. The rich, sweet paprika flavor never disappoints. A large bowl of sour cream is always on hand. For dessert, apricot crepes are always a good decision, though I'm usually far too stuffed from the meal to even think about dessert. The staff never hurries you out the door, so it is a great place for a relaxing evening with friends or family.
