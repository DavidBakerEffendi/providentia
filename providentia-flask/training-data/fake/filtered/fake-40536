The main reason why this place only received two stars is service, to be more specific our server "Mariana" #42.  Non-attentive, & rushed service. Bash Burger was decent but not as great as I expected. In summary this is more of a trendy soho bar that serves decent food.  The Hostess,table runners, & even other servers were helpful making up  for "Mariana" Server #42's lackluster performance.  Disappointed, & will not be back.
