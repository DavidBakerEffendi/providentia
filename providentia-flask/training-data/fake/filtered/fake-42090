Really great pizza! It really hits the spot. It had a pretty good wait time. And if one is just wondering around the city, this is a really nice place to stop by. The dim lighting is really nice and cozy, definitely a nice place to take a lady out on a date. My favorite pizza of the night was speck topping! If you're into italian ham deff go for it!
