Went to The Counter with a group of six.  The place has a super cool vibe to it.  "Build your own burger" concept is a lot of fun.  They have TONS of cheese, toppings and bun choices.  All six of us were impressed with the burgers, and the parmesan fries are fantastic.  The reviewer complaining about the burgers being $10 or so is crazy.  A Big Mac at McDonalds is almost $5.  Full bar with a pretty extensive beer list.  The "upscale" burger joint is getting pretty popular nowadays, but The Counter is the best one that I have been to.  We will be back.
