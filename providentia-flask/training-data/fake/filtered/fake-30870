We could have eaten better for less money anywhere on Rt 33.  Sauces were tasty and the meat was ok before it was re-heated.  Not much food for the price and the potato was overcooked and the sour cream was FROZEN.  Texas Brisket was great on one plate but too fatty on another.  Great cole slaw and ok beans.
