I reallllllllyyyy wish I had not even wasted the time coming to this establishment. Food ok (not great), service was terrible besides the sommelier. I would think customers should be treated a little bit better at a place like this especially with their prices ($90 steak? I think not). I got a too cool for school vibe from all the staff even the management.
