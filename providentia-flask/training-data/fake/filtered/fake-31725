So the only good days to go to Emerald Corner are Tuesday nights. I've been there on weekend nights and it's too overly crowded to even move around!  I only like going there on Tuesday nights for their Dollar Beer Night, but I haven't even gone to that in a while.   A lot of people who live in the Clifton area end up here because of dollar beer...So, after waiting over fifteen minutes to place my beer order, no bar tender came to our table so I decided to go up to the bar and waited for another five minutes,  I then asked "Can you please take our order?" and the bartender, a big-baldhead bloke called Chris responded back with very loud "Do I f**king look like I want to take your order?" and then he said to the female bartender, "Do not to take his order!",  so I then asked him, "What did I do to warrant this?", and he then angrily reacted "Get out!"  He then pushed me and said "I will call the cops because you are now trespassing!" and I am like what's his problem, I didn't do anything wrong and I was thrown out for no apparent reason. I felt really embarrassed because Chris (the bartender) disrespected me in front of everyone in the bar.. Would I ever come back here?  NO WAY!  I call this extremely unprofessional and terrible customer service! If he can't work in a crowded location then he shouldn't work there at all! He should be fired for sure! Seriously, this place epitomizes everything on my list of "can't stands" in the of city Clifton.
