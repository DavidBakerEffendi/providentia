It was Halloween night, and I just got done walking the grand kids around for massive collections of treats.  With all that walking, me and my wife decided to stop into Papa's for dinner.  We both did not want pizza, but instead opted for other items on the dinner menu.  Well that was a tragic mistake. I ordered the sausage, pasta and broccoli rabe.  My wife ordered the Vodka rigatoni. Prior to the "food" being delivered, "bread" was placed before us.  In all my days of dining out I have never been presented with such an  carb loaded abomination, referred to as "bread"  A stale hamburger bun would be far superior.  I asked my wife, is it me or does this "bread" have the texture and taste of 6 week old manure? She agreed and we shoved the "bread" to the far end of the table.   After about 15 minutes the food arrived.  After tasting the tasteless broccoli rabe, combined with what appeared to be steamed sausage of the lowest caliber, I began to eat the over done pasta.  All and all a total waste of time.  I reached over to sample what my wife had before her.  I looked like vodka rigatoni but tasted like Campbell's tomato soup with milk added instead of water.  I could not believe my eyes and taste buds.  It tasted EXACTLY like campbell's soup poured over pasta.  And I thought Honey Boo Boo's ketchup over pasta was insane. Papa should have his nationality taken away for serving such trash under the guise of being Italian food.  I will never return to that dump again.  If the ability existed to give this joint a "0", I would have.
