Ambiance was super nice and service was really good (3 out of 3 stars are for this) I wasn't impressed with the food at all. I also wasn't impressed that even though I mentioned that the dinner is a post wedding dinner for a party of 5, they didn't really offer any extras for an extra special day. I'm not used to that. Restaurants normally even give a free dessert for a celebration but was this place too upscale for that?! No clue.
