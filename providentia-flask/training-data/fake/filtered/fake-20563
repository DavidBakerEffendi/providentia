Absolutely fabulous! The specialty drink menu was super tasty and the food was to die for! The menu was a bit strange and a little overwhelming not knowing the dishes, but the waiter was very helpful with any questions. Instead of doing too much thinking, we decided to go for the prix-fixe menu. It came with a large assortment of dishes, and there was nothing that we didn?t care for. We left totally stuffed, I cant wait to go back!
