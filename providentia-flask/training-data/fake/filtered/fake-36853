Cowgirl Sea Horse was amazing!  My girl friends and I were checking out new restaurants at the Seaport and tried this place for dinner. 1.  The margaritas were terrific.  Plenty of booze. 2.  Our food was wonderful.  We had the Rattlesnake Bites, which were very tasty but beware that they are super spicy.  Then we had the Sweet Potato Fries and the Nachos with Pulled Pork.  We couldn't get enough of the last two. 3.  Service was impeccable.  Hawaiian Bryan was our waiter - he was a great waiter and fun addition to our evening on the town. All three of us are highly recommending Cowgirl Sea Horse to our friends and have even booked a dinner for a bachelorette party there.  Definitely go to Cowgirl Sea Horse!
