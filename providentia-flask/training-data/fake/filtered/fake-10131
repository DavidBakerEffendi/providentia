The GF and I went here on a whim, although I've lived in the Woodbrige area most of my life and have seen this place around for a long time, it was a last minute decision. I wasn't disappointed... The food is what you really should be critiquing here... No one is going for the atmosphere, so if you're really going to downgrade stars because of decor then you should try writing for Food and Wine.. Anywho, we had a coconut shrimp appetizer, which could have passed for frozen from the box, but I wasn't sure because the shrimp still had that fishy taste that you'd expect from fresh.. We each had a special entree fish, both cooked perfectly, but they both had a little too much of the "sauce" or topping on them.. The service was attentive, pleasant, and grateful.. I'll def be going back..
