I have been to this place two times already having to be in Hartford on business a few times a month from NYC. Lots of potential. Too bad that this place is so horrible. WHO IS RUNNING THIS PLACE????? Looks like another one of those places that I see pop up in Manhattan that opens and is closed in less than two years. The service sucked! The food was not bad once they corrected the order and brought it out (we were there 35 min at this point). Then we noticed a gentleman who we thought was a customer (due to how the employees were serving him) walk into the back. Wow!!! Was this the owner?? That was second and last time at this place. If my business associates in the area tells me it is better then I might give it another chance. On the other hand, I can just go up the block or around the corner and where they have a clue on how to be great to the customers. The funny thing is that when we were leaving the first time we went there were encouraged to take a menu with us. We all had a good laugh when we ready what this place was about. Look it up. When you visit the place you will get a good laugh too!!!
