Had been looking forward to trying the old fashioned and (apparently) famous Tom's in Prospect Heights.  I'll never go back.  Here are my thoughts from today, sitting at the bar: 1) Line down the block 2) Flies 3) Zero service throughout 4) All the hype about the pancakes is completely unfounded. On top of that, pun, the syrup is cheap and gross. 5) Had to ask for syrup 6) Had to ask for salt (they brought salt, no pepper.) 7) No coffee re-fill, no water re-fill 8) Asked for eggs over medium, and, ommmm.....they weren't even close. A mess. 9) Unable to order a single pancake and 2 eggs. 10) Did not clear my plates 11) Toast came out when i was done with breakfast 12) Patrons of the restaurant asked me to move down, i did 13) Patrons continually bumped into me, not even close to enough room 14) Staff continually bumped into me 15) Staff arguing with each other Wow. Clearly, this place is riding the high of its hype, and, good for them....they're snared in that sweet spot of great popularity and in NYC that could last for years. But for me, all I'm after is a simple greasy spoon diner.  I'd like to experience the opposite of all 15 things above, and it's not too much to ask.  These are simple, basic expectations from your average breakfast diner. Coincidentally, the place I have been going regularly for 2 years prior to this is the Tom's on the Upper West Side, and that Tom's I can recommend.   Good luck.
