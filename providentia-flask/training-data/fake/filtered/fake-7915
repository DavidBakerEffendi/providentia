A friend and I stop here every other week or so for morning breakfast before work, and it's one of my favorite brunch places after a night out... mostly because  it's so close... and because the homemade ketchup (marinara sauce) is an antidote to residual beer in the bloodstream...  I've never been disappointed with an entree I've ordered here, and I actually like the coffee in the tin mugs The only problem are the wait times to get seated, which can be ridiculous (usually less of a problem if one is hung over).  They also *never* open on time which is pretty annoying if one is trying to grab a bite before work.
