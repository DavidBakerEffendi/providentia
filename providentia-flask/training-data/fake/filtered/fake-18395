Lucked out when my boss took us to Kochi Indian Cuisine in East Windsor NJ. when I attended a meeting in Princeton recently.  I'm told I'm a picky eater, but I just pay more attention to what I put in my mouth than most.  We ordered a few things on the menu and I liked it right off the bat when our server asked our spice level! Very knowledgeable and friendly staff, they grind their own spices so everything was flavorful and fresh.  I tasted the Lamb Korma which was wonderfully tender and I ordered the vegetarian Paneer Tikka Masala where the the sauce was majestic!  The accompanied Garlic Naan was soft and fluffy which makes you fall in love with Indian Cuisine.  Excellent presentation - beautiful!  I promise you won't be disappointed if you try this place. Kudos to the owners!!!
