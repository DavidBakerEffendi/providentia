We've found this place to be an excellent stop off when we are on our way to northern Vermont. Great place to take kids, their veggie calzones are good and the service is quite good. As a side benefit, the staff is extremely helpful. I left my pocketbook there and promptly drove back to MA, the staff made the effort to find my stuff and determine a reasonable way to get it back to me. Huge Plus in my book for the extra mile they went for me!
