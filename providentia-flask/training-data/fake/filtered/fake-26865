I've been going here about once per week for the past year and a half.  It's much better than all the chain burrito places (Chipotle, the best of the chains in my opinion, Baja Fresh, Blockheads, and Qdoba, the worst).  I almost always get the steak burrito, but I've the chicken burrito as well.  The ingredients are always at least very good, usually excellent.  Be careful with the hot sauce-it is HOT!  I get the medium and "a little bit of hot."  The staff is friendly.  If you go early there is no line and you will have no problem getting a seat, but during the lunch rush hour you will have to wait.  Prices are the same as the chains.  All in all, one of my favorite places and highly recommended, despite the terrible viral video :)
