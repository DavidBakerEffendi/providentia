Eataly...went, saw, left....too white; too crowded; prices same as everywhere else in NY; no delineation between eateries and shoppers; can find better and for less $ in many other places in NY and at Arthur Avenue; feels like "IKEA" went to Italy; but the tourists will make it happen for the three backers!
