I was really excited about going to this place because it was so close to my home. but i was very disappointed when i walked in to place my to go order the place seemed very nice and the staff seemed very pleasant. I ordered a california roll and a sweet potato roll and a cup of onion soup. I waited for 40 minutes for it to be ready, which is quite ridiculous. as i was walking out, frustrated that i had to wait so long for 2 rolls when the restaurant wasnt even packed, i realized the bag seemed very light. they forgot to put in the soup so i had to go back in a wait for that becasue there was something happening in the kitchen. When i finally got home, i was even more disappointed because the rolls were very tiny and the soup was flavorless. So after waiting for 40 minutes for my takeout order, i had less than mediocre food and was stilll hungry. I will not be returning to this place and hope other people have better luck.
