This is my husband and mine's favorite restaurant! We love the garlic bread fondue as an app, they have nightly specials as well as rotating specials so there is always plenty to choose from. Monday's offer a great meatloaf sandwich and Tuesday's offer an amazing Mac and cheese that you will never finish in one sitting. Regardless if you get pasta, a meat dish, sandwich, or seafood you will not be disappointed. Great atmosphere and great staff!
