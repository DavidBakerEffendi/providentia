Went with high expectations on a Tuesday afternoon to celebrate buying a wedding dress... all we wanted was some sparkling wine and good vibes.. Not to be had here! Tried to order wine at the wine bar, was directed to a different bar, they then directed us back to the original bar.  No one wanted to wait on us.   We asked for recommendations for a sparkling wine, and the waiter said he had no idea.. He knew nothing about the wine and could care less.. This was not a busy time for this place, yet we could not get any service. Go somewhere else for a fun time in Manhattan, this is not the place. 111
