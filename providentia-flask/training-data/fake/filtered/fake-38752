Went last Saturday night with my son.  Food was great, service even better.  Was in and out in a flash, since we had parked at a 30 minute only parking zone and wanted to be out quick.  We will be back soon when I have more leisure time to enjoy the atmosphere....reminded me of the Italian places in Little Italy in NY.
