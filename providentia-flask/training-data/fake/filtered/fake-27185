Ambience - OK Server/customer service - Excellent South Indian Food - Very Good I live only a mile away from this place and have had food many times. My all time favorite is the Chicken Kodi Vepudu, Chicken Dum Briyani and Chicken Pepper masala.. Â I am from South India and these items are really authentic.. I am not a big fan of the indo-chinese (or) north indian curries here.. Parotta is also good. Rajesh - the supervisor is very friendly and they do have good service.. Definitely a good place for south Indian food.. Cheers Prabu!
