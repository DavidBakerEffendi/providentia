I've eaten at Yasuda a few times and always found the food to be good but the service terrible (especially if you are not at the sushi bar - you may as well not exist) - the reservationists are incredibly rude and it doesn't get much better once you arrive.  Today, we got to the restaurant 5 minutes late for our lunch reservation, only to find they'd given our table away.  They claimed we were 10 minutes late and that was unacceptable.  After arguing with me about this for five minutes, the maitre d showed me his watch to prove me wrong - and it STILL wouldn't have put us arriving 10 minutes late!  So basically, they gave away our table after THREE minutes.  Unheard of at any good restaurant in NY and even worse as I was on a business lunch.  When we requested logical solutions like putting together two tables to accomodate us, they were having none of it.  Eventually, he said 'I'm not talking to you anymore.  You won't eat lunch here today.  I will not serve you' and stood silently like a child even though we were respectful and trying to be constructive the whole time.  This restaurant should be seriously embarrassed at the rudeness of its staff.  The best food in the world would not make up for the experience of giving away a table after three minutes and then acting like it's the customer's fault.
