We can't say speak highly enough about Joe's.  It's wonderful.  We just had our wedding celebration there this past Saturday.  There were 38 people, so we had the restaurant to ourselves for the entire afternoon.  The party started at 1:00 and was supposed to end at 4, but they were delightful as they had been the entire time even though we didn't leave until 5:45 - and they had people coming in with reservations at 6.  And there wasn't any extra charge.  But the best part was of course the food.  It's hard to please so many people, but there wasn't one who thought it was anything less than absolutely delicious, and who couldn't find a few things that they liked.  The antipasto, fried calamari, and salad were served family style.  Then there were 5 different main courses served buffet style.  We're very picky and requested quite a few things that were different from the regular menu, but they never hesitated as they said yes to every request that was made.  And the trays weren't ever empty.  They kept up with demand seamlessly! The value can't be beat. Everybody was really enjoying the food and having a great time, which is why the party ran so long. So we wouldn't hesitate to highly recommend Joe's.  They made our wedding celebration so wonderful, easy, and unforgettable. Randi and James
