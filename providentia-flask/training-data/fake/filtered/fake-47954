My fiancé and I decided to come here for a treat after a very long and stressful week. Hands down, this was one of the best meals I've had in a really long time. We were greater as soon as we walked in and were promptly seated. I had this delicious Mojito made with white wine and my fiancé had a regular Mojitoto start. Both were outstanding. We decided on a mix of small plates. Our favorites included the sliders which were PERFECTLY cooked and they were served with the most delicious au jus on the side. We also had goat cheese on toast which were served drizzled with aromatic white truffle oil and topped with figs and walnuts. YUM. The ceviche was outstanding. We we seriously ready to finish off the juice with straws. I could have eaten that the rest of the night and have been totally content. One thing that we did not enjoy was the trio of cheeses. We love our cheese plates but were disappointed that we had no idea which were which. It didn't really matter because they all tasted the same. Dessert consisted of their version of pineapple bread pudding which was almost more like a dolce de leches dish with creme brûlée crust. Who cares, it was so dreamy. We also had these amazing tiny chocolate and almond croquettes which were cleverly served on spoons. Heaven. I remember at some point during the meal my fiancé and I saying how impeccable the service was. Our water was never less than 1/2 full all night. Plates were cleared very quickly and at the end we were allowed to sit and relax and finish our drinks. After we paid we were brought these little shot glasses of passion fruit mojitos on the house. It just made our night and we left so relaxed. Can't wait to bring everyone we know here!!
