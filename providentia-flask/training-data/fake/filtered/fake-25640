5 Star service, ambiance and of course food! The decor of this place is quite beautiful and the wine is top-notch. Every waiter was very attentive and the presentation of every dish was beautiful. This place is truly a gem and I will definitely be returning in the near future. Try the grilled octopus, it is amazing.
