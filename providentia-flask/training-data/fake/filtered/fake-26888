My husband and I went to Ai Fiori for dinner last night and had a wonderful experience. We did the four course tasting menu, with wine pairing. Everything we had was simply delicious! We started off with the razor clams and soft shell crab (yum!) then moved on to tortellini (decadent!) and squid ink seafood pasta (light and tasty!), and finally had scallops with pancetta and the rack of lamb.  The seafood was fresh and tasty, the pastas were perfectly al dente and homemade, and the desserts were fantastic.  We could tell that a lot of thought went into each dish. The wine pairing was also perfect. Everything they recommended with each dish was flawless and truly complemented each of the flavors. The service was impeccable all around - from our waiter, to each person that served us with bread, refilled water glasses, etc. Our main waiter, Michelangelo, was impressive - knowing each dish to a t and describing everything so that you wanted to taste the whole menu. Everyone showed high attention to detail, and were very courteous and friendly. The ambiance is very elegant. A really great place to go for a date, special occasion, etc. We will be back and will recommend it to others!
