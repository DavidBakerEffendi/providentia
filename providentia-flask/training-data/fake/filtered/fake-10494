This was the worst breakfast place I have been to in a long time.  First, the cook was handling food items such as bagels and toast with his bare hands, (without plastic gloves).  The sausage and bacon were not good.  The sausage was the already cooked "brown and serve" kind and the bacon was also the already-cooked kind. The home fries were awful.  They too were not the freshly shredded potato kind of fries. I will never, ever return. The food came super-fast and now we know why.  Only the eggs, were what we expected. Overall,  VERY poor quality food.
