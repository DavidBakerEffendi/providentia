i almost NEVER bother writing reviews here, and although ippudo hardly needs my vote of confidence, just thinking about eating there several months ago is making my mouth water. the ramen: got the classic akamaru modern, with the suggested extra toppings (hard boiled egg and braised pork belly, extra $6). there's nothing else to say except that it was exceptional. having lived in japan and being pretty familiar with japanese cuisine, i feel comfortable saying this may be the best ramen i've ever had. the pork belly, while delicious, does make the whole bowl taste fattier, and though it should absolutely be tried the first time, i may skip it from now on. hirata pork buns: yes everyone raves about these, but for a reason. it seems unfair to compare them to your standard pork bun, as this is really an entirely different beast, but it also is one of the best i've ever had. ippudo isn't cheap, but for the quality it's also not outrageous, and certainly worth the occasional trip every now and then. GO.
