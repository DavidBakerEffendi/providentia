Had such a great time with my girlfriends @ Yerba Buena! We celebrated our friendship of many years and i'm so glad we did! The ambience was festive and lively! The staff attentive friendly and warm from the moment you walk in! The spicy drink Picante is a must try.Our friend tried the one with a rose i it! The chef's appetizer platter was soo tasty! The black cod was superb" like butter baby".The calamari I wa not a fan of but that's Ok The restaurant is not enormous but yet you feel like the staff carefully orchestrate their moves around you! we loved it! Champagne toast compliments of the manager! We will be back !!
