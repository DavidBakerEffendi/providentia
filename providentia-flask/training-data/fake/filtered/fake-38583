You know those mornings when you're so hungover that you need the biggest, most delicious breakfast and all of the beverages you can fit on your table? Had one of those recently, and let me tell you - Magnolia was the perfect cure. The atmosphere was great, the descent downstairs added to the magical breakfast kingdom vibe, and the music in there seemed to have been pulled straight off my junior year of high school playlist (a good thing, I promise). Plus, they offer vegan and gluten-free options, and they're the first Green Certified restaurant in Vermont - what more could you need? I went with two friends, we got the cheese and fruit plate to start (I didn't dig the horseradish cheese but, that's just me), along with really good coffee and made the classic choice of chocolate milks all around. One of us got a Benedict (perfect) and the others got Bo Knows Breakfast. Everything was so good, I never wanted to leave. As for the service, our waitress (I think her name was Abbie?) was a godsend. She made sure we were well hydrated and had everything we needed, maybe even before we knew that we needed it. I feel like I consistently have excellent restraint experiences in Burlington, but Magnolia takes the cake
