The only thing i have to say is the best indian restaurant in CT period. There food is so good that i cant stop ordering more and more. The chicken curry is the best and the nan are fluffy and buttery made fresh. The service is nice to, they are very friendly and they keep my glass of water full. The restaurants interior is nice and the restaurant itself is clean to from the inside. Give them a try and trust me you wont be Â disappointed.
