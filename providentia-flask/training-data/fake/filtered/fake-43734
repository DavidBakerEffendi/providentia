This is really shameful I have to write this review, but after having continuously dined at Alta all this time, we took our family to Alta one night and explicitly told our waiter we would only order from the nut-free menu (which apparently didn't occur to the waiter that someone at the table has nut allergies).  Anyway, after just a dish or two, my fiance began to feel ill, and it turned out that pine nut remnants or oil or whatever it may be (presumably cross contamination and carelessness with managing utensils/dishes/pans in the kitchen) affected his dish (of tomato mozzarella, mind you -- no nuts) and he immediately began to have a severe allergic reaction.  We had to use his epi-pen and all had to get up and leave dinner so we could rush to the hospital and save his life.  Eight traumatic hours later, we were released from the hospital.  My fiance's sister who put the dinner on her card called the restaurant that evening to ask if we could get our money back and to explain the situation, and the manager HAD THE NERVE to actually yell at her, no offer to pay her back and even told her it was our fault that we never informed the waiter we are allergic to pine nuts.  Seriously Alta, shame on you and your poor management.  I really hoped this would be the one place that we could eat without any concerns, but apparently not.  And for those of you with food allergies, even though they do have gluten-free and nut free menus, don't take it seriously, because apparently Alta doesn't either.  And their attitude is pathetic, considering we were going there every week for months at this point and they certainly must have had some record in their system and, if not, that's just pathetic customer service.
