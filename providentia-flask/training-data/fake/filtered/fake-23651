If you want great food, you will get it here. If you have plenty of time to wait for a table and no where to go and you are not yet hungry, your experience will be great. But if you are on a schedule or with other people, watch out, it will take a long time for a table unless you are there at off hours. My rating is for incredible food, mixed with just nice atmosphere and a lot of difficulty seating.
