Food was mild on my request. Love the basil chicken soo good can't get enough of it. You can request 1 to 5 star of spicy intense of your choise. Love the chicken on stick also since I am allergic to peanut I have to request with sweet Thai sauce which is make it perfect. Next time I will try four season special they offer sound delicious Recommended place for spice lover. Will be back when I am in town .
