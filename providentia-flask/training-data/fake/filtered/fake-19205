FIVE STARS!  Whenever I get Burrito Bar in my head, I'm having dreams of sangria and tostacos until I plan a dinner with one of my girlfriends.  The endless tortilla chips and salsa are a big problem; all you want to do is keep eating and once the food comes, you're already stuffed!  That never stops me, though!  I've tried so many items on their menu and I've never been disappointed.  I can honestly say the only reason I wouldn't recommend this place is if you're on a serious diet, because you will not be able to stop eating.  Sometimes I'll go there for drinks, but not without leaving with a slice of flan to go.  I just can't help myself!  For the record, I have been going to Burrito Bar since it opened many, many years ago; so take it from me!
