We came for lunch and quickly learned that they only made fresh spring rolls for dinner. There was a particular lunch specials menu which was limiting (no appetizers, soups, etc) so we had to order from that. We had the Pad Thai with Chicken and the Beef Pad See Ew. My friend's Pad See Ew was a little oily, but adequate; skimpy beef and skimpy broccoli--definitely too small for the $10 lunch price. The Pad Thai had practically no chicken and about 5 individual bean sprouts with the tiniest piece of lime I've ever seen. I had to ask for a LOT more lime to the whole dish to cover a not-so-pleasant fishy taste. Unappetizing and uninspiring. I always loved Royal Orchid in Montpelier. I can't figure out why nothing ever tastes good in this lower Church Street venue where restaurants open and then close at an alarming rate.
