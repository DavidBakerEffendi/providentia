One of our favorite hartford restaurants.  Been three times (one lunch and two dinners).  All meals were excellent.  Oysters, fish and steak all prepared to perfect. GREAT Jalapeno martini.  Unique and terrific.  If I weren't going to a show I would have had two. Often $25 off coupons are available from restaurant.com Recommend.
