This place is amazing! I recently went when I was in town and I had so much fun there! The bartenders are really friendly, they play great music, free cheese puffs, and decent pricing for alcohol. Definitely a fun place to go to with friends if you're looking for some place chill to hangout. If in live in New York I'd definitely be coming here more often. Will be visiting on my next trip out east.
