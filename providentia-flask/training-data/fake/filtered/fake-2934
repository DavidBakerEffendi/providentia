Went to Cuban Pete's for dinner with another couple - told the wait was 90 minutes.  90 minutes still no table, however a blond with her group got seated after she was told there was a 2 hour wait.  When I spoke to the manager, he told me "it was his restaurant, he could do what he wanted and it's a free country".  We got seated immediately when my husband wen to speak to the manager (same guy).  We ate here, food was not as good as we remembered from last time, service was good (Daniel was our server) but we will not be going back due to Mr. It's My Restaurant. Be sure I'll be spreading the news of his disrepectful attitude...
