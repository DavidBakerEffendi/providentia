Will never return to this restaurant again!! Made a reservation weeks ago to celebrate my brothers birthday. I also called to reconfirm my reservation, since I had read online that they tend to "lose" reservations. Sure enough, my party gets to the restaurant and they have no record of our reservation, but very conveniently have a reservation for another party of my size with my name at my time. When I tried to speak with the hostess (who is the daughter of the owner), she was completely unhelpful, not accommodating, and plain rude. She told my party she did not need to apologize and did not need to seat us. The chef (the son of the owner) also came out and told us that he would only apologize if we could tell him we had never made a mistake in our lives. Completely unprofessional and irrelevant! In the end, we ended up staying because we were a large party and did not want to ruin my brothers birthday more than these people had already ruined it. The food was Â very good and the waiter was very kind. However there are plenty of Italian restaurants and it is certainly not worth the aggravation! The ownership never apologized and I felt uncomfortable for most of our meal. Buyer beware!!! Go elsewhere!!!!!!
