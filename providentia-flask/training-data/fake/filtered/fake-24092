So refreshing to find a healthy alternative. I stopped by the rest stop last week and figured I'd grab subway (seeing as it's at least slightly healthier than the others) I noticed the sign which read, Good To Go Organics and was immediately attracted to the concept of organic fast casual. I was however a bit surprised to see that the prices were more than I'd planned on spending, that was until the girl working at the time (Amanda) explained that the product was of high quality and therefore costs more and sells for more. I was pleased to see that she cared enough to not only promote the brand, but also seemingly really liked healthy food herself.
