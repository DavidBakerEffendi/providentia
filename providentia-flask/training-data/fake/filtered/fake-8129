Had the chance to try the food and interact with the staff. The staff is attentive and responsive. The food is well presented. The restaurant seems like a place for a couple trying ethnic food. The bar is a different story, if you like rum, if you enjoy rum or wish to know more about rum, this is the place to go. The environment is calm, clients can come in and talk without any problem.The manager does a great job when it comes to hospitality. The bartender and the owner have well based knowledge of rum. The waitresses know their wine. Overall it seems like a good place for a couple to enjoy dinner and drinks. Friendly and attentive staff makes the establishment work smoothly. Would recommend to anyone who wants to relax, drink, talk and enjoy good food.
