Horrible! former employee! DO NOT BELIEVE THERE FOOD IS FRESH. ITS REPROCESSED the warehouse is filthy. The owner and staff are very nasty! they do not put the costumers first. very rude people, they only care about taking peoples money. The pricing of there sweets are not worth it at all. The restaurant is okay, not bad. to go food is refried many times. not a good place.
