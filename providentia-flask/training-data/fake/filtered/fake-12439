This place is a classic place to grab your weekend macrons or buy a souvenir box for your Mother In Law. Yes, its expensive, but you have to expect that when you're buying macrons flown in from Paris on the Upper East Side. I bought a box of 8 for 22.50$ and I was treated well by the employees, who thanked me in French and wished me a nice day. The macrons themselves are excellent, especially if you pick them up before lunch time when they are most fresh. I would also recommend going in the early morning because the tourist crowds haven't hit yet. I tend to stop by around 10:45 and 11:00 on Saturday mornings, and its usually pretty empty. My favorite flavors are Hazelnut, Pistachio, Raspberry, almond, and anything citrus, but all the flavors are exceptional.
