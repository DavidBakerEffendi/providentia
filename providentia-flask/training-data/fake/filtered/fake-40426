WOW! This place is amazing. From the decor to the food it is just the best Thai food I've ever had! You can either sit inside or eat outside in their garden which has very cozy feel with pillows and lights. Okay, back to the food. I usually get the Pad-see-u and white rice. The portions are very generous and you can definitely share the dish with someone else and get more things to try. Very cheap too! Great place! I have also been to their other location Joya on Court Street.--Not as good as Song but it's second best.
