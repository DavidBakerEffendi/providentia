The staff is very young and inexperienced, something you would not expect at a restaurant in this price range.  The four of us were seated quickly, but we didn't hear from our waiter for about 10 minutes after being seated.   We were given bottled water right away, both flat and sparkling...and we eventually got some bread.  The bread went quickly as we were quite hungry, yet we had to ask several times for more bread and the wait staff seemed surprised we would ask for such a thing. The food was acceptable, but to be honest we all thought it was way too salty, and we each had different dishes.  It seems like the chef  had a really heavy hand with the salt shaker.  Its a unique menu, which uses a lot of local ingredients (that's the best thing about this place) but the food and the quality of the service don't seem to match up to the price.  Sorry!
