It's the place to see and be seen in Downtown Hartford.  Great place for a meeting, lunch with a friend, or some time alone to read or work.  A booster seat would be a welcome addition as many young parents visit the library with their toddlers.  Don't worry, the space can accomdate toddlers and adults in a meeting without conflict.
