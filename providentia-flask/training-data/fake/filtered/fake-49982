a pretty little thing. I had an organic vegetarian pasta drunken noodle there. It's decent, basically you can tell them cook the way you want. The owner is pretty friendly, she told me they season at the time they cook so if you don't want any fish sauce or soy sauce or oyster sauce, you can always tell them.
