My favorite Thai in the Village! Reasonably priced with a great ambiance. They also do takeout, and they deliver on Seamless! I used to always get the Chicken Pad Thai and have recently switched to the Drunken Noodles. Both are top-notch. One time, I went in to get take out & it was cold out so they treated me to a hot green tea. I often wonder why this place isn't more crowded.
