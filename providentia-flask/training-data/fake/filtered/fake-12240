Not a hater, but after seeing some of the reviews of the margaritas at this place, I thought I would try to balance out the hype.  First, though, killer shrimp tacos!  I've had margaritas at this place three or four times and they've been consistently very weak.  I'm no booze hound!  I had one the other night and was convinced it was a $8.50 virgin.  It may not taste quite as good  (COJones doesn't knock it out of the flavor park either), but I'd suggest crossing the street and having a $5 house margarita at JP Dempsey's.  It's a stronger pour, just as palatable, and w/o the frilly distractions etc.
