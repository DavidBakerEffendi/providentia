I like this place, and have been several times, but be warned, their curries can be hot, I mean, incredibly, painfully hot, particularly the green curry which I would avoid altogether. I love hot and spicy food, but when you can't taste anything because your mouth is scalding, that is just silly. My friend ordered the green curry and I thought she was just being a wimp, then she had me taste some and it was ridiculous. She ended up sending it back. They were actually nice about it, and she ordered something else without fuss. Â So I'd just advise caution on their spicy/hot items - they border on sadistic. But they have a huge tome of a menu with plenty of choices so don't worry. They also have a lovely garden seating area in the back which is a lovely oasis in the summer time. The service isn't friendly but it's respectful, so overall I'd say it is a good experience.
