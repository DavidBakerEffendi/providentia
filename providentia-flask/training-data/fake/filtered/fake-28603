I ate here and I'm not happy with neither the service nor the price. They're nice, but slowly and not paying much attention to the customers. The food was ok, but expensive. And the worst event of the dinner was the gratuity! They added a 25% gratuity to the bill! So, I don't recommend this place, except if you wanna pay a lot for common food...
