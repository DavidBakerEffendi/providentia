FIVE STARS! This was the nicest dining experience we've had in some long time!  We were greeted at the door by the owner, who opened early for us.  The folks here were very welcoming, clearly wanted us to have a very nice time (and we did!). The Serbian appetizer (a smoked meat antipasti) was really good, and the Sarma (stuffed cabbage) was just unbelievable!! After two appetizers, we could only think about sharing a single meal between us, and opted to share the Muckalica, which is a spicy beef stew.  Also great!  If you've never had Serbian food, you don't know what you're missing, so go to this restaurant now! If you *have* had authentic Serbian food, you know what you're missing, so go to this restaurant now! Oh, it's in a neighborhood in the city, so parking is tricky, just so you know...
