A diamond in the rough. You have to look for it, but once your inside you know you're someplace special. Reliably friendly service while you wait for your order to be prepared with patience and care. The Grass is my favorite: roasted beets, goat cheese, butternut squash mash and arugula perfectly balanced. Complimentary ben-yay's with your to-go order. Not a potato chip fan usually, but I do enjoy their selection of Zapp's. Like I said this place is special, comforting and slightly sacred. It's for a particular taste - foodie cajun comfort in proper portions.
