I have to say I have been going to Jalisco religiously once every week or two since their opening. I am disappointed to say that I have noticed a decline in the taste of the food and portion size. The prices went up and portions sizes decreased. Also if you plan to eat from the lunch menu you had better order before 2:00, otherwise you are charged full dinner prices. My family and I no longer go there due to our last two negative experiences over the last month. Wish I could say better things because we were huge fans initially!
