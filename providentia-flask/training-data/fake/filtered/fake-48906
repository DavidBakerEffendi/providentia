Stopped here on Friday night before heading out to meet some friends. Â Since it was 4th of July weekend it was fairly empty and we got a good table by the windows. The space is quite nice and the tables aren't crowded together. We decided to just share a few small plates - warm octopus and purple potatoes, 1/2 dozen oysters, a small charcuterie plate, and after confirming with our waiter that they were indeed made with cheese curds, the cheese fries quebecoise. The waiter was waxing poetic about these saying they were his favourite dish and a great seller. The warm octopus salad was well done, with a nice char that gave the octopus a slightly smoky flavour and the potatoes a crispy skin. The charcuterie place was nothing to get excited about - duck prosciutto was oilier than it needed to be, and the pork terrine lacked seasoning - though there was a nice pickled kumquat (or something). Finally those cheese fries... They came to the table with hardly any cheese, and it was definitely just cheese and not curds. The flavour was there - coming, I'm sure, from the copious amounts of bacon added to the dish - but the gravy was very thin and the lack of cheese was disappointing. Needing a little something sweet we decided on the Sticky Toffee Date Cake. It was fine, but being a Brit I know my sticky toffee pudding and wanted it to be better. The texture was good and I really enjoyed the creme fraiche ice cream (best part of the entire meal), but the toffee sauce had a sharp flavour which did not work with the cake at all. Not combining the sauce with the rest of the dessert meant it was lacking that gooey comfort. Overall I wouldn't run back here, and don't think the meal was particularly memorable, but the service was excellent and I wouldn't mind stopping in again.
