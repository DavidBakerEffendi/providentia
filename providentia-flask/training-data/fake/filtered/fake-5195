(very rude)....so he snobbishly comped the meal...saying " i win"...so my dinner guest were so insulted my the owners behavior they never got to finish their dinner.....guest who won't be coming to this so- so establishment...... me and my dinner guest....by the way this was my birthday dinner.....thanks  frank....check you snobby ego!!!!! i did ...and walked out
