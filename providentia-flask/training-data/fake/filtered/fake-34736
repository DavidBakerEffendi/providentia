Living only a block away it's easy to get into a rut of going to the same few places all the time regardless of how good they are, Sanfords is EXCEPTIONAL and definitely an exception to that rule. Having been there for breakfast, lunch, midday treat, and in the wee hours of the night, I've never had a meal that wasn't FANTASTIC. BRUNCH is by far my favorite here! How can you go wrong with a $14 pre fixe that includes coffee/tea, mimosa/screwdriver/blood mary/bellini, AND delicious meal! My staple is always the salmon and crab benedict. Amazing! The service has never really amazed me, but for being a 24/7 diner the quality of the food outshines that downfall.
