Great place! Loved the ambiance as soon as we walked in. Dinner seating is at the lower level - the rustic feel makes you forget you're in the city. Food is fantastic - we ordered bone marrow and pork belly to start and we were blown away - we asked for more bread to literally lick the sauce off the plate - it was so yummy . The main course was slightly disappointing, the burger was lacking in taste. The short rib with mac and cheese was so bland. The duck was fine. Overall the experience was nice but like I said the food was quite disappointing. Perhaps if we do go back we'll just order several appetizers.
