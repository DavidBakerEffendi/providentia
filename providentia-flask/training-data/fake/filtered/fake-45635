This was my second effort at liking The Blue Elephant Trail and, unfortunately, I have to say the place is, in my opinion, just "ok.". My girlfriend and I started with two appetizers, the spring rolls and the chicken satay.  Both of these were quite good; the spring rolls were large, flavorful and served with an excellent plum sauce, while the chicken was flavorful and very tender.  I wish ee had stopped there. We next moved on to the Shrimp Loves Scallops. Unfortunately, just like the pad Thai and Phuket Seafood that I had on my prior visit, this dish was bland and lifeless.  Additionally, at $22 I would have expected more than 2 shrimp and two scallops (cut into quarters). Service was also ok, not bad, not good, just ok. To me, if you want appetizers and a couple of drinks, this place might do the trick.  Their main courses, however, leave much to be desired.
