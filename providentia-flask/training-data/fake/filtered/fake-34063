Greek Taverna is a great place if you want to taste authentic greek food. Service is very quick and friendly even when the place is stuffed, and most importantly the food is absolutely amazing. I recommend the melted saganaki cheese for appetizer, chicken gyro with pita for a main dish and kadaif for dessert. I don't mind some noise, it makes the place feel lively and more friendly. In general, the food is wonderful and the service is cool, so I will definetely make many return trips again in the future..
