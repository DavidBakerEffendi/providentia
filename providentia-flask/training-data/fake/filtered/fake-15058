We've always loved Bud's, great food and great service.  I'm surprised at some of these reviews, we've been going for years and the food is awesome.  In this economy you have to expect prices to be higher, all goods and services have gone up or will go up.  This is the only restaurant where I can order a burger and finish it as it is that good!  Their crab clusters are my favorite as is the Chicken Francaise.  If you order a mixed drink, you need to ask for premium liquor (that's at any restaurant).  There is a nice outside eating area.  Hal is the owner and is always accommodating.  Not sure how someone paid $77 for 2 people without alcohol for their dinner, as it never cost us that much with 2 people with alcohol.  Yes, Bud's may need an outside upgrade, but it's a local "pub" restaurant so what would you expect.  We have always enjoyed the atmosphere, great food and service.  Thumbs up Buds!
