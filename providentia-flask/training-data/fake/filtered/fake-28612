I have been coming here a few times a year and have always had a great time.  Jeff, the owner is a wonderful host/bartender.   Mama makes the best homemade meals.  My family favorites are the Mac&Cheese appetizers & wings.  Today we had the $1 oysters and the delicious ginger wings.  My favorite entree has always been the Drunken Fish Soup but today I tried the Curry Noodle (clams and potatoes) and that was awesome.  Mama always adds hers special touch to every dish. Being at the Seaport, the crowd is a mixture of tourists and locals.  Great place to watch a game at the bar and hang out with friends and family.
