An insult to Middle Eastern hospitality.  The SALATIM - tasting salads, which in the Middle East are usually placed on the table for FREE, are embarrassingly minute. And $9 for 2 tasteless and small uncooked stuffed grape leaves decorated with one single grape cut in half, and chicken shishlik served in a small bowl --  simply pretentious.
