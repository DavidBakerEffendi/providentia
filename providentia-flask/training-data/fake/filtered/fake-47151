I had the pleasure of trying Entree last week for the very first time. The entire staff and the cozy atmosphere was excellent; truly a great dining experience as well. Everything I ordered was so delicious including the duck which I normally don't like but LOVED it here. My favorites however were definitely the calamari, lobster tail app. and the purple potatoes they served on the side!
