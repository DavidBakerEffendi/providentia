This place is a gem.  Every time I eat here, I feel healthy, satisfied, and somehow just overhall happy.  Over the many years I have frequented this place, the staff are consistently thoughtful, kind, and seem pleased to be doing their jobs.  I especially appreciate the owner, who is usually working behind the counter.  He often helps me clear my dishes when I have my hands full with my two young children.  He asks my opinion about the dishes I am eating and enjoying.  He personally welcomes me into the place and makes me feel at home.  He seems like a really decent guy.  I actually prefer going here over any other place in Burlington, including the more upscale places.  The food and atmosphere are better at Stone Soup.
