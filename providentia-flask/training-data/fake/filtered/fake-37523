Been coming back to the area twice or three times a year and never fail to stop at Cosmo for a pie to eat and five pies to bring back to Buffalo where pizza is simply terrible.  The Cosmo family keeps it simple - a decent mozzarella, a light tomato sauce, and a great crust add up to the quintessential Jersey pie.  Yes, I've had a better pie in Brooklyn, and an even better pie in Naples, but this is the pie that cries "welcome home to Jersey" at you.
