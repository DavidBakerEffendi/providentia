For a review of the food, plse. look elsewhere.  Can't do it because I pretty much got turned away.  An hour and fifteen minutes before the posted closing time we asked a tall skinny server for his estimated wait for a table for two.  The response in its entirety was, "I think the kitchen is closed."  A bit later the chef came out. His disposition was considerably more agreeable than the server's, as were his manners.  But the chef explained that they were overwhelmed with eat-in and take-out orders and he couldn't promise service any time soon - and probably not at all, that evening.  So if my experience is any indication, be prepared:   it's a small place and depending on when you get there you may have to wait very, very long - or, essentially be turned away.
