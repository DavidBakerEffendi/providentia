If I was told I could eat in only one restaurant for the rest of my life.....it would be Wasabi, in orange. This place is so good, if you mess up and order the wrong food....what they  give you will still be excellent. Over the past three or four years this has become by far my favorite Japanese restaurant, period.   The waiters and waitresses are extremely friendly.   The pricing of the food is more than reasonable, one can get an extremely large dinner for around $45.  Also the environment is great, extremely nice place to sit down and enjoy your food in peace and quiet.
