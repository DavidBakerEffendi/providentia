Probably the worst dining experience of my life. After spending $150 on lunch for 3 people, (yes, with only 4 small beers between all of us), we had finished eating and were halfway through our 2nd beers when a male employee came over and asked us to hurry up. I said I hope you're kidding, weve only just ordered these drinks, at which point he left, for about a minute. He then came back staring at us, and his watch. Im almost lost it at this point and demanded to speak to the manager, he was of course, the manager. The rudest behavior Ive encountered in 25 years of dining out. We had 45 min wait too, not worth it.
