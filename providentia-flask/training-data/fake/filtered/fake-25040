Great food, appealing atmosphere.  My friend had the eggplant tacos and they really were fantastic; and my elegant shrimp and grits was finger-licking good!  It was a little loud - but we were there on a beautiful Saturday evening so it was totally full.  After the crowd thinned out a bit it was perfect.
