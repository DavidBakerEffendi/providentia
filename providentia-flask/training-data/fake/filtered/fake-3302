Last time there, about a month ago, we brought the kids and sat outside on the patio.  We had a great evening.  The food was good, the kids were good, and everyone enjoyed their meal.  I had an awesome cheeseburger with port wine cheese and a delicious crock of onion soup.  The kids actually asked when we could go back (maybe when it gets a little cooler!!)  I don't know if you would want to bring the kids upstairs in the dining room, but the patio and the nest should certainly accommodate them.
