I heard about this place from a friend so I decided to go try it out. I always frequented Smashburger and Fuddruckers in Parsippany so I benchmark every burger by what I had there. The best part of eating here are the choices they give you. The burgers are very diverse and I appreciate the flavor of the meat. You can tell its not processed and very high quality. It has that organic flavor to it. Very cool overall and I'll be coming here for some eats if I'm ever in the area.
