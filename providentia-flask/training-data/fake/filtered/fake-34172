One of my best Japanese places in the town. Everything is in high quality, much better than how it looks. Never tried Japanese hot pot and pork tonsoku before, they are so good! Especially pork tonsoku, crispy outside, tender inside with the right amount of flavor. Addicted. Must make reservation ahead.
