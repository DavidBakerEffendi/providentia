What a fabulous lunch I had there on Monday! From the smiling bartender seating us to the friendly and helpful waitress to the amazing food- great experience. We were in a little bit of a hurry and the service pace was perfect. We ordered off the 10 for 10 specials and they were delicious! I got the flank steak over mashed potatoes and my guests got the Cajun chicken and Italian meatloaf- not a bite left over it was so good. Our server finished off our lunch telling us about the killer happy hour and daily dinner specials and provided us with take home dinner and lunch menus. Highly recommend this restaurant for business or pleasure and we are definitely trying out dinner.
