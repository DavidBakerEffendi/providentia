David Chang - you may be slightly overrated. Went with a group of six. We ordered: (1) the kimchee w/ pears; (2) hamachi; (3) oysters w/ kimchee foam; (4) the pork buns; and of course, (5) the pork shoulder. The best - by far, was the hamachi. The seaweed shavings and wasabi all melded together to create one of the best, umami-invoking tastes EVER. Everything else was just MEH. First, the pork shoulder, like the pork buns, are very porky. That's a good thing. The lettuce that comes w/ the Bo Ssam are also very fresh and crispy. What David Chang loses is the acid necessary to cut through the porky fattiness. Traditionally, Bo Ssam is served to kimchee, oysters, another type of kimchee from fresh julienned radishes, garlic and green chilies. Although his scallion mixture attempts to replace the garlic and chilies, it's too weak. Also, the radish kimchee adds crispy, fresh texture, which Chang forgets. All in all, it's probably NOT worth getting the bossam unless you go with around 12 people, who just want a small taste. Because Chang lacks the acid to cut through the porkiness, it's just too overwhelming. The cocktails are excellent, though.
