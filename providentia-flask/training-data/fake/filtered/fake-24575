You've got to try the dumplings at Joe's Shanghai when you're in New York. They're pretty spectacular. Other than that, Joe's Shanghai is an authentic Chinese restaurant, unlike P.F. Chang's or those other Americanized Chinese chains that don't serve real Chinese food. Joe's Shanghai is where the Chinese and Chinese-Americans go to eat Chinese food.
