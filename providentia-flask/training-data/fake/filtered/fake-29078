I've been here several times. I'm pescetarian, so I'm usually limited to tofu when getting Vietnamese/Cambodian sandwiches. Not here! My favorites are the roasted cauliflower and the coconut tiger shrimp-- quite delicious. And the tropical fruit salad is so fresh. I'm definitely going to continue coming back.
