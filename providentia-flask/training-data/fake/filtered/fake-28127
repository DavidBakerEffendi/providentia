We had a very pleasant experience.  Really good food. Lots of choice. No surprise discomforts later.  We are planning to go there often. Located in a nice neighborhood, interior is upscale from typical local Chinese restaurants. Although the restaurant is small, seating is comfortable and service is quick.   The management makes the extra effort to satisfy its customers.
