The skin was left on the pork and roasted so it was nice and crunchy. The pork broth was not heavy or overly greasy. The miso broth was somehow very buttery. Definitely different then your traditional ramen--but in a good and improved way. The only thing I would suggest is the noodles could be a little more al dente or at least a choice given on the menu.
