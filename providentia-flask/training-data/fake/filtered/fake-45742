High quality food and great prices, with an excellent buy ten get one free discount card. The breads and produce are always very fresh, and the pastries are very tasty as well. One shortcoming: this place can be a bit inconsistent. It seems they get somewhat overwhelmed by lunchtime crowds and when I've gone with a group, often someone's order gets lost, and the food can sometimes decline in quality (a "prosciutto and spinach" salad with limp, overdressed greens and hard pancetta instead of prosciutto.) All in all, great little spot, but probably best to come during the quieter hours.
