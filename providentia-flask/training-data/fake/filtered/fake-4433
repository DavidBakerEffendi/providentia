Mediocre food, bad service, ridiculously overpriced. I ordered the mixed grilled platter, which consisted of 6 tiny pieces of meat, along with a somewhat small amount of rice. The meal was $15, which is about $7 too much. In addition, they attempted to charge me $16 for this embarrassment of a meal. I would never fathom going back.
