I love this place. Great, fresh food. Big fan of the pizza and grinders, haven't tried much other than that in all my visits there. Only reason they didn't get get five stars is bc on more than one occasion my order either wasn't right or things were left out (instead of two sandwiches I was only given one, etc) although when brought to their attention they did correct the issue both times. And a few times over the last month (including today) I went to go in and they were closed - sign in the door said it was bc of "mechanical issues" Â whatever that means. Other than that, is a great place to go.
