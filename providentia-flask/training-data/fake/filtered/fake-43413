I went to the first midori sushi restaurant in highland park when it first opened and have been a regular customer of these restaurants (there are now 3 locations) ever since. when i moved to hopewell in may, i was sad to leave this gem behind but am happy that they opened this location. same menu, same high quality fish. best quality sushi in the area (we also love Ajihei in princeton but it is much more pricey). my boyfriend loves the noodles that come with the habachi dinners, but i almost always get sushi and sashimi. the special rolls are great, too (try hollywood or midori rolls or the super amazing crispy spicy lobster roll). attentive staff. nice atmosphere. byo.
