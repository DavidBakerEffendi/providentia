Went with a group of friends last week and had a great time.  The selection of beers is truly impressive.  Dozens of hard to find beers on tap, including a delicious cask ale. The food was also a pleasant surprise.  We sampled a large portion of the menu.  Really enjoyed the tacos, meatballs, deep dish pizza, buttermilk chicken sandwich and short rib empanadas.  They have a smoker on premise that they use throughout the menu (smoked meats in the tacos, brisket, smoked turkey, etc.)  They're still working through typical opening issues-they just opened last week- but the service was friendly and efficient.  Great addition to the neighborhood!
