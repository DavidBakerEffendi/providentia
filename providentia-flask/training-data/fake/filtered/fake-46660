We ordered 2 vegetarian platters and they gave us one piece of bread. We kindly asked the waiter for another piece of bread to go along with the other platter and he refused! We called the manager over and he said, "I don't care if you order one hundred platters, we will not give you another one!" What kind of service is this? To make a statement like that when each platter is supposed to be accompanied by one piece of bread is ridiculous. Terrible service, terrible attitude.
