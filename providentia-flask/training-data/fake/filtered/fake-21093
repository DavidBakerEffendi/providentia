Amazing food, great atmosphere. The idea is to order a few plates of food for the table, for everyone to share. Everything is vegan, the majority is gluten free. On the spicy side, so have plenty of water handy if you're not used to that. We ordered 4 plates to share, and everything we got was delicious. I am so happy I got to experience this restaurant! Will definitely be back.
