I would echo a lot of what Kevin M. noted in his review.  I spent the day with Scott going around town in his school bus.  Scott was a nice guy and entertaining.  Think a young Jackie Mason, not as off color...a defined shtick.  Some wished that perhaps the cheesiness of his humor carried forward onto the sauce covered dough we were eating.  Unfortunately it did not.  The pizza was literally 'fine'.  There was definitely not any excess of it...only one slice per person.  At the inflated price per head, I would buy a Zagat guide, gather a few good friends and have a car service drive you around to the great pizza places in the boroughs.  Less money, good pizza.
