Call ahead, sometimes during lunch they can seat you right away. Otherwise brace yourselves for a lo-o-o-ng wait!  For dinner: about 1 hour / 1.5 , they don't take reservations.   Tip #1: If the weather is warm and you don't feel like waiting around, chances are others are not going to either.  ( Cold weather? The wait may feel a little longer then expected.) --   They have a bar with decent house warm sake, beer and the bar tender is friendly and can be creative.     The soup is what I wait in line for, it's a hug in a bowl, silky smooth and perfect with it's al dente noodles.  They roll out the specials, which my partner in crime alway likes to try, but I stick to my tried and true Akimaru (sp?).  Also, I like the little peppers, they are fun to eat because some are spicy, but can't tell which one by just looking at them.  Pork buns are popular, although they do look like they could be fun to make, I am not a fan. I took the star off for the wait.  I remember being put off by the communal tables.  The 'hug in a bowl' makes you forget,  the price tag, the crazy wait, and the the over the top ambiance for something so simple, but SO AWESOME!
