Fantastical... Beef Rib eye slow cooked in water with mixed vegetables and a huge BEER.. I think it was about 32 oz.. not sure though.. either way.. very genuine experience. Stumbled out of there with a nice clean fill, and a great attitude. Recommend it for groups, first date, and practicing Japanese. Advice: Do not touch the middle.. Until next time we swim in beef and veggies, PWILDE
