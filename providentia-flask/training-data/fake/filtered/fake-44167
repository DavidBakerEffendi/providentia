We eat lunch here once a week. The service is usually prompt and courteous (though we've had the occassional slow service). The food is excellent. My favorites are the Thai Basil Fried Rice and the Chili Garlic Wine Sauce. We order our meals HOT and they are usually pleasantly so. The Thai iced tea is very good and the dressing on the salad and complementary spring roll are excellent. They get a good crowd in there for lunch.
