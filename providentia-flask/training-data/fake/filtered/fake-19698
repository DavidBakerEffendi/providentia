whoo hoo...luv this place.  The margaritas are whoo hoo, dont do too much of the food, only the drinks.  The outdoor is crowded, but when ur drinking....it does not matter after the third margarita.  lol.  always sad when it closes, but I am always at the grand opening every year to kick off the summer w/em.
