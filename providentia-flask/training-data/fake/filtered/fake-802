Sorry have to give you two stars for going on both occasions and eating semi burnt noodles.  How can this happen going within 8 months apart?  It's pretty inexpensive in the heart of park slope area but I can get the same service and be in the same price range at Lemongrass on seventh avenue.  The atmosphere with the backyard garden is pretty nice but not worth paying for burnt food.
