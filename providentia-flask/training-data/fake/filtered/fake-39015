I used to go here and liked it then. Tonight,  service was awful had to shout at the bartender just for her to respond. They spent more time on their cell phones than they did taking care of their customers.  Don't think ill ever go back. Also what's up with the three door men. A little overboard.  Too bad, because I really like this place.
