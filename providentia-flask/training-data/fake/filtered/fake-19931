I don't really use Yelp I'm more of fan of open table but I would like to write few words about my experience at the restaurant where I had dinner over past weekend. It was very busy Friday night, have to say making reservation its a must. Somehow we got still nice table. Menu its interesting, on the heaver side dishes but worth trying. Its something to try in the city. Trout was my pick, and as I prefer red wines I asked server for help since wines from Austria are not know to me. Not our server help us but other staff member, she did amazing job and spoke about wine with passion. I was very happy to have her attention and on such busy night she put time to it. She picked great wine and my co-worker and I simply love it. I don't remember her name now but I know that she was from Poland, no wine land and she knew wine list well. Thank you. PS dessert list a bit on short side. Maybe something will change soon as I'm sweets lover too.
