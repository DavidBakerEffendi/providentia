I ate here three times. The first two, the food was good, cooked well. The only drawbacks were drinks that we didn't order on our check. On my third visit, I ordered the same items as the first two trips with the addition of a cold platter. This time the food was sub par, not worth the cost, and overcooked. The shrimp on the cold platter had too much old bay. I am a fan of old bay, but this was excessive. It looked as it the shrimp had not been de-veined because of all the old bay. The raw oysters were the only good items on the platter. I also ordered snow crab legs. These were overcooked. The meat did not come out of the legs in one or two large pieces, but many little ones and was fragmented just kinda gross. It's not that hard to steam crab legs. I will not be returning
