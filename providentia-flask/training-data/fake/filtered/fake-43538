The food was great. Han was a total asshole. We wanted to order the rabbit in chili oil without peanuts. He said it would be like having a cheeseburger without the meat. I know I'm white, but I don't need anyone to relate food to me in cheeseburger analogies. It was a bunch of bullshit anyway, there were maybe a couple spoonfuls of nuts in the whole thing. Good food sold by an annoying douchebag. He should really stop going to every table.
