This is my favorite Japanese restaurant in the area. I've been here quite a few times with friends. The service is good, the atmosphere is nice, and the presentation of the food is really great. It does get crowded at times but I've never had to wait. I'm personally not a big ramen fan (their Shoyu ramen wasn't bad though) but their other entrees are generally quite good and pretty authentic. The red bean mochi is lovely. Drinks are reasonably priced and the glasses for plum sake in particular are decently sized! When I have friends visiting this is usually where I take them.
