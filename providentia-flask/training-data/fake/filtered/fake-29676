I have been here many times.  It's always a solid choice.  Never really over the top either way.  Steaks are done nicely.  Service is pretty good. Just had dinner about a week ago.   The roasted marrow bones were very good.   I enjoy the ambiance upstairs more than down. I know people love to moan about prices in NYC.  Well, your not in Kansas anymore.  It is what it is. *Helpful hint:  You pay for location, as well as quality. The value is good.   Will always recommend Landmarc.
