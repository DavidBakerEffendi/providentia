What a fabulous addition to the West Village!  I was in for the second time this weekend, this time for brunch. I thoroughly enjoyed the chicken salad, haricot vert, house-cured bacon, and a lovely glass of Barbera. The atmosphere is welcoming and the fare is simply amazing; I love this restaurant! The staff is very friendly and everything I've had to eat and drink both times has been fresh and delicious.  Another thing I love about Ellary's Greens is that it's open all day, so getting a great meal at an off time is no problem. The Ellary's Greens team has created a real gem. I am very much looking forward to my next visit!
