It doesn't matter how good the food is and this food is good if you can't enjoy it. A seeming policy of moving tables in 2 hours leads to a constant harassment by multiple waiters to the point where we were actually asked to vacate our table as others were waiting. First time that has happened. Complaints to the manager provided no satisfaction. Pity, this place knows how to create great Peruvian dishes but who cares if you can't enjoy it.
