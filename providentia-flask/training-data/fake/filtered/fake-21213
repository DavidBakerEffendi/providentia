The hubby and I have been wondering about this place since it opened. We ate there last night, and I have to echo a lot of the other comments I see here, great experience from hello to goodbye. We had reservations, (which I recommend making easily through OpenTable.com) and were seated shortly after we arrived. The hostesses are beyond welcoming when you step through the door. The restaurant itself is gorgeous with a warm feel. The service was also impeccable. I was not sure which wine to have with dinner, so after explaining to our server the type of wine I like, he brought me over two different bottles to try. They bring out two little warm biscuits to start you off, and they just came out of the over... heavenly.  We had the shrimp scampi as an appetizer, it was incredible, cooked perfectly and very flavorful. I had the salmon served over sauteed kale and bacon over tiny fingerling potatoes- it  was also delicious. My husband had the cod, and he loved it. We also got a side of the crispy sweet potatoes,... To. Die. For. Perfection, honestly. The portion sizes are on the small side, but were perfect for us. We did not have room for dessert, but will definitely try something nexttime. It is pricy, but for the overall experience of excellent food, service, and the atmosphere, it's worth the splurge.
