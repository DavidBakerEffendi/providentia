My boyfriend and I ate here last night and absolutely fell in love. The whole place seems like a secret society that you've finally been invited to join. The food was incredible and the ambiance was romantic and homey all at the same time. Seemed like a great place to bring a group or just go on a date with a friend. I can't wait to return!
