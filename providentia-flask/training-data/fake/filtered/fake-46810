I agree with Robert.  I too had frequented this place when they first opened and the place was great, very chic but now.......I would not go back again.  This place was a hot spot for a little bit but not anymore. My husband and I were in the area and we wanted to grab a drink and quick bite to eat.  I remembered how much I had enjoyed Koji when they first opened and I hadn't been back since and wanted to try it with my husband.....no good!  The place smelled like urine, the people in there seemed sketchy and our dinner was inedible.  Our beef negimaki was so dry and tough we were practically choking on it.  We didn't even finish our drinks (or our dinner) when we asked for the bill so we could pay and quickly left.
