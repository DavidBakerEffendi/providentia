Get the buns. Seriously, they are the reason for eating here. Pork belly buns are delicious. The short rib ones are great. The kobe beef ones are above average. There's some other above average stuff on the menu (shishito peppers, teba wings, gyoza and grilled nasu were all good), but just get the pork belly buns and enjoy.
