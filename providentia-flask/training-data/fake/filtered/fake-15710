Have to agree with the bland and tasteless. I was there two weeks ago, and was very disappointed. I have had hospital food that tasted better!  Also very boring atmosphere...great if you were 80 years old and on a diet of low-salt, overcooked mushy food.  And what is with that waitress over there?!?  Not worth the money or time or calories.
