I eat here alot and there are a couple of reasons. Number 1 is that the food is always consistently excellent. Yes it is Italian, but they serve great steaks and other items. Had melt in your mouth short ribs the other day.  The fresh fish is just that, FRESH. Number 2 the wait staff is very attentive and will do everything to make sure your meal is what you expect it to be.  Number 3 is the Matthew the owner is always on premises to see to your every need. How can this be beat...Great Food Great Service.
