Got the 1/4 lb burnt ends and mac & cheese for dinner via delivery. Burnt ends were absolutely delicious (kind of salty but that's to be expected) but the portion seemed somewhat small for the price. I was not a fan of the mac & cheese, it was very creamy but simultaneously bland, especially when eaten with the very flavorful meat. Would probably give this place another try and get some different items that would make me feel like I got more bang for my buck.
