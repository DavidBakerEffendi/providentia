I know only a few guys run this place but when you were promised a table in 5 min and were ignored pointedly even though u reminded the staff that you already waited 20 min... There were 2 tables but no one bothered to clean up. The staff nodded but ignored me completely and proceeded to take orders from the next table. That plainly is unacceptable. Iced coffee is most basic beverage on earth but they could not get that right, and when I asked for more syrup, they looked at me as if I were bizarre The scrambled eggs were fine but nothing you cant make at home, get some fesh salmon from Whole Foods and the right herbs, I am sure you can open a brunch place as well To be fair the eggs benedict was great, but not wow. As expected from a good brunch place. Food was alright but service was lousy, so only 2 stars.
