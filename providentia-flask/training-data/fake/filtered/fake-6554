The staff is very friendly and welcoming. The restaurant can get quite noisy when it is busy so if you have difficulty hearing, this might not be the best place for you. But otherwise, the food is overall really good. Their tomato sauce is absolutely delicious and they serve it with their bread. The spaghetti and meatballs seems like a simple dish to order at a restaurant, but theirs is delicious. Overall, the food is certainly on the pricier side so unfortunately this isn't a restaurant I visit casually. But if you can afford it, the food is very good and I recommend. They also have a big bar on the other side of the restaurant that seems like a chill place to go for happy hour or otherwise get drinks.
