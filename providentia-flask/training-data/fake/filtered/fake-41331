My husband and I had an appetizer and glass of wine at Eataly and then wandered a few blocks uptown to have a final meal at Lulu and Me. The mussels were to die for and the large plate of pork and grilled aspagus were just as good. The desert menu lokked intriguing but we were too full to continue. It was a low key nice experience. I would add a little tea light candle to each table for ambiance but overall it was good food, servive and atmosphere. Kathy G
