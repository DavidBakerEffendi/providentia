This place used to be the best breakfast joint in Burlington for the price and value. Last time I went it cost us (2 people) $30 for breakfast and we were still hungry! Anybody that says this place is inexpensive is from out-of-state where they're used to paying through the nose. Unless I feel like overpaying, I won't be back.
