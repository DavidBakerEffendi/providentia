The only thing they have going for them is the size of their sandwiches.  The veggies are no good, the bread seems a few days old, the meat is sub-par, and the service is unbelievable.  I am not quite sure how they are still in business due to health code violations, but it is absolutely disgusting.   Every time I walk in there, one of the few employees making my sandwich seems to stop mid-way, cash someone out, pick up the phone, pet the dog who just walked in, and then continue making my sandwich.  I only eat this with friends who want a cheap, filling alternative.  It blows my mind that gloves aren't used and they have such terrible habits regarding cleanliness.
