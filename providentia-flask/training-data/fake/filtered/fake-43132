Terrible service with groups, not friendly at all. "What you want?" Was about the only thing my waitress said to me the whole meal. They lump sum the whole check so everyone has to dish out cash. Asked for ice water; "It is ice water." It wasn't ice water. :( Spring Roll was definitely not made in store and it was surely microwaved because it was boiling hot. Mango Chicken, although pretty, consisted of mostly empty breading nuggets and then some overcooked stiff chicken pieces.
