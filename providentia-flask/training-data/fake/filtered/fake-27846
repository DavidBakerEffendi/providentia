A friend described this place to me as a "dive, but it's the best burger you'll ever taste." I disagree. It was not really dive (not fancy, but not a dive) with friendly service and a clean environment. But the burger was not the best I've ever had, just very good. But a good burger is worth celebrating! Not too greasy, but still with plenty of flavor, it was served on some really fluffy bread that was very tasty. Also, lots of mayonnaise on mine, which is how I like 'em!
