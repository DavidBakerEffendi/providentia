So I had the Geno's vs Pat's comparison and although the food tasted the same it was the service I got at Geno's that SUCKED!! So I went to philly with 2 of my friends and as we were in the 2nd line to get fries the lady there was so rude. I asked for a cheese fries, my friend asked for plain fries, and my other friend just wanted hot chocolate. We all were paying serperatly but she felt that we should have all put our orders in together and actually rolled her eyes in when my friend ordered the hot chocolate. Then I see that 2 fries are ready so I walk up to the window to get what I assume is fries we had ordered and I see her sticking her dirty (money collecting) fingers in the fries to close the tops of it. Then she looks at me and rudely states "these aren't yours" and I told her "Im glad cause I wouldn't want you to be sticking your fingers in them" which again I got another eye roll. Once we get our fries I go to the ketchup stand and try to pump some ketchup on my fries and she starts yelling at me "stop pumping the ketchup - there isn't anything in there" Â Overall, the owner should fire the old lady with the blonde hair who works at Geno's.
