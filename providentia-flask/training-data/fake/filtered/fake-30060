Being from LA and having lived in SF I can be very picky about my breakfast. This place is by far one of my faves. Found this place randomly on Yelp after a looooooong red eye flight. It being the only breakfast place around with 4 stars I figured that many people can't be wrong. I got the Big Man breakfast. The pancakes are fluffy, bacon crisp, and coffee is super hot and strong. Those homefries are something I'll be thinking of all the way back to the West Coast. Not overly seasoned, and perfectly cooked. Also the coffee came with my meal (a special they run for the morning time crowd) Def visit this Johny and his dad if your into small, intimate crowds and no frills good ole' diner eats. (p.s.- ladies Johny is kind of a hottie) If I ever get back to NYC they will be seeing me again!
