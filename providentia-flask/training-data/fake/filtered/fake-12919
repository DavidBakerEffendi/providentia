Used to be interesting fusion cuisine. Still pretty good food, but the menu is a little 20th century....make that early 20th century. More embarrassing, one of my pals asked for veggie options and was told: the chef will cook up something with whatever assorted veggies we have. He asked, cook what up, and she said, oh I don't know, steam stew stir fry...Clueless!
