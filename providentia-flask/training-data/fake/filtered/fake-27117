As the people around here know, there aren't many japanese cuisines around Princeton. However, recently I have come upon Hon Sushi. Located in Mercer Mall near Route 1, you can easily find this place. Very clean and modern, there is no other place like this. There weren't many people there but I assume that because it is fairly new. I started with some sushis, and they were amazing. The amount of fish they give you blend perfectly with the outstanding rice. And just when I thought I was done, I tried some main dishes. The Kalbi, which is actually Korean, and the Chilean Sea Bass were exceptional. I went with my boyfriend who is actually Japanese, and he said that this was the best Japanese restuarant in New Jersey. Price is fair, and the service is wonderful. For sushi lovers, I would strongly recommend. A++
