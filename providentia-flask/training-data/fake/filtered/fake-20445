Cutest place ever!! It's a very small place in the heart of soho, but totally worth going to if you're looking for a quick bite to eat somewhere an need to relax. They do have outside seating, but mind you, this place doesn't really have air conditioning. Their decor to their table settings was absolutely adorable. I ordered the mashed avocado sandwich which came with a cherry tomato jam and pickled carrot slaw on top. Yum!!! I came back the next day to order it to go since I work right around the corner. Definitely a must-go next time you're in soho.
