Yes the place is a dump. Yes it may take more than an hour to get your pizza (there is a secret to get your pizza a lot faster but if I told you it wouldn't be a secret, would it? Let me just say when I go there, I usually get it within 5 minutes). Yes they have no AC so it can become insanely hot in the summer. Yes $4 a slice is the most expensive slice I've ever paid for. However, I usually get a though. Comes out much cheaper that way. They favor their regular customers. They will serve their regular customers considerably faster than others. When there is a crowd, it gets very disorganized. Just fight your way to the front and order. Being agressive works to your advantage here. Talk to Dominic (the guy making the pizza) and he will like you and will know to serve you faster in the future. All that will help you. I still haven't and refuse to tell you the biggest secret though. Regardless of how long you wait, it is worth it though as this is the best pizza that exists. I have never met a person who didn't like it and about 75-80 percent of people I know would agree that this is by far the best pizza that exists. So what are you waiting for? Go there now.
