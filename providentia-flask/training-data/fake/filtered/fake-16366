My wife and I took my parents there for lunch and were greeted by stares from the staff with no greeting whatsoever despite there being only five people in the entire place. This was followed by a rude, abrupt waitress who acted like we had to speed talk to place an order. To cap off this wonderful experience, the pizza was non descript and Â the pasta tasted like it had been ordered from a diner. So poor, in fact, that my two kids, who normally love pasta, refused to eat theirs. Won't be back and will definitely not recommend this place to anyone.
