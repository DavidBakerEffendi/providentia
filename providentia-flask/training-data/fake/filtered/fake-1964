This place is phenomenal! I'm not sure why they are getting such horrible reviews. Yes, it is new and they don't take reservations and they clearly have a few kinks to work out in the seating department. So go there prepared to wait, have some drinks and oysters at the bar. It is absolutely worth it... the food was incredible and the staff was super friendly, the chef even came out to check how everything was after the meal. The seafood was so fresh and delicious, I will no doubt be going back again. The peel and eat shrimp were perfection! We ordered snow crab legs which were great, as were the fried clams, creamed spinach and crab cakes. The blue crabs were pretty good too, but not the best I've eaten. Everything was reasonably priced, and given the outrageous prices for seafood in New York, I'd say this place is great deal. Â All in all, I had a great experience. Just go there ready to wait and it'll be all good.
