Was once good for celebrations... BUT NOT ANYMORE...IF YOU HAVE A PARTY HERE, BE WARNED!!!! There is much to like about Jadis: the décor, the food & wine. Because of this we had eaten there and hosted parties in the lounge several times over the past 3 years. It had always was reasonably priced and that's with copious wine drinking. Sadly, the last party we hosted in December was an unfortunate exception to the rule and we (a party of 12) ended up being charged around $300 more than we should have been in wine. Actually, it was $500 over what was originally planned but I did order a few extra $25 bottles at the end of the night. That being said... THERE IS NO WAY THAT I or anyone else in our party ordered a total of 20 extra bottles for the 6 of us who hung around late.... When we politely disputed the bill, the Mgr. (who was REALLY RUDE and DISMISSIVE)  said that others must have ordered them without us knowing, but our waitress was gone and we did not save the empty bottles to count to prove what we had ordered. He could have said I ordered 500 extra bottles and I would not have had any proof! Even though I arranged the party, I was never asked about orders that I did not make. SO BE SURE TO SAVE YOUR BOTTLES FOLKS! Other than having to pay hundreds more than I had planned, it was ok, but looking back I could have gotten a lot more for the $1000 that I spent on a few apps and some ok  wine ...
