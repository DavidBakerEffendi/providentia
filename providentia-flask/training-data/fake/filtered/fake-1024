We are very picky about our BBQ, as my better half is a native Texan.  Whenever we go to Texas, our first stop, before doing anything else, is usually a drive-by to Good Company BBQ to pick up some ribs.  We've now eaten at Morgan's twice and both times have walked away convinced that this is the BEST Texas-style BBQ in New York.  The owner came from Texas (Austin and Houston) and understands how to make authentic Texas BBQ.  The brisket (we've had both lean and fatty) was amazing - and the pulled pork was equally so.  We don't often order chicken at BBQ restaurants - but the chicken here was cooked perfectly - it had so much flavor and there was no drying out as sometimes happens with BBQ.  We also love the BBQ sauce - not vinegary like North Carolina sauce.  The sides - including the green beans and the collared greens - were also excellent (and we are often not fans of sides in BBQ restaurants).  To finish, the pecan pie was delicious - it's made with bourbon - so not too sweet and just the way we like it.  I should also add - that on both of our trips, the staff was extremely helpful and nice.
