The food was great, but the customer service was terrible. Here's a brief exerpt of a blog post I had written about it 2 years ago: On May 6, 2007,  arrived at Jimmie's at 4:25.  Seated at 4:45. Waitress took order at 4:55. Salad was served at 5:25. Dinner was served at 5:35. In the meantime, at least 7 other parties were seated and served - with their dinners, salads, drinks, etc. - afer we had been seated.One of the parties that received service after we had been waiting for almost an hour to eat intervened with the manager, Lisa, to point out that we had not been served yet, and we were there ahead of them, and Lisa did not even come to our table to enquire as to the situation. When she did come 10 minutes later, she dismissed my wife's complaint about the service and then when I addressed her, she bcame rude, arrogant and racist. I haven't been back there since.
