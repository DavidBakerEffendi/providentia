I love this place.  It's got a real East Village vibe and although it is obviously new and getting itself up to speed, it's got a really impressive menu already and the food choices are innovative and yummy.  I love the drinks as well.  I had a delicious cocktail and I found the service to be very friendly.  I'm definitely going back.
