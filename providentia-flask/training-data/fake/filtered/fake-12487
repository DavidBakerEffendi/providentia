There are many ways to prepare a tuna "burger." For starters, one could serve a seasoned section of tuna steak grilled to rare or medium rare on a bun with condiments and the standard lettuce, tomato, and onion. Or, finely chopped tuna could be formed into a patty with seasonings and grilled to rare or medium rare. However, I would not advise serving ground (yes, actually ground, not finely chopped or minced) tuna cooked to a dry, tasteless, cat food-like texture and served merely with the same lettuce that comes in the accompanying salad. Perhaps the tuna was pre-cooked or canned and that's why they couldn't promise me even a medium-rare burger (apparently they "tried"). I suppose I should have known better than to follow through with my order once I realized the waitress couldn't explain to me how it was prepared. Perhaps you will enjoy Mooncake Foods, as most other reviews seem positive. But if you have any respect for tuna, wait until your next date with the sushi restaurant.
