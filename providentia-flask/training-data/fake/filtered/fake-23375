Awesome place! I went for a date here a few weeks back and it was one of the most romantic dates ever. We both were pretty full from lunch, so we just ordered pizza and wine. The pizza had the most delicately baked crust I have ever had and really well cooked toppings. The ambience is perfect for a romantic evening together, with minimal lighting and beautiful candles on every table and an old worldly charm around you. The price is a bit on the higher side, but compared to how costly the rest of New York City is and what a great experience it was, it was totally worth it.
