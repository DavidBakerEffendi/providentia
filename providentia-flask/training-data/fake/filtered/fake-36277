I've never written a review before so I'm not sure where to start.  I just got back from my first shot at sushi in philadelphia. When I told the concierge  that this was my first trip to Philadelphia and I asked where my friends and I could get good sushi, he recommended that we try Yakitori Boy.  All was well for the most part. My server jenny was excellent, the place was crowded and she was still able to check on our table every few minutes.  The yakitori and other hot dishes were really good as well.The sushi on the other hand was kinda crappy. The pieces were small, with not much fish, and a lot of rice, and barely stayed rolled long enough to eat.  Other then that the drinks were nice and stiff, and I had a great time.  I'm willing to give it a shot next time I'm in philly, the yakitori and service were great
