Avoid the Ear Inn if you want respectable food and there are a lot of great places to hear Jazz in New York.  The Ear Inn is not one them.  My party has been there on several occasions and noted more than once that the "musty odor" is more like urine.  The food is bland, the menu uninteresting.  Even the daily specials are as stale as day old pita bread.  We found the management to be on the cheap side, serving small portions, using cheap ingredients.  Mickey will even ask you to leave your seat before you are done with your after-dinner drink so he can get the next customer in.  For great food avoid this out-of-the-way dive and check out the multitude of wonderful restaurants in Greenwich village.  For great music on a budget pick up any local NYC guide to find off-the-beaten-path venues like Smalls.  Other great places include Jazz Standard and Village Vanguard.
