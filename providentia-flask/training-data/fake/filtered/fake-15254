I came here for restaurant week lunch with my sister who was visiting the city. The location was a little hard to get to, but the restaurant itself is located in a very pretty area, and you can admire the outdoor veggie gardens on your way in. Food, overall, was really disappointing. My sister ordered the rabbit appetizer (not on the website's menu), hanger steak (with the $5 supplement), and cheesecake, while I ordered the campanelle pasta (appetizer portion), grilled pork t-bone, and cheesecake. The appetizers and steak were beautifully presented but turned out to be only mediocre. The grilled pork was terrible -- it tasted like someone had doused it with soy sauce, and it was so salty that I could only stomach a few bites before giving up completely. The dessert was the only highlight of the meal. The other disturbing part was finding hair in the food -- there was a hair in the butter dish (with the bread), and another hair in my pasta. Really, now? Service was generally prompt and efficient. Since we went during a mid-week lunchtime, most of the other tables were occupied by an older crowd. All in all, I wouldn't come back again, for fear of getting another over-salted dish or something with a hair in it.
