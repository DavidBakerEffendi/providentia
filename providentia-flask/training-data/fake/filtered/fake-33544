I've had dinner twice at 983 now. It was great the first time and even better the second. I had both the garlic and pesto mashed potatoes. They were DELICIOUS. Creamy, full of flavor but not heavy. I also had the Mac and Cheese on my first visit with bacon. While the bacon was a little underdone for my liking, another order came out to our table that was perfect. Crisp and sprinkled over the top. I also had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. It was GREAT the first time I tried it. Tender, juicy and full flavored. The second time it was a little overcooked but still tasty. I wish the Blue Cheese Dressing was punchier. Overall, head over to 983 if you're looking for a great, affordable meal. The wait time is short and the staff couldn't be friendlier. It's nice to sit in a relaxed environment and not be rushed.
