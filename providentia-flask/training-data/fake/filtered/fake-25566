My family has dined here on many occasions and while the food is good, the service (of the owner specifically) is terrible! On this last occasion, we were forced to order both our appetizers and entrees even before the whole party sat down to look at the menu!  Given that not everyone had the chance to survey the menu, i didn't know what everyone wanted, which made the owner who was serving us become very agitated and rude.  Needless to say, our whole dinner was uncomfortably rushed.  This is just one experience of a few that have led me to form an opinion and stance.  Not going back.  Better dining experiences could be had elsewhere with business owners that genuinely care about their customers!
