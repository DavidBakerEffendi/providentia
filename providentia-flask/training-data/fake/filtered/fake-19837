Last night, I went to Vesta for the first time for my birthday with a date. The tables are so close together, which would have been ok, but the room noise and music made quiet conversation pretty impossible.  Good thing all the food was great.  And, well, it was a friday night at peak dinner time, so hey, what can you expect. So, yes, I will return, perhaps on a calmer day of the week.  I'm looking forward to the seasonal menu and locally grown food.
