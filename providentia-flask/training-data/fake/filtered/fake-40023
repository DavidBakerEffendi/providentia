I dont know what happened to this place ....and what all the good reviews are all about. THIS PLACE IS DIRTY!! THE PIZZA IS BURNT TO A BLACK CHARCOAL AND DID I MENTION ITS DIRTY!! I couldnt wait to try this pizza after hearing about how awesome it was.From what i understand it NOTHING  like it used to be. AND 28 DOLLARS FOR A BURNT PIE AND SOME DIRTY BASIL CUT WITH A DIRTY SCISSOR. Again i dont understand whats up with the good reviews . There are much much much better pizza joint out there Pizza Suprema in Manhattan and Lombardis in Manhattan  just to name a few that actually take pride in quality and cleanliness!
