My family and I were looking for a good place for dinner and we were in the area and we remembered that a friend had told us about Devil's Pocket, so we decided to go. We we got there we were pleasantly surprised. The placed was very clean, and tidy.    Once we got seated in a very comfortable booth, we were greeted and served by the fabulous waiter Andrea! She just had this warm vibe. Then my family and I ordered. I got the Hell in a basket fries and the cheeseburger! It was EXCELLENT!!! The burger was juicy and perfectly cooked and the fries were just "Mmm...Mmm...good!" In the end this was defiantly the best resturant choice I could of made. I'm coming back in a heartbeat!!! Great price, Excellent staff, and GREAT FOOD!
