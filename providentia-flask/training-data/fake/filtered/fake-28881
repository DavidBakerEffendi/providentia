My wife and I took our 5 year old and 2.5 year old here for lunch on a Sunday at noon.  The place was full, but we got a seat right away.  The menu is enormous and includes a greek section as well as many burgers, salads, and the deserts looked delicious.  Portions were very large.  We shared a spinach artichoke dip appetizer.  The corn chips and dip were very fresh and delicious - would feed 3.  I had a delicious reuben, kids had hotdog and other had french toast sticks that were enormous and crunchy delicious!  Wife had an ENORMOUS greek salad with chicken, would feed at least 2.  Service was prompt, courteous, and even on a very busy day, better than many restaurants i've been too.  We took home menus and will definitely be back.
