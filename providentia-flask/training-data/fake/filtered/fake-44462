* This place is very loud; it seems everything echoes like mad.   * Food took a while to be served. * Happy hour specials are not really as they seem - don't order the Nachos with chicken advertised as half off cause that doesn't count and don't expect the service to let you know!  To me it seems their selective happy hour selection is just a gimmick, if you go to Vaughn's downtown they have the best happy hour specials (The Advocate review is a joke).   * After 11 PM, too crowded by a younger crowd fighting for a bar spot (understandable I guess) * Burgers are pretty good; Nachos are over loaded and cold by the time they get to the table/bar. * Wings not so great  maybe  3 * s. * Since it's the only "Irish Bar" in W. Hartford, it does well, but I think one should visit either the Half Door or as mentioned above Vaughn's to put things in perspective.
