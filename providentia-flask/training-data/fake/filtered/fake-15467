My first time eating sushi! my boyfriend loves sushi and is always trying to get me to try it...so finally i did... Umai was great! the rolls i tried were very good and most importantly they were patient with me...i have very specific taste buds haha...and they made sure the dishes i ordered were prepared without certain sauces or spices...which is very important to me....they also did not give me a hard time about making changes to their dishes which was very nice.....our waitress was very nice and friendly and made some great suggestions...i will DEF be coming back here and bringing some friends with me!
