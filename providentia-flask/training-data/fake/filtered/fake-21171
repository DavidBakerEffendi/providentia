My intention was to review this place but I was never able to get to that point. The management seems to be totally inept. I emailed asking if I could get a gift certificate to give as a gift. They never replied, so I called. They took my credit card info a week before xmas and said they would mail the certificate to me. Xmas came and went. I have called 3 times to find out what happened. The manager has never even been courteous enough to return my call. Its now been 3 weeks and no reply. Explaining the situation to the person I was giving the certificate to will make me look like an ass. Why would I want to eat here if they can't run their business?
