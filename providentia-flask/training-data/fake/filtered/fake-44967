Extremely unprofessional. I am a teacher in Newark and often order from Hobbys. I ordered 2 sandwiches and left the main office with $32.00 assuming it was plenty for two sandwiches. About 30 minutes later I received a call from a woman at Hobbys stating that I did not tip the driver enough. Whether this was true or not, I found this to be extremely rude and unprofessional. Last time I order from Hobbys.
