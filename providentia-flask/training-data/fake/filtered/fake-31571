I'm just gonna say, that sangria got me drunk enough to download this app and warn yall about the side effects of drinking a few pitchers of the red sangria ... And those side effects may possibly include: baby making practice, missing work the next day, forgetting how strong it is and going back for more! Ps. The food was rich and delicious! the staff, Natalee who sat us quickly with no reservation was awesome, Felicia who got us drunk and was too sweet! (almost gave us diabetes) lol, I must say this is now my new favorite spot... Kudos to whomever is responsible for this establishment!!!
