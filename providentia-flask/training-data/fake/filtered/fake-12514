This is the official dinner of any red carpet screening at the Ziegfeld.  The wait is long, but that's part of the experience.  People drive here from all over the city to get great food to soak up the booze from the night. The cart starts at 7:30p - 4:00a, any other time it's another company.  Expect a wait of about 30 minutes average.  Sometimes it can be 15m if you're lucky or up to an hour if you're not.  There is a way to bypass this line, as this is New York and money talks. The food is AMAZING and many many times I wish I had a bigger stomach.  This is indeed my last mean on Earth.  Sometimes I would crave this on Monday and would not stop until I get it later in the week. They've now changed it to add your own sauce.  You can drown your combo rice in white sauce all you want, but definitely GO EASY on the spicy hot sauce!
