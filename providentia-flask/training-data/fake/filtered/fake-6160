The good: We had no problem parking right on the street outside the restaurant on a Friday night.  I would recommend a reservation - it was crowded!  The place is small - you are brushing up against people trying to get to your seat - but i liked the little mural on the wall and the cozy bustling mood inside.  Prices are fair and BYO is always a plus! The bad:  I was surprised by how small the portions were.  I am a relatively small woman and not used to leaving italian restaurants hungry!  However my biggest complaint was the tiramasu.  It seemed like a homemade jello pudding recipe, absolutely the worst tiramasu I've ever had, which was really disappointing when you are expecting "real south philly italian."  Overall this place was fine for somewhere to eat, I mean I'd rather go there than applebees, but didnt at all live up to all the good reviews I'd read.
