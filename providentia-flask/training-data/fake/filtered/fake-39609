We trekked out to Queens from the city on a Saturday night based on a recommendation from a friend. There was a wait, but our party of 6 was promptly seated when a table became available. They have a pretty good number system in place. We ordered family-style and got to try quite a few dishes. Each dish was flavorful and authentic (according to my friends who just got back from Thailand). The wine was not over-priced and the coconut ice cream was probably the best I've had.
