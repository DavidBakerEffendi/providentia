We have been a fan since they opened and were saddened to see them closed for 2 months during the christmas season. We tried our luck again last night to find out they have returned!! The Duck is the most flavorful duck I have EVER enjoyed (and I order duck wherever and whenever on a menu). The atmosphere was as relaxing as a spa and our server, Jessica I believe, was as friendly and on point as they come! We will continue to be devoted guests of Blu!
