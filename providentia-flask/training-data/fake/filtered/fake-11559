Let me just say this. Every time I'm at the bethwood, I'm treated with the utmost respect as a vendor. For years now I have worked alongside Steve Ranieri, the matre di, and I have to say, he's the reason events go smoothly there. A true professional in the industry. The bethwood is reasonably priced for all budgets, the food is pretty good, and the service is unparalleled. Highly recommended
