It screams speakeasy and secret and mysterious and I love that about this place.  The atmosphere is art deco but stunning in decor and very refreshing.  It can get packed in here on the weekends so it's best to come during the week.  Try all the cocktails.  Why not?  You come here to drink.  Eat, Drink and be Merry!
