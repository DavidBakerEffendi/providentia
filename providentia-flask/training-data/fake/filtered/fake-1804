I've visited this establishment a few times since it's opened. The food has been great, drinks are excellent however, I was turned off by the manager Jessica and her untactful regards towards guests along with the staff members. She is rude and unprofessional. It is sad to say but I don't see this restaurant standing long-term in our up and coming neighborhood of Long Island City with someone like her running Â this business. She will drive it to the ground.
