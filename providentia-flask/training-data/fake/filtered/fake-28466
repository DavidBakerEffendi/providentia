After several years Casa Mono continues to deliver a fantastic experience, tremendous service, and an excellent Spanish wine menu. We eat out virtually every meal and this is one of few in a consistent rotation, which is totally deserved. Make sure you make a reservation, because it is very small (unfortuneately not great for large parties, if ever I hear a bad review for Casa Mono, it is always a large 8+ group crammed in...) and fills up quickly for night. If you decide to wing it without a reservation you can walk in (if you are lucky) and sit at the bar. Watch the amazing chefs go to town Â in this intimate place is an experience you will totally enjoy! If you can't get right away and must wait, try Bar Jamon next door for a few tapas and wine while you wait. Bar Jamon is actually part of Casa Mono, and wonderful in its own right. Make sure you try the Pumpkin Goatcheese croquettes and the Duck Egg with Mojama amazing!
