Went here for dinner with a friend last night... heard they had great burgers. It was 8pm on a Saturday but the hostess seated us right away. The burger was good, nothing special, I've had much better for the price. But what really ruined it for me was the terrible customer service. While paying the bill the hostess told us we needed to hurry because we were holding up a table that had reservations for 30 minutes earlier. Â And then seconds later, while using the restroom before leaving we were asked again by someone else to please hurry up and leave. We weren't lingering, by any means, just finishing off a second beer. I'm used to paying for hyped-up and overpriced food in Williamsburg, it just comes with the territory, but I have never been treated like that in a restaurant. Such a shame. Needless to say I will not be returning.
