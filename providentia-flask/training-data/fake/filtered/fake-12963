My husband and I and two of our friends decided to try Calandra's Il Vecchio restaurant last night, 1/2.  I'd originally tried to make reservations the day before our visit but was told that reservations were only accepted for parties of 6 or more.  OK, so much for that.  We arrived to the restaurant the following evening at 7:40 PM.  It was crowded but we expected that.  When we asked the hostess how long the wait would be while giving our name for the waiting list she was very annoyed we asked the question.  Her response was " 30 minutes but the wait may be less."  OK, so much for that.  We waited for the appointed 30 minutes and still no seating.  With that, another party of 4 arrived and when they were told they'd have to wait, one of the women in that party said " What about that table over there?  I see an empty table."  Magically, the maitre'd seated them ahead of us.  With that, my friends, husband, and I all left this place and went to Pal's Cabin.  This was a very rude and disheartening experience.   Based on this unpleasant episode, none of us would ever recommend Calandra's to anyone.  It was just terrible.  A bunch of extremely nasty people seem to be running this place.
