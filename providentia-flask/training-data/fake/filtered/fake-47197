Definitely coming back.   I had the hummus and calimari for appetizer, trio grilled platter and mariscada for entree, and pistashio baklava for dessert.  Later we went to the back for some pretty awesome hookah, ($15), which was very reasonably priced and pretty smooth.  I'm really surprised this place only has a 2.5 Yelp average rating.  It must be the kids who go there for hookah expecting to share one set between their 7 friends and only spend 15 bucks while they take up a table for 8 people for 3 hours.
