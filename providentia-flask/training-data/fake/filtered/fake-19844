Going to Sugar Freak has become a monthly event for me and my friends. When we have guests from out of town, this is one of the sure destinations. The decor is festive, southern, deep friend and fun, although somewhat hipsterish. It's a popular weekend brunch option so there's sometimes a bit of a wait, but always worth it.
