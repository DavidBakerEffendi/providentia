The food is excellent but the service has been quite poor during my last two visits. Last night on NYE, the "computer" lost my order. I wasnt comped or even given a free cup of coffee for having to wait another 15 minutes while my fellow diners eated their orders. Nor was I even told what the problem was. And the kitchen was horribly slow as it was during a prior visit. Disappointing after much better experiences in prior years.
