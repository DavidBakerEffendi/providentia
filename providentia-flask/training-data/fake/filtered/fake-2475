Okay, first off a warning isn't always a bad thing. Lombardi's has to be a gift from a higher being. But beware that once you've eaten at this place, no other pizza is the same. Take your favorite pizza place before and you can compare that to licking a cat's litter box. I'm actually afraid; the next time I order pizza, it's going to be a day from hell. I wish I was exaggerating, but the fact of the matter is that I have been ruined. Seriously this pizza is good! I ordered a couple pizza pies and both were phenomenal. The toppings were top quality, the sauce didn't overwhelm the crust, the toppings or the cheese... absolute perfect balance. This is the way a pizza should be made, with every aspect complimenting the other in harmony. Some people want thick bready crust, some want sauce dripping out of every bite; this is all well and fine for a cheap delivery pizza on a binge drinking beer bong crazed "I don't care about flavor!" kind of night. But, Lombardi's is the place to go for quality tasted in every bite, the kind of flavor that will force your eye lids open and all those little hairs on the back of your neck shooting up. It's like winning the flavor lottery with every bite. So head to 32 Spring st. next time you're in Manhattan. Change your view of pizza... forever. You've been warned.
