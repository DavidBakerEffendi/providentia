Service was excellent, ambiance was lovely, and food and drinks were FANtastic.  Possibly the best bread I've ever had.  had calamari and tomato salad for appetizers.  both were soooo fresh. I got mussels for dinner and can't stop thinking about them - perfectly cooked with tender chunks of bacon and garlic...h'oh my god.  tasted my friends meals too - also fantastic. new york strip steak was cooked to perfection.  for dessert we had the banana bread...great size to share.  banana and chocolate mousse, moist bread, homemade ice cream...Ah! pricing for quality is also exceptional.  i highly recommend.
