I've been three times-always cozy, always tasty. The first time I had chicken milanesa and the mate braised short ribs, second time the braised short ribs, third time the tilapia. My first two experiences I had to create every single bite with care because the food was perfect.  Chicken crisp, slightly seasoned...the mate braised short ribs were the best I ever tasted.  The meat was tender and flavorful throughout, the sauce was rich with the perfect amount of flavor, and the mashed boniato-like a perfect mashed potato with a hint of sweetness. The third time scared me.  After having considered this the perfect restaurant, the quailty of food went down-not sure why, different cook?  I had tilapia, which was well cooked, but not very flavorful.  The braised short ribs looked different-it looked as if they weren't cooked as slowly, not as flavorful, the sauce wasn't a rich.  I almost cried. Chocolate lava cake is awesome, as usual.
