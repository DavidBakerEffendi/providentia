Houston Midtown has a very nice decor, nice lighting, and just the right level of background noise. Good for a date or a group of friends. The Cali burger was great with fresh avacados and they offer many sides in place of fries. The fries are the shoestring kind which I don't really like, and are pretty greasy. The drinks are good but weak and expensive. The staff however is very friendly. They deserve 4 stars for the food and service but I think they're overpriced.
