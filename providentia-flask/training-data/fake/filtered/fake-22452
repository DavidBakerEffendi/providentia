Being a huge fan of Italian food I always try to find new awesome spots in the city! And recently I found Piccoli Trattoria Place! The food is fantastically delicious in there! Ravioli with mascarpone cream, grilled Â calamari, all kinds of pasta, desserts, breads and gourmet wines - everything's on a top! Great service as well! I'll definitely going back there again soon!
