My husband and I came for dinner on a Friday night. We did not have reservations and boy was Â I sorry I didn't make one. Next time i will call and make one for sure. The 2 friendly hostesses told me it would be a bit of a wait but the cute tapas bar in front made the wait totally pleasurable. The best part about our wait was the talented bartender who knew exactly what we needed. Best drink have had in a long time! The hostesses came to take us to our table and we were almost sad to leave the bar. But once we walked into the dining room we were pleasantly surprised. Beautiful atmosphere, great service that's just the right amount of attention, and the food was amazing. TimeOut NY was spot on with their assessment of the rosejat rapido. It deserves best dish in NYC for sure! I could eat this dish every day. It can get a tad loud but this is NY after all and it's always a good feeling to be in a busy place. So I can deal with it happily. All in all Salinas is a great place and I can't wait to go back!
