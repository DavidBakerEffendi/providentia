My wife and I have eaten here a few times.  I must say this last time is the last time!!  If you're looking for a good (expensive) pizza and half way decent mussels then go and enjoy.  If you actually want a nice dinner save your time and money.   We've tried the calamari, lobster ravoli (which knowing seaford I swear was stuffed with crawfish  - " cheap man's lobster") and not real lobster chunks.  The free range chicken was dryer then eating a cotton ball.  The vegetables are greasy and the portions are tiny and the pricing is way out of whack with the quality!!!  Even more, ordering take out....no bread, no salad with entress and no lemon with calamari.  This place should be a deli, serving pizza and sandwiches...then I may, may, consider going back.   BTW....my wife and I eat out a lot, I speak from experiences...both good and bad.  On the other hand, your better off going to your local butcher or seaford market and cutting your loses.
