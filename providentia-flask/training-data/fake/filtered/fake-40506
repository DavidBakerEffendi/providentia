The place is immaculate since the renovations. I love the pressed tin ceiling. Everyone was very friendly. The food was phenomenal tried the porcupine shrimp which were the most delicious thing I'd had in weeks, but that was only bettered by the braised short rib which melted in my mouth. My server was friendly, he explained the local beers for me and I ended up trying a bunch of them. I signed up for a frequent diner membership because they brought us little free versions of their bread pudding. When you sign up they give you a $10 "thanks for signing up" gift card, 25 bucks every year on my birthday, and all kinds of other stuff. I'm so excited to go back there with my girlfriend next time.
