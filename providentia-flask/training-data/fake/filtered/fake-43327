My wife and I was recomended by an indian friend to try this restaurant.  We went there on a weekend at about 5.45 pm. The restaurant was not full. The  server  welcomed  and seated us in a nice way. Food was good. But wait.... My wife has alergic reaction to MSG. We knew indian restaurant do not use this msg Whilst still in the restaurant, she had to take her medication. I then approached  one of the waiter, who infd he will check with the chef and came back about a minute later  and told me there was no msg in the food. Well this was not the truth  from the chef. The food tasted good because there was msg in it. I would never want to try indian food again...never.
