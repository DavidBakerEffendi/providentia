Came here for the first time on a Monday night and it was very busy.  I met a friend and we had the best time.  From the moment we walked in the door until the moment we left (after dessert of course!) we were satisfied.  The service was amazing.  The manager Scott was very accommodating although it was busy.  There was a wait so we decided on sitting at the bar and our bartender Olga was so superb and fun. We were just blown away by everything. I will definitely be back.
