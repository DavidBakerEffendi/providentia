Philippe Massoud has a story to tell at Ilili (which means tell me). Ilili is a high end, contemporary Lebanese restaurant, located in the Flatiron district. Massoud's culinary tales are woven into the nouveau Lebanese cuisine he's created that draws on his beginnings in hospitality in Beirut and experiences that followed suit in the United States. The space is expansive. There is a funky lounge area, a large dinning area, several private rooms and a DJ to set the mood. One would really expect to find this kind of place in the Meatpacking District. The brunch at Ilili, which was recently introduced, pairs classic American offerings with a Middle Eastern twist. These inventive combinations present a great alternative to traditional brunch dishes. It is priced at $25 for a cocktail and two courses from the brunch menu. Dessert is not included but definitely worth trying. I'm going to go back to try out their lunch and dinner deals for sure. Everything we tried ranged from good to very good. So, if you are looking for something a little different to do on a weekend morning...mosey on down to Ilili for brunch and tell them that the Restaurant Fairy sent you along for some good eats.........
