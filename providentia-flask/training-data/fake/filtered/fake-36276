I did not like the private room. It was cramped and hot. There was too much competing noise from the outside. Me and my girls were constantly peeking out to see what was going on. They ordered food. It was good but the portion was too small for the price. I'm a singer. I live to sing for people so I paid $5 to sing three songs. They only let me sing 1. I would go back though. Fun, party atmosphere.
