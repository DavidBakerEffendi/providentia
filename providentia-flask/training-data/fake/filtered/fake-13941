Went for lunch and took 1 and 1/2 hours. Waitress was pretty bad. Pizza was so under-seasoned. Tasted like white bread with crushed tomatoes on top. Meatballs were only great dish, but because of the horrible experience could not enjoy them. Would not recommend for anything but ambiance. Which at least made a weekday 2 hour lunch almost worth it.
