We went their for brunch because all the reviews I read and because of the Philly Mag shout out. Greek food is by far one of my favorites ever since I traveled to Greece last summer. So clearly I was looking forward to this. The four of us all got the specials. I got the pork they were roasting outside. We got a dipping platter and a the Kanella Platter for the table. The dips and things were very delicious. The stuffed grape leaves had something in them I have never had before, it was quite a pleasant surprise. As far as the main dishes go they were good. Not great, just good. They missing that "zest" and amazing flavor I tasted in Greece. Maybe if we had gotten the regular menu items it would have been different. For desert we all had Baklava. It was incredible! So I will definitely be returning. I highly recommend this little spot.
