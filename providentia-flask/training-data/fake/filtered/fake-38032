Upon moving to the upper west side I was on a hunt for the best bar and restaurant in the area. This is it! If you're looking for great food, look no further. Everything I've tried has been made with the utmost care for flavor and the portions are huge! Their biscuit sandwiches are light and fluffy and their pancakes with fried chicken and bacon are the best pancakes I've been able to find in NYC. They've even made grits a must-order item on their menu. And of course, their pickles are crispy and flavored to perfection. Their service has always been great and I have no complaints. As for the bar, if there's an open chair, grab it! The bartenders are friendly and make a damn good Manhattan. Their selection of craft beer is one of the better selections I've come across at a very reasonable price. The lines can be long depending on what time you drop by, but it is well worth the wait. If you're looking to sample their food and beverage selection without too much of a wait, just head in for an early dinner and if you want to stay for the night, head on over to the bar. This is always the first place I recommend when people ask me for a restaurant or bar suggestion!
