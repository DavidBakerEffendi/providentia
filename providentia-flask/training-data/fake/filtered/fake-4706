Overall, I really enjoyed my experience at Blue. I love to go to fine dining restaurants, and I think that I am able to identify good food when I see and taste it (the food at Blue was exquisite). With that said, the staff at Blue were completely mystified as to how to accommodate me, a vegetarian. Most restaurants in this day and age have at least a few menu items that are vegetarian and vegan. Even at other well-known high-end restaurants (the Todd English and Daniel Balouds of the world), there are a few vegetarian/vegan options. At Blue, there was literally no vegetarian entree available. I very much appreciated the staff and Manager's attempt to accommodate me, as they asked me what kind of dish I wanted -- but eventually it was up to me to design a meal for myself (a pasta dish), when I would have preferred to experience the creativity of the chef and what Blue had to offer (in which the only creative confine would be that the meal be vegetarian). Â  I really don't think that vegetarian and vegans should have to miss out dining at a place like Blue. The restaurant is beautiful, the tomato soup I had was absolutely delicious, as was the bread pudding dessert, as well as the avocado carpaccio appetizer we had. I know this restaurant is capable of producing a fine vegetarian meal. So I ask the managers of this establishment -- please expand your entree options for vegetarians, and you will open up a new customer base!
