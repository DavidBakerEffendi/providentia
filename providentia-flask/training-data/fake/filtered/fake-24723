Food quality and service are absolutely stellar.  Bread (Naan) is definitely better than your average Indian restaurant.  And the rest of the food too.  Prices are relatively low (Mango Lassi only $3).  A lot of vegan and vegetarian options.  Ambiance are not top notch and there are no table clothes under a glass table plate but the place and bathrooms are clean.  I can't figure out the reason for bad reviews here.  We used the restaurant.com coupon but would have gladly paid the bill if I hadn't had the coupon.
