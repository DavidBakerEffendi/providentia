ELM PARK INN NOT A GAY  FRIENDLY ESTABLISHMENT I've been going to this restaurant  under two owners for about 25 years.. Last night my wife and I had an extremely unpleasant experience due to an offensive comment made by the entertainment. We are a maried gay couple and were subject to a slew of unfortunate and offensive anti gay remarks made by the singer in an apparent attempt to relate to the audience. This person did not recognize my wife and I as gay until I called attention to his remarks.  No one in the audience commented or joined the confrontation in any way. When I alerted the owner he told me that he couldn't control the entertainment and that he was excersising his freedom of speech. It was very clear to me that he was unconcerned with my comfort particularly when I told him that I would never return. Thank you to Jackie the waitstaff who did come to our defense and force the guy to appologize for his remarks on mic. Too late . I did not accept. Paid my bill and will never return.
