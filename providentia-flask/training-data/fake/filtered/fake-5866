This is easily my top choice for fine Italian cuisine.  Everything is perfect.... the food, the ambiance, the service.  The Eggplant Rollatine, Shrimp Scampi and Gnocchi are my favorites.  There's simply no comparison to any other Italian Restaurants in Princeton or anywhere nearby. This is 100% authentic Italian food, and I feel so lucky to have it in my own backyard!  Divine.
