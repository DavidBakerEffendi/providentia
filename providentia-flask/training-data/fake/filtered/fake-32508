Have been ordering there for years.  And me being a vegetarian and always ordering shrimp parm dinners from them, they gave me a veal parm meal and after eating some of it then realizing its not shrimp call them about it and they send me the right order.  now im feeling sick of course and the guy comes over and tells me i ordered veal.  Now when have i ever ordered that it all these years.  So i don't recommend this place.  If this is how they treat there regulars, how will they treat there newbies?
