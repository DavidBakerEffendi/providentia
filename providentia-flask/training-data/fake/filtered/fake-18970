4 stars . me and my finders ordered a large half Margarita, half plain.  Couldn't have come out any better.  Crust was thin and crispy, the mozzarella was fresh, and the best part, the sauce was the best.  Reminded me of the sauce my Italian grandmother makes back home.  Delicious.  Ordered another medium we enjoyed it so much.
