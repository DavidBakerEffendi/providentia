I love Alfonso's!  Everyone is very friendly and accommodating.  The food is delicious.  They have amazing pizzas, available as pies or single slices.  Alfonso's was the first place I tried a Penne pizza and I have to say it is delicious!  If you are getting pasta you get a large portion which is great for sharing or for lunch/dinner the next day!  Overall I HIGHLY RECOMMEND dining in or taking out at Alfonso's!
