This is THE best indian restaurant in new haven, hands down.  they have good deals on food from monday to wednesday (15% off, as of lately), and their weekend lunch buffet is exceptionally reasonable.  The wait staff is incredibly friendly.  The service is fast, even when it's busy.  And the food is always served perfectly. I go there all the time because it's right down from my apartment in wooster square, and i have been here probably once a month for the last year and a half, so i speak from experience-  this is a must-see.  it's not on chapel street but who cares?  there's a reason they've been around for so long.
