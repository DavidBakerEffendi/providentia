Obsessed with this place! Best Chicken Teriyaki bowl in NYC! The menu is amazing - super easy to mix, match, create your own dish. The space is super clean, modern, and inviting. Young crowd looking for good food at good prices. Great addition to the neighborhood. My buddy had a burger and was raving about it.
