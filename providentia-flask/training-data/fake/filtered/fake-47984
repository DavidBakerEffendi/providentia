i dont recommend this place. the food is overly saturated and dulls your mouth after 2 bites, but thats nothing compared to the service.... THE service is despicable. Wan to be treated poorly and be under appreciated for your patronage? Then it's Our House for you! 30 minute wait. Ok. Add another 30 minutes. That's fine. 2 hours later. Ok. Being told to go to another restaurant. Deplorable. A good friend sticking up for you and finding three empty tables in the restaurant! Absurd. Our House, Bad food, Bad service, good riddance.
