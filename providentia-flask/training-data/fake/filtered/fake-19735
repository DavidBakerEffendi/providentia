Great place to find Eastern European groceries. If you are looking for old world authentic meats, this is the place. No frills, no sparkle, just good real food. They specialize in sausages. Numerous kinds of kielbasa, kishka, several wursts, head cheeses, and other stuff I didn't know existed. They do whole roasts for parties (pigs, lambs, goats). He also does custom game meat processing for hunters. A real treasure right here in Hartford.
