2 stars We went to Enoteca Maria because of the real good reviews. To be frank, I was disappointed by the look of the restaurant. Initially we waited for 30-35 mins to be seated and then waited for ~45-50 mins to get attended, meanwhile they didn't even offer water during the time. Noise - 1/5 Crowd - 2/5 Service was ok but we had to wait like 45 min to order(not enough staff) - 2/5 Too little place for seating and its not comfortable - 2/5 Food - 3/5 Definitely not going again!
