Overall the food is very good and the drinks as well.  The Staff is very good too.  I remember being greeded by Nichole whom may be the manager.  I only say this because she is knowledgeable, professionable, and friendly.  Well if if she is not the manager she should be, anyway I enjoyed my visit because of her and the other employees.
