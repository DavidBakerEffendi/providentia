Perfect for gluten and lactose intolerant customers. Found this restaurant while walking around Princeton last March. My daughter and I are gluten and lactose intolerant and I am allergic to tomatoes. We are the diners from hell for most restaurants. We are not easily Â pleased but the chef made me a delicious meal of Indian chicken with saag but without any cheese or tomatoes. My daughter had the spicy chick pea and chicken dish that she loved. He also made us a lentil dish without tomatoes to share which was wonderful too. Everything was very tasty and perfect for our dietary needs. We had a very enjoyable late lunch (3:00pm), the price was very reasonable and the staff were very nice and accommodating. Roman was our waiter and he was terrific. We are going back this Sunday to eat there again.
