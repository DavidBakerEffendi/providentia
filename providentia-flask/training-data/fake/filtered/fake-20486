We went as two couples trying to catch up.  The noise level made it hard for me to hear my boyfriend let alone the other couple. The food was nothing special.  The crab tacos where a major disappointment.  We only got 1 of the 2 orders of edamame dumplings and the chicken fried rice was nothing to write home about.  Are guests said that it was a bad night as they have been there before but that the place is usually hit or miss. I would not reccommend giving them another chance.
