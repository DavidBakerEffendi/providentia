Very quick, very friendly service.  Was in and out in 10 minutes on a weekday during the noon hour.  Had the pepper turkey sandwich (with amazing peppercorn dressing).  It blew my mind.   Fantastic sandwiches, no more expensive than getting a sandwich at any other deli near here, and it's way better!
