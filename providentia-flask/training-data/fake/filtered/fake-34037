DONT GO!  I just had a horrible experience at this restaurant.  We have gone to Greek Taverna many times and have generally liked the food.  Tonight we went and were served ROTTEN DESSERT.  When I alerted the waitress that it didnt taste right she went back to the counter and her and the other waiters and kitchen staff examined the dish and had a good laugh.  I alerted the hostess of what was going on and she said she would comp the dessert. I said I wanted my whole meal ($40) comped and she refused.  She then called the owner who also refused to comp my meal. It was a terrible experience and I warn anyone from trying this place.  I am going to bed now hoping I dont wake up with a horrible stomach flu!!
