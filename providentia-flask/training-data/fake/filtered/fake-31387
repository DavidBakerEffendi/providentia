We were so pleased with this restaurant on our last visit to TriBeCa...pies were the best we've ever had. Family enjoyed everything from the mac n cheese to the organic salmon and chicken.  If visiting NY, this is worth the drive to Hudson St.  They also have a spot on the High Line that serves pies and homemade ice cream and pop.
