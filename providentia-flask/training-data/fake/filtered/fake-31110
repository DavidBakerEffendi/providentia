I started the evening with a Hawthorne in Your Side: it's difficult to balance and mix with the smokiness of Laphgroaig's 10-yr whiskey, but this place has figured out to do it. The Hawthorne lands very near to the top of my all-time favorite cocktails list. For anyone who loves dry aged steak, the Cambridge Hall's a dry aged beef burger with wine poached pears is an excellent option. The breadth of draft beers on tap is impressive as well. We sat at the bar and the bartenders were incredibly knowledgeable and attentive (my water glass was never less than half empty). Not much more you could ask for a restaurant.
