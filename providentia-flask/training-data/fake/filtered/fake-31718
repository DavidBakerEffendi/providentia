went in looking for a drink and some bar food but were pleasantly surprised to find the food is fantastic.  atmosphere is definitely a bar scene, but food is 5 star! Bartender and staff are very friendly.  Happen to be sitting next to the owner at the bar but did not find that out until we were leaving.  Great guy, very humble!  we will definitely return.
