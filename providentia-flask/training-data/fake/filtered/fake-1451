Like most people I find the Viennese ambiance enticing.  It is a bit pricey but someone has to pay for the wood panelling.    The quality of the cakes is good even if not worth the price.  The goulash is good but expensive.   Wish they had more hot food as there isn't a lot to choose from for main courses.  Check the opening times before going.
