Went back and hit Wednesday night, figured it would be slow and I could enjoy a plate of little briny guys. I figured wrong. Busy, busy and more busy. Had a cocktail around the corner and got a text that the bar was open. Very clever and helpful that they text you when there are openings for seating. This place gets it, and it gets me. Every damn time. The food, service is always solid. Ohh and the music is great and you can actually hear yourself talk and think. Very different than most places in the hood.
