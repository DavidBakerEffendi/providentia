What a wonderful selection of wine, food,etc coupled with great service! Â I didn't go to the restaurant prior to the remodeling, but I think it's such a beautiful place now and I'm SO GLAD that I only live 3 blocks away! I do wish that they had liquor options, vs. just wine and beer, but as an avid wine drinker, I'm about 99% ok with this!
