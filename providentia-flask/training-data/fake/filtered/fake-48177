Rude, dirty, expensive. The men behind the counter were not empowered, or did not understand good customer service. They refused to refund my money after I saw a bug on the wall. They said it could not be done and were afraid of the owner. They Â could not reach the manager when I asked to speak with her. Perhaps this is an attempt at the "Belgian experience", yet I have had nothing but good experiences in that country. I will spend $5 - 10 for fried potatoes in another establishment.
