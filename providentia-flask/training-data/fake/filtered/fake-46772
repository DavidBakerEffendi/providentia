curries in buffet tastes bad all the time especially vegetarian curries, once they had to take out the whole curry because it was smelling like they prepared two days back( can't they chk of before placing it on the buffet?)  . Appetizers, dosa are kind of ok. Biryani does not taste good every time, out of 4 times I eat the biryani only once it was ok.  Curries not good at all
