I disagree with the two dollar sign ($$) rating. The London Grill is ala cart and when you add everything up that you would get with an entree at most $$ restaurants, you are up to $$$! I am said girlfriend of Daniel S. (see his review on 2/20/12) and we ate there on 2/19/12 with my daughter. It wasn't that busy and yet the service was terrible. They were out of the first four things we tried to order! My daughter and I ended up ordering the butternut squash ravioli. We received 6 - yes SIX literally - raviolis apiece for $10 per plate! (My bf said 8-10--WRONG!) Good thing we added on vegetables for about $5 more per plate. The carafe of wine we ordered for $21 was your basic cheap house wine. Do yourself a favor and go to one of the BYOBs in the area - at least you'll get good wine. The little bit of food we received WAS very good. They gave us a free dessert to compensate for all the things they were out of, and while we ordered three desserts altogether, we still left hungry and feeling ripped-off. Â Overall, I would NOT recommend The London Grill.
