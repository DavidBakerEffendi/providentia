After hearing so much about this place in Tribeca I decided to try it out with some friends from LA - they actually enjoyed it, since they are used to that kind of scene/attitude. Food is expensive for what it is, but the service was lacking in every possible way. Slow service and a bitchy attitude at the door. I think it is overpriced for what it is. Nothing special to write about...
