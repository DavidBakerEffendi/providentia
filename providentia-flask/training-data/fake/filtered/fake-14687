We were kind of the assholes. We walked in and asked for a table and then walked out again and demanded to be seated outside even though there weren't any tables, so they were like fuck you, you can sit on our bocci court. When we got out there it started raining. The waiter kept looking at us weird. He kept looking at the sky, and then looking at us, and we were like, it should be fine. And then he forgot about us. We were sitting there for at least 20 minutes and nothing happened. I got bocci court sand all over me. Finally I asked the bus boy for a menu and he said "oh, right." My friend ordered some wine from the bus boy. Then we kept waiting. A few other tables were seated and served meanwhile. Finally the waitress came over apologetically. My friend got her wine: 4 ounces, 9 bucks. She got two this way. We got two Coq au vins. It came pretty quickly. It was in a little ceramic bucket. It was too damn salty. There were two carrots in my friend's and no potato. There was no starch element. There was no bread or anything. It was weird. Because you had to then spoon the gravy. It was decent though. It was pretty tender. I mean, it was alright. We gave them a mediocre tip but that was only because they were cash only and we had only just enough. Had the service been even remotely better we would have gone and gotten more cash. But we were like, fuck it. Overall the food was passable, the prices were reasonable, the service was not good. Their garden is nice. If we hadn't been on the bocci ball court it would have been nicer.
