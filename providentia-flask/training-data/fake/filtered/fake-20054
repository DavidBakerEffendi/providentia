Having just moved to West Caldwell and craving some Hibachi we ended up in Parsippany at Sakura.  It was a Thursday night and not the busiest, but that was expected and we were sat alone, which was fine for us, a little odd, but fine. Chef was good, I've had better, but also had much worse, my biggest issue with this place are their prices are very out of touch.  Coming from Bergan County and frequently going to Mt Fuji, I expected much of the same (and well the same for all other hibachi places).  The meats/fish were priced normal as other places in the area, but as we were ordering we were asked if we wanted fried rice/noodles.  I thought to myself, odd question, but maybe a precaution for gluten allergies, not a big deal.  When the bill came, both sides were changed (first I've ever seen, really pissed me off; as well as my normal pet peeve of soda refills being changed).  Coming from Mt Fuji, where you get the sides + a salad/appetizer bar, this felt very dirty. I wouldn't have minded the extra charges, but the food really didn't justify it.  There are better places in the area, I know for myself I will not be returning, and I guess driving 20 miles east is how my hibachi fill will happen now.
