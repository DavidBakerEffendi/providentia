Are you kidding me?  I really don't get the hype on this place.   My husband and I are vegetarians.  Our first clue that Firebox would be disappointing should have been when we determined there was only one vegetarian dish on the entire "farm to table" menu.  In spite of that, we gave it a try.   We both order the chickpea gnocci, which is the most expensive dish on the menu.  We were served a $30+ pile of flavorless mush covered with steamed vegetables.  The vegetables made it look pretty but the gnocci was just awful.  I started with a kale salad and my husband started with the market salad.  Both were good but it's hard to screw up a salad. We went with another couple who are carnivores.  One ordered mussels with a side of greens and was underimpressed.  The other ordered a pork dish.  Apparently the pork dish was good but not worth the asking price. For dessert I order the strawberry shortcake.  The strawberries didn't look fresh even though I went in the middle of June, prime strawberry season.  The cake was ok and the sabayon was flavorless and very disappointing.  My husband had the smore.  The marshmellow was delicious as was the ice cream but the cake was disappointing. On the positive side: the food is presented nicely, the waitstaff is very friendly (albeit slow), the space itself if absolutely beautiful and the bread was fantastic - but is made offsite, I belive by the Hartford baking company. For me this place is all hype.  I expected spectacular flavor from fresh ingredients.  What I got was subpar food at ridiculous prices.  If you like to overpay, this is the place for you.
