WORST BARTENDER IN NEW YORK - RICHARD (Saturday night at Moto) So unfortunate that this awesome music venue has some DREADFUL individuals as employees. Had one drink with TERRIBLE service and when asked with error about bill he REFUSED service and asked us to leave. Â UNKIND UNREASONABLE UNFRIENDLY and JUST PLAIN MISERABLE! BOYCOTT MOTO !!!!!!!!!!!
