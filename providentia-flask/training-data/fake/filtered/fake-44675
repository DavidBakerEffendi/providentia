LaVa Cafe is becoming a staple of the up and coming graduate hospital make over.  This quaint cafe has all the charm of a mom and pop restaurant and all the hip of a gallery/coffee spot. I have read some of the reviews on this site and some people seem to be writing about a different place.  Not only is this the best cafe this side of Broad but the others near by leave much to be desired, Beauty Shop has a tendency to move at the speed of weight loss while talking your ear off about nothing, ants pants is cute however the rush in there is overwhelming especially for the staff  who seem slightly unshowered (we call this place no-down-under pants) and darlings has great cheesecake but their specialty coffee is from the pods and not so fresh.  In which case by default LaVa is above par.   The staff at LaVa is friendly, nice, and the food is actually very very good, homemade breakfast and lots of good stuff.
