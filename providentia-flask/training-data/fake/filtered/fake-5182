I ate here last weekend.  The space is small but warm, with the hue of a fireplace, staff all very kind sincere, as if it were one's home. I could tell from the regular's at the bar and the tables that this place has been in business for a long time partly due to the faithful patronage of Soho locals.   The prices are fair, large selections of wine ranging from cheap to not so cheap.  And the menu, huge in selection all under $30. The food... delicious and generously portioned. My friend had the cassoulet which was a hearty mix of white beans lamb and sausage topped with a whole leg of duck confit.  She forced it upon me saying that it reminded her of her mother's cassoulet recipe that she ate growing up in the south of france. Super good for the belly in winter. I had the Steak Frite which honestly was a flavorful sirloin cut with not much fat for being the cheapest steak on the menu. ( I have had worse cuts for more money at some other bistro/brasseries in this city.) The Service was attentive and actually helpful. It just seemed to me that this restaurant served hearty homemade food that was French without any of that NYC pretense.   It's my new place.
