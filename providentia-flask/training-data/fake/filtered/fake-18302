We went as a group of ~8 for dinner, after a couple of the group had enjoyed a lunch here.  Even they were surprised at the extensive wait, and the portion/price ratio.  Others have noted the 'patio'. The furniture looked like it was purchased from a condemned high school. Traveling past the bar to the dining area was difficult to manage. The Servings were small, and expensive.  I don't mean that they could have been a little larger; Several of us literally walked around the corner to the Subway shop, on Park, due to lingering hunger. I guess cannibals must be pretty thin. The pig's head looked nice, but was too pricey. The food we received was long in coming, and nothing special.  The bartenders were nice. Wait staff . . . as they say above,  "meh".
