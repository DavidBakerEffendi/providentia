The best fried chicken ever! There's a sweet brick walled back room to savor your meal. Loved the grits, greens and biscuits. Can't wait to try the Huevos Ranchero for brunch. It looks like take-out from the street, don't be fooled, there's room for everyone. It's about time we found a restaurant with great food and no 'tude.
