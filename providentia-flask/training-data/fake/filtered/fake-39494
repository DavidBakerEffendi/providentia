We don't eat "in" here very often because it is BYO, however the food is EXCELLENT and we are never disappointed, even with take-out. The complimentary bread (especially the cheese foccacia) and dipping oil that comes with your meal (even with take-out) is outstanding, and my favorites are the penne vodka as well as the antipasto misto.
