I visited Blue Cat for the first time last night with my boyfriend. We started our dining experience off with the empanada and the mushroom/asparagus "cat-apps" - both were super tasty, and I was very pleased with the speedy service. For entrees, I choose the steak special, while the bf ordered the chicken and rice dish. Overall, the food was flavorful and fresh, and I give the dining experience an A-OK 3 stars. I left satisfied, but the meal did not blow my mind, by any means. Before I continue, let me snob-ishly confess that I have been to over 30 BYOBs in the city, and am probably a tough critic for the Blue Cat. The A-OK rating of 3 could possibly be attributed to the fact that my expecations were off. Most BYOBs I frequent have a romantic vibe to them, while Blue Cat is well lit, the noise from other patrons was quite loud and there are paper knapkins on the tables, given it more of a casual vibe. I almost felt odd drinking a nice bottle of wine. I also really wish there was music playing to cut down on the noise from the other patrons, but either way, I could barely hear my bf as he talked two feet away. I also could not cut through my steak, due to the casual silverware. Given, this is a new restaurant and the steak was a special, I don't feel like they were fully prepared to serve this meal. When I asked for a steak knife, the waitress brought out a bright yellow fruit knife from the kitchen and said this was all they had. I happily accepted the knife, as it cut the meat much better, but overall I found the situation a bit humerous. To make a long story short, I will most definitely go back to Blue Cat, but this time it will be for a lunch date, and I will be bringing a six-pack of beer and ordering one of the yummy salads or sandwiches they offer.
