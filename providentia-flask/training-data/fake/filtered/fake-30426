i don't get it. I have lived in this area my entire life. I grew up on cheesesteaks. Over a half an hour wait for a cheesesteak with fried onions??? This is fundamental and basic. Should take 5 minutes TOPS. Never have I seen such an inefficient process. They took a dozen orders at at time and STARTED OVER EACH time. The grill should be cooking meat as long as there is a line - then add the extras to each. Keep the line moving. This sandwich was not all that fabulous either. It's a cheesesteak, definitely not the best and hardly worth the ridicuous wait. The other people in my party got a roast pork and special cheesesteak and they were out the door and had finished eating 15 minutes before I got my batch-made, apparently very time-consuming, cheesesteak with fried onions. I ate it in the car on the way home. It was ok but see no reason to return.
