I love this place.  I have visited on many occasions for different purposes from lunch meetings with clients to Happy Hour with co-workers to a big family dinner over the holidays. We always have a great time and Steve, the bartender, always takes great care of us. The food is delicious and worth every cent.  Their HH menu is fantastic, you can't beat getting a pizza and good quality wine. I encourage anyone looking for a place to eat in the area to check it out. Thank you Stella, keep up the good work!
