I have been coming here for years. It was a great space to spot a celebrity as in the past we have seen Alan Rickman, Harvey Fierstein, Chita Rivera and others here. And the food used to be good. The food has slipped however. They used to have great burgers but last time the meat tasted like it was old or had soured. Â It's not as good as it used to be and I'd rather pay for good food than the hopes of seeing someone famous. You are paying for the experience of seeing a Broadway instiution but this institution has seen better days.
