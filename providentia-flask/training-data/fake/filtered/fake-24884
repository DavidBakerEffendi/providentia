As a Venezuelan i can tell you that this is exactly what our food taste like! Theres no question about it. From what i had everything is in the right place, and I totally recommend it. My favorite is the arepa with Guayanesse cheese, avocado, sweet plantains and pork.... MY GOD! Â And of course our national beer POLAR lovely as always! Go now! You'll love it!
