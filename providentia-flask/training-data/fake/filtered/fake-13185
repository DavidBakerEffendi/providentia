This is a fabulous place to get some college type food... I'm talking subs with chicken cutlets, mozzarella sticks, fries, cheese, and gravy all in one( the godfather sandwich) The food here is really tasty and I suggest come in and check it out instead of listening to a review from people who find the taste bad because of the look. My favorite part about the place is the selections of things to drink! You can have a bottled coca-cola vanilla, red bull, coffee, juice, and many more things! I'm telling you this place is great and you should check it out if you are nearby!
