One of my favorite places to grab a nice lunch and I'm an addict of their cranberry orange scones.  The blueberry are good too, but I could eat their bakery goods all day long...except my thighs would strenuously object. Good soups and I like a few of their sandwiches, too.  The tuna is actually great here - not sure what they put in it, but it is seriously good. Very good service - especially for a high-end fast food chain.
