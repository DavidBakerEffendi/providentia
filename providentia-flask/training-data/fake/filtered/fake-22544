It is just okay. The pizza is good, above par for the area. Everything else is not so great. It is expensive and the portions are small. The cheesesteaks really aren't very good at all. As a whole, the food quality here is VERY inconsistent, it can be great it can be awful. I usually experience the latter. Of the 3 times I ordered delivery, they messed up my order twice and had to return to the store. I was never compensated for the inconvenience. Sides are way too expensive for the size and quality. The portions seem to shrink each time. I only recommend Del Rossi as a final resort for the NoLibs area. If you just want a couple slices, though, this is your place.
