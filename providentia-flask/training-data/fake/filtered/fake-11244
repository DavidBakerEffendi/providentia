I like this place a lot, but only am going to give it 3 stars. Over crowded, but I guess thats not their fault.  The first time I tried this place we just ordered a plain pizza which was a mistake, but after a few more attempts and long waits, we started eating all different varieties.   Its over priced especially for pizza, as much of gourmet NYC pizza is, but its fun, you can watch most of the dishes being prepared, much to see, and a wide variety for Italian food standards. Try it out and expect to wait.  Don't forget to try some of the salted meats, if your into that stuff, or even if you aren't they are all fresh and perfectly salted.
