The experience at Walter's in Fort Greene was outstanding - from the perfectly inviting ambiance to helpful and gracious service and finally a truly exceptional menu.  The duck buns, artichoke dip, brussel sprouts, fried chicken and key lime pie are not to be missed...  We left most pleased with the entire experience plotting our next visit before we had even left the restaurant.
