It was the first time I had a sit down meal at Blue Elephant Trail.  I am a big fan of their Avon location.  A groupon coupon helped lure me in to sit.  It was so delicious.  My daughter and I sampled different dishes and loved the plateware, presentation and amzaing food!  Our waitress was so sweet and nice.  I look forward to going back.  Thumbs up for environmentally friendly to-go containers!!  :)
