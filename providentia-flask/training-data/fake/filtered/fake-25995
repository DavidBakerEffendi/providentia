My mom started coming to Main Street in 1984 so you can say my family has been long-time customers of Main Street. My mom said their tuna was the only thing I would eat for a time when I was a baby, and twenty years later, their food is still amazing. The service is quick and their chalkboard with the specials that day is colorful and makes the food sound very appetizing, which it is!!  I just finished eating the tuna on pumpernickel with lettuce--delish!! And my brother loves their meatloaf and tuna melts and their soups are amazing too!  Their baked goods, especially the ginger snaps and the brownies are divine, according to me and my family.  The baked goods are made on site too!!  Major plus in freshness! I cannot say enough about the quality, let alone the atmosphere!  It's cute, trendy and gives off a coffee shop feel, but also adds a bit of sophistication with the seating area that feels like a living room and their outdoor seating. Natalie, Samantha and Lindsey behind the counter are so sweet and helpful! They like to get to know their customers, but they also provide efficient, quality service--a perfect balance. I would highly recommend Main Street to anyone in the Princeton area.  We literally plan our trips to the area based on ordering food at Main Street.  Thank you Main Street for your constant delicious food, excellent service and delightful ambience!!
