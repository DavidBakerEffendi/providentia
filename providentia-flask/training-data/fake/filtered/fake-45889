First time to The Brothers Moon and we had an excellent dinner. Had a taste of so many delicious foods served on interesting little  tasting dishes. The Goat cheese and caramelized onion tart is a great was to start the meal, loved the Mesclun with roasted tomato, mozzarella and pancetta, light and tasty. Then had the West African spiced lentil cake with kale and carrot risotto, wonderful mix of spices and a creamy risotto. Tried rabbit for the first time with strozzapreti pasta, calamata olive and rosemary and I would definitely  have it again. Loved the halibut  and peas and hanger steak with asparagus and potatoes perfect with a wonderful Romesco sauce. Feeling full and very content, we still had room for dessert. The Lemon curd with berries was perfect, but the Creme Brulee was to die for! Oh, almost forgot the mushroom appetizer with caramelized garlic was so good, some people  in our party that don't eat mushrooms even liked it!  Overall it was a great evening of good company and amazing food! Loved every minute if it!
