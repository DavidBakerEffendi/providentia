I'm conflicted because I don't think there are less stars to describe my experience. I arrive at the place, get in line for a table and hit the bar to wait for my friends. I waited for 45 minutes to be seated and six other parties that came after us were seated before we were. I walk up to the hostess to find out what's going on. She's on the phone so being courteous wait for her to finish the conversation. She hangs up, I launch into a sentence, midway the phone rings, she raises an index finger "One moment". Being courteous I wait for her to finish, she hangs up, I launch again into a sentence, the phone rings, an index finger is raised.......you get the drift. I remind her that I'm waiting for a table and she asks me if everyone in my party has arrived. I wait another ten to be seated and finally giving up decide to eat at the bar. Â Since when does a hostess take roll call before sitting you at a table? What if one of your friends cancels? The only redeeming quality was the service from the bar tender Carly-masterclass. After the dinner was over, not trying to get someone fired or to be confrontational, I pull the bartender aside and tell him in the six years I have dined in this city, this was a new low for me. The ambience was nice, the caesar salad was good but my appetite was gone. Its even worse because everyone else gave a stellar review, seemed to have a good time at the place and cared enough to give a compliment.
