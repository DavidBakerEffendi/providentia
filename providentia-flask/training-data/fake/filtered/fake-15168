Since MP has opened I have been here many times.  The octopus (as everyone says) is awesome!  I have never been disappointed with the food here.  The outdoor cafe area is a nice place to sit at night at have a cocktail and an appetizer.  Definitely one of the nicer restaurants on Ditmars, which means it can be a little pricey!
