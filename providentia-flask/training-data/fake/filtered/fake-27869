I usually come to Lucali's whenever I visit Brooklyn! HANDS DOWN...BEST PIZZA EVERRRR!!! The ingredients are FRESH and so GOOD! The crust is HEAVEN! I can't wait to return for an entire pie for myself (sorry family).....next trip back to the east coast will be in two weeks! Are you ready for Lucali? OH, YES!!!
