If you love Comfort food Mac Attack is the place for you. Anything you order their is AMAZING. The have the Best French fries. Creamy and stringy mozzarella sticks that are to die for. Grilled Cheese that has great texture and great taste. The Mac and cheese is made unconventionally but will be the best you have ever tasted. They even have. Great kids meal. The staff are on of the most friendly people. And the owners are also really awesome. I would 101% recommend Mac Attack.
