The service here is horrendous. My family of 9 (plus a wheelchair, plus 4 strollers and a walker for my mother) felt not only unwelcome, but utterly terrorized when we were informed that we musn't block the entrance due to some ridiculous "fire regulations".  Next, the waitstaff told us that our family has to sit at two separate tables, because they have what they claim to be "dinner reservations". This is where i drew the line, saying that we might be poor, but we love eachother dearly and will not be separated at a German restaurant. We therefore gathered all the available chairs around the table to which we were so rudely assigned, and proceeded with our order. After a brief consultation, the 9 of us settled on sharing one roasted sausage (Bratwurst),  7 bread baskets, and tap waters all around. The piece de resistance, however, was when I was forbidden to consume the sandwich that I brought with me. (I have to eat my own food at restaurants, ever since I found out on Dr. Oz that I'm gluten intolerant.). The audacity they had denying me my meal is inexpressible. They also refused to comp any deserts (despite my gluten intolerance, I can have a Klimttorte every once in a while). They also charged us for 3 (three!) bread baskets.   In short, we had a terrible experience, and they should really change their policies or we will never set foot (nor wheel) in this place ever again.
