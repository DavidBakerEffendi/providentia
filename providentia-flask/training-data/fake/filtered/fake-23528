Our family also ate at Consiglio's on graduation weekend, in fact, we had the table next to "Rocky B".  However, our experience was far different.  Yes, the place was packed and running quite behind.  However, our waiter, Kevin, was fantastic, immediately bringing us our wine and bread.  Any REASONABLE person could see that the staff was literally running around trying to serve everyone, and this is one of the busiest nights of the year in New Haven.  We ordered our appetizers (which were delicious and not over-priced) and they were brought out in a reasonable length of time considering how busy the place was.  Our entire table noticed "Rocky B" constantly complaining, getting up out of his seat,  and being incredibly rude to everyone that worked there.  Yes, the meals took a while, but were well worth the wait.  DO EAT HERE!  By the way, when "Rocky B" and his table got up and left, the entire restaurant started clapping.  Perhaps "Rocky B" ought to hang up his attitude.
