We love this place!  There aren't too many spots in Bay Ridge to have a meal outdoors, and they really did it right design-wise at this place.  The back yard is quiet and serene.  We went for brunch last weekend and are heading back today for dinner and bringing all the kids.  The Kings County Ramblers, a great bluegrass duo, play on Sunday afternoons.  Great music that's not too loud and obnoxious.  The go-go Godzilla bloody mary alone is worth the trip - wonderfully horseradish-y and garnished with jack cheese, pickled green bean, lemon and a SLIM JIM!  How can yo beat that?!
