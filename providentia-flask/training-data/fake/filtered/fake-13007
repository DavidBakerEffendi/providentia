I went to this place twice. The food was okay. It is very homemade grandma's cooking kind of feel. There is nothing that will make you "WOW" about. Â If you want something plain and boring this is a place to go. The service is NOT so great. They seated us and never gave us bread until we requested for it! After we go the bread it was just plain dry bread with nothing to dip. So we had to request again for the dippings. This happened both times I went! The place is tight. You can hear the other tables convo very clearly! The third time I attempt to go I had a drink with me. (I was with a friend who likes some of the dishes they had there. So I was dragged along.) They would not seat me until I dump my drink out! Its not like iam not going to order YOUR food. What is the big deal? I walked right back out! The food was okay like I said but the service and because of my experience, I would not be returning any time soon. I understand the food is cheap you get what you pay for but seriously you are spending money here at this restaurant you deserve some kind of decent treatment. The place right next to it has the same rating. At least the waiters are so much more nicer!
