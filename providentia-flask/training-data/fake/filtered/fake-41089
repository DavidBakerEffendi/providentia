Delicious! I went to the city to see the tree and we stopped in for a bite to eat. The spinach dip was divine, the prosciutto in the panini was fabulous and I definitely enjoyed the lava chocolate cake! Of course you can't forget the wine! I live in New Jersey and I would definitely make a trip back - from the ambience to the service, what a perfect place to bring a date!
