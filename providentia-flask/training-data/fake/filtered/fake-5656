Friendly service,but worst cheesesteaks I ever had.I didn't know a cheesesteaks could be so bad. I don't know how this place has customers Â . The first turnoff was the huge pile of meat on the grill,chopped up so fine making it very dry,how can that be fresh?The meat had 0 taste. The sandwich had little cheese and onions,the only positive was the roll wasn't bad.I has looking forward to my first dalessandro cheesesteak, but it turned out it would also be my last.
