We enjoy India House very much. Their pakoras and samosas are great, as are all the variety of naan they offer. Their house Shiraz "Sula" is quite good and goes well with the food. Two of our "go to" dishes are Aloo Gobi and Veggie Korma. Consistently good, hot (temp not spice wise), and lots of excellent flavor. We always have enough left over for another meal. If we're not too full, it's a treat to have their Masala Chai. One of the best I've had. Service-wise they couldn't be more pleasant and the meal is excellently timed. Parking is never an issue as there is a free lot just across the street that is never full. They re-did the inside of the restaurant last year and are renovating the outside this year. It makes quite a difference.
