Wow! First off let me just say the service was outstanding. A couple of friends and I went out this past saturday night for a couple of drinks and some food. The food was absolutely acceptional and the place was bumpin'. I got the carne asada burrito. YUM! Our bartenders name was Evan and not only could he make the most delicious off the wall drinks but boy was he a handsome devil. I definitely recommend this place as one of the finer restaurants to hit up in the old city area.
