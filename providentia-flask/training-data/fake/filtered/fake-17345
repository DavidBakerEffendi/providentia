Love this place! Sushi/ sashimi is always fresh and creative. They have the classics as well as delicious innovative culinary delights! The place is neighborhood and local and great prices. I recently moved to the area from nyc (and am a foodie) and can say that this is one of my favorite sushi places. Owner is helpful and friendly. I love the mango mingo roll and the naruto special roll. Mmmm! I come here nearly once a week and its always been a great experience.
