Decided to have my birthday dinner here this year, rather than Lavo, Tao or Buddakhan since I was getting tired of doing that every year. The experience that I had here was simply UNBELIEVABLE. The entire staff from top to bottom was accommodating and fun. I made a reservation for 14 and showed up with 19 people, while the restaurant was PACKED with other guests, and they made it into no problem at all and just smiled and were fun about it. The lighting was perfect, the music was perfect and the food, absolutely delicious. The owner even went out of his way to get Lychee Martinis for the bar because he had heard that I was there prior and requested one and they didn't have them at the bar. As someone who works in high end retail every day, I can truly say that the customer service displayed by Steve Galli and his team are unparalleled to that of any restaurant I have been to in NYC.They went above and beyond to make my dinner there amazing. Thank you!
