Last night was the straw that broke the camel's back for my support of Raymonds. I will never be spending my money at this establishment ever again, and will be sure to tell everyone I know not to go to Raymonds ever again. I had a bad experience with a rude waiter a couple of months ago, but since I have been going to Raymonds for years and that was the only rude waiter I had thus far, I decided to give the restaurant a second chance. I was deeply let down by the service I received while at Raymonds last night. Our waitress seemed decent enough in the fact that she didn't tell us off when she took our order. We got wine (there were two of us dining), and the wine cork was not left on the table. We did not want to finish all that wine, and since the wine cork was not left on the table for us, I went up to the two waitresses that were standing around and asked if they have a wine cork we could use. Our waitress abliged, and me and the other person I was with both thanked her, with no response from the waitress. But that was not even the worst part. We figured the service was good enough (no effort on our waitress to say "you're welcome" or "is there anything else I can get for you", but we figured she wasn't outwardly rude to us, so we left a nice tip. As we were leaving the restaurant, I hear our waitress make an off-handed comment under her breathe, "We only open like 70 bottles of wine a night" and something about having like 70 corks. Now she waited until after we had left her a tip to be passive aggressively rude to us, the customer. I did not think it was too much to ask to have her give us the cork so we could seal the wine. She was, after all, the one who had taken the cork from us in the first place. It seems Raymonds needs to make some changes to their staffing, there are plenty of pleasant, kind, well mannered people who would love a job.
