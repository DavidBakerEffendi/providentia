After many rave reviews about the food, we decided to try Kanella for a Saturday night dinner.  Our choices -- pork tenderloin and the whole fish special -- were good though not outstanding.  What ruined the dining experience was the arrogant and supercilious service.  When my wife expressed her discomfort at receiving her fish with the head on, and asked that it be filleted in the kitchen rather than at the table, our waiter told us he "understood" but that it was the "chef's preference" to fillet at the table because, you see, it is "about the presentation."  And so that is exactly what happened.  And on top of this affront to the very notion of customer service, the fish was so poorly de-boned (I certainly hope not intentionally) that it was barely edible.  If you live in the neighborhood, I'm sure this would be a great choice for take out.  Otherwise, I'd give it a pass.
