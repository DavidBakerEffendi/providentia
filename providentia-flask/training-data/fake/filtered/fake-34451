Umai is hands down my favorite restaurant in the city.  The service is always great and the food is unique, fresh, and flavorful.  I am absolutely addicted to the yellowtail teradito, japanese fondue, godzilla and nemo rolls, and the spicy tuna handroll.  I always look forward to having the chef make a special roll with uni. Definitely check this place out ASAP and keep going back.  =)
