The food was not bad however our waitress Maria must of had a bad day. It seem that everything we asked for (which at times were things we previously asked) we got the idea that we were bothersome to her. She does not reflect the warmth from the rest of the staff there. Next time I go, I gonna call to see if she's there. If she is, I'm going elsewhere.
