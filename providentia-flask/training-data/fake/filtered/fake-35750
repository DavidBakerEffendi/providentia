OK, I've just gotten around to writing this review after eating at Cafe Triskell for three and a half years.  Hands down, this place is THE best food, especially for the money, in Astoria.   The Chef is a world class culinary genius, the likes of which you'd find at Le Bernardin or Le Cirque but he happens to run the cute little place in Astoria.  This is the area's best kept secret.   The entrees are superb and only the highest quality ingredients are used.  The brunch items are well prepared and the crepes, both the savory and dessert, are served perfectly.   Seriously, it's like going to the home of a master chef and getting all of the amazing food with none of the pretense.  The service is always fun and friendly too.   Great date spot.  Great birthday spot.  I've probably been there 50 or 60 times in 3 and a half years and have never left disappointed...and I'm picky.
