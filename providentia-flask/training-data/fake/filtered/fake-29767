We live in Vermont and visits to Manhattan are rare. I am often overwhelmed by the choices of where to eat, but this place was a winner, and we'll be back next time we're in the city. Lovely ambiance: elegant and casual at the same time.  The menu is a delight just to read, and we three were all very happy with our choices at brunch.  Chickpea burger with tomato jam, garden omelette, and panini with cheese and EG's own bacon.  I especially appreciate their attention to allergies and diet sensitivity.  My husband appreciated the option of coconut milk for his iced coffee. Yum!  There is really something for everyone on this menu and the prices seemed reasonable for the area.
