BEWARE of "specials". Make sure you ask for the price. We were oversold on the appetizer and ended up paying $12 for what amounted to two average crab springrolls (they cut them in half to make you think you get 4). $6 per roll... not even sure if they were fresh or dumped from a freezer. Disappointed!! Otherwise, happy hour specials are good and like all other reviews...chicken fingers and carnitas good....oh yeah. We will definitely go back for drinks and happy hour specials, but not sure we'll venture outside of happy hour.
