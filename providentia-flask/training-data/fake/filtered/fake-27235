We live in the area and went to Cocina Forte with fairly high expectations, based on previous reviews. The service... wasn't as we expected. There was a bit of a superior aire from the waiter, which I would expect perhaps at Â Amis or something of the like. But I thought, maybe the food is just thaat good, it'll make up for this. For appetizer we had an eggplant crab special. Although the individual flavors themselves were good, they just didn't meld together in the way I would expect at a top-notch restaurant. It was as though someone though by sticking a bunch of good stuff together on a plate, the sum would be greater than the parts. It was difficult to eat and lacked flavor and consistency. Expectations lowered. Of course we ordered the gnocchi for entrees. Expectations... shattered. The spinach gnocchi with gorzonzola sauce was good... the gnocchi itself was indeed very soft. But the marinara sauce and the ricotta gnocchi tasted like it came from chef boyardee. The sauce utterly lacked flavor. We did bring the leftovers home and hopefully can save them with... ahem... FLAVOR. Best gnocchi? Not at all. Go to the Royal Tavern if you want some really excellent homemade gnocchi... and for a cheaper price.
