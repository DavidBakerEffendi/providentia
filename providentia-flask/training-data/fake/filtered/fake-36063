I enjoyed everything - service, food, cleanliness, and was very welcoming.  This is the best place to visit in the area.  You will have a great time here and the owners have done a great job and it shows.  If you live in the area this will become your place of choice especially for soccer and football. Thanks for a great time Smithfield.
