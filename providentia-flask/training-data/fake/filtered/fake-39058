I ate here for breakfast yesterday, 5/18, and I became violently ill. I am still sick with cramping and diarrhea. I ate the same meal as my girlfriend but the only difference was I ordered a lemon with my iced tea. She had a sprite. That was the only meal I ate all day. I am so sick I could cry! THIS PLACE IS FILTY AND DISGUSTING AND I AM A CONSTANT HAND WASHER. THERE IS NO WAY I PICKED THIS UP ANYWHERE ELSE. THEY SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN!
