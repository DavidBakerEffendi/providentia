My husband and I stayed here for a weekend getaway in August, 2014 and had a truly wonderful time. The room we stayed in was clean, comfortable and quiet and the entire Inn is extremely well-maintained. We ate breakfast and dinner at the Inn each day and the food was some of the best we've ever had. The ingredients were fresh and seasonal and each dish a great combination of flavors. We had the tasting menu one of the nights we were there and were super impressed with every dish and with the wine pairings. I am a vegetarian and have some food allergies, but the chef and waitstaff were able to accommodate these restrictions while preserving the unique flavor combinations for each dish on the menu. I highly recommend the Inn at Weathersfield whether you are looking for a quite weekend away or just a nice place to have dinner while traveling through Vermont. The food is incredible and the setting is beautiful. The innkeepers Richard and Marilee and all of their staff are friendly and helpful and the entire atmosphere at the Inn is warm and inviting. My husband and I will definitely be returning on our next trip to Vermont.
