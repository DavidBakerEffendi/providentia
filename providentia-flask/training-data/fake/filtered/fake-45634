We decided to try this restaurant by doing take out. Maybe that is not a great test. We ordered Maju Pineapple Soup, vegetarian. It came with chicken--the kind of dried out chicken which is the reason we ordered it vegetarian in the first place. Strike One. We also ordered edamame. Maybe that was our mistake, after all, edamame is not a Thai dish. We had better edamame when we bought frozen edamame at Whole Foods. Strike Two. We also ordered Thai Green Curry, vegetarian. Green Curry should be spicey--this was mild, hardly what Green Curry was advertised at on the menu. Strike Three. On a positive note, we had called early and asked that the order be ready later that evening and it was ready as requested. Perhaps take out is not a good test, but we certainly will not give the restaurant a second chance after three strikes. Both of us have also spent time in Thailand, so maybe our expectations were too high.
