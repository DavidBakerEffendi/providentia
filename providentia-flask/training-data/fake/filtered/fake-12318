Just went there tonight with a friend after purchasing coupon on restaurants.com and I'm so glad I was introduced to this new cafe. It's a tiny cafe hidden in Northern Liberties with a nice vibe that will probably become more prominent as the cafe becomes more established. The service is very friendly and laid back. The star of the cafe is the menu! There were so many things that caught my eye and the pricing was very reasonable. I ended up opting for a pork sandwich of sorts which was scrumptious and wrapped up the evening with a mocha which also was delicious. The chef also seemed very connected and inventive with the food he was serving which added to the dining experience. Initially, I worried as my friend and I walked past Honey's (another one of our Northern Liberty favorites) to get to the cafe that we might regret choosing this cafe over our trusted standby eatery. However, now that I know what awaits me at this lovely cafe, I think I can willingly walk past Honey's. Overall, it's a nice addition to Philadelphia!
