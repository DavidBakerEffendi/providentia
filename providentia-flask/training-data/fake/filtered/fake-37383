Simply put, this place is real bad. We landed in this restaurant because another planned location we were gonna visit was closed. So we visitied this Saturday 9/28/2008 for lunch buffet. Any takeout restaurant in the area will have more and better choices for less. The chicken tandoori was "old" - really. The chicken-something (I forget the name now) was definitely a left-over from another party supply. Only one simple rice (few pieces of paneer trying to prop their head out) offering. One daal (never bothered to try). Cold (even though it was on top of heating device) paneer pakodas. And last but not to mention dessert - small gulab jamuns (probably some cheap canned ones) and fruits. Most of the staff is either new or inexperienced. So you can imagine the service, even though I have seen worse. Don't blame me. I warned you.
