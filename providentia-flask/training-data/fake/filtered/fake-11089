Always a joy to take a gamble on a little shop you've never heard of and be pleasantly surprised! As we drove past with a car full of hungry people we randomly decided "let's just eat here!" The portions are large- a personal pizza is almost as big as the small. My husband and I really liked the cheese pizza. It's NY style and the ingredients taste fresh. All five people in my party liked their orders and the staff couldn't have been nicer. If we find ourselves in the area again we'd go back!
