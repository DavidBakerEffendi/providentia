Had a very nice meal here eating at the bar. I was there on a Wednesday and it was pretty quiet. I do think they'll need a double door to make sure there's no winter drafts if the restaurant is more busy. Food was very good, with the burger the clear highlight... Honestly, i love a good burger and this is one of the best ones i had in the city. Defiantly superior to Back Forty for example and probably similar to Shorty's but for less money. We started with the chicken liver mousse spread and the steak tartar spread. Both were good. Steak tartar was good, but not award winning... could probably use a bit more spicing, but I'm very picky on those things. Chicken with Kale was also very good, very tender, like a great homemade dish, not a wow, but very, very good. I was drinking the rioja which was good and very reasonably priced. Â  Bartender was very knowlegeble about the wines. I would defiantly go back for a casual dinner. Great food for the price.
