I eat hear once a week. They make their own signature pitas and the staff is very friendly The food is pretty good and it is close to my home, personally the pizzas have a bit too much cheese on them, but they will accomodate and fix that if you ask. The service is a bit slow some times and they need to keep the place a little cleaner, the tables are covererd with this weird vynil upholstery material which makes them a bit sticky, it is a bit dive-y but the food is consistent and the staff is very friendly.
