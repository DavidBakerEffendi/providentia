Change the menu once in a while & add some flavor to the food. Everything there is just OK - more convenient than going to Franklin Deli for lunch because I don't feel like driving. The Cafe I'm more familiar with is the one at 2000 Lenox Drive and not 1009 Lenox Drive. Most dishes are blah blah blah and don't even appeal as enough food for the price. I don't care what i have to pay - just give me good food & a decent amount for the money. Also the workers need to pay more attention to customer request and listen. Speaking a little more fluid English would not hurt either. Overall this place is just 2 stars and declining! Prices should also not vary a dime or two from week to week!!!!!
