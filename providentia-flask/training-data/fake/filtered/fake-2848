This has been the worst experience in restaurant eating.  We were told there was a two hour wait for the table, they have no bar to wait, they refuse to take a reservation or your number to call you when your name comes up. But the most galling of it all was the arrogance and rude, unaccomodating attitude of the manager. We had a large party and we walked out and went elsewhere where our business was appreciated.  Not even in the toniest restaurants of NYC have I ever witnesses or experienced such poor customer treatment.  No apologies for the wait, no provisional considerations offered. We will never set foot in there again.
