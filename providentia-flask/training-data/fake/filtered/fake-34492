This is my first time at this restuarant and everything was aweful.  I was hoping to find the best pizza in NJ, but all I found was terrible service, a line 45 minutes long just to get a table, and another 45 minute wait just to hear that they gave 1 of the 2 pizzas I ordered to someone else and I have to wait longer to get the other pizza.  I declined receiving the second pizza and nothing else was done to try to remedy the problem.  The pizza I did receive was half decent, but still, I would NEVER return to this place.   With service like this, you wonder how they could be the 'best' that New Jersey has to offer.
