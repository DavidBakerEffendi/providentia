I had lunch here and I must say the food is good! Next time I will take it to go because the service is the worst!! I don't want to come in and be treated like I owe you for dinning at your establishment , no way!! Â The food was good but I don't want to get aggravated when I eat , no worth it!! The only reason I'm writing this review is because the excellent service I just received at Brooklyn dinner . Night and Day !!
