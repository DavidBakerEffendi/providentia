Since I cant pronounce the name, I just call this place "The Train". When I lived in Philly, this was my go to spot to fulfill my once, sometimes twice weekly Pho cravings. Always ordered the same things: fried spring rolls, seafood noodle soup with egg noodles, and an avocado milkshake. Hit the spot every single time. Great food + Fast service + Great price = Win Also the service is unimaginable fast. By the time your server walks through the kitchen door, no more than 30 seconds goes by before you're enjoying a steaming hot bowl of delicious noodle soup. Seriously, time them.
