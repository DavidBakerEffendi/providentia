Fishmarket is the place to be for a relaxed atmosphere and great food.  The prices are not outlandish compared to the surrounding Bar/Restaurant options.  I personally recommend the buffalo wings.  I know every bar has them, but these are phenomenal!  I find myself at the Fishmarket once a week, without fail.  The owners are always present and always enjoy their business.  They are happy and comfortable and you feel that comfort the moment you enter.  If you are anywhere in southern Manhattan and looking a great place for a round or some food, give it a shot!
