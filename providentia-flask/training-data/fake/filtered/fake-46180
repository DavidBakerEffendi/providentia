Noodle here is still great. One of the best pork ramen soup in nyc. BUT they changed certain things lately (too bad!) and I was so disappointed that they down graded the quality of the following: 1) RICE dish - they are now using lesser quality rice or not cooking it right. I can tell by the texture and the taste. 2) DESERT (Matcha Brulee was heavenly before - now it's completely different look&taste - who makes it now? not worth $7) 3) one of the reception girls (Japanese native) was so rude to one of my guests I could not believe it
