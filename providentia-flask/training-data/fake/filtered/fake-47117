Sunday brunch at Balaboosta ended up being a total disappointment. The lamb burger was absolutely dry and tasteless. We had to send it back. The service was grumpy (even before we send bad burger back) and very unfriendly. Not something you would accept from Sunday brunch crew. The rest of the food was also quite average. I might try going there for dinner, but not again for brunch.
