OK, Ive been to this place on both hands more then i can count! i love the beef, shrimp,chicken pad thai with peanut sauce (extra please!!!) lol Great place and great atmosphere. totally a good place to have a first date or a group setting. as the other reviews say it is sometimes of a wait cause this place can be packed from 7pm till close. for me its worth the wait, i eat here about every two months on a norm with friends, and if im feeling thai we go about 3 times in 2 months and we go all out! i totally recommend this place for great thai and a cool place to eat were the atmosphere is pumping from the bar to the outdoor seating, cobble hill has a cool gem on its hands.
