My favorite restaurant in NYC.  The Entrana (skirt steak) is pure heaven, and only $20.  Chimichurri, avocado fries, ceviche de boef - excellent.  When you go to an Argentinean steakhouse, don't order tacos, order a steak (though in my opinion the rib eye is a tad too fatty).  Service can be hectic when it's busy, but chill dude, you're going to eat well.
