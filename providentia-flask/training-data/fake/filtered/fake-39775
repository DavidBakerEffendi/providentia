If possible avoid London Grill. My wife and I went for Sunday brunch. She had to return the Pinot Grigio which was rancid and the salad with Brie which was lifeless. Our main courses were put on our table while we were in the middle of our soup which tasted as if an entire salt cellar had been dumped in it. The service was amateurish. There are many good restaurants in Philadelphia. London Grill is not one of them.
