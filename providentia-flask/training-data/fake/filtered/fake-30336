Its a rip off. SOGGY pizza, the cheese comes in half melted round globs and the staff is too "cool" or- stuck up / euro -I don't get it. I've been more than 5x's and it just NEVER...was a good experience . They make it obvious they don't care about the neighborhood, the history, or the people in it. Not a good vibe AT ALL. Last time I was there, some guy showed me how the small coffee is almost the EXACT amount of a large (with a 2$ difference(?) something to do with the circumference of the cup.. *IF you get coffee to go...get a small and save 2$ without being screwed. and if you get pizza, prepare to swallow whole unmelted globs that refuse to even stay on your slice.
