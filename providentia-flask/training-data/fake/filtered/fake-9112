DONT GO THERE! We were 8 people at this restaurant at afternoon around 16:00 on 20/12/2014 soho NYC. This restaurant has an open kitchen which you can watch all the meals when they are cooking them and its really nice! we were sitting on the next table of the kitchen and we finished our meal. When we were waiting for the bill, they cooked their own bread in front of us and some of them are ready, warm, smelling great and looking delicious! I'm 3 months pregnant and i was craving of that bread. I asked the waiter to buy some of these breads but she said no, sorry they are for dinner menu and we have to wait till 17:30. I told her that its just a bread, i m pregnant and i really wanna to eat that bread soo much right now. I craved her... She asked her manager and they said no, again... Can you believe it? It was not a big thing for them! Do you know how Â much is it a big upset if a pregnant woman crazy to eat something and cant have it!!!! The stuff is too ruthless and uncompromising!!! I will never go there again! Customers always should be more important than the rules of the restaurant. Because the customers brings you the money not the rules...
