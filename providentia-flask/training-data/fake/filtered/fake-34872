While reservations are required, I am fortunate enough to know the owner well, and did not have to fight the wait for a reservation. Chef's table was one of the best meal I've ever eaten. Been here twice, both times I was totally blown away. Last minute planning sometimes pays off. Sommelier was very knowledgeable and made great recommendations. Service begins promptly and you don't want to miss a single dish. 25 courses of meticulously-prepared and creatively-presented gourmet goodness. You will leave STUFFED. Prices are reasonable for service given. $225 prix-fixe dinner.
