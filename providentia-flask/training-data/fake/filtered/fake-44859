Overall I thought that Emporio was on, maybe, the high side of poor, and frankly, I'm shocked at the suspiciously over-the-top positive reviews here. My pasta (Forget the name of the dish, but it was the special) was actually undercooked to the point of being UNCOOKED. It was actually laughable. Our server was very apologetic and said that it had a recurrent problem (!!??) that night, and that she would get another dish. The substitution was a pasta dish with a cream-based sauce, and it was bland and kind of gooey. One look in the display kitchen reveals that all the food is being cranked out at lightening pace by a bunch of kids (and I mean that almost literally) with no apparent supervision. In my opinion, Emporio is just another money-making "machine" restaurant, cranking out mediocre food at reasonable-enough prices. When a restaurant is just about the bottom line, the food suffers horribly, and what you get is Emporio. Another reviewer hit the nail on the head saying that this place is just another novelty restaurant. Couldn't agree more, and won't ever be back.
