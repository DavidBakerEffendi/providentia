My wife and I had reservations for this evening at 6:00 at Lupa.  We arrived at 6:18, and apologized for being late (a common occurence in NYC).  We were then told that our reservation had "already been no-showed" but we could be seated as long as we didn't mind forfeiting our OpenTable points.  Our seating was also contingent on the table being returned by 7:30.  When we said that an hour and twelve minutes was not enough time for a comfortable dinner, we were offered to "wait for something to open up" at the bar.  As a fifteen-year veteran of food service (and nearly five years working in Michelin-rated NYC restaurants) I found this simply unacceptable.  We left and went to another restaurant.  It is disappointing that with such a first impression we will absolutely NEVER patronize another B&B establishment, despite my wife's good experiences at Lupa, Otto, and Del Posto.  We understand that reservations arriving late are inconvenient.  For the maitre d' to act as if they are an air traffic controller with a sensitive and delicate queue is just ridiculous.  Avoid at all costs.
