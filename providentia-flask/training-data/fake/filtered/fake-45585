Went to Somerset based on recommendations from friends and co-workers. If you're single and into the drinking scene, this is for you. My wife and I were highly dissapointed with the limited menu, and slow service. We had our wedding reception there when this was O'Connors, and this was completely different. Typically when the drink menu is larger than the food menu, the emphasis will be on the bar. There are plenty of good "Mom and Pop" restauraunts in the area that will treat you better and glad to serve you. If you want to drink and be a "player", then go for it!
