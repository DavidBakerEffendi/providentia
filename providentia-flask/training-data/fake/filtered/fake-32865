I made reservations for Perry St with much anticipation. Having dined at several other Jean George establishments I had come to expect a  certain level of service and culinary excellence - but was extremely disappointed. I had planned a special birthday experience and it turned into disaster.  Everything was a mis-step, from the long wait for our pre-dinner drinks, to the fact that our server didn't bring the wine for the first course  of our "wine pairing meal" until we had one bite left of the first course and simply placed the wine on the table and sheepishly walked away knowing she was late (....last time I checked a wine pairing means you are supposed to enjoy the wine WITH the meal AS you eat it...not as a means of washing down the first course AFTER you eat it)..then they couldn't get it right after that, none of the other pairings came on time, the 3rd course took forever, the broccoli rabe was soggy and overcooked, the special desert was overly-chocolate and dry (I've had better treats at an elementary school bake sale). This was supposed to be a birthday celebration and we had made our discontent known with the manager - to which she said she didn't know it was a birthday celebration - it wasn't " in their system" (even though when they called to confirm the reservations the restaurant confirmed it was a birthday dinner).....well when the coat check person couldn't find my coat and i had to rummage through their coat closet myself the manager asked for my phone # and she pulled up my reservation on the computer...Oh - wouldn't you know on the reservation screen it clearly stated BIRTHDAY CELEBRATION. So now the manager lied right to my face.....Absolutely will NEVER go back....and for over $300 I've had better dining experiences at Olive Garden for $30.....
