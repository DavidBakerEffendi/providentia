Although it did take them 35 mins to get us a table for 5 and a child, service was TGIF like friendly and quick... The food took just as long to come out, and the place was packed.... All and all you can't really go wrong, sat at the bar to start and have a beer, there were TV's on with espn.... All in all great experience was a little noisy but as previously stated it was packed so expected....
