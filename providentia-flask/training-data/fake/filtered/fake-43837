I can't believe I ever stepped foot in this establishment. Everything from the food, the wait staff and the cleanliness of the diner leaves so much to be desired. I have been to diners all over New Jersey and this place easily sticks out in my mind for all the wrong reasons. If you have a choice to eat somewhere else, anywhere for that matter do so and be thankful you did.
