Just call me fat now! LOL Just came here with some friends for breakfast and it was delicious. I got so much food eggs, home fries, toast and a waffle. YUP I can eat all that by myself. My waiter was super nice and friendly checking up on us every minute. The pricing is very cheap also. I got everything for like $7. Our wait was a little long but that happens when it comes to breakfast especially in new york city. I would def come back
