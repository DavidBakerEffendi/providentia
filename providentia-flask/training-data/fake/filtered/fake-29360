Cheap, delicious & healthy!! Ofcourse, I want it! Â The best part about this place is that they are super fast, extremely busy so surely the food is fresh! This place is so alive. Even @ 2 am people are standing outside in a line. That experience of eating tasty food @ 2 am in the midst of fifty other strangers is rewarding in itself.
