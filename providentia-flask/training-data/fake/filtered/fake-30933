I have been a customer for over 2 and 1/2 years of this establishment, and it has taken me this long to write this review to warn others of this place.  In the beginning, the food was amazing, but the service was ALWAYS terrible!  The manager's never care when you bring complaints to their attention, and they always exclaim, we promise to make it better next time.  I'm not looking for a comp, I just want them to care, but it is SO OBVIOUS they DO NOT CARE!!!.  The servers and hostesses who take orders screw up so many times it's unbelievable, and there are NO systems in place to correct.  I can remember on one hand the times I actually had a positive service experience with this place! I own my own small business in NYC, and if I treated my clients that way, I would be out of business within months.   But...I would always come back for the food which my wife loved.  But NOW...please READ.  This place is horrendous.  Last month, I went in for take out and saw one of the regulari sushi chefs in the bathroom.  He never washed his hands after using the toilet, brushed his hands through his hair, and LEFT....I was mortified. Two weeks ago, I got sick, bad food poisoning...the worst 24 hours of my life from this place.  When i called it to there attention of the manager's, they balked...did nothing and now it my crusade to tell everone.  It is a big hangout on weekends so please proceed with caution on every front with this place.  There are TOO many great places out there to deal with the crap of Sushi Lounge!
