Williamsburg eateries are known for their calm and easy going atmosphere, friendly service and food that makes you want to go back again and again. Unfortunately, this is not the case with Traif, which we all found pretentious and substandard when it comes to their menu and service. Situated at the foot of the bridge on S 4th street, they have "Door Nazis" who control entrance into the restaurant. Most likely it is done to make you feel as if you are stepping into exclusive place that will leave you with unforgettable experience...Well, if that's the case - they were right... I'm too lazy to go over every little detail that left us with enormous frustration, but do yourself a favor and pick another place to eat, unless you like your red wine to be at the same temperature as your steak and your pasta dish to look like your drunk neighbor's TV dinner. I can puke a better looking dish. We skipped desert and all left with the feeling of being genuinely angry with ourselves for stepping a foot into this dive. If they want to use cute Yiddish words for their name, the more suitable name would be "A Shandeh un a Charpeh", which means "A Shame and a Disgrace".
