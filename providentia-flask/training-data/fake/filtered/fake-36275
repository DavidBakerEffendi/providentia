i've been to Yakitori Boy probably a dozen times in my life - whether for my birthday or others, we've always gotten private rooms. the experience has always been fun except for last week. for some reason, when your time is up, they dispatch some henchmen to kick you out of your room. unfortunately, a 4-figure bill is not enough for them to say, "thanks for coming!" a 4-figure bill will get you a "you're time is up, you need to get out!" and then ripping the microphones out of your hand. uh, dude, it was exactly the end of our reserved time. there was no need to be so rude, we would happily wrap it up without the attitude.that's probably why the tack on the mandatory 18% gratuity - because no one would put up with this sort of crap. also, don't let the velvet rope and the line at the door fool you - there's no one upstairs in the bar room. at least no one worth waiting in line for - there's always just some pathetic bachelorette party with ugly ladies in too short skirts.
