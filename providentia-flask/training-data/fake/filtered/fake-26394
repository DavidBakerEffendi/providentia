Consistently the best place to dine near Parc Restaurant, Bistro & Cafe. Have been there several times and the food is always fresh, creative, delicious and well presented. Once the daily specials are presented, it is difficult to decide what to order. If you sit in a booth, the dining experience is significantly enhanced. Individual tables are much too close together. Wines by the glass are excellent, elegantly served, and at the right temperature. The staff could not be pleasanter with one exception - the lead hostess. She has an Upstairs/Downstairs attitude - she's Upstairs and her guests are Ddownstairs. Her attitude and demeanor are so bad and ungracious (rumor has it the staff agrees), my husband and I always debate returning.
