so I ordered a few days ago and as I took the first bite into my long awaited chicken cutlet and fresh mozz wrap.. I noticed something different, YES a piece of LONG brown hair was tangled up in my wrap (i'm a blonde so I knew it was NOT mine)...totally ruined it and I felt disgusted. I would have called back but the damage was done and the wrap was in the garbage... good margarita slice tho.
