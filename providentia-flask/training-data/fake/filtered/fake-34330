This is the best Sushi I have had in New York.  Yasuda is a very serious Sushi chef.  He is almost a "sushi nazi" (in the style of the "soup nazi" in Seinfeld).  He once got upset with a Japanese friend of mine who was sitting at the bar and put a large piece of wasabi on his sushi.  As Yasuda puts wasabi and seasonings under each piece of fish, in amounts delicately balanced to suit that particular fish, he was very offended that someone would disturb that balance.  If it was an american he would excuse their ignorance, but since he was Japanese he got a scolding.   He has a right to be upset though, his sushi only needs a touch of soy sauce to reach perfection.   Also, the sizes of the sushi are just right.  One bite, as it should be.  Many places will make huge pieces of sushi that are impossible to eat in one bite, at least impossible to do with grace.   The decor is also worth the trip.  Very Japanese modern.  Overall this is a great place for top of the line sushi.  Be sure to try the Unagi kuro, freshly grilled and perfectly seasoned.
