I can only echo the other unfortunate people who have experienced the rudeness and arrogance of the owner.  I'm actually surprised that this restaurant does so well given how terrible his interpersonal skills are. Two weeks prior to a special dinner I was hosting, I made a reservation for 9:00 p.m. for two people.  When I made the reservation, I was told that we might not be seated until 9:15 p.m.  I asked if we could sit at the bar and wait, and the man who took the reservation said, "If there's room."  Nothing welcoming there.   Nevertheless, I took a chance, and we arrived at 9 p.m. on the dot.  We were told we would have to wait, although I clearly saw more than one table already clear.  There was one seat at the bar, and I invited my guest to sit.  The owner belatedly asked if we wanted to see a wine list.  But the space is so loud, the tables so crammed together, and the owner's attitude so frankly off-putting, that we decided to leave.  We had a great dinner elsewhere. I should have trusted my instincts at the time I made the reservation, and taken a hint from the other negative reviews.  The owner is a real jerk.  I hope he's kinder to his staff than he is to some of his customers.
