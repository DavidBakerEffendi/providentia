As with other reviewers here, I had a mixed experience with Angelo's.  It was only our first time ordering out, but first impressions are important.  We were told pizza, salad, and jalapeño poppers would arrive within an hour.  1 hour and 30 minutes later, we get  luke warm pizza, warm salad, and cool poppers.  It was a pain to have to heat up being that we were hungry.   Grandmas pie:  Tasty with a good crust, not doughy, but came late and was luke warm. Poppers:  Meh Salad:  Good, not iceberg lettuce, but came warm from being next to pizza. Overall:  I may eat there, but I wouldn't do delivery again.
