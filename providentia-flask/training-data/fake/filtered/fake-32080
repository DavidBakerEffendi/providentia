I came here with my girlfriend twice for their dinner service. Both times, coincidentally we sat in the exact same spot, haha. Anyway, this place is in St. Marks, so for dinner time it's always buzzing. It's a good place, the food is tasty, but I have to say that the portions are small if you order off the menu. It's better to get the Dinner Special because you get way more food for the price that you're paying for. You have your choice of Udon or Soba, and the Soba is very light tasting, not like the ones you cook by yourself from the packages (it's made in house here). The tsuyu sauce is pretty tasty, though I have a suspicion it's from a bottle. The last time I came, I wasn't really that hungry, so I just ordered regular Zaru Soba. For those of you who don't know, Zaru Soba is straight up cold soba noodles on a plate, with dipping sauce. That already set me back 12.00 USD, haha... damn. My girlfriend ordered a Kitsune Udon Soup. She said the soup flavor was oddly off for a Japanese run restaurant, but what do I know, I'm not Japanese and I thought it tasted pretty damn good, haha. Overall, good experience. Food is a little pricey for what you get (I was nowhere near full with my entree) but the quality is good, and the atmosphere isn't too bad. More like 3.5 stars, to be honest.
