What surprises me is that this place is underrated and not as famous among University City students as it should be! This restaurant is awesome! The food is really great tasting and also something that is not super typical so it's great when you want to eat something different. The pita is delicious and the toppings are great (I love the chicken tawook in particular, but everything there is great). The desserts are amazing as well and come in such a large variety Â - many many different types of baklava, cookies, and various pastries. My mom loves their cappucinos! And of course, the prices are great. I also really love the atmosphere - the dining style is casual and the restaurant is really cozy. The service is extremely friendly and welcoming. Another thing that is great is that they now offer baklava-making classes for $35 per person! I took one a few weeks ago and it was really fun, very educational, and a great deal because I got to take two boxes of baklava home with me!
