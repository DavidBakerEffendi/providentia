Omg. What crap!!! You may like this place if your used to eating shit. Really, rude servers, cold food, tried to break open a crab claw and it exploded all over me. Clams need to be loosened from their shell as well as the oysters. The snow crab tray was empty throughout our meal. Never saw a crab leg. New food was not brought out until someone took the last cold morsal from its bin. $15.95? Never ever again!!
