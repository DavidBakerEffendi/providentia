The only bad thing about having Dos Toros set up shop down the street from my apartment is the impact it's made on my waistline. I love Mexican and my original goal was to be adventurous and try a little of everything on the menu. Then I had the carnitas burrito, and it's all I've had since.  Incredible.  The shop is a bit inconspicuous and tiny, but I've always snagged myself a seat with minimal wait. It's well worth the stroll past Chipotle to get there.  And now as I write this, I'm getting hungry and craving one of those burritos...
