Absolutely fabulous place.  I have never had haggis before, having heard all kinds of jokes about how bad it is.  Boy am I glad that I decided to try it out.  It was delicious.  I also had a bottle of the best hard cider that I have ever tasted.  My family and I plan to always dine here whenever we are in the area. My only request is that the kitchen stay open later than 9:00 PM on weekdays.
