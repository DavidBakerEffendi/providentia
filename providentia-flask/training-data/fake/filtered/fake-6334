What an incredible value.  When you see the location you automatically think it's going to cost a fortune, but you definitely get more than what you pay for here.  Staff is fantastic and genuine.  Calamari was perfect.  My chicken was a bit overcooked but still very delicious.  All the rest of the meal was perfect.  I saw the bill at the end was was pleasantly shocked for once.  Great place.
