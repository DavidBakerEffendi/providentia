Excellent Japanese cuisine!  We had the chicken and shrimp habachi.  Our chef was excellent and very interactive.  The steamed dumpling appetizer was as good as I've had in New York and Boston.  The atmosphere is very modern and inviting.  Although I had habachi, the main menu looked excellent too.  Next time you're in Glastonbury, stop by Sakura Garden for dinner.  It's got something for everyone!
