I visited Cafe Orlin on a Sunday around 9:45am.  It was quiet with fewer than 10 guests but the crowd increased to approx 20 people by 10:15am.  I ordered the pumpkin pancakes based on the reviews I saw on Yelp.  They were ok but the yogurt was a nice touch  I'll likely stick to buttermilk pancakes (which they also have but I did not try).  I ordered an Americano and it was watered down a bit.  The waitress was nice and attentive as were the other members of the waitstaff.  I'll likely return to try their other menu items and perhaps during the week when they have events.
