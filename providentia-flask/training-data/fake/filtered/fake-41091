Been meaning to pop in here for ages and finally did a few weeks ago on a Sunday afternoon with my husband and infant son. They were really accommodating of the baby and the staff had a lovely relaxed attitude. We each had a couple glasses of wine (well, the baby didn't) and split the bruschetta and the cheese plate. The food was good but overpriced. The wine was great. Atmosphere really mellow with the perfect number of patrons - enough so that it didn't feel lonely without being too packed. Since the space is small, I'm guessing it could get tight at peak hours. There is a downstairs garden space that I saw only in passing en route to the bathroom. All in all, a nice spot and I will return.
