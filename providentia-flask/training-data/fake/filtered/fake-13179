I came here with my family for the first time in a while. Our experience was disappointing and seems everytime we go it gets worst and worst. First, their dim sum specifcally the shrimp and pork shumi tasted and looked old. We had one bite and returned it. The fried calamri had a funky smell and like the dim sum tasted bad and looked like it was cooked days ago. It wasnt crispy at all but soggy and not at all appetizing. We asked to send it back and would just like to get the receipt and leave. They said we would have to be charged for the calamari but said they'll send it back and insisted to exchange it with another dish so we got the jumbo shrimp that they suggested and like the calamari it smelled and tasted bad. I am truly disappointed with the food we orderd and most likely not coming back. If you do go, I suggest not ordering, the week old shumi or the funk calamri or jumbo stinky shrimp. I am truly disappointed and suprised on the good ratings they are getting.. I guess we just choose the wrong food.
