i have a deep love for moto. rumbly train tracks, gorgeous dim lighting, pretty music in the corner as you walk in, otherworldly smells wafting from the kitchen... the ultimate date place, or friend place, or anytime place. it's straight out of another time, and everything on the menu, brunch, dinner, dessert, it's all wonderful. i sort of want to say you shouldn't go here, and keep it all to myself, but you should go here, it's the loveliest.
