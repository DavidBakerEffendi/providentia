A group of 11 of us had a fabulous meal, each ordering the $45 chef's selection and it was enjoyed by all!  The terrific wait staff just kept bringing beautiful, family style plates of Asian inspired dishes.  Everything was fresh and oh so edible!  We shared a variety of tasty treats including mini soft serve ice cream cones for dessert.  While there were a number if ingredients in each dish, the wait staff was very conscientious about food allergies and made anyone with an allergy feel comfortable.  I highly recommend the brussels sprouts...  I know... sounds crazy but it's true; that was everyone's favorite.  The leftovers made an encore appearance again in our hotel suite late night!  The atmosphere was gorgeous and I would recommend this to families, couples or large groups.  Sampan was very accommodating in every way.
