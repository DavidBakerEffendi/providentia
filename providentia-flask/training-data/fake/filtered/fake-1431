My husband & I had dinner here today....1st time here, wanted to try something new. It was the worst decision. The food was nasty, the worst Peruvian food I've ever had. We ordered the anticucho & papa rellena for appetizers, jalea & lomo saltado for entrees. The meat in both the anticucho Â & lomo saltado were overcooked & very salty. The seafood in the Jalea was not fresh at all & it tasted like they use frozen seafood & old oil to fry the seafood. The papa rellena's filling did not have any taste to it & the outer texture was hard like it was heated up in the microwave. The service was just as bad. Not once did they come to our table to ask if we needed anything or the usual: "how's everything"? And we were ready to go we had to get their attention because they were busy on their cell phones. I'm Peruvian so I know about Peruvian cuisine & this was by far the nastiest food I've ever tasted!!!! We will never go back to this restaurant again. If you love great authentic Peruvian food you will stay away from this place. I had to click on at least one star because it wouldn't let me post without choosing a star but in reality I wouldn't give them a star at all!!!
