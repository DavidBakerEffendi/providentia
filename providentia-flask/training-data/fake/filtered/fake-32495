Margaritas, Margaritas, Margaritas!!! Have a great experience every time I go in.  The Guacamole is great and the service is SPEEDY.  I never had to wait for anything.   My favorite for lunch is the tuna salad.  I love the Grilled Beef tacos.  Make sure you try the Guac with the Truffles!!! The service, decor and atmosphere is always lively.  Great first date place. Only reason I am not giving 5 is because I think the bar staff could be better.  Funny but the Hostesses, the managers and the servers are always amazing.  The bar staff is hit or miss especially during happy hour.
