We were in Burlington this past Sunday and tried for the second time to have a meal at Ri Ra. And for the second time we walked out due to the service being non-existent. We were seated, waited, and no-one asked us if we wanted a beverage, we finally flagged down a passing waiter who took our order and advised we could just help ourselves to the brunch buffet. We went up the stairs and not only was there no food under the chafing dishes, there wasn't anyone at the carving/omelet station. So we waited five minutes, still no-one showed. And no-one even asked if we needed any help. After looking over at our table and observing that no drinks had arrived, we decided to leave. I did stop and ask the bartender to speak with a manager - he said none was available, but did offer to do something after I told him that this was the second time I was walking out due to poor service. But there really was no point of anything he was offering. Perhaps had he intervened earlier instead of paying very close attention to the lone pretty gal eating at the bar.... ..... We wont go back as there are many other good restaurants in Burlington providing good service and good food. Note that this is the only restaurant I can remember walking out of due to lack of any service - twice no less!
