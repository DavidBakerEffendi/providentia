Great addition to the neighborhood!  Thank you!   Went to Jora with some friends yesterday and thoroughly enjoyed a great dinner and ambiance.  Pleasant staff and the bar area is cozy & made for mingling.  We had tasty piscojitos and the jalea seafood platter; everything was fresh & tasty.  We all agreed the skirt steak was cooked perfectly and the lamb shank is ABSOLUTELY, WITHOUT A DOUBT, HANDS-DOWN, the reason for this 5-STAR post.  I'm sure you'll agree.
