I have never felt the need to make a yelp account to write about my bad experience until my experience at this restaurant today. Every time i go, service and food gets worse. We ended up arriving at the restaurant earlier than the 45 minute wait that they told us for the pick up order. Â we got to the the restaurant, the hostess asked us to wait at the bar. We go to the bar and ordered a drink and the bartender tells us to leave the bar because we are taking up space for people who are eating at the restaurant. Donald, the owner, did not care about what was going on. Worst experience ever at a restaurant.
