First of all, let me start off by saying I haven't been here in awhile. The current reviews seem to imply this place has gotten better. If that is true, this is pretty much a phoenix rising sort of culinary tale.  When I ate there on several occasions about a year ago, this was one of the very worst restaurants in Philly . The only reason I am not giving it a one star review is because of the hope --HOPE-- that Fare has finally gotten it's game together. When I went, the wines were spoiled, the cocktails horrid, and food flavorless. It was insanely bad, almost funny bad.   here's to hoping the place has gotten better!
