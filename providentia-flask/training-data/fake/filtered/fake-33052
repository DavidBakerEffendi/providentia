My favorite Sunday brunch spot in the east village.  I am partial to the steak.  The array of unusual juices delighted the non-drinker in me, however my raving alcoholic friends seemed quite content with the available booze.  The decor and music are very chill.  This place is made for a cool afternoon with your friends
