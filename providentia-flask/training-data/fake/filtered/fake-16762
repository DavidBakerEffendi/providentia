Incredible vegan food.  I have eaten at many different vegan restaurants that try to make vegan food taste like something it is not.  Vegan Tree has amazing flavors, is not ashamed of its veganness and is my definition of the standard of which I will measure all of my future vegan eats.  We live in Dallas where  there are many fine vegan choices and this outdoes all of them!
