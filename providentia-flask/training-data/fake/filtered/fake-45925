Catas is about a 10minute walk from the Harrison PATH train station and Newark Penn Station.  It is without a doubt is the best bar near Red Bull Arena.  The interior is stylish and spacious.  The bartenders are great.  The bar menu they created for the Viking Army Supporters Club is affordable and delicious.  If you go, you must try the Viking Burger. The pre-match atmosphere at Catas is second to none.  A friendly yet passionate crowd gathers to watch La Liga games prior to the Red Bulls matches.  The singing and dancing can only be described as epic. There is also a handsome, charming young man who sings the 80's classic "The Final Countdown" by Europe on the megaphone.   If you live in the Ironbound or are heading to a Red Bulls match you gotta check out Catas.
