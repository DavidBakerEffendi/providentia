Tomato Soup was absolutely delicious - really fresh and perfectly seasoned. Grilled Goat Cheese w Fontina and Mushrooms Sandwich was off the hook - really, really tasty. My friend had the Beef and Blue which sounded a bit weird but turned out to be very, very tasty and the Ice Cream Sandwiches - the best ever. I also like that you can sit outdoors when it's sunny or indoors in inclement weather.
