I live in the nabe and have been to Quaint for dinner many times. It's my first choice for a meal in Sunnyside, other than my apartment. This is not because it's so fantastic, but by default. Other than the Turkish Grill which I no longer frequent because they raised their prices, Quaint is the only place in the area that I know will reliably serve me decent, real food that won't leave me feeling ripped off. The place is a bit dark (the garden in back is better if the weather permits). The room has a somber feeling that could be improved, although later at night, and if you're feeling romantic, it's just fine. The menu never changes, which means you know what you're going to get, and it also means you're stuck with it. Hence, I only go to Quaint when I'm ready for what they have to offer. They sell a middling hamburger but the fries are great. They usually have a steak on the menu, as well as salmon, their mussels appetizer is always good and they serve some good salads. Their appetizer specials are typically small for what you pay and I've learned to avoid them. Quaint has a bar and there's a nice selection of decent wines. When Quaint opened it was hailed as some kind of culinary destination in Sunnyside, but it's not. It's a cozy, clean place to get a meal, it has a nice laidback neighborhood vibe that's not sleazy, the service is good and the prices are pretty OK.
