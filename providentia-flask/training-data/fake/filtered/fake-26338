NEVER GO HERE! Not only is it a trashy bullshit Italian restaurant it also uses extremely unfair labor practices. As a table busser i worked three times before i was notified that i wasnt being paid...at all. The only compensation i would receive was tips. I worked from 4 pm till Midnight (usually waiting for the Bayonne police to finish their 11oclock meal) then id make on average 40 dollars. Then on 3 separate occasions i was forced to split my already measly tips with first time employees who had originally come in as a "waitress in training". The night i finally quit i had worked 7 hours and since it was busy i received 70 dollars. But because there was a waitress in training, i received only 30 dollars. Regardless if anyone thinks the food is good and affordable. Remember they don't pay their employees!!
