Excellent diner. Food always meets expectationws. Staff is courteopus and efficient. Very pleasent atmosphere. Very good quality. The hambueger delite is a diet plate that does not leave you feeling empty. The omelettes are alweays prepared just the way they were ordered. This is the go to place for lunch in the area.
