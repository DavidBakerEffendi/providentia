I have read a few lackluster reviews about Joes and I have to disagree.  I have been going here for about the last 15 years and I have always had a great experience.  The soup dumplings are the best, the crispy fish is great, food comes fast and hot.  The servers are very efficient and can be a little brusque, but seeing how crowded it always is, this is not unacceptable.  Love Joe's!!
