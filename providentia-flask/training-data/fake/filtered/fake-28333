Ok, I finally went there because my friends told me about it, then i heard from other people about it too, and I thought that there must be something here. And this something was a loooong wait for a meal which is well, worth the wait :) We had grilled octopus which was amazing and fried calamari, also very good. The stuffed sea food was delicious and I think i will be back. It was very noisy and kind of lacks atmosphere though...
