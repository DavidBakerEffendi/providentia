I will never come back to this place to eat.  I came here a few days after New Years with my family.  My son gave this to us as a Christmas Gift two years ago, and we never used the gift card.   This place has four strikes against them.  Their meat was too well done and dry,  They sat us near a children's party with a clown and children songs blasting.  They should have told us that there was a children's party that was going to start.  But we were already sitting down and being served.  We told the manager how it was not professional to do this to their customers.  Considering we are spending close to $200.00 for dinner.  This is not Chucky Cheese.....or McDonald's.  The third strike was that my son bought a $75.00 gift card for this place and they told us it was no good and annouced there was no money on the card.  We definitely got ripped off.  The fourth strike my husband and my daughter got seriously ill one hour after leaving the Brasilia Grill... Something that they ate was spoiled.  I'm telling everyone, DON'T GO THERE.
