Great food, they have amazing burritos the only reason this place is not getting 5 stars is because of their service. The hours online said they closed at midnight. When we walked in at around 1030PM they told us the kitchen was closing and we had to order right then and there. They brought our food out in less than five minutes and kept coming to our table every five minutes trying to ask us if we were done eating. Definitely made our dinner date a not very enjoyable time. My advice is advertise your hours better if you do not want incidents like this happen again.
