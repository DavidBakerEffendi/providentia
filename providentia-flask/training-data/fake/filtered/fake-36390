We absolutely loved our dining experience. The service was top notch. Â Our server helped us match the wine and food to perfection. We shared the short rib & bone marrow agnlotti that melted in our mouths. It was so beautiful, velvety pasta with the succulence of bone marrow. This plate took me back to my childhood eating bone marrow tacos and stews back when it wasn't popular. We continued with broccoli rabe and our entrees spiced duck breast and the ash crusted venison. Both were excellent, but the venison was exquisite. The venison's crust was perfect, flavorful and delightful. I have never had such perfect venison! The dessert panna cotta with guava and pineapple was perfectly made, not too sweet or syrupy. It was heavenly! Service was outstanding, price appropriate for the quality of the dining experience.
