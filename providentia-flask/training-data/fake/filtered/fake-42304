a tiny storefront with like 3 chairs, this place was packed! Clearly some good food is coming out of this. Had the $1 sesame pie which was essentially pizza dough missing the deliciousness that is pizza, and the $1 pork and chive dumplings which were Yuuuuummmmyyyyyy. I'd be down to try more food from there.
