We've been here and to Sushi Palace as AYCE in this area. Masa is in a different league. You never feel cramped at Masa. The staff is friendly and will remember you (by face anyway). They are constantly refilling something and do not rush you at all. Sushi is fresh and comparable to most good sushi places. All of the rolls have there own taste, not some generic sauce or seasoning. Cooked food is a plus. Go for the Masa Cerviche, Eggplant Roll and spicy seaweed salad.
