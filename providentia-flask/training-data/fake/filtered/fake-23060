This restaurant is so good that it finally motivated me to join Yelp so I could write a review. It was a pleasure to experience great food and outstanding service. My husband and I were greeted warmly upon our arrival. I was in the mood for a light dinner so I chose the antipasto bar. What a pleasant surprise -- not the typical selection of fatty, salty fare. Our waiter -- JR -- was very helpful in suggesting items I might like. I eventually decided on three salads: quinoa/arugula, beet, and lima bean with cubes of a sharp cheese (I think it was Provolone). All were delicious. There were many other wonderful selections as well. For my main course I had the vegetable minestrone (I think it had a touch of pesto). A perfect blend of flavors. My husband ordered the lasagna, which was served with a thick meat sauce. Also delicious. Next time we will definitely order the thin crust pizza for an appetizer. Trattoria Dell'Arte is a great choice for a pre- or post-Carnegie Hall event.
