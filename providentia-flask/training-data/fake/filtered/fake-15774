OMG! I happened upon Red's doing errands at the mall.  I glanced at the menu posted on the window and thought "finally, something different for a change". I walked in, ordered a dipped beef sandwich with "celary relish" and instantly recognized this "Chicago" style sandwich from my travels.   I have been back on several occassions, each time sampling a different item. This restaurant does it the right way!  The food quality is really good and the employees are friendly and informed Try this place!  Worth the trip.  I hear they have started Delivery as well.
