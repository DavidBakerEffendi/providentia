Amazing! Came here Saturday night for my boyfriends birthday since we're both big sushi fans. We got six different rolls and they were all delicious! The staff especially the owner Hendra, were all so friendly. Although it's not close to me, it will now be my new sushi spot! I highly recommend going...best sushi ever!!!!
