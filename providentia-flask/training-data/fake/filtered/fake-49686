Food was fine, service was poor. I was part of a party of more than 10, called and made reservations more than two weeks before the visit. When we arrived the hostess treated our group rather rudely, and the same with the waitress. When making reservations, we specifically asked to have separate checks for each person, with gratuity added. The hostess said no problem. The waitress could not have been ruder regarding this matter and absolutely refused to do it. She did split the check into two. If you change it from one check to two, why not just make the party happy? I didn't ask my group but with a separate checks her tip would have been a done deal, the rude service sealed it for me.
