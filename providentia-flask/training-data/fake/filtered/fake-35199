While visiting New York my wife and I were looking for a place for lunch on the lower east side and would have walked right by this little jewel of a restaurant had we not noticed two women descending the stairs and then seen them go into Gaia's. And how lucky we felt that we had passed up a number of other places that seemed "okay." Gaia's Italian Cafe is infinitely better than okay. There are only eight tables but the place is filled with the obvious love Gaia feels for her food and her customers. Gaia is Italian and a typical Italian cook. When my wife asked for pepper for her salad Gaia said the salad didn't need pepper but when my wife then ordered the marvelous vegetable soup, Gaia asked if my wife would like it to be a little spicy. That story tells that this wonderful place is much more like eating marvelous food in a friend's kitchen than in a restaurant. Oh yes...the food is just terrific. Order anything; you'll love it.
