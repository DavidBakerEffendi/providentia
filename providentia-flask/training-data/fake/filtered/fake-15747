Over priced for poor quality food. Save your money and go somewhere you know is good already. Service is horrible... Pasta is cheep if I got a 1/8 cup of cooked pasta with Puttanesca Sauce I was lucky and to pay $2.75 for a glass of soda with out refills.. Waitress came to our table once a $1.00 tip she deserves.. Â like I said go some place else to eat you can get your money worth else where..
