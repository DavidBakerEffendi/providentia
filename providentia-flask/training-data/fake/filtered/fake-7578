I come in almost every other day. The food can't get no better. I been eating at the cafe since it opened and the P20 never gets old. The service is amazing too but I came to eat this morning and realized a new trainee named Britney. She use to work for a relative of mine and she is BAD news. I am a loyal costumer and I don't want to see your business get hurt because of a mistake hiring the wrong people. I feel like it will bring problems to your business and I wouldn't want to see that. I won't get into details but please watch out. This place had been a god sent and a blessing to this neighborhood.
