i've been here twice.  the first time was because i was hanging with a friend who wanted to go because he knew the owner from the other restaurant he used to own.  we were dressed casually in streetclothes, and when we walked in on a saturday afternoon with no reservations, the hostess didn't seem to want to let us in because we had no resevations, mind you there were only three tables occupied and the place was quiet.  she finally offered us the table next to the coat rack.  the owner saw my friend out of the corner of his eye and waved us in and gave us the run of the place.  he sat with us for about a half hour and kept bringing us appitizers, by the time our main couses arrived, we were stuffed.  food was great.  the waitstaff was cold and seemed to loathe us, after first denying us a table, then to see us eating $50 of appitizers with "no charge" on the bill..  i was so impressed with this place, i went back 2 weeks later with a date.  the second time wasn't so good.  the portions were smaller, the flavor was bland on my veal marsala.  overall, neither of us were impressed.   vowed never to return..  i live near this place, and pass by it a few times a week.  one day i noticed something is missing from this italian restaurant... italian customers.   that tells me something when an italian restaurant doesn't attract italians.  there is a great italian restaurant on ditmars & 43st that has italian families going there for sunday dinner.  it's called Forno.  that one i highly recommend over this place...
