Right next to Willowbrook Mall open for Lunch and Dinner.  A little Jewell "Jyoti" lives up to it's name offering flavorful and deliciously prepeared indian food.  A well stocked Buffet than can be taken out is offered at very affordable ($7.95) rate.  Do not however expect welcoming hospitality or gracious smiles, and if you do "Take Out" do not expect to taste any of the desserts offered at the Buffet since they are not included.
