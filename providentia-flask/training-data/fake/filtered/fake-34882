We were fortunate enough to have our first experience at Chef's Table on 12/3. After calling every week on Monday for hours, I was able to score a table for my wife's birthday 5 weeks out. Jackpot I had won the lottery! The person who took my reservation was pleasant and really felt my pain when I originally didn't get one on my first two attempts. Let me first state that the meal was for my wife's birthday, and the only thing she wanted was to eat here. I almost broke down because I couldn't get a table; however, the reservationist took sympathy on me and said that I was first on the wait-list. It took persistence, determination, and follow-through because I eventually got off the wait-list. Now let me get into the meal itself..... soooooo, last night was spectacular. It was the best meal I have ever had. My wife had done the majority of the research and I was going Â in blind. I was pleasantly surprised to find out that he had been trained by a famous culinary institute in Japan, and almost everything that I had in the fish section was like being transplanted to Tsukiji. I don't remember all the dishes because there were so many but here are a few of the more memorable ones (they were all good); Uni with caviar? Horse Mackerel, suzuki, Langostine, Tuna (do I have to mention what type?), Hamachi? Fluke, Sardines.. The food went on and on and on. It was a real treat. In addition to the food, the service was spectacular. We really lucked out because we were able to sit closest to the kitchen and were able to see the chefs do their magic. They were extremely friendly, attentive and Chef Ramirez was extremely helpful and made us feel welcome. Hopefully everyone else can have a great experience like us. Thank you Chef's Table!!!
