An extremely appealing place. I would not call it a "hole in the wall" because that doesn't do justice to the fine design of the place. So far my experience has been limited to the bar, but that has been a very happy experience. As a single woman of a certain age, I really appreciate being at a place where it's natural to have a conversation with the people around you. And of course the wine and the bartenders are way better than average. I only wish it were a lot bigger.
