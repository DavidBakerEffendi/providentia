I know people LOVE this place, but I find it a bit meh. Everything (at least in the Mexican part of the menu) is fairly spicy. The place is really popular, so it's not unusual for there to be an hour+ wait - on weeknights. Forget it on weekends. They don't take reservations. The parking lot is shared with urgent care and I've spent 20+ minutes looking for a spot before because it gets THAT crowded. Personally, it's not the Mexican place for me. But, portions are big and the prices are reasonable.
