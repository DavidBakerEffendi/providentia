I'm shocked anyone would give this place anything less than 5 stars.  Everyone I've taken to Chili Willie's has loved the place.  It's small, so sometimes you've gotta wait, but it's worth it.  You can also BYOB, which makes it very economical.  Very friendly staff and excellent service.  They make some of the best flan I've ever had.
