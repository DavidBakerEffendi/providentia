I went here on Sunday for my birthday dinner, and was thrilled. We went really early so there wouldn't be a wait, and we were seated right away (I can't speak to what it's like when it gets crazy busy). EVERYTHING (from the oysters to the rhubarb strawberry pie, the cocktails and the main course -a mouthwatering mackerel) was pitch perfect. I'm not often a yelper, but this experience was so spot on that I wanted to shout it out!
