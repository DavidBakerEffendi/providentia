A place to fall in love. A place to eat, talk and wine yourself until vertigo. The mussels were superb, the bisque was amazing. To the chef and wait staff: Thank you for giving me a restaurant i can confidently bring anyone to that I'd like to impress by exposing them to your personalities and talents in and out of the kitchen. I plan a return trip with champagne to see the parlor trick that I've heard about the chef wowing people with.
