My first yelp review ever despite living in NY for 3 yrs.  Great food, reasonably priced, - HOWEVER, never coming.  Worse service ever, very rude, insulting, snobby - can't believe Japanese people are involved with this restaurant. And no, the strength of food does not make up for the behavior of the people who work there.
