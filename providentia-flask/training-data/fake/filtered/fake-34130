Went for lunch again today.  Top notch service.  Claudio and Leonardo truly want you to have an amazing experience and do their best.  Such a relaxing meal and quite yummy. Today I was spoiled by being offered several samples of wine they offered  by the glass as they were concerned that I got what I liked.  Had eggplant with house made mozzarella Tapa and stuffed piquillo pepper tapa. Nice crusty bread with olive oil too. Portions large and both dishes were layered with flavor. Mother had three course prix fixe menu with roasted beet salad, the best lobster ravioli ive tasted and vanilla panacotta for dessert. Both of us took home leftovers.  Great job and can't wait to go back. They have a wine dinner next thursday that sounds great. Always my first choice place to dine on a day off.  Although I'm only able to go there once a month or so, I am always warmly greeted like a missed friend. Ellen from Milford
