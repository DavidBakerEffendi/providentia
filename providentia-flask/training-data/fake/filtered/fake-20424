This place looked very cute when I passed by, so we decided to try for lunch.  I was very very disappointed, the $15 fish entree came out almost after 1 hour and it was fishy and not fresh so we sent it back and got a burger instead thinking that is a 'safe' choice.  It came out another half an hour later and the meat had a very bad smell, like it was going bad.  Worst part was when the hostess came and told me, "I tasted the fish, and it wasn't fishy at all, and the burger meat is fresh!".  Not, "we are very sorry!".   These are moments when I wish that I was Gordon Ramsay, after waiting for 1 hour and a half, I was still starving!  I have never been so angry at a restaurant before, even with bad experiences and that's why for the first time in my life, I decided to write a 'bad' review of a restaurant.  Bottom line, bad spoiled food and bad service, do not go there!
