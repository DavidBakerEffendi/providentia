Finally!  A lounge that gets it. No cover, cool bouncer, ATTENTIVE  and personable bartenders.  The crowd is normally multi ethnic and relaxed. It gets very crowded on Fridays after 6pm. Seating is limited. The wall art changes every week i believe. The D.J.  normally plays Tribe called Quest sort of hip hop, James brown and other soulful tasteful tracks.  Yada, yada, yada, just go, you'll like it.
