Interesting atmosphere and history...food was freshly made and edible for the price. For Manhatten, this place was reasonably priced and one can get a nice meal. The wine list is strange but we were able to find a  nice chardonay that worked for us. negs - the waitress had a bit of an attitude until we killed her with kindness AND  the music was too loud upstairs.
