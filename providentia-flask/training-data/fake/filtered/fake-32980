For me, it gets very frustrating deciding what to eat before a show at the Union Transfer because... well, to be frank, I'm a glutton and need a sizable amount of food to pre-game with but would prefer something that isn't dripping with grease. I asked a friend for a recommendation and he pointed me toward the shady shack that is Jose's. Now the restaurant isn't exactly the prettiest but I don't mind the shady ex/interior as long as the food delivers. Well, holy crud, did this place deliver. The fish tacos were out of this world, especially when I poured Mexican hot sauce all over it. The fish was flaky, juicy, and perfectly seasoned; a wonderful compliment to the delicious mango soda I grabbed from the fridge. I followed up with a steak burrito that wasn't too bad but I would've appreciated more steak. There was way more rice in it than I would've expected, but I liked that it wasn't dripping with grease or laden with that icky sweat that is all too familiar with quick-stop taco joints. You can tell the everything is made fresh to order. The staff was super friendly, attentive to our needs, and quick to offer recommendations. I will certainly be going back to try out their other dishes (especially the pork) but I am absolutely sold on just the fish tacos. It's cheap and right around the corner from the UT..... make this your pre-concert spot for sure.
