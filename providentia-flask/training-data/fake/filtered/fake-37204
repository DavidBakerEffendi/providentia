Pros: Lovely modern decor, quiet dining area and fun bar. The staff is extremely professional; the level of service is way above what the menu prices would predict. One of the best burgers in the city, ribs too. Excellent selection of very well thought out seasonal sides. Cons: The steaks are usually over salted to the point that I dont order them anymore. Neutral: Salads are good but not really that nothing to write home about. The sushi is so so. I really love this place but only a few of their dishes really bring that wow factor. That being said the service is so good that I'm ok with only ordering one of three dishes there.
