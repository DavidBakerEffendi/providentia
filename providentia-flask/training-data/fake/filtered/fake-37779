One word. Disappointing... Well at least for brunch.  Seemed liked a forced breakfast menu taking their better liked dishes and adding eggs.  Staff was a little unfriendly and rushed despite a not too crowded day.  The dining area is way too loud for normal conversation. Bad acoustics. Burgers were small.  Salads were not very unique.  Stick to mussels and fries and beer.
