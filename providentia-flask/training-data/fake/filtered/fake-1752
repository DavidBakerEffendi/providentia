I booked the reservation for Pio Pio for my boyfriend's birthday. Upon entering the restaurant, it really looks nice. The decor is pretty and I love the darkness of the restaurant because it makes it super sexy. However, when we were seated downstairs it got so loud it was unbelievable. The food was ok...we ordered the matador combo..it was good. but my chicken wasnt cooked wnough..but at the same time it wasnt anything to go crazy for. i didnt go for the fries and hot dogs..i could make that at home. the rice and beans were good..i love rice and beans but they couldve given more. Bar was crazy expensive though..we bought some henny and honestly the amount they gave was absurd. the highlight of the meal was the tres leches cake i ordered for him. they were nice enough to come out with a candle and sing him happy birthday... overall, it was just okay. nothing to make me wanna come back in a hurry or at all. but my fellow yelpers are pretty spot on with reviews, so you can trust this one, because I LOVE food and a great meal, but this wasnt it all the way
