I had no idea what to expect,  I used to frequent the old VI, and was planning on just a  quick drink. but wow, we ended up staying for a bite. Fish taco's were full of flavor, and my friend loved the celtic salad!   It's what this town really needed.  The staff is amazing and food is pretty good for pub fare.   You have to try  the Birthday Cake martini :)
