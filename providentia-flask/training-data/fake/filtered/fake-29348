Get the falafel, it's amazing, it's affordable, it's sofa king good. I ate it while walking since - warning, it's super small in there. I dropped a little piece of falafel and mourned it for a moment. It was just so delicious. It took me far too long to check this place out, and I look forward to coming back.
