This place rocks - really tasty meats with unique toppings (radishes, squash, cotija) plus the standards (pico, lettuce, etc.).   Chipotle is right down the street but definitely give this place a shot - better tasting food that isn't thrown at you like someone's jabbing the employee with a hot stick.  The servers here are friendly, cool and willing to please.  Very good!!!
