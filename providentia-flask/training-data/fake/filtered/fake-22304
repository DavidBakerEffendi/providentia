Best pizza I've had in CT.  We drive over 30 minutes to get a pie.  Great house salad and balsamic dressing is delicious.  This crispy crust and delicious toppings.  I have  not found a pizza place that can beat it!  Not the same as the one in center of West Hartford.  Go to the one in Bishop's Corner near the Big Y store.  Yum
