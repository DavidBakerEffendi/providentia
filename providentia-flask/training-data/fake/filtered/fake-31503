I NEVER write reviews but this one I had too...the view is amazing, the place is pretty small... The food is really good but very small portions.. NOW!! THE SERVICE???? OMG HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE !! PLEASE HIRE MORE PROFESSIONAL PEOPLE! THE STAFF MAKES THIS PLACE LOOK BAD!!!! We seriosuly had to ask for our waiter and everytime we asked a new person came to help lol is this some type of a joke? NOT ONLY DOES THE SERVICE SUCK BUT I took my boyfriend here for his birthday they brought out the cake I ordered and sang happy birthday to his cousin (the person sitting next to him) and then the waitress said " oh shit sorry " LOL "VERY PROFESSIONAL" ! Please hire new staff !
