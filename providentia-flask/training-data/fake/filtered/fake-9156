My boyfriend and I went here the first time for drinks, it is a beautiful place and the drinks and service was great.   We went for dinner last night.  We had the asparugus wrapped with procuit, he had the chicken, I had the hanger steak with lava cake for dessert.  Everything was off the hook, but spicy which we do not mind, but I think most people would not.  The service is great and ambiance even better. Check it out, well worth it.
