A fantastic breakfast place.  Always seating available, and the food is consistently good.  Our waitress last time must have been new because when I asked for a bacon and cheese omelette, she insisted that the bacon only comes on the side (as opposed to in the omelette).  Other than that little glitch, the service has always been good.
