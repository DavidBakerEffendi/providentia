Wow, what a disappointment.  The other reviews here sum it up well, but to echo the sentiments....  The service is absolutely awful.  We stopped by on a Tuesday afternoon - very slow, very few people there - and yet it took forever to get our drinks and the waitress seemed to disappear for 15-20 minutes at a time.  The drinks are way overpriced and simply not done well.  $9 for a martini?  I don't think so.  The strawberry daiquiri was almost all mix with no real flavor.  And the food - outrageously priced, the portions are very small, and there is absolutely nothing upscale about any of it.  I got the calamari appetizer ($11)  It came in a "Chinese box."  It looked like something from a fast food place.  It was half the size and nowhere near as good as what I get at Max Fish for the same price.  My fiancé got the "lobster roll" at $18 (!!)  Now if you're going to pay that much - you expect something special - yet what she got was barely edible and seemed to come out of a freezer . Her comment summed it up nicely... the Lobster Roll Panera Bread offers is bigger, tastes much better and is cheaper.  This place also had an odd smell to it - like someone spilled beer and tried to cover it up with something.  In summary - this place needs a LOT of work before we'd ever consider coming back.  I'd recommend it to someone who wants to meet for *one* drink and move on.  This is not a place for a memorable dinner (well, you will remember what a rip off it was!) or which leaves the impression of "wow, I have to come back."  And that's a shame given its prime location.  Compared to everything else around it, this place just falls very flat and has nothing appealing about it.  Your money will be much better spent at either Max restaurant nearby, Sakura Garden downstairs, or Magee McFly's.
