My gf and I were staying at the Carlton, when she suddenly hungry at midnight. So she suggested this halal cart that's "apparently amazing" so we decided to take a taxi up and stand in line for about 20 minutes in the freezing cold for some chicken, beef, lamb combo and rice. That white sauce, yeah... Mmmm. Get it. We took it back to the hotel and ate it in the bathroom so our room wouldn't stink.
