Bellas is one of my favorite places to eat on staten island.  All of the food is great. The service is great as well.  If you want good italian food and good service Bellas is your place.  They make you feel like you are part of a family.  You never leave there unsatisfied.  BELLAS ROCKS!!!!!!!!!  The stuffed meatball is my fav....  Pizza is great... Go to Bellas and find out how good the food is...
