The place is awesome - great food, environment and people.  It has a family run feel and the diversity of quality offerings is refreshing to see. I'm vegetarian and yes, it's weird that I would go into a place called the "Flying Metaballs," but sometimes I just tag along with my coworkers.  They were happy to make substitutions and custom recipes, how awesome is that? The food is excellent and the portion sizes are perfect.  Yes, you can go to Espositio's and get twice as much food, but the quality is less than half.  Quality vs Quantity here. Great tasting sandwiches for around $8-9 is average for this area.  David Alan's is around the same cost. I wish the drinks were a little cheaper or there was a chips plus drink for $2 add-on offer.  I've been to FM several times now and the food and service has always been great.  They're one of our usuals now.  Good job to the owners for bringing in some refreshing, great quality, diverse tasting foods!
