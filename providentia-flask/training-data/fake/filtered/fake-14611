I absolutely loved this place.  The ambiance is so great! The food was very delicious and it came so fast.  If you order the lamb chops, they should tell you that they are minature lamb chops.  I had the shrimp and chicken in garlic sauce with yellow rice and broccoli, and it was superb, Lots of food too!  The banana desert was made to order.  The waiter was friendly. I would definitely recommend this place to a friend
