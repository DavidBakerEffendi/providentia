The food is fresh, big portions, and priced right, and there are tons of menu options. The warm chips and fresh salsa they give you are the perfect start to a meal. The nacho appetizer is really good, covered in fresh toppings and not too overloaded with cheese. I've had the veggie tacos, which is listed as an appetizer but is totally an entree. It comes with four soft corn tortillas stuffed with fresh sauteed veggies and a big side of rice and beans. I've also had the veggie burrito, which I was only able to finish half of because it was so huge. I've heard that the chicken enchiladas in mole sauce are also excellent. They give you these green and red sauces on the side that are great, too. The staff is really nice, and the owner will remember you. We've been there maybe four or five times, and the last time he gave us a complimentary dessert (delicious flan!) for our patronage. Definitely recommend this place.
