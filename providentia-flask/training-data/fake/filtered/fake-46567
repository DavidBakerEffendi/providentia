Bad, Awful, Crap....how many ways can one say in-freakin' TERRIBLE! Crowded. Rude management. Even ruder service. The food was nothing memorable. Felt like I was getting the bums rush the entire evening. I simply don't get the rave reviews here. Obviously, the management here is writing most of the reviews with 5 star ratings because this place offers nothing close to a true 5 star experience. I would have given a no stars rating if it were possible. Spend your money at a restaurant that serves quality food accompanied by friendly service, in an enjoyable atmosphere.
