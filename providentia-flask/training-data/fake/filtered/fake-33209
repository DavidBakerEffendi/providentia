"Falafel.Wheat.Green.Everything" That's all you need to know.   Since moving from the West Village to the Brooklyn suburbs a few weeks ago my favorite former neighborhood eats are quickly becoming clear.  Taim is one of those that's led me back to the big city just to pick up my favorite inexpensive lunch and walk around the old-hood. The west village doesn't have a plethora of cheap eats and this one almost makes up for the lack of everything else. Tasty falafels that keep you fed and full for the day for under 10 bucks is as good a deal you are going to find.
