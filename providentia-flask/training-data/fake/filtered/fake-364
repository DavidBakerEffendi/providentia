The two times I have been to this location I was less than impressed. Both times the floor staff were very accommodating however the service was rather slow.  The first time I chalked it up to being apart of a larger group (7 people) however the second time was no better (only 3 people this time). The food both times lacked any real flavor  however my husband did think the fries were amazing. I don't know if I will be going back, it really didn't leave an awesome impression on me.
