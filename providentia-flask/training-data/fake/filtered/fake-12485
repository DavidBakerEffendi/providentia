If I could, I would give NO STARS. It took almost 2 hours to deliver 6 blocks away and even when the food got here, it was cold and wrong order.  WTF.  When I called the restaurant they were rude and another bothered that I called with a problem. Another time I tried to order... instead of telling me what they had available, they let me go through the list of 6 different items to tell me they ran out of ingredients to make them.  How is it that they ran out of miso glazed salmon and steak sandwich - it's their best sellers! I think they are riding high on positive reviews and people and not paying attention because their quality is inconsistent and service horrid. NEVER AGAIN.
