New Location - Cedar Park Cafe has reopened at: 2035 N. 63rd Street (63rd & Woodbine/Lancaster Av) 19151, in the Overbrook Farms section of the city.  Just two blocks south of City Av. This is my first time at either location.  The food was fantastic.  I'm rather picky, o.k., very picky, and it was presented to me exactly as I ordered it. Very nice relaxed atmosphere, sunny and very clean inside.  The staff was very pleasant and courteous.
