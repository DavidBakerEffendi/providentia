This place was excellent! Our server Thibaut was great, very attentive. The food was perfect, and they have by far, the best waffles I've ever had in my life! I was prepared for fussy and overpriced French food. It was anything but. Amazing comfort breakfast food that will fill you up for the day. Cocotte is superb with the potatoes to die for Service was generally good, although it was rather busy, so refills on water and waiting for the check was on the slower side. Not too pricey, but certainly could go cheaper too. I would come back in a heartbeat for breakfast of lunch if I'm in the area.
