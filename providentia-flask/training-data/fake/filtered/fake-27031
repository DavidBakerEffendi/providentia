We recently had a very strange experience at this restaurant! We had just moved into the neighborhood, been here once before and loved it! Food good, cozy atmosphere. This time we had friends visit and wanted to take them- there were six of us on a Wednesday eve. I called ahead and asked if I could make a reservation outside. The guy who answered said they don't usually take reservations but he thought it would be ok, and he would call us if there was a problem. No call. So we walked up, and sat down at the table selected for us. We were the only people sitting outside. A man then approached us (owner maybe?) and proceeded to tell us that we really shouldn't have tried to make a reservation, that it was first come, first served and we should remember that in the future! We were taken aback, it felt a little like receiving a scolding as a child! Â  They are known for their wood fired pizzas. My son only likes cheese and garlic on his- usually no problem anywhere we go. When I asked the same guy if it could be done he said no! The cheese could not be grated so it wouldn't work. We got up and left- and I am disappointed because the food is good here, but the arrogance of this man totally turned me off. We will not be back.
