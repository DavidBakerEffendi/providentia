What a great time! You can definitely see a difference! They have a wide variety of beers on tap. Service was quick and fast. All the staff was extremely nice. Just a relaxed environment in general. Food was best I have had in the city by far, and I have eaten at some very nice places. I would definitely recommend trying this place if you ever get the opportunity, you wont be let down.
