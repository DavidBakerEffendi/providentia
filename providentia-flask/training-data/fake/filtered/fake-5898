Really not sure how this place has so many great reviews. The place is nice, if not generic. The food was closer to Olive Garden than anything else. The kale salad was so bland we asked for a different salad. The arancini (rice balls) were all bread crumbs and cheap mozz. Overall, not impressed. I'd rather walk a few blocks east and get dinner in Little Italy (which I never thought I'd say).
