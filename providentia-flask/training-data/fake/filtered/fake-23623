I love taking friends who are visiting the city to this spot. The area can be somewhat unsettling at night, but navigating the area is well worth it when you see the pleasant surprise on your friends' face as you take them down this small alleyway to stumble upon the quaint restaurant tucked away. It's also right across the street from a great beer garden called Loreley's that you can fall into afterward.
