The food here was great ,we did get the whole roast suckling pig. The wait staff was very attentive and was very willing to answer any questions we had. You do have to order this a few days in advance so it can be prepared for you. We also tried a lot of different appetizers as well. All were very good =No complants from me. Everything was in order.
