My wife and I met some friends there last week for brunch. We enjoyed the food, and amount of variations that were available. The spinach soup was excellent, the chicken tikka was cooked well, but fairly mild. The fish wasn't that great, it seemed a bit old and therefore not as fresh as it could have been. Our general disappointment come with the service, the waiter hovered around our table but we had to ask for our water to be filled and our plates to be taken. Additionally, they charged us a gratuity of 18% even thought we were only a party of four and this at a lunch buffet. The food was mediocre and the service lack luster, I would this avoid this establishment and find some place else to spend your money.
