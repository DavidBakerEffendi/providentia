Yaaaawn.  This is mexican food for beginners.  Nothing very spicy and the entree's come with the basic bland beans and rice.  Sorry, the fish taco's were, well, fried fish inside a taco with a little salad and mild sauce.  No Cilantro.  No jalepeno.   Casual outside seating along the road was nice, though.   Good eating!
