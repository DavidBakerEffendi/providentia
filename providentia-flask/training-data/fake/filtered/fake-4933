Don't know who Sharon W. Is, but she wasn't at the same Piccolo Angolo as me. I've been eating here for years and the food and service are top notch. Sure, it's a little small and sometimes noisy, but that's where you find the best food in New York. I live on the Upper West Side and often go down to Hudson and Jane because that's where the best Italian food in all of New York City can be found!!! The portions are huge and should be shared Â (hence the higher prices) and Maria and Peter are outstanding hosts. They take reservations (online and on the phone) and always honor them. I'll be going back next week!
