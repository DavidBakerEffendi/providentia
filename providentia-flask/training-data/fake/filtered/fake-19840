Went here Saturday afternoon for the Happy Hour menu and to watch the football game.  Plenty of space at the bar and 4 tvs for our viewing pleasure.  Our bartender, Kevin, was very friendly and a jovial host with good advice on what to order. Really large selection of tap beers which is always a plus.  Ordered a Empire Cream Ale which was 3 dollars from 3 - 6 pm.  My wife ordered a Greek Margarita which was only 5.  The wine list was also quite extensive. Oysters for $1 - Superb.  Fresh and cold. Gyro Spiced Sliders for $1 - Perfectly cooked, medium rare, flavorful. I ask Kevin the bartender the one dish I MUST try and he tells me the Octopus Salad without hesitation.  Well, he was spot on.  It was the most delicate, tender octopus I've ever eaten.  Served over a bed of chickpeas, black eyed peas, and olives. I'd come here again just for that one dish.  it was that good. We spent 3 hours at the bar.  2 drinks each, 30 oysters, 5 sliders, the octopus salad, and mini souvlaki wraps.  All told, the bill was 70 bucks.  Such an incredible value for awesome food, good drinks, and a great bartender. If there is a single gripe it would have to be: We sat close to the front door, which has a mini heated vestibule.  Only the inside door didn't close all the way so every once in a while you'd get a blast of 20 degree air from the outside if customers had both doors open at once. We are absolutely coming back and will try a sit down dinner then.
