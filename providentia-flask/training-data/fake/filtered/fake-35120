JS I am at the Dark Horse at least 3 days a week with my friends. It is the most friendly place ithe downtown area, especially the server Annie. Gavin the manager is very customer friendly and the other bartenders take that lead. the food is good with a great variety including sweet paotato fries, calamari and ribs. Try it sometime while out for good food and conversation while watching a game with your individual TV. You will like it.
