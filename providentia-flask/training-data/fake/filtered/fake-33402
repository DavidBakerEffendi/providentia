I have read some of the past reviews and I don't know which restaurant they were reviewing. I went to Max Downtown with my wife, daughter and son-in-law. My wife ordered scallops, which were overcooked. My daughter ordered a salad with goats cheese. Server noticed something wrong with salad before setting it on the table and said "oops" and took it back to the kitchen. I ordered the mixed grill. It consisted of one sausage, three dried up shrimp, three small medallions of venison. It was a mess. Everything was overpriced. So I do not think that I will return too soon.
