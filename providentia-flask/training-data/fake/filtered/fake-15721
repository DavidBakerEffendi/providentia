Good food, friendly staff.  I love the marinated grilled chicken dinner, really has a great flavor.  Most of the dinners come with a salad and either potato or rice and a vegetable.  They make the best broccoli around...don't know how they season it but it's really yummy.  My husband loves the prime rib which I think is only available on Friday or Saturdays.  Solid eats!  Decor could be nicer, but would definitely recommend the food.
