First let me say I read the other reviews on here and dont get it.  I have been coming here for many years and have always been happy.   You can bring your own bottle and have a great meal for a little amount of money. I love the beef ribs!!!!!   I guess everyone can't be happy but I dont see some giving one or two stars.   A great value and food is always good.   I have never tried the take out  and have always eaten there.
