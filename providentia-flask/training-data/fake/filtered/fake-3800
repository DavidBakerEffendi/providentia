Sadly....I can not comment on the food as we never made it into the Restaurant.  We were invited for a special 50th birthday celebration.  Our host called the day of the reservation to confirm, however, the same person who booked the reservation informed our host that there was no reservation.  Being the meticulous person our host is, she reiterated the day, time and name of the individual from Mes Reves who booked the reservation.  The chef/owner even got on the phone....he was rude and kept insisting there was no reservation.  Our host worked desperately to try and remedy the situation for herself and the other 9 guest, but he held little compassion for her dilemna.  This special day...her 50th Birthday....along with the beautiful invitations and party favors was turning into a nightmare for our host/birthday girl.  Fortunately, one of her guest called Cafe Matisse in Rutherford and they quickly rearranged their seating to allow our host to continue with her special milestone birthday.  Unfortunately, too many restaurants today want to turn over their tables in the name of making money.  We all understand that and as business owners must care about our profits in today's economy.  However, whether Mes Reves mistakenly accepted that reservation or not, there is still a moral obligation to do the right thing.  Every once in a while, it is important to remember we are human beings first.  However good a restaurant's food may be should never override the qualities of a good, decent human being.  Shame on you Mes Reves.
