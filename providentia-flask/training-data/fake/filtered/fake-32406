I'm so thankful to have styled upon t&n! When I went in it was very quaint and friendly. I only went in for a normal egg breakfast - and was blown away. Â They make their own spicy ketchup that is insane and I'm obsessed with their version of tater tots - they're like fried mashed potato balls - gotta try them! Try one of the fried chicken and waffle cupcakes - they're life changing!
