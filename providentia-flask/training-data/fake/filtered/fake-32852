This lettle spot near historic independence area of Philly is a gem.  We ducked in out of the heat last week and enjoyed a cooling salad with fresh fruit and wonderful cheeses.  The service is attentive and knowledgeable.  The desserts looked So Yummy, but with time of day and excessive heat outside, had to give them a pass.  Next time--coffee hour for sure!!
