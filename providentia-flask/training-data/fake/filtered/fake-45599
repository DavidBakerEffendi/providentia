Went there with friends last week.  The cobb salad was large and delicious, very tasty...my friend had the mushroom ravioli and he cleaned his plate.  For an appetizer we had the boneless chicken wings and coconut shrimp...skip the wings, they were just so-so, but the shrimp was fabulous.  Crisp and crunchy and the dipping sauce was to die for...as for dessert, the pecan pie is better than the cheesecake and it is served warm...ummmmm good..also "True Accustic" was playing in the dining room and it added to the great atmosphere..music was not too loud and we could still hear ourselves talk.  Had a great time. I will be back!
