Chef Chris Torla has created a globally eclectic menu as their website claims and his flavorful world dishes do tantalize the taste buds like no other restaurant around. Not to mention it's a hip, stylish place near a parking garage, a plus for Hartford. My appetizer was the Rock Shrimp and Sweet Potato Fritters and they were to die for. I moved on to the Seafood Pad Thai / rice noodles, gulf shrimp, scallops, lime-chili sauce and roasted peanuts. I was skeptical he could pull off authentic Thai but he did and he did it well, absolutely perfect. (I should know, that's one of my favorite dishes). I have to comment that the sweet potatoe fries my wife had were fabulous as well. I highly recommend TK! I was told June 25 he is doing a prix fixe Patron Tequila Dinner at 6:30. I have already RSVP. The Trumbull Kitchen Facebook page has the menu.
