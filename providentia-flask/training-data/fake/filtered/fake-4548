Devil's Den is one of the few places in South Philly where the service has always been great. The food runner/barback and the servers work well together and it's often hard to tell where the server ends and where the barback begins.   The barback will often drop food at a table and give a simple explanation, and as he leaves, the server arrives with a water pitcher and to check up on us.  It seems like a well-oiled staff.  Most of the bartenders are also friendly (aside from one guy who just seems to lack personality altogether), and as someone that knows a whole lot about beer, its nice to be able to ask questions and have them answered.   When it first opened, Devil's Den seemed to have an identity crisis..was it a pub, a restaurant, casual upscale dining? Or was it a sports bar?  The menu in the past has gone through a lot of changes and in my opinion it's much more appropriate now with mainly sandwiches and flatbreads (and a DELICIOUS DiBruno cheese plate! mm cheese.) I like that I can stroll in, get a beer and maybe get a burger while I watch the Phils, or show up for a casual date with my friends and have a completely different vibe in the dining room.   On a scale of 0-4 we give: Service: 3.5 Food: 2.5   because the menu is limited and doesn't offer many veg options
