I'm not sure why any of the Dos Toros locations have anything less than five stars on yelp. I don't get it.  Do people not know what a proper burrito is supposed to taste like?  Because I'm seriously confused.   This place deserves six stars.  The folks over at Dos Toros via my homeland (California! What! What!) have nailed it.  Now, I no longer have those sad dark nights lamenting my burrito-free diet.
