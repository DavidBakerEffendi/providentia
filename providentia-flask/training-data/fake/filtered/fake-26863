I'm from the Bay Area, Ca and this place is almost exactly like one of my favorite Taqueria places back home, "Gordos"...Which is truly a "fat" compliment when it comes down to it given all of the wonderful Taqueria choices in Ca. Not that I don't love other types of restaurants NYC has to offer, but when it comes to the Taqueria business, the only place that makes me feel like I'm back home is Dos Toros. The guacamole and just about everything as far as I can tell is freshly made and the service is excepcional! Finally, wanna talk about finding a place for a lot of "bang for your buck"? Well, again, Dos Toros wins again! :-)
