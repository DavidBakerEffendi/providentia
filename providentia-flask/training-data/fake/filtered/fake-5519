This place is great. I live down the street and go here a lot. I think I've eaten my way through the whole menu and never had anything I didn't think was good. Price-wise it's pretty good, I usually get a salad and crostini or split a panini with my girlfriend and it's a lot of food. The soups there are AWESOME. They only do them in cold weather though; I wish they would do cold soups in the summer, I bet they'd be great. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND trying this place out. Order anything, you'll love it.
