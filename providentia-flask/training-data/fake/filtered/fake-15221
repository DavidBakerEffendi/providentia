While amazing food, the staff, ownership, and service was absolutely horrible.  1) There was no room to stand while waiting for a table, 2) multiple groups of two were sat in front of our group of four when they could have pushed two tables together 3) When we informed the waiter that he got a part of our order wrong, he was openly rude to our table twice  4) When management was informed, they threw a fit over removing the item from the bill and defended the waiter for being rude to us.  Even with its amazing food, I will never return to this establishment as there are too many customer friendly options in Center City.
