This is an old neighborhood standby sometimes I go to when I can't think of anywhere else to go to.  The food is ok but the service is spotty.  Sometimes we have good service and sometimes we have bad service.  I came in here for brunch recently and the waiter came to take our order.  He seemed hung over or something but whatever.  Anyway, he got my order wrong.  I said salmon bagel and they brought over salmon benedict.  Instead of being apologetic and taking the plate away, he accused me of ordering the salmon bendict which I didn't even know they had and when I insisted I ordered the salmon bagel he huffed and turned away.  I wasn't sure he was even going to replace my order because he just left the salmon benedict on the table until the busboy brought my correct order over.  Needless to say we never saw our waiter again until my boyfriend had to hail him several times to get the bill.  He dropped the bill off and never came back.  My boyfriend had to bring the bill to him to charge the card.  Btw they never took the salmon benedict off the table so we ate our meal with the dish on our table. NICE!
