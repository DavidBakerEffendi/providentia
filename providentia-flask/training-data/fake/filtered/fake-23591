Unbelievable - such a disrespect - April 6 2013- I went there by 3pm and a guy, the hostess says that We have to wait ONE hour, We are party of tree. It was very weird because We could see one free table for 4, another for 3 and the last one for 2 on the first floor, at least 9 seats available. Then, I go to the restroom on the second floor and I see others 8 seats available, 3 & 3 + 2. WE WASTED 40 minutes looking one table for 4 available on the first floor and decided to kindly ask again what's is going on? They told us that's because They were calling a few clients numbers and waiting them to come from their houses??? because They've a reservation. THAT MEANS the spotted pig PASS OVER a real client to wait a virtual client. I'll never be back and I won't recommend at all.. If you were really full we wouldn't mind waiting one hour having beers.
