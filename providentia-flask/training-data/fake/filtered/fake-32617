I was there with my wife, while on vacation from Puerto Rico, because my father use to frequent it in the early 60's. He told me that it belongs to "caborroje√±os" (Cabo Rojo being the town in PR). I went there on the weekend of this years PR day parade for dinner. The steak was very well seasoned and tender. The tostones and the avocado salad were excellent. I had to go back a second time for the same great taste. Tito, the cashier is a great person. Only wish that the place were bigger.
