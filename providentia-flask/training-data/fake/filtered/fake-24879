Crowded, loud and the food is below mediocre. Add to that bad mix the rudeness of the Manager who may have been thinking that he is doing the customers a favor by letting them eat there. I don't remember any taste from any of the many dishes that we ordered (we were 8 guys so we pretty much ordered the whole menu). Trust me, find another place or you will be waisting your money and saliva.
