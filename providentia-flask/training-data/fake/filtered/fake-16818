FOOD: 3.4 SERVICE: 3.4 Many yelper's review are on the point, a lot of toast, entree's just ok, nice cafeteria food court setting. Maybe because of too much hype, have had better suckling pig. Pasta has a nice kick of spiciness. Crab toast is good, but I can totally imagine making it at home. dining table service was nice. Sommelier was a little distant but gentlemanlike. however, the bartenders spoiled the begining of the night by making me stand there for 10min without a drink list.
