After reading so many positive reviews I was really excited to try Yasuda. The experience was great until the food came.  Two of the rolls we ordered fell apart, and they put wasabi in everything.  Also, the fish they try to pass off as high quality tasted a day or two old.  INCREDIBLY overpriced and not worth it. As a sushi connoisseur in the city, I have to say GO TO Shinbashi!!!  Similar prices for a significantly better experience.
