LOVE LOVE Â LOVE their lychee martini ... well i should say used to :/ ... i went to Verlaine 4 nights ago for a pre-bday celebration and we ordered the lychee martini...seems like they changed the ingredients a little bit ... i dunno what it is but it was more cloudy or something .... either way it snuck up on me and i felt a little buzzed when i walked out. i would give this place 5 stars but 1)the place is sooooo small and 2) it gets sooo crowded and packed (which is understandable because of the amazing happy hour deal) but it could be annoying because people spill other peoples drinks and that cant be replaced (you gotta pay for another one). They should extend the place to make it more comfortable for a bigger crowd or stop letting people in after a certain amount or something. Just saying
