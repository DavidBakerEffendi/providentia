Went on Sunday for brunch with my family and some close friends. I love the decor and ambiance of this place. Just a first class establishment. We started at the bar and Kristin made us some awesome drinks. My wife was loving the Bellini's. We sat at a table near the window and our waitress was quickly over to help us with our appetizer orders. It was already afternoon(around 1:30), so most of us ordered lunch items. We started w/ lobster mac n cheese and crab dip, both delicious. My wife had the beet salad and filet, both of which she enjoyed. I had to get the burger, it is one of the best around. Just perfectly cooked with shoestring fries. We also had some bread pudding french toast topped w/ bananas foster. What an ingenious creation from head chef Chris Graciano. My wife said it was one of the best things she has ever tasted, and she is very picky when it comes to food. Overall a great day at a great place. I would recommend Witherspoon Grill to everyone I know. I cannot wait to go back.
