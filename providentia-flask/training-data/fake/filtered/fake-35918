Had brunch at this uber-popular place today, tucked into an uber out-of the-way industrial neighborhood in Brooklyn. Don't see what all the fuss is about. Food was decent, but by no means outstanding. And the overall experience was marred by the waitress-from-hell who let us know she was doing us a HUGE favor by working our table (part of a shared refectory-style long table). My companion received her pizza, then I waited nearly 30 minutes for my scrambled eggs. The waitress's response was "there are two kitchens" and it was just my tough luck that they are out of sync. Will not return.
