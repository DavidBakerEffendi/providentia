I went there last week to celebrate a birthday and ate lunch there.  My friends and I all ordered the $12 lunch special, most of us got Spicy Pork Dup Bap and Bulgogi Dup Bab.  The proportions were enough with organic vegetables and fresh beef, and the staff was nice.  The meal was served with soy bean paste soup, which is a bit salty, but was ok. The atmosphere was great, and we made reservations for the seat under the huge moon decoration so it really made the meal so much more enjoyable.  Also when we finished our meal it took a while for the staff to give us the bill.  The one thing I do not like is that our attempts to make eyes contact failed and after a few minutes we were able to call over someone and ask for our check because I think that it was kinda busy.  Other than that I enjoyed it and I would definitely like to go back.  If I could I would give 4 1/2 stars, but since that isn't an option then I am willing to giving 5.  I highly recommend this spot for lunch because of the great atmosphere and the tasty, well proportioned fresh meats and organic vegetables.
