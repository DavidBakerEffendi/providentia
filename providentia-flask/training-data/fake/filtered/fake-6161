Found this Italian restaurant in South Philly after a Phillies game recently. We didn't have reservations, but got there just in time to not have to wait for a table. Cozy place with great food and service! Had the fish of the day and it was very fresh and cooked perfectly. L'Angolo is on the list to go back to again!
