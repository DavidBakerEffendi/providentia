HORRIBLE!! HORRIBLE!  Y does this place refuse to have reservations for large parties.  Their food is OK, not great.  Been waiting for over an hour for a party of 12 for a table. Only came here because family from out of town for some reason love this place.  Will never come here ever!! Large parties stay away.  Wait time has been close to 2 hours!
