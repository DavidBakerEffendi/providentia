Can't take it away. Sketch's burgers rock. But the menu is itself "sketchy." Meaning you never know if you'll have great choices or "whats not the worst" choice. I stopped eating at Sketch when their humungous burgers were part of my humungous cholesterol numbers. How about a smaller portion for less than $9.00 (at least) for a burger? All of us have to face the scale and numbers one day. Sketch needs to be a little more "human caring" oriented. Sure, you'll find people paying $20 for a burger loaded with bacon and blue cheese. But you'll also find them in the ER getting help later. Cut back, cut prices and sell more reasonably healthy foods.
