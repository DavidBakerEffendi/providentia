Love Penny Cluse!  The wait is a bit annoying but this is because it IS so good. I recommend going on an off hour. Great service and lots of options for all kinds of diets.  I love the Orzo Chicken Salad.  But if you are looking to spurge try their breakfast specials like Banana Bread French Toast.
