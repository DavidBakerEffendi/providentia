This place is OK. I've had better Pizza in the local greasy spot. My and my friend went there late one Saturday. it was about an hour wait and once entered, we felt kind of rushed. We had a regular small pizza and ate it within minutes. I also had a giant canoli as a dessert. it was way too big and sweet. In all, i would go to this place again and would even go there for a first date, as it gets kind of intimate because you really got to get close to a person to hear what they are saying ..... lol and it is crowded
