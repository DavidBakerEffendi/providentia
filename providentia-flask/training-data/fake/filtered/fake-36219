We went with friends after a lecture on a Tuesday night.  It was packed--uncomfortably so and much too warm.  No one could move without bothering someone else and it was impossible for the wait staff to get around.  I understand they need to fit as many people as possible but....  The food was good as always.  We shared a delicious flatbread pizza with goat cheese and mushrooms.  I had the beet salad which was just fair and the herb roasted chicken was tasty.  I'll go back and hope for a little better experience.
