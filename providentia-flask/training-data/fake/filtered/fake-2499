I've been going to sonny's for a few years now I guess you could call me a regular, I just can't get enough of my classics 2 times a week :) Â I'm not really a review kind of guy but I'm bored so decided to go on yelp and check out reviews when I stumbled on sonny's. After reading a few reviews I actually became offended for some of these workers. When I say these are a group of Great workers that's an understatement... REALLY no joke they are the hardest working people I've ever met. For the men working in the kitchen I give them High fives for just being awesome and making awesome cheesesteaks to the woman behind the register I think her name is Kate or Krissy not sure but she's hands down awesome, a matter of fact the last time I was in there I seen her on her translator helping customers from another country order and the smile on their faces was priceless I see her constantly going out of her way to make everyone feel awesome I know I feel awesome when I leave. To the people who are negative about them shame on you. I found it very inappropriate to put them on blast when they know squat about them, awesome cashier always helping the cooks out speaking in Spanish to help them understand better and awesome cooks for being kind and serving me the best damn cheesesteak.
