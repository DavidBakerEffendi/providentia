WOW is all I can say! I stopped in tonight on my way home from work, and, as usual, one of the best dining experiences!  I love a place where you can go and get a smile from everyone, from the hostess to the waitstaff, and the cashier. I love the renovations that have been done!  So awesome!  The food, as usual, is top drawer!   I had the Pastrami Special, which I prefer with raw onion.  The onion brought out the flavor of the meat, just as I had hoped!  I would have to admit, however, I did save half of the enormous sandwich to take home, because I wanted to experience some of the deliciousness of their new bakery!  It did not disappoint!  Rugelah  to DIE for!  crispy, tender, and delish! I cannot wait to go back.   Service with a smile!  This is one thing I love at a restaurant.  They make you feel like you are at home! Thanks, Katz's!
