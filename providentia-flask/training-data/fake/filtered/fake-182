Went on a cheesesteak tasting in Philly and hit John's after reading about it.  It destroyed the other sandwiches sampled.  Tried the philly cheesesteak and an original roast pork sandwich.  Here's how it broke down. The roast pork sandwich was served piping hot with flavorful and properly moist pork.  The bread they served the sandwiches on was not chewy or flavorless either.  It was a good sized sandwich and made me and my teammates want more of it, not less. There was plenty of meat on the sandwich and the additional toppings were cooked proper and tasted great as well.  Next time I'm headed towards Philly that's where I'll try to stop, if they're open.  They close early, so keep that in mind. The Philly cheesesteak was made professional all around.  Again, a good amount of meat, and cheese, were included in the piping hot sandwich.  The cheese was mixed in with the meat and tasted really good.  The flavor was there in the meat too, which was not the case with some other cheesesteak vendors.   In summary, when I hit John's again it will be hard to decide whether to have the roast pork or a cheese steak.  Both were excellent and the guys working the place were friendly and know how to make a proper hot sandwich.  Keep up the good work and don't let the details of how you make your sandwiches get lost because that stuff really matters!! Thanks!
