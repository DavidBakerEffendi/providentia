This place has been in business at this small unassuming location since 1962 or 1963. It has not undergone any significant changes in appearence and service since it first opened. The steak sandwich served here is the world class standard against which all competitors should try to match. I grew up on them in the 60's and I still make it a point to indulge in one any time I visit Roxborough. After nearly 50 years of consistently satisfying its customers with its salivatingly delicious product, it should be cannonized as a culinary landmark.
