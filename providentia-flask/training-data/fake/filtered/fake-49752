I ate at this wonderful little restaurant a week ago and have been thinking about it ever since and as well, have recommended it to coworkers and friends all week long.  I went with my 3 girlfriends and we shared everything.. the grilled octopus.. tender and tasty, potato pizza is something I had been thinking about making and viola! on the menu.. with a nice thin crust so the flavors of the potato and sage could delicately mingle on the palate.  Branzino grilled to perfection, served whole and boneless which I think was quite a feat!  Normally I am not a fan of fillet minon (I tend to order a cut such as ribeye) but this was not only exceptionally tender and flavorful with the accompanying peppercorn sauce every bite almost melted in my mouth. The service was great and welcoming and I look forward to going back.
