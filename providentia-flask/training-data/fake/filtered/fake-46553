well  Nadav B.'s, for a guy whose never been in this store, let me tell you a few things. Jen is the owner, bathrooms are for one person at a time, Jen has been the owner for 15+ yrs and the people who work there has been there for ever. So if you don't drink it must be drugs.. But what ever your on you should get help. some of the best wings i ever had, great people thanks p.s     sorry there are childish people on this site who do what they want
