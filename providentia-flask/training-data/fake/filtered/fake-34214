I really loved the sushi. I wasn't sure how to order first because they don't have a set omakase meal like many restaurants. It's by how much you want to eat. Good thing is you can tell them your budget. Â For appetizers we had the clam soup. It was good and fresh.I believe the dish was meant to be simple. Reason for 3 stars is very pricey place.
