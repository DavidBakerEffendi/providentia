So I start by saying I am NOT the type of person to write reviews of any kind, and thoroughly enjoyed Green Eggs about once a week with various different friends since I moved to South Philly 7 months ago. But in this situation, it seemed warranted. I planned on meeting a friend of mine, who is also a Green Eggs regular, at the restaurant at 7:30. As we never have been there that early, we didn't realize they didn't open until 8. No big deal, after sitting outside for a little bit we decided to take a quick walk around the corner and come back at 8. My friend locked his bike up in front of the restaurant (on a pole, no signs saying not to lock your bike) and 20 minutes later we were back in front of the restaurant. However, by the time we got back, the owner had taken out a power tool and cut the u-lock and placed my friends bike across the street unlocked. Now I understand if you don't want bikes locked in front of your business for various reasons, but owning a business in the city, especially South Philadelphia, it seems like something you should be prepared for. If there was some sort of sign asking for guests to please not park their bikes there, we would have easily complied and parked it across the street. It just doesn't seem like good business for a place who most likely has a high percentage of cycling clientele to (im pretty sure illegally) cut the bike lock of someone who wants to eat at their restaurant without any sort of warning or notice, to leave it unattended in the street and open for theft. Needless to say, although there will always be a place in my heart for their granola and coffee, I do not see myself frequenting this place again.
