My first night in NY and I went searching for one of my favorite local craft brews by Southern Tier. Called around and it was on tap at Grape and Grain (well, actually next door). Turns out they were all of six blocks from the airbnb we were staying at. Headed straight down there and ended up hanging out for a couple of hours. Amazingly friendly staff, great local beer, great munchies. Dragged my friends back a couple of times over the next day or two until we killed the keg. Was hoping to come back a few more times before heading back to SF but I got moved over to a different apartment. Thanks to everyone there for all the advice on other great spots. Will definitely be back next time I visit NY.
