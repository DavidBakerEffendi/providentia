Eataly pizza: Just waited 20 minutes on line for the pizza to go and am VERY disappointed in the results. For $13 I got an undercooked pizza with a floppy crust and ONE basil leaf on what was supposed to be a Margherita pizza. The basil is my favorite part! Of course I didn't realise this until I had hustled back to my office so rather than going back to find out why, I simply will not go back at all. I will still patronize the store itself (the cheese was excellent) but would definitely advise against getting the pizza. This is NYC, there is better pizza available at many other places within 20 minutes of Eataly. Skip it!
