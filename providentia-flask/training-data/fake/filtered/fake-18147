I rarely ever write negative reviews but my experience with the service at Temple Grill was truly insulting. We came in with a group of 10 and some people wanted to leave early so they requested separate checks. When the final 5 people went to pay the rest of the bill, we found that we were being required to pay the 18% gratuity on the entire bill, even though our friends had included their portion of the gratuity on their separate checks- which amounted to $20 more than we actually needed to pay. We talked to two of the waitresses about the mistake and they did not want to listen to us at all. In fact one of them said "I just can't deal with people today." We explained we were tipping more than the required 18% if they counted the amount our friends had left but the waitresses insisted that our friends must have meant to leave extra tip on their separate bills. We asked them if we could speak to their manager and after hearing the whole story, he simply said "I wasn't there so I don't know what happened with the checks. All I know is that the waitresses say you owe more money." All three staff members were completely disrespectful to us while we were trying to explain the situation to them and straight up wrong about the bill. That is my main complaint about this restaurant. Aside from the service, the food was mediocre and cold when we got it and drinks were delivered to all of the wrong people. Â My friends and I will definitely never be back.
