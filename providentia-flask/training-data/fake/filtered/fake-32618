Great place for some Puerto Rican food. La Taza de Oro has been here for well over 40 years and counting. The neighborhood surroundings have become gentrified but this place chugs along as if time has stood still. yes, it is small. yes, it is inexpensive and yes you will get fed....large portions. So come hungry and bring friends. A casual place for some delicious food. Recommended.
