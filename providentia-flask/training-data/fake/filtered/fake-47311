What a great place! I was there two weeks ago and I was quite surprised with what use to be Charlie Browns. The food is good...but not exceptional, but I only had some apps and a sandwhich which both my girlfriend and I shared. It has a great atmosphere as far as the bar goes, but needs to not look like CB. The beer selection is phenomenal and that is what I look for as far as local spots go. The $5 app really does the trick!!! Our server, Mike, gave us the rundown on specials as well as the different selection of craft brews and we couldn't have been happier! Definitely will be back to the Fairfield Tavern
