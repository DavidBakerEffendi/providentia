I ordered a "give me a tan". The description reads fresh carrot, oj and ginger. The person who made my juice put in 5 small pieces of carrot, filled the 20 ounce glass to the brim with OJ, liquidized it and then handed it to me. The whole experience was gobsmacking as my cranium refused to register the 5 round pieces of carrot in the juice. If I wanted orange juice I would have asked for it. Surely the proportions should have been half carrot half OJ ? Oh and there was no sign of the ginger. So essentially I paid $5 for OJ. As I said before I was left completely gobsmacked. Next time I will get my carrot+oj+ginger juice from Pumpkin market.
