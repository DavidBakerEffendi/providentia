I visited this restaurant in early September, 2011. Nice atmosphere. Service good. I ordered a cabernet at the bar while waiting for my friend. They did not have cabernet. No cabernet??? For dinner I ordered the Â pork ragu. The pasta was extremely el dente to the point it was difficult for my fork to penetrate the pasta. The ragu was sparse and had little flavor. The portion was minimal to the extent I had a snack on my way home. I do not expect a lumber jack portion for the price but this was not worth the money or my time. I detest flies in a place of eating and this place had flies. I do not care if the place opened to the outside patio of tables. The people were nice and that was the only good experience to this place.
