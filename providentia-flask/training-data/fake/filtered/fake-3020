Went on a Saturday night at 7:30pm with a party of 4.  There was a 45 minutes wait but based on the reviews I was willing to wait.  As we were waiting the owner was able to seat us much quicker which made me happy.   The skirt steak with the spicy chimicura (sp) was awesome, and the tapas were great as well.  The empandas and chirizo was very good also.  I loved the sangria and byob makes it even better. I must add that the owner was there busting his butt and keeping the place in order.  You have to respect that, plus he was very nice.  I will def go back. I must disclose that it is very loud, so it you want to quiet place this is not for you.
