Had one of the best salads I've ever had in my life at this place. The combination of brie with sweet roasted walnuts and tender chicken was just delicious. Also their fries taste great (and I'm Belgian so I'm picky if it comes to this). Good steaks and also the mussels are better than in most places. Definitely a restaurant I'd come back to again in the future.
