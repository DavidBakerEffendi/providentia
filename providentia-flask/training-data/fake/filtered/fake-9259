Amazing food, great service, family run business! The restaurant is clean and well maintained, and the food is awesome. The pizza and it is the closest to NYC pizza that I've had in NJ and the grilled chicken with roasted peppers and mozzarella sandwich was delicious! When I ordered food for delivery I was told that it would arrive in 30 minutes, but the food was at my house in 15 minutes! I've found my new pizza place!
