I never ever write reviews but had to talk about Max Fish! The gem in the group as far as I'm concerned and I've eaten many times at all of them as the group is great. I eat most meals out and so, have vast dining experiences. Fish is one of my regulars. I probably eat there at least 2x a week. The Happy Hour menu is generous and the prices great. That allows me to pop in often for a quick bite and drink which typically stretches into a couple of hours. I sit at the bar and find the cocktails so so yummy and the bartenders attentive and fun. For grown up meals I find the white table cloth side to be spot on every time. I bring family, clients and co-workers there as I can always depend on the service to be truly white table cloth worthy. The food never disappoints and the atmosphere is elegant but not stuffy. I think having the 2 different sides to the restaurant is neat and offers something different depending on what your in the mood for. I don't get any negative reviews of this place. I totally get that every server has an off night or sometimes the kitchen may fall short for various reasons but really? Overall Fish is my go to place for a quick solo bite or trying to impress!! GO NOW!
