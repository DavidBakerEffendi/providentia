Picked Cookshop for my girlfriend's birthday as it was close to the High Line and looked good online. The food was great and loved the feel of the restaurant. However, what earned the five star rating was the service. We had a 815pm reservation and the restaurant was pretty busy when we arrived so the hostess warned us that we would have to wait for a few minutes for a table. At about 825pm, one of the managers / owners comes over to us and offers us a complimentary cocktail because of the wait, and tells us that he developed many of the recipes and loves finding local ingredients. It was a very nice gesture that went a long way, especially given that we weren't even close to frustrated by the wait (10 minutes does not feel that bad). After enjoying our cocktails for a little bit, we were seated at a nice booth in the back of the restaurant. The same owner / manager stopped by our table to make sure we were enjoying ourselves. Because I had mentioned it was my girlfriend's birthday, they brought us a complimentary slice of cake with a candle at the end of our meal. Thank you to Cookshop for the very attentive and thoughtful service, which is arguably the best I have received living in New York.
