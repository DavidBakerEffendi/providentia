Honestly, there isn't much to Geno's but there cheesesteaks. You wait for a long time and buy an overpriced cheese steak and eat it and it's not really worth it. There policy is a little racist also. There really isn't much to Philly but cheesesteaks. It's not even that good, anyone could make a better quality one at home. It's alright but I rather never go there.
