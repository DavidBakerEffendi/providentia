Signed up just to write this review.  I loved the old Lolita and could not wait for this new version to open.  I've been twice now and I doubt I will return.  Everything was just...okay.  Service was okay, drinks were okay, and food was okay.  That is the best I can say about it.  I loved bringing people from out of town to the old Lolita as a way to impress them with Philadelphia and its restaurant scene.  It always had great food and a really fun vibe.  I got none of that the last two times I was in.  I actually wonder if what I liked so much was really just getting drunk on a bottle of tequila.
