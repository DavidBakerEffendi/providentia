I just came back from my honeymoon in the Baleric islands two months ago and decided to try Salinas this past Friday to see if the food reflected our wonderful experiences.  It absolutely did!!! It brought me back to the most wonderful trip of my life.  the food was excellent! I had several tapas, including the quail, pate and the ceviche--all were extremely tasty.  I ate the steak as my main course and my husband had the suckling pig, both excellent.    all was complimented by a great bottle of Spanish red.  Plus, the atmosphere was perfect--soothing atmosphere, great wait staff and we sat in the outdoor patio, which made the experience even better.  My husband and i are excited to go back to Salinas to try some of the other dishes--what a great escape back to our honeymoon, right here in NYC!!
