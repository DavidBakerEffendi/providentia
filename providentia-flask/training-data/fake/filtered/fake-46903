We booked Gennaro's for a small wedding reception, party of 12, Friday lunchtime. Although its location on a strip mall off a two-lane highway is unwelcoming, our expectations were blown away by the service and food. The waiter (special shout-out to Doublass!) was incredibly friendly and attentive during our 2 hour dine-in, and the chef was able to accommodate for items not on the menu (including kid-friendly dishes). We were served an excellent antipasto platter with calamari, zucchini rollatini, mozzarella/tomatoes, coconut shrimp (my fave!), and fried potato puffs. I ordered the shrimp scampi for my entree and was most impressed by the linguini in lemon-butter sauce! For dessert, I second (or third) the panna cotta that everyone else on Yelp is raving about.
