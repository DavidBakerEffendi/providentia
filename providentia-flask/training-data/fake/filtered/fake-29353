As with anything, there comes the good and the bad. The good: The service is impeccable. Their knowledge of wines impressive. The kitchen, on full display, is immaculate and sitting at the bar there is like watching a muted ballet. Those guys have incredible grace in that tiny space. The bad: The food was ok. Just ok. And I'm a full-on foodie- and a San Francisco-raised foodie, so my standards are admittedly high. There was nothing bad about the meal, but nothing noteworthy. Overall, my meal was, as my mother would say, "insincere". Presentation was beautiful but there was no soul in the food. There is also a lot of blending of very specific, strong flavors, and not in the palate-challenging Momofuku way. Out of 8 dishes, there was only 1 that I would eat again. I wanted to like it, I really, really did. But for me, the whole experience was a big letdown.
