Went to the Lobby for lunch last Sunday.  The place looked nice from the outside, but the parking lot was packed. The outdoor seating area, again looked nice, but when we sat down - the tables hadn't been wiped down from the previous guest. The music was very loud, we couldn't hear each other...  The food wasn't bad.
