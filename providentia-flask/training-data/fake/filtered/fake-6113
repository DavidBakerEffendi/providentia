Love this place- my husband and I come here regularly because we just can't get enough! I am fussy when it comes to authentic Asian cuisine as I rarely find it in NY. But this place is pretty authentic as far as Malaysian food goes. The roti canai is a must have for appetizer, and other amazing items are the beef rending, kari Ayam, Malaysian Buddhist and sweet & sour pork. The coconut rice is also delicious. Place is CASH ONLY, which is the only thing about this restaurant I wish would change. But aside from that, Nyonya is about as good as it gets for Malaysian cuisine.
