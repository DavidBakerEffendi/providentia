I've been to plenty of diners and there aren't many like this one, by far my favorite.  Portions  are satisfying and fresh.  Usually you don't order seafood from diners, but I'd recommend you do from this place and you won't be disappointed.  I usually like to start up with crab cakes with their homemade remoulade sauce which is very much like a tartar sauce.  For my entree usually a pasta, seafood fra diavolo, chicken carbonara, grilled chicken pesto etc.  The dishes are filling and worth the price.
