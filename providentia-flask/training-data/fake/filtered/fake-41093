Came here with a friend one night after work for a bottle of wine and some pizza, and must say, Sofia's has a great, warm ambience and very friendly, helpful waitstaff (although I was at first admittedly intimidated at first with all the tattoos). Â Would definitely go back next time I want wine after work!
