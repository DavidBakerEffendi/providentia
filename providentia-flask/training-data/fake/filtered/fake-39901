Read the reviews CAREFULLY.  With good luck you will be at this place on a good day.  Otherwise ...WATCH OUT!!! Tourist trap par excellence. Over cooked - under done - food literally blows off your plate outside to the accompaniment of the laughing indifferent staff. Do yourself a favor go to Henry's, Sadie Katz, Penny Cluse, anywhere but here.  You might as well play the slots - it's more rewarding.
