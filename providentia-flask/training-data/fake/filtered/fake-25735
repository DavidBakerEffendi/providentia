This WAS our go to place for great pastrami and bagels every weekend. But it seems the smartness is leaving this establishment. Went on a Saturday, walked in 30 minutes after it opened and they were out of everything bagels and kippered salmon. A jewish deli....seriously?! ....on a Saturday??? Looks like the owner doesn't have enough business Â sense anymore.
