This place is just awesome.  The coffee is really good and REALLY strong.  I love getting a bagel with faux margarine spread.  They always have Grid or Philadelphia Weekly / City Paper to read and there is some interesting art up usually.  They also have free wi-fi that works well. The staff is insanely friendly.  They are awesome and always do a great job. I don't really like the literary collection, because I'm not on the far left of the political spectrum, but if that's your thing, you'll like it even more!!!
