My husband & I visit this restaurant for the first time back in August  in surge of authentic Cuban food well we found it. we travel all the way from the height "manhattan" to queens and let me say it's worth the trip.  We ordered ropa vieja, filete de cerdo, arroz moro, yucca and desert delicious flan and mini churros what a feast. We went back in September for my hubby's birthday and second time around was even better. the staff do make you feel at home. One of the staff members I don't recall his name but he's the best there he puts on a wonderful  mini party for the birthday customer, wares a hat w/lights,cheers you on and dance floor moves.  We had an enjoyable dinner  and a every nice time at Rincon Criollo. Come November and December our family celebrates more birthdays which means back to Queens.  Love this Restaurant.
