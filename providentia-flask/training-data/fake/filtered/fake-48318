EWWWWWWWWWW!!! I am not from Philly and to me a cheesesteak is meat WITHOUT a load of fat hunks all over it, finely shredded, with lettuce, tomatoes and mayo (NONE of these were options). Obviously cheesesteaks in general are not a healthy option but since I was here, I had to try it. CheeseWhiz?? Are you kidding me?  Is that even real food?  I think NOT.  Cheese Whiz is something you feed a picky 4 year old.  Completely revolting. The one star I did give was for the bread, which was pretty good.  The rest was fatty meat and greasy onions.  And the price was also completely OUTLANDISH.  My only regret was that I didn't bring a bottle of Ipecac syrup or a box of laxatives for after.
