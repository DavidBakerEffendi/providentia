I'm a Malaysian and I've spent 10 weeks in the US without a taste of my home food so when I found this place on Yelp, I was really excited but I kept my expectations low because whenever I go to a Malaysian restaurant outside of Malaysia, more often than not, they taste nothing like the real thing. I ordered the chicken rice while my friends ordered the Penang Assam Laksa, Char Kuay Teow, Curry Mee and Popiah (appetizers). The food came really quickly, were served in portions worth the price and most importantly, was tastes 95% close to home (not 100% because the kuay teow - flat noodles - were not as soft as it was supposed to be and was slightly too salty). I also ordered the fried ice cream and pulut hitam and they were equally as good as the ones back home. If you want to have a taste of Malaysian food, this is definitely the place to go to (and definitely go to Malaysia for the cheaper but better versions). *warning - when they say spicey, they really mean spicey and hot! Beware to those who are not used to food filled with spices and chillis
