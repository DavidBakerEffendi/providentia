Well, this place was given a rare rating in my guidebook and I couldn't agree less. The restaurant is a self-styled food lovers paradise but the palate was mediocre. I had rhubarb gazpacho which had not been anywhere near a gorgeously tart piece of rhubarb. I followed this up with (too thickly rolled) ravioli stuffed with ricotta and nettle, which lacked any of the zing associated with nettles, not least because it had been masked with a far too rich caramelised butter sauce. I tell people where to eat and where not to, this is in the latter category.
