A group of 6 searched out NY Noodletown based on some reviews, obviously outdated based on our disgusting experience! It all started as we were being seated and there was a dead pig hanging in the kitchen with stuff dripping from its nose. If that's not enough then watch the cook pet it while talking. I went to the bathroom ready to puke my veggies, after cooked chickens and ducks were carried right behind me complete with heads and feet, when the bathrooms odor and filth did me in. The experience was topped by being overcharged for our less than adequage food, and a rude waiter refusing to let us leave without giving him a big enough tip. I wasn't feeling a tip for the terrible service, rude waiter, and disgusting eating conditions. There are better less expensive places right down the block. Enjoy your food...skip this place!
