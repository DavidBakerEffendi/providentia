I live in the neighborhood and often stop by to get some Oxtail on my way home from work (when I'm too tired to cook.) As many have stated, the service can be slow, but the food is "the bomb!" Â Yah man! Sometimes, if you've been waiting for a while, the owner will give you a free cup of soup that you can sip on while you wait. The place is small, but there are even a couple of tables set up in a makeshift second floor if you want to relax. I give this a definite recommendation.
