Seafood is exquisitely prepared. Delicious by any standard. The paninis and the cheese products are immaculate. But this place is too expensive and too crowded. Perhaps, that's part of the charm, but when you have 1 hour for lunch and limited budget, forget going there. They should charge a small admission fee just to eliminate the ones who just wants to marvel at the pasta.
