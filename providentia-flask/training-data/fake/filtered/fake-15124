Amazing, Fresh, and Cozy.  (some say cramped but I say cozy) the only GF establishment I will eat at.  You can feel safe that you wont get contaminated gluten free food and you can also bring other people there because all the food is amazing whether it is gluten free or not.  The staff is groovy.  And they have lots of gf beeeeeeer.
