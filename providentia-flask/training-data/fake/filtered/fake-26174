At least one of these three brothers is a drug-addicted loser. Vermont is a far cry from the awesome italian eateries of Long Island when you have middle eastern sociopaths taking their crack on pizza up here. Next time I hope they open a kabob shop, I'm willing to bet they make better tabouli than pizza. For those of you who choose to go here, props; I for one am not really into low-quality stoner food masquerading as a Neopolitan masterpiece... and that's what pizza is when it's done right. Drunkin' bros demanding "wings" rejoice, this is the sort of crappy watering hole with super bowl party fare that brings tasteless meaning to your lives.
