I went in here for the first time this weekend and it was a lovely experience. I was there late morning on a Sunday, which I would assume was a busy time for a little coffee place, but it was not horribly crowded. It was pretty easy to get a table, and it definitely has more seating than some other area favorites (good karma, cough cough). The coffee was tasty and fairly priced. My friend had tea, which was a little pricey, but worth it for loose leaf quality tea. The vibe is pretty laid back with a neighborhood feel - we saw folks with young kids, a few older people, definitely a good mix - not just the young hip crowd. Overall, a good experience and we will be back!
