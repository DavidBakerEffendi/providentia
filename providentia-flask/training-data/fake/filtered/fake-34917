One of my fav restaurants in NYC. I do like the vibe and ambiance of the place. Drinks are great in well packed bars and the food is delicious. The alley to the restaurant is just spooky enough to gain respect from my first-time-visiting companions. On the downside there's no way to book a table for smaller groups and the service is sometimes cold and hasty.
