went on last friday with my friends from canada, trust me the food was awesome, but you what went wrong.?. the guy who took order, he was really really rude and he was trying to show his face like he don't care for his customer, first he came to table to take order,so request them for 5 more minutes please, and after this his face like, his wife is having affair with someone....so, bad, rude...after dinner we ask that, do you any near by starbucks or any place that we can seat and talk for some times, ( reason to ask this is,we can clearly saw his face expression that, he don't like his customer to seat and talk, he just wanted his customer to eat and get out here... ) and he replied, Â do you have your mobile with you..??? do google and check...wtf***...is this the way to talk with your customer..???? after that, he told us that, you have your mobile with you means you have the universe in your palm....we respond, we know that but, we ask you...and his respond, i dnt know..... i never ever recommand this again to any one, if you would like to insult or harassed your self, than this is a nice place.. choice is yours...
