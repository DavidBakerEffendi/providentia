Best punjabi homemade food to take out. Their Chicken Kulcha, Paneer Bhurji, Chicken 65 are very tasty. My family is fan of Punjabi Rasoi. Their food taste like homemade food. I got the catering from them recently. My guests loved the foods. The quality food and quantity were perfect. Bhindi Masala, veg biryani, chicken 65 were very tasty. If you like to have homemade food from outside. this is the place. We are taking home food from Punjabi Rasoi for now more than 5 years. This is not the place if you want to sit there and eat. This is good for take out and catering.
