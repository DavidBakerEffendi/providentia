I am a New Yorker that knows her way around the NYC restaurant industry and I can confidently say that I have never been so badly treated in a restaurant ever. To be fair the brunch menu is great and the servers are pleasant. The management and hostesses on the other hand leave a lot to be desired. We had beenregulars at cafeteria for years before management changed. ESPECIALLY the brunch manager who is not only condescending, but didn't even apologize for the 90 minute wait when we were told 20 minutes. He didn't have the courtesy to comp the bread that we requested while we were waiting for our food because we were starving at that point. He definitely spreads his negative superior attitude to the hostesses, who are clearly very stressed out from poor management, but are also looking for any reason to get angry and aggressive towards customers. They act as if somehow you are trying to mess with them...about seating...and spending lots of money? Totally ridiculous. If you want to be treated terribly and wait an hour to sit after you've been told 20 minutes then this is the place for you! If it wasn't for the management we would eat hear regularly. The negative energy and vibe has ruined it for us.
