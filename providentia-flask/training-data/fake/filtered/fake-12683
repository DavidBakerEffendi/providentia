very disappointed.  Went for lunch and got put in the back room, which I found to be very bleak and uninviting.  I ordered the veal.  It looked like a meat pancake.  No garnishes, nothing.  Very unappetizing and it wasn't very good.  My friend had the pasta and that was a bit better.  The wine was great and I liked our waitress.  Would not return.  Hope Mario's other restaurants aren't like this one.
