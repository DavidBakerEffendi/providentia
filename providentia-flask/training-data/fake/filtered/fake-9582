Went on a weekend morning with my girlfriend When we got there we immediately noticed a wait... Went to the outdoor waiting area and put our name on the list... About 35-40 minutes later we were called. We were seated and my girlfriend was immediately impressed with the table setup and the coffee cups... Everything on the menu looked like it would be delicious. We split a short stack of choc chip pancakes...some scrambled eggs...an order of potatoes (they provide really tasty ketchup as well)...and toast. Everything was delicious.. The price was right and the service top notch. Probably best on a weekday as the weekend wait was a bit long. Top notch breakfast place though in a battle of morning glory vs sabrinas... sabrinas takes the cake.
