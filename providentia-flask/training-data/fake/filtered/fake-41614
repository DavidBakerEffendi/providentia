My boyfriend took me to Barcelona last night for a birthday dinner and we were really happy with our choice, despite a few shortcomings during the meal. First, the highlights... We went for the tapas and were pleasantly surprised especially by the eggplant with feta and mint, which was a really creative combo. We also really enjoyed the scallops a la plancha, the chick pea and spinach casserole, and the mushrooms with goat cheese. For dessert, we had the crepas, which were perfect to share. The ambiance was lively without being too hectic. We were still able to have a private romantic meal. The service was also very nice. One of our servers went out of his way to help with our wine selection, and even asked for a second opinion before making his recommendation. We ended up really liking it. The warm bread and olive oil were also a treat. And now, the areas for improvement... We were underwhelmed by the papas bravas, which were apparently popular. Basically a pile of big potato pieces with barbecue sauce. The steak paillard was also uninspired and the flavors reminded us of ground beef and pepper pizza. The biggest disappointment of our meal was the tuna tartar, which unfortunately was our last dish, leaving a sad taste in our mouths. We forced ourselves to eat it despite it being oversalted and not having enough flavor. And finally, my boyfriend had notified them in advance of it being my birthday and they failed to mention it at all or even stick a candle in any of our food for me to blow out. Regardless, we have no regrets and plan to eat at Barcelona again.
