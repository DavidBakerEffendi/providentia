This place has quite a variety of different foods from countries all over the world!  You can entertain your taste buds here for hours. The atmosphere is really diverse, and I would suggest taking out of town guests.  Not only is there food, but there is also jewelry, books, and clothes. The only downside is that some of the food stands/ restaurants close early and it is crowded (especially on the weekends).  However, overall I enjoyed this place and I will go back again.
