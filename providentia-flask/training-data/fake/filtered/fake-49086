Amazing! The quality and taste of the food is exceptional. Love the calm "spa like" atmosphere. And the brunch...the best I had...suits anyone. From steak lovers, to unconditional vegerarian, and as well it offers the Â traditional eggs benedicts. A must try .The chef creates amazing tasteful and healthy dishes, the service is great, and the atmosphere is calm, relaxing and romantic. They also accept reservation for private parties. For now, it is BYOB.
