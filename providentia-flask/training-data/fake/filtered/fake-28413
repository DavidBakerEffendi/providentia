Just because its a "celebrity" chef owned restaurant doesn't mean anything. The food is pretty good and the decor is beautiful . But as far as the management department goes I can say diff. I over heard them actually cursing at there staff . And from what I've been observing they are all very rude. And they obviously don't know how to run a restaurant because the floors /bathrooms are always filthy its disgusting. Also I had to wait 15-20 mins just because they were "setting" up the table so unorganized . Its pretty sad because this place can be so great. Hopefully they will fix these things and i might come back and actually then i will Â want to tell my friends about this place but heres a little hint get better managers/staff!
