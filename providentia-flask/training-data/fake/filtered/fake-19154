I've gone to Koto for close to 8 years. It's been touch and go, the food is okay to great (the Lucky Tree is amazing) and the service can be lacking some days. Today was one of such days. My fiancé and I decided to treat ourselves after a very long week. We got to Koto at about 5 and was seated right off (we opted for the regular seating instead of the hibachi). That's where the good times end. In short, our waiter was the rudest server I have ever had in my entire life. Our whole meal we felt looked down upon, like we weren't worth this guy's time. Simple questions were answered like he was talking to first graders. My fiancé doesn't try new things very often, he's a very "meat and potatoes" kinda guy. This was the first time he's gone to a Japanese restaurant. This experience was ruined. It got to the point were we both just wanted to leave. After waiting several minutes for the bill, I ended up going and talking to the hostess and let her knew what was going on. She immediately knew which server I was talking about (which should tell you a lot) and said she would talk to her manager. By the time I got back to our table, the waiter still hadn't brought the bill. As soon as he did, we paid and left. This is the first time I have ever stiffed a server. As we were leaving, I mentioned again to the hostess what horrible service we had received, this time in front of her manager. The manager was still unaware of the situation, but the hostess had simply said " it's Taylor again" . We just walked out, meal ruined by an over condiscending waiter.  No amends were made by Koto. In talking with friends, this isn't the first time others have had issue with this waiter. They had the same problem until they whipped out thier wallet and then the waiter's attitude did a complete 180 . Until Koto does a rehaul of their staff, we won't be returning. There's no sense in paying 60 dollars for a meal that is going to be ruined by a server with a chip on their shoulder.
