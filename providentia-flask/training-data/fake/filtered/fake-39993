The best Mexican we have found in North Jersey. We stopped by for lunch on a whim. It wasn't that crowded, and the service was friendly. We had the chips and salsa, chicken flautas, nachos supreme, and chorizo enchiladas. Everything was fresh and downright delicious. We will definitely be back. Perhaps for dinner.
