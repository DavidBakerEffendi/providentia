DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!!! Just went down this weekend  and what a terrible experience. Me and my girlfriend sat outside. Sitting Area : They sitting area was overcrowded. They putted too many tables making it very difficult to get in and out without having to excuses yourself constantly  to other customers . Food: We  ordered in total 3 beers, 1 glass of wine, 2 entrees and 2 calzones.  Calzone was ok, a bit overcooked. Cheesesticks  are good but cheddar jalapenos were way too overcooked.  Drink are normal. Service : WORST EVER!!!!!  We had to ask for glasses of water, get ourselves our own napkings cause the waitress didn't come around our area unless she had something to bring.  Waitress was RUDE, once we finished eating she kept on asking us to pay or  if we wanted something more  to drink.  Told her 3 beers in an hour and a half is more then enough for a Sunday evening.  After my constant refusal to order any additional drinks , she ask us to leave. What the F#!* ?  Ask her what were the reasons and she said that she could flip the table.   I told her that we spent more then 55$ for pizza and beers and also told her that we would gladly leave if there was a line up of customers waiting for a table. But there was no line up and many available tables. We spent 55$ and they don't have the decency to let us sit until we decide to leave? Other customers around us were surprised and offended by the waitress attitude and disregard toward the customers.  The manager came out when we left and didn't  even apologize but told me that I shouldn't had made a scene about it.   This guy obviously doesn't care about us or about any of the customers.
