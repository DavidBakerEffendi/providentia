While visiting New York my cousin took me here.  It was not only the most incredible calamari appetizer on the planet but the salads, main course and desserts are going to haunt me until I go again.  The service was so personal.  The owner is a hoot...Prices are very reasonable.  We had the best time here.  I recommend it for impressing dates, just want a good meal or to bring out of towners.
