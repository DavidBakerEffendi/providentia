We enjoyed our dinner at Perry Street restaurant very much. The service was attentive, friendly and unobtrusive, the room is elegant and low key and, most important, the food was excellent, imaginative, beautifully presented without any unnecessary frills. In our opinion, the price-quality ratio is very good. We will certainly be back. Jeannette Zehnder
