I've never actually eaten in the restaurant, but I have ordered take out before. Yes, the place is expensive--that's why I can't give it 5 stars. I would love to try the soy cheese, but the experience is already a little cost prohibitive. Their pizza is DELICIOUS though, and the service is great. I stopped in to get a gift certificate recently in the middle of the afternoon, so the place was empty and the staff was mostly prepping things and joking around. It was nice to have a chance to watch them interact and be able to see that people there treat each other well, not just the customers. Â Because really they do treat customers well. After a bad day, that's almost as nice as a *really* good pizza!
