Had an issue with the check, we were a large party and couple of us arrived later, they didnt want to give us a different check even though we actually arrived like 2 hours later. The waitress was terrible took 15min to bring us the dessert menu and 30min to bring the actual dessert that was a lava cake(actually good) w/ice cream. When i asked to talk to the manager he was an asshole and very rude. They had very limited variety of drinks and they call themselves a BAR too. Terrible service, terrible management. If you open a restaurant bar at least be nice. I hope this restaurant close, they do not deserve to be open if they dont even know how to split a check or even try! Hate this place, will never come back.
