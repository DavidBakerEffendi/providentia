We were introduced to Joseph Leonard a few years ago by a good friend. Since that first introduction, we have frequented often ... nearly once a month (which is a feat for people who don't live very close by).  J. Leonard it has become our favorite restaurant in NYC. Our service tonight just solidified our feelings toward this place.  The wait ... which is always long! ... was an hour, but Lacy (the maitre'd) helped us navigate a nook to have a drink while we waited. The manager came by to thank us for waiting, and had a good laugh about how busy it was on such a miserable winter night.  We then got lucky enough to get the "chef table" - where Aaron, the chef, was a wonderful host & dinner guest.  Our food - the pork hock dish, salmon, amazing Brussels sprouts, brocollini, and the macaroni - was amazing, as always.  And our drinks were phenomenal as well! Overall, it was yet another a great experience.  Absolutely love this place!
