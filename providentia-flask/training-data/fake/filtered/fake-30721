I walked in here once on a really slow afternoon, only to have all 3 people working ignore me and continue to only engage in conversation with themselves without asking if I needed anything. When I said, "excuse me, do you have any gluten free options?" a woman snapped at me and said "no." and returned to her conversation with her coworker. I really have never had that experience anywhere else, so I would never recommend this place. Really rude.
