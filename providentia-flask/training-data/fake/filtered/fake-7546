wow all I can say is very bad quality food also very inconsistent. I have been ordering soup and pizza from there always something I ordered garlic cheese bread they forgot the cheese!!! I order soup no bread at all. I also ordered calzone so bad the sauce taste worst then some can sauce!!!! Either they have inexperienced employees or idk what the issue is but if they keep on they will be Â another business in and out of Verona
