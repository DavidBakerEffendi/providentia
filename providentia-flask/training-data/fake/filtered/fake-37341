I was just visiting Philadelphia and I thought that I would have a difficult time finding this place if I dont have a car. But I was wrong. I just hopped in the Market-Frankford line, got off Spring Garden station, a good 10 minute or less walk, and then I was there. I was greeted by a man by the front dorr, whom I later learned was the owner, Gabby (?). The staff were friendly and courteous. I had the Shukshaka, the breaded eggplant dish with eggs and some other stuff. I like the savory flavorofthe crispy breaded eggplant combined with the mildly spicy flavor of the other components of the dish. I tried the macarons too, and the pistachio ones are not to be missed out. My seat by the window was nice. Overall,I had a great time in this restaurant.
