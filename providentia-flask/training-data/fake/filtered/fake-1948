After reading the reviews of this joint all summer, some friends and I decided to check it out on a Saturday late afternoon.  The place itself is in an amazing location and offers sights and scenery that are not the norm in Brooklyn.  We were greeted by friendly hosts who let us know there was 45 minute wait for a table and pointed us to the bar.   The bar was busy, but bartender Ronnie was great...she chatted with us, gave us some direction as to the menu, and made some of the best mojitos and margaritas we have ever had.  Prices were reasonable and we were enjoying ourself so much that we forwent the table and spent the afternoon at the bar drinking and eating the Cool Platter and pulled pork sandwiches...both of which were delicious.   No complaints here...and we will absolutely be returning to check out out the third level which is waitress service.
