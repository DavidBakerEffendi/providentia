Awful!!! Occasionally you might have an ok special - and never see it again on the menu.  Regular menu is very ordinary, nothing special.  Wine and beer are ok, several different beers but the beer is way over priced!!! Like Manhattan prices.  They even charge you for olives!!! Terrible.  Dark and depressing atmosphere inside.  The servers/bartenders should  take 'smile classes' .  Wouldn't recommend this place at all.  How they stay in business is beyond me. I HAD to click on a star to POST this review, otherwise they don't deserve any stars, that's for sure!
