Worst vegetarian food i ever had in nj. no taste at all... We ordered veg manchurian it tasted like a salty ball of corn flour Next kulcha are so thick n doughy and lastly malai kofta which is blunt N no salt no spice in it worst ever curry i had any where . When i asked Waiter for replacement of dish he simply took it inside and made sme Changes and and got same dish back n it tasted worst then before, Then, we preferred to check out table rather than eating this food.very disappointed n Â we will never visit again. a waste of money for us .....
