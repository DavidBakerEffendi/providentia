We went here on our anniversary. I am a vegetarian so a friend of mine suggested this place. We were suprised to see the menu. They have vast vegetarian options and I really enjoyed my platters. Try Sambusa, and crepes. They are yummy. The place is cute and staff were very cooperative. Prices are reasonable.
