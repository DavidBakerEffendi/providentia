Really wonderful food and ambiance. Highly recommend the rabbit. It is worth the trip to the very tip of Greenpoint and further! Appetizers and dessert were the also good but that rabbit won my heart forever. Ambiance was lovely. Service friendly and relaxed. The fifth star I will keep in my sleeve for my next visit. Wine was not bad but not in pair with the rest of the experience. Next visit may be the five star one! Definitely coming back!
