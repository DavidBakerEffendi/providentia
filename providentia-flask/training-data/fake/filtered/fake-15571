Very cute Modern place. I've been going to this place for years, they never let me down. I LOVE my sushi and this restaurant has Thee best sushi around Ironbound, Harrison, Kearny, area ! The owner is always very nice, and treats her customers very good. I completely recommend this restaurant to anybody!! Food is always so fresh and tasty. When you get seated ask for the crackers with duck sauce its free & it helps if your starving . lol I specially like to always have a miso soup before my entry. & the hot tea is also free. So ill recommend those 3 to get your dinner/lunch started :)
