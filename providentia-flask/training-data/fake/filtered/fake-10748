we stopped into steinys  on saturday, drinks were great especially the bloody mary . ordered pastrami club , corned beef reuben, and a new item called a stuffed burger.... the cook really seems to be innovative . the corned beef was incredible, and the burger was so tasty and cooked perfect. .... i stopped here about a year ago and hated it.. what ever they changed it sure seems it is working... i never recommend places but due to the great food and service id happily recommend steinys to anyone who wants great sandwiches , soup and burgers. at a  good price...
