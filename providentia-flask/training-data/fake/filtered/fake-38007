Food remains A+++.  Service and 'tude is reaching epic annoying proportions.  The bar/wait staff is getting a little too full of themselves.  This is the UPPER WEST SIDE, relax, you are not in Trbieca.  Be friendly and coureous!  Ate early one evening this past weekend, walked in to see the staff hanging at the bar, making drinks, relaxing...place was pretty empty and we were ignored.  Then had to deal with a waiter and a bartender flirting with old women at the bar instead of taking our order.  Was there another night at 9:30 and I guess they close at 10, b/c the staff basically told us "no more orders, I can try to sneak in something for you, but need it FAST"...then they proceeded to bus and clear about everything around us, including our salt an peppar shakers.  Lovely.  Food is so great, that is why I go back, but would be nice if they cleaned up the service act!
