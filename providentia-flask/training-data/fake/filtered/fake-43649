Good food, good coffee. Great interior..it looks like it's been there forever. Great location. Very very spotty service(sometimes great service, sometimes wait staff definately looks like they're doing you a HUGE favor) You wait a long time if you go during weekends, and sorry, but it's a bit creepy that everyone(including bartender, waitstaff and patrons)look similiar.  Same level of hipness, same level of kind of aloof coolness, similar age group.  Similar hair styles, similar clothes.  Food tend to be a bit pricier than other eateries around the area, but not necessary better.   I like their burgers and coffee, though coffee's quite expensive.   During warmer month, it's nice to leisurely sit at one of the table when the place is empty of weekend or evening crowd.
