After wanting to go here for four or five years, I'm glad that I didn't endure a 60-90 minute wait for the experience else this review would warrant no more than three stars.  Yes, it's cute/cozy (hence the interminable wait if you try to go sans reservation at any normal dining hour).  Yes, everything is reasonably tasty (it's tapas, folks).  Yes, we only ate from the bar menu (late afternoonn snacks/drinks).  And yes, we have no real complaints.  I'm just dealing with feelings of underwhelmedness after experiencing some incredibly good alternatives for tapas that always seem to have seating when I pop in.  Highlights were crisp Patatas Bravas and fairly standard deviled eggs.  Chorizo al Jerez admittedly had a nice bite to it but left us feeling like we'd just had spicy hot dogs rather than some Spanish delicacy.  Bartender was a nice enough chap with a malfunctioning tap through no fault of his own.  We'll have to call ahead for a table this winter (since when did Tia Pol start taking reservations?) to get into the full menu.
