By far one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  Reliable but not boring.  A cozy, sexy atmosphere, delicious, creative food, changing menus, strong drinks, and free cookies!  It's fancy but casual and the range of prices on the menu makes it easy to control how much you spend. They don't take reservations but the wait is never much longer than 20 mins and once you pick your cocktail I assure you the time will quickly pass.  You can also sit at the "bar" to eat which means an actual table with bar stools.  They seem to rotate people through pretty fast, and though I've had times that my meal felt rushed, they're usually nice about letting you hang out for a while.  To have the full experience I suggest doing a starter, main, dessert and drink...and yes this will make your stomach hurt but you won't regret it. The menu is constantly changing which is further encouragement for me to return again and again.  The food is inspired by southern (new orleans?) cuisine with a twist on some traditional dishes.  The duck gumbo and shrimp and grits are my favorites, but I've also enjoyed some of the fish dishes and fried chicken (like everyone else has reviewed).  For starters the salads are creative and worth trying even though they can seem "typical" on the menu.  The desserts are constantly changing and I've never had a bad one...For drinks I'm a fan of the Aviation or Revival.
