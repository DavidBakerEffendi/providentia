as i mentioned in my last review of Zutto, i'm new to yelp so maybe i don't understand how this works --- but what happened to my last review?  it's gone!... i liked my last meal enough that i came back, and i think i was there the same night that that party of 11 had the comunal table.  those guys had fun for sure.  i don't have a lot of sophisicated speak about food but i know what i like and i like zutto.  enough said?
