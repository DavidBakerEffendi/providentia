Went here for restaurant week, got the $30, three course meal.  On the second floor, away from the much-maligned pictures of actual Cubans, the decor was nice and the lighting was not too dark.  The service was pretty much flawless, though the pacing was rather slow.  The ceviche was very good, a fresh, bright combination of flavors.  The corn nuts were a nice touch.  But the Lechon Asado was the star.  The pork was incredibly crispy and delicious, with rich layers of fat and tender muscle.  The richness of the pork was complemented perfectly by the fruity acidity of the "mojo" and the cabbage salad, which was similar to that served in Salvadoran pupuserias.  The creamy yucca was bland but inoffensive, a nice textural contrast.  The only shortcoming was a shortage of "bean broth."  The flavor of black beans should really be the base of this dish, and a full serving of beans would have been a much better starch than the yucca paste.  Still, the dish was already so flavorful as it was, and the portions so generous (I could hardly finish the plate) that this dish earned a fifth star.  By the time dessert arrived I was quite full.  The pumpkin cheesecake was serviceable but the only thing inspired about it was the spiced, toasted pumpkin seeds.  My companion ordered the salad and steak, which were both good.
