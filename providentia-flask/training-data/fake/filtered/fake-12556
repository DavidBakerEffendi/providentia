I'm looking at all the great reviews here and shaking my head in disbelief.  Koreander was a huge disappointment. We arrived at 6:30 p.m. on a Friday night and not until we began ordering were we told that the whole right side of the menu was unavailable.  There was no sushi. When our entrees came, we were given 1 very small bowl of lettuce with dressing.  I asked if the 2 of us were supposed to share this and the waiter said yes.  We were each given a medium size bowl that was about 1/3 full with miso soup. My "BBQ" beef (bibimbap) had almost no flavor.  It was shredded beef over a pile of rice that tasted and looked as though it was steamed with little seasoning.  When I asked if I could have some BBQ sauce I was told they didn't have any. Koreander is hardly a fusion restaurant as the name implies.  It's a mix of poorly prepared food using very little seasoning and skill. For $15.99 plus tax and tip I had a very unremarkable dinner that was definitely not worth the money.
