My husband has a love for brick oven pizza and when we found Peppino's on a weekend stroll through Park Slope he was in heaven. We ordered the Margherita pie well done (I don't like a soggy center) with extra fresh basil and it was DELICIOUS!  The crust was perfect not too thick or too thin, the sauce was flavorful and there was just enough fresh mozzarella that you didn't feel guilty eating a slice or the whole pie, which we did :)  The staff is very accomodating and attentive.  We've made it our Saturday lunch spot and can't wait to try out all the other items on their menu.  Happy Eating!
