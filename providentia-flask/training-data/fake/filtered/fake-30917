I live in CT and my sister and I had company visiting from AR. Our company wanted to eat seafood so I asked a coworker for a recommendation. First the waiter could not be bothered to do his job because they charge 15% gratuity for parties of 4 or more. Since he did not have to earn his tip he decided that our table was not worth his time and he went to help his other tables who he had to earn a tip from. He would disappear for long periods of time leaving us waiting. The food was good. Since the waiter was horrible we had decided to talk to the manager but we wanted to finish our food first. After we had paid for our meals after almost an hour of waiting for the waiter to come with our check, we asked a bus boy to get the manager. The manager was rude saying that we should not have waited so long to tell her and that we should have flagged her down early. She looked like everyone else in a t-shirt and black pants. She kept talking over us and would not listen because she assumed that we wanted a free meal. I can only assume for myself that it was because we are black. We told her that we did not want anything but the 15% gratuity to go to the chef instead of the horrible waiter. We dismissed her because it was pointless to try and talk to an idiot. We tried to get her name but she said that she did not have a name. Never in my life had I had to deal with such rude and disrespectful a manager of an supposedly "fine dining institution". Until I talked to the manager I was planning on returning at a later date because the waiter was just rude. After talking to the manager I realized that the whole business does not care for its customers. What ever happened to the customer is always right? All she had to say was I am sorry for his behavior and I will speak with him about it. The waiter's name is Scott B. #403.
