4.5 stars? Is that a joke? What a sad experience...First of all you arrive in this very tiny room, and you have to share your table and sit on a stool it was so uncomfortable but who knows, it's an "iron chef", should be good... So, the food was "ok..." Not very tasty, kind of insipid actually, I won't go into detail everything Â test the same anyway... The service was good! We paid $100 fwith 2 glasses of wine. Way, WAY OVERPRICED!!!
