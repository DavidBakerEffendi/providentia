Okay, so first of all.. the food is amazing. The burgers are absolute perfection. Our server, Chelley, was excellent. She came over and introduced us to a fun little game, their "Traitor of the day" burger. They tell you the ingredients and then you have to guess which traitor the burger is named for. If you get it right, then you get a free shot of Wild Turkey. I'm not a hard liquor person at all, but my boyfriend is, so we were THRILLED when we guessed correctly. Chelley was very attentive, although she was busy, she never forgot about us, and always made sure we had what we needed. I can definitely see my boyfriend and myself maxing out many credit cards here. TRY THE TRUFFLE FRIES-- YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!
