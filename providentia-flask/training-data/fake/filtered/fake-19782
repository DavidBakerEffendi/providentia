if there is one place in NJ that is the most tasty Indian food -- its Urban Spice. Since the time we moved to N J we tried a new restaurant every weekend. Its the only place that resembles true Indian taste. From Chicken 65 to Achari Chicken to just about everything is simply awesome. I have taken friends and family to that place for last 6 months and not once has anyone not loved the food there. The waiters are very friendly and parking is always available. No longer wait period as other Indian places. Surely recommend this place !!!
