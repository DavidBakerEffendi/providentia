So far I visited this place three times. On my first visit i ordered chicken biryani to-go. But their chicken biryani is just some masala rice with chicken pieces. and the rice was not cooked properly. Second time I ordered Chicken Dum Biryani and this is the biryani that I was looking for and it was good. Third time i got the Chicken Dum Biryani and this time it was too greasy. I have never seen that much oil in biryani anywhere. It looks like they are not maintaining consistency. Now I am not sure if I would go back there for Biryani.
