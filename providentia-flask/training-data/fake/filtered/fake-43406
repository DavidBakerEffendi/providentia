I had the lunch special Teriyaki Chicken Bento box and 3 roll Maki combo (Eel Avocado, Spicy Tuna, and Yellow Tail Scallion) for takeout today.  The prices are very good in comparison to Tokyo Sushi down the road (which in my opinion is way too expensive).   The sushi was not the best.  The fish tasted ok, but the rice lacked flavor and the seaweed was soggy.  In addition, the spicy tuna tasted a little too sweet.  The rolls were well sized and I was definitely full after the three rolls. The chicken teriyaki was decent, but the chicken was relatively dry and chewy.  Sauce tasted a little more Chinese than Japanese.  The white rice was good, and the rest of the items were what you would normally expect from a Bento box. Overall, the two items were good for the price, but I have definitely had better (Yutaka in Somerville has much better sushi).  Due to the close proximity to my home, I would probably come here again.
