Skip the tacos and burritos and go right for the entrées.  Simply excellent.  Chips and salsa, endless  and fantastic. The desserts - second to none. If it wasn't for the snobby, hipster wait staff who treats you as if you were bothering them by being there, this would be a five-star place, no doubt.
