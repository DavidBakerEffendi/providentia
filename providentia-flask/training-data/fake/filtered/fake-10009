Lives up to the hype! I've been thinking about going to Sabrina's for brunch for a while now, but I've been unwilling to deal with the wait. I finally gave in. I went on a Sunday morning. They told us it would be a 30 minute wait, but they probably got us seated slightly faster. I ordered the eggs benedict and it was absolutely first rate. Everyone at my table loved their dishes. The coffee was excellent. Service was efficient (not overly friendly + got shit done). If you're not in a hurry, Sabrina's is well worth your time. I love when a place lives up to its hype. Will definitely go back.
