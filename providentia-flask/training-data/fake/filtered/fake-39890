One of the best pizza places in the area.  They don't skimp on the toppings or the size of their pizza.   Only drawback is they don't deliver but still worth the trip.  They also make really good calzones, subs and garlic knots.  Highly recommend the white pie with spinach and tomato and their special pie is also really good.
