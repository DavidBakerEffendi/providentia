Way to go Daddy's Pizza!! You have relocated to a better area, and inside is beautiful! You have all created a nice, comfortable place to sit and dine. People enjoy sitting down and being waited on, which you now are doing and I believe this will help keep your business booming!! Before I end, I'd also like to add in that your prices are fair and reasonable. Thank You for allowing the community to have a nice place to sit and have a delicious meal wothout breaking our pockets at the same time. Best wishes to you!!
