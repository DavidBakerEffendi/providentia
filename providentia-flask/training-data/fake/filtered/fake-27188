Corn beef hash was awful, omelet was okay. Far more troubling was the approach to customer service. The AC dripped fluid from the ceiling into our food! We brought it to the servers attention who said: "oh, that happens when it gets hot" and then went back to work. Are you kidding?!? I am usually so much from the school of thought that there's only so much a waiter can do and empathize with how hard it must be to handle issues or complaints, but there was no apology, no offer for a replacement dish, or not even an offer to take the food off out bill until we demanded it. Stay far away from this health hazard of a stpre where customer service goes to die!
