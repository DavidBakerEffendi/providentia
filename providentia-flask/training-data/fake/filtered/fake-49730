We frequent a lot of restaurants all over Chittenden and Addison Counties, and we decided to try McGillicuddy's. Two words: decidedly mediocre. Burgers are overpriced and overcooked. (They use frozen, not fresh, meat, as they cannot cook their burgers to order; grass-fed beef is $2 more, adding up to a $13 burger.) Fries were soggy and not hot. Drinks were expensive and relatively weak. Disappointing since Colchester/Malletts Bay could use a decent restaurant. Bottom line: not worth it. There are a ton of great restaurants in our area where you can get a better meal for a better deal.
