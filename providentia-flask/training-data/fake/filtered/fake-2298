Wow - I waited 2 hours for brunch.  The weather was good, so everyone was out, but 2 hours?  At that point shoe leather would have been delicious, but everything tasted great.  The pancakes were light and fluffy, the coffee was appropriately bitter, and they were quick about the refills.  I dont think I would put in the wait again, but if you have the time, its worth trying
