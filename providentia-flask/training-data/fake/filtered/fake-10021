I'm a frequent flier at El Vez.  Mostly because if I don't get a blood orange margarita at least weekly my kidneys stop functioning.  The blood orange margaritas are AMAZING.  Sweet, frozen, pretty strong, soooo refreshing.  The food here is good as well.  I'm not a huge guacamole fan but the guacamole here is great.  Nachos were average, not bad, but if you like goat cheese, roasted calabaza soup is where its at.  It's so good, I didn't even care when the waitress splattered the soup on my white shirt.   luscious.  fantastic atmosphere.  you must go.
