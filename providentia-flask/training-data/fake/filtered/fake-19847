Being from Louisiana, I got so excited when I heard this place had opened. I went in today with my roommate. We ordered the Boudin Balls (delicious!), the Muffaletta sandwich (the olive component made it super tasty), the Red Beans and Rice (my roommate loved them and added the Crystal Louisiana sauce like a good southerner-in-training), the Macaroni and Cheese (yummy yummy breading!), Â and the Gumbo (no one's gumbo can be better than my mom and family's, but being a block away from me- a very warm substitution!). We also had two desserts. The Bread and Buttermilk dessert laden in bourbon sauce- sublime! All I was missing was milk and a place to curl up in a fetal position (though the pillows on the back of the booths provided a nice touch). This dessert can be shared. The other dessert was chocolatey goodness with peanut butter crumbles. A good single serving size as I would not have wanted to get into the habit of sharing. We were too stuffed to try any of the cocktails. I look forward to trying the PoBoys and Fried Chicken Entree. The decor, feel, and food is a welcome addition to a community saturated with European venues. It brings something different which is nice. One of the owners spoke with us and expressed his love for Louisiana. Our friendly waitress informed us the chef was from New Orleans. Mardi Gras beads were placed in the bill tray for a nice touch. Today was their second day opening, so with any new restaurants I am sure they have many more details to work out. I look forward to when they offer earlier hours, brunches, and potentially more additions to the menu (Beignets and Shrimp/CrawfishEtouffee, please!!!). Being a southern girl who escaped the south without cooking skills, its nice to know now that I can get a taste of home not too far away.
