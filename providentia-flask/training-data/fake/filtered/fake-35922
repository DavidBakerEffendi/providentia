This is my first yelp review and unfortunately it's going to be a bad one. I've used yelp very often and love this site but I had a terrible experience at Robert's and feel compelled to write a review about it. I've been there twice because I read some review somewhere stating they have the best fried chicken. When I got there on a Sunday afternoon, they said they didn't have fried chicken. I was more than disappointed but we order a pizza with smoked mozzarella and pork sausage ( I really liked it but my BF wasn't a great fan of the size or the price) and also pork shoulder with polenta (I thought it was a bit on the cold side and the polenta was very grainy) The second time I went, I called ahead to make sure these prissy bohemians were going to serve fried chicken- they said they did. After we order it, I asked the waiter very politely if she can make sure we get at least 1 white meat ( I totally understand if you can't do both) but she said there was nothing she can do and that it's the chef's selection. Really? You can't ask the chef to put 1 piece of white meat in the fryer?! So of course they brought out two pieces of dark meat. Not only were they tiny- they were honestly not that great. For $16, I was really expecting a lot more. Bottom Line: If you're really willing to make a trek out there to no-man land, do yourself a favor and go somewhere else. The pizza, fried chicken, ambiance (or lack there of- it was like eating at a farm with communal tables with BENCHES - not even chairs), fake-ass waitstaff, wanna be organic farmers is NOT WORTH IT!
