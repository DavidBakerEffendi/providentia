Nothing compares to freshly made hand pulled noodle soup on a cold NYC day! When you pass by this restaurant, you might not want to go in because it's small and looks dingy. But trust me, the rave reviews are true! I had the Beef brisket noodle soup and boiled dumplings and it truly satisfied my cravings! And, it was cheap! The noodle soup was only $6.00 and the dumplings were $3.00 for 11 pcs! I even bought their frozen dumplings to take home ($10.00/50 pcs!). This is one of the best hole in the wall cheap eats places I've been to!
