Oh Red Sonja how I've missed you!!! I couldn't be more thrilled to celebrate one of my best birthdays ever at Mundo! As you step into the beautiful new space, you are transported to a world of delicious culinary delights, eclectic decor and beautiful sounds that sweep you away into pure pleasure. The incredibly friendly and stylish staff add to a beautiful dining experience, and always warm you with their smiles. I love the cozy and intimate vibes, yet appreciate the large space and those gorgeous canopy of lights that sit majestically above the beautiful bar. Can't wait to celebrate and feast again! Now if you'll excuse me I just got a craving for those mouthwatering Manti (Ottoman Dumplings). Off to Mundo!!!! See you soon!!! xoxo ~J~
