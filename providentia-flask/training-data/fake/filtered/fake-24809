Brauhaus Schmitz is a good solid German place in food, drink, and atmosphere. In a few places it excels past "good solid", and is not really deficient in any area. While I could leave some minor criticisms of the food and beer selection they would not be worth your time to read as they would only be minor criticisms. However, that main thing that Brauhaus Schmitz lacks is *soul*. I just can't put my finger on it, but this is not a place that I can go to and spend hours and hours (like I did at Ludwig's Garten, a German place that closed a bit before Brauhaus Schmitz opened). Brauhaus Schmitz is definitely worth going to and I go from time to time, and recommend you try it if you have not, but it is just not a Â place that I cherish and love.
