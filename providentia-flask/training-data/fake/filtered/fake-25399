The restaurant is so special. You can tell that a lot of care is given to the smallest detail. I love their spicy margharita made with chile enfused tequila. And their tofu curry entree dish is great for me since I'm a vegetarian. And their brunch- forget about it! Their turkish eggs are amazing- and I don't usually even like eggs! Brunch is done on a walk in basis only which is the only draw back- since they have serious waits.
