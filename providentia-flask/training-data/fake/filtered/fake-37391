My first visit at urban spice was good mostly after hearing about the living condition of there staff. It first started off when the staff came to know that we were from Bombay too. We had some okay food. But what was really interesting to find out then the staff told us about his situation with the tips, he requested us to tip cash , because the owner Kamal pockets the service charge made by credit card. The waiter told us he can't do anything because he is working on cash And cannot legally work in the us. And was very unhappy of the living situation aswel. He told us they live upstairs And was asking us to help them with there status. I wish we could help them , look how owners take advantage of the staff who can't help it. Tushar is such a sweet person I wish him the best and for that Kamal I hope the authority does something about this. He requested us to come back , but I don't think so , I don't Â like to support owners like this. Manoj
