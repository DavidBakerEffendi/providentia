My office is within walking distance and I've passed by a few times, so I wanted to try it out.  Ate here last night with a few friends for my birthday.   It took me forever to decide what to order because there were so many things I wanted to try (that doesn't happen too often).  I had the flank steak and it was fantastic.  The pork chop, sea bass and kale salad were all big hits. They are now open for lunch.  Porteno is going to see a lot of me!
