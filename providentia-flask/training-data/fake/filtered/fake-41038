Friendly waitresses and a nice atmosphere.  I crave their pizza every week.  They make the best sauce in the area.  It's tough to eat other pizza after you've had Lombardi's.   It's always a good experience.  You'll need a gym membership once you're addicted.  I make it my regular place, right before my hockey games!  Great place for a team to meet before or after games.
