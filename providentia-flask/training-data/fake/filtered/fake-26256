The fish was so fresh I thought they had just caught them in the back.  Love my sushi at least once a week.  I liked this place because they have a great happy hour. There are too many options and you don't want to miss a thing. . They were also very accommodating of the vegetarian in our party. The owner is very passionate about his food; he often lets his customers taste his new dishes.
