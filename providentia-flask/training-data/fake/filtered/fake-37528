Diamonds Disaster Diamonds may last forever. I don't think that it's likely with this one will. Our recent visit to Diamonds was a huge disappointment. I did not expect it to be the "Burg" version, as those days are lost forever. I did expect some hint of the old Diamonds quality with its current more generic menu (the average Italian menu offered in thousands of other restaurants), sadly no. As mentioned by another review, prices at this level demand a better dining experience.   The wife and I chose to dine at the bar and with bartender Kelly the only high spot of the evening. Good drinks and a friendly personality. We ordered appetizers, my wife enjoyed her clam's casino, and sorry I can't remember what I ordered. It surely did not reach the level of remembering. I did have a good salad, the greens were fresh and crisp. Entrees consisted of lobster tails and pasta with clams and red sauce. The lobster lacked taste, over cooked and somewhat dry. As for the pasta with clams. It started off with a great sauce and nicely done pasta. It was made with steamed "fresh clams" and a mined clam red sauce base. The disappointment came with one of the "fresh" clams, it had a bad taste, though it had opened. This can happen as I have experienced it before over many years of enjoying shellfish dishes. Not sure I can blame the kitchen on this disappointment. I passed on any desert and my wife ordered the crème brûlée. The crème brûlée was a disaster, watery custard with a rock hard prefab topping. This sums up a first and last visit.
