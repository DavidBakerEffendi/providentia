I recently had a party using the private room downstairs.  It was a great time!  The private party space was amazing -- comfortable, yet functional for just $200 for 4 hours. Lots of eating and lounge seating and a private bar.   They have great food/drink packages to meet any budget. The food was excellent, and plenty of leftovers even after many went up for seconds. The staff was very attentive and the GM Kurt was terrific in all ways!   I will definitely do another party in the future and I recommend anyone to do the same!
