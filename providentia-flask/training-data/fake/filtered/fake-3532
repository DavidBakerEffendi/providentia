I've only been here on Sundays so don't know much about the regular crowd. It's a bit off the beaten track but the wings are awesome! I'm a big fan of spicy, meaty wings & American Retro has it! The medium is too spicy for most people so beware of ordering the super hot ones. I'm a fan of the hot ones. The mac & cheese & nachos are pretty good, better than you're average bar food!
