I've always dined in the Tavern, not the dining room, but it hardly matters. Anything you order at Gramercy will be delicious, and the staff is always helpful and friendly, always offering friendly recommendations. Sitting at the bar to eat offers the same tavern menu, but sometimes is more fun if you're alone or just a party of two. If you want a great meal with great service, go to Gramercy. Also, Micah Danger in the kitchen is an amazing chef =)
