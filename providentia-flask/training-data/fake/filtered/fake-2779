I have worked in the restaurant industry for a few years now and I have never seen an establishment run out of so many menu items so early in the night. The servers are rude and not compliant when mistakes are made. The servers are not aware of what is going on in the kitchen. The lack of communication between the servers and the kitchen staff has left my group of friends and I in shock. The night began enjoyable. They seated us quickly and brought out our appetizers in a timely manner. 45 minutes after our food was ordered, we were told that some of the food items had run out. When were were asked to be compensated for our disappointment, we were told that "nothing in this culture is free". I am not really sure what that means or indicates but I am positive that this was not the appropriate response. They servers continued on to explain some bull shit story without any reason or rhyme as to why their mistakes had occurred. Furthermore, don't come here. Don't bring your friends. Don't bring your family. Don't waster your time
