Living in New Haven and experiencing so many visually interesting and artistically designed restaurants, that also have great food and service, I have become somewhat of a pain in the .... when it comes to dishing out a load of money to eat. I wanna have a great time ,see cool things and have great food,all for a good price. As a resident of Westville I really had high hopes for Stone Hearth.I want them to be the awesome place to be in town.I did not feel that.In fact I have been 3 times and each time I have come away thinking"Why did I just spend so much money?"The Â food is delicious and portions are fair but at the end of the meal the price does not seem to merit the experience.Each time I have been here there have been very few people in and the atmosphere seems kind of cold.Maybe because the wind blows in every time the front door opens.The lighting above each table is very stark and boring and there does not seem to be anything interesting to look at.I found myself wondering why they do not paint the raw silver duct work with a tone that blends better into the ceiling.A couple of curious sculptures,a colorful painting on the wall...something Anyway...The food and service are great but hey,I can eat anywhere.
