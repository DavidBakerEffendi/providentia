I've been going here for god knows how long now.  its was at one point the only place i can go get the perfect spicy tuna roll.  a year or two ago, the owners changed and the quality derailed slightly.  some things im familiar with changed a bit and i was not happy about it.  after a while i came back and things seemed to be tightened up and are back to normal.  def try the fire fighter roll and the udon soup.  you get the miso salad and miso soup as soon as you sit down.  still my go to sushi place for sure.
