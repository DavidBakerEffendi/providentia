I've been eating at Jose Tejas for as long as I can remember. Despite the long wait, I still go back. I have been there for a party of 2 to a party of 20. It's our family's favorite mexican restaurant. We're quite disappointed that my (my entire families) favorite dish is off the menu. They took catfish bites off and since then we have been quite upset. Family from London, Canada, and India would come to this restaurant just for the catfish bites. (but we're still regular customers and go back) The nachos and salsa are amazing (and free!). They taste best with the various margaritas offered in the restaurant. My favorite part is the fajitas (or any of their grilled mexican specialty). You get your money's worth. I usually get the chicken fajitas (eventhough the vegetable fajita is quite good as well.) Placed on a bed of sizzling onions is blackened, delicious chicken. The quantity is great to. I usually substitute my rice and beans for french fries. Sounds weird, right? But the homemade thin and crunchy french fries are out of the world. They recently added corn bread to their menu which makes a great accompaniment/dessert. It would be great if they would do actual mexican dessert. It would add something traditional to their restaurant. They do however offer Carvel Ice Cream cake for birthdays on request (an additional charge). Overall, i love this restaurant. Expect to wait a decent amount of time before getting seated. I wish they would take reservations. Especially for larger parties.
