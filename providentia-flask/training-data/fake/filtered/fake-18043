This place is great during the summertime for SIPS! Nice music, great atmosphere and tasty drinks. The rum punch is really good. I always get the mussels, jerk wings, and cheese steak rolls. I don't live in the city but my friends and I definitely go for the Center City SIPS specials. The only reason I left out the 5th star is because it can be hard getting to the bar during the happy hour rush. Enjoy
