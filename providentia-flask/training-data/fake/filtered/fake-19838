This place is not worthed. You have to wait outdoor for an hour or more and another 30 mins to get your pizza. The pizza is just plain like you can get from regular pizza place in nyc. The floor is filthy and the waiter is rude if you dont spend much money. The bathroom line is another 30 mins. You probably need to spend about 2 and a half hour for a 30 mins meal time. I will look like an dumbass if I come back here again.
