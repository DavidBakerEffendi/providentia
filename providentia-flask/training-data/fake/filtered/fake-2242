i have been going to clinton street bakery for years now; I have to say food is good but I think the hype took over the depth of the experience; We decided to try it on a saturday; After a 45 min wait, we were finally seated uncomfortably on the high chairs; that was a first bummer, I never sat there before; then I ordered the 3 eggs and my friend had the blueberry pancakes. the food was good but all the extra hustle and uncomfortable seating is not worth the wait anymore I think. Am I getting too old?
