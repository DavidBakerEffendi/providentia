This is my second time at this diner.  I wasn't impressed the first time.  Thought I give it another chance.  The place is clean and had a nice brightly lit atmosphere.  The staff is accommodating and friendly.  I had the smoke house burger and a spinach soup.   The soup had the consistency of glue even though the taste was edible.  The burger came on a bun so thick you have to open your jaws wide as sharks to bite into it.  I ended up using a steak knife to cut it up which defeats the purpose of eating burgers.  Why would anyone go and ruin a well intention burger like that is beyond me.   The sauce was good even though they forgot it initially.  It had fried onions in it but it was sort of just there, flat not crunchy. This place needs to step up the food a notch to catch up with it's nice decor. It's pretty inexcusable that it's called the "nutley" diner -  representing the town but the food is so mediocre.
