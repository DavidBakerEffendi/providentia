Do not miss this place.  New chef is fantastic.  There is no bad choice here and it is certainly evolving.  Friendly atmosphere, family friendly with an outstanding liquor list and the ability to accommodate special requests.  The specialty drinks are delightful too. The wait staff was very very friendly and helpful.  Cannot wait to go back a 5th time.
