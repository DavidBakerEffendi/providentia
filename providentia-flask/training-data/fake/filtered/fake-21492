This place is my new favorite!  The food is so DELICIOUS and FRESH.  Great choices to choose from.  Everything had such great flavor.  I can see that this will be my lunch spot at least 3 times a week if not more.  Staff was friendly and nice, even giving me suggestions when I was undecided because of all the choices available.  Can't wait to go back and try some more things I missed out on.  The steak taboon was so good, as was the eggplant. hummus and israeli salad.  To top it off, the place was spotless! Did I mention freshly baked pitas?!? Soooo good! Don't forget the Baklava for dessert!  Yummmmmmmyyyyyyyy!!!
