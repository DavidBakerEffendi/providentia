It's a beautiful space with a relaxed atmosphere and the food is AMAZING!!  We had such a great time.  The staff was so accomodating and pleasant, such a welcoming atmosphere.  There is something for everyone on the menu.  The small plates let you sample things that maybe you wouldn't have ordered in a full size entree.  My group ordered a variety of different things, some of which I never would have ordered for myself and I was pleasantly surprised every time.  All the flavors are so delicate and creative -- it really is like nothing I have ever tasted!!  It seems as though it would be just as enjoyable for a quiet dinner for two as it would a large group.  Don't miss Sampan!!!  You will love it -- all of us did!!
