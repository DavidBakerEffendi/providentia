Great place came here for dinner with my boss from London.I was really nervous since he travels around the world and is well versed in service and food.But by the smile on his face and the repeated poquito picante fix plus a bottle of wine I exhaled.They made me feel special as they were attentive and sensitive to the fact that I was on a dinner meeting.It went so well we went to the bar after our great steaks and the bartender Felix..was teaching us on the Rums of Latin America...Zacapa very smooth we will be back even though I lost m scarf at this point I didn't care...I wil be back!!
