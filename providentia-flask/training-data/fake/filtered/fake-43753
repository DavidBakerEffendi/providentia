Very good food. Very good service good too. The last time I was here (a 1.5 weeks ago) however, the bar smelled sour, kind of like it needed a good cleaning and disaffecting on regular basis. The smell kind of wafted through the entire bar. I hope they keep up the cleaning part. Perhaps the place needs a refresh, but the food is great. Otherwise, I would have given them a solid 4.5 stars.
