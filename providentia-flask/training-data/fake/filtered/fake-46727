First time going there yesterday and ordered a yummy, but super pricey, $10.00 halo-halo to-go because the place was super busy. While talking to a bartender, I gave him cash but he never gave me my change. Â I only realized when we were too far away to walk back. Lesson learned; be aware of your cash and what's due back!
