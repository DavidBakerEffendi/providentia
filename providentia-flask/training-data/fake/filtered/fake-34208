I'm not sure why this place gets so much hype... The fish is not the freshest I've had in NYC, maybe I expected to get what I paid for.  I tried every tuna/toro and yellow tail on the menu and was very underwhelmed.  The presentation and the sake were fantastic, but I expect toro to melt in my mouth like butter and that didn't happen.  It was OK, but with the exception of one or two pieces there was a very fishy after-taste.  Don't come here for the fish, save your money and go somewhere else.
