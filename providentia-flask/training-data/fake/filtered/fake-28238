This place is awesome! I've been twice since they opened last week - once with a big group and once with a friend. Since we had a huge group with us we decided to order a whole spread. I'd definitely suggest the southwest mac, reuban mac, traditional grilled cheese, apple & manchego grilled cheese and the showstopper (top quality burger in between 2 grilled cheeses...YUM). The traditional grilled cheese was literally oozing with cheese mmmm, reuban mac had awesome flavors with the sauerkraut, thousand island and corned beef, and the southwest mac was great with just a little bit of a kick and cornbread topping! Apple & manchego was a nice & refreshing take on grilled cheese too & the fresh basil is a great touch. Also make sure to get the paprika sauce with any of the sides!  SO GOOD.  I'm getting hungry just writing this Everyone working there was super friendly and accomodating.  Great laid back spot to chill & gorge on cheese.
