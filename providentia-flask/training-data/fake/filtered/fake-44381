Been meaning to try this place since it opened. Went there a couple of weeks ago, and it pretty much lived up to my expectations. Got the veggie wrap (which was just average), iced tea, and of course some frites. The fries are the standout star here - nice and crispy with lots of amazing dips to choose from. My friend and I shard the basil, eggplant, and mango chutney. The mango chutney was a little thin, eggplant was good, but the basil was absolutely crave-able. The price is very good, which is difficult to find in Old City. The guy at the counter was quick to help and offer suggestions. I will definitely be back.
