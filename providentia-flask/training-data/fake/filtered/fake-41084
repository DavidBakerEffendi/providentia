Discrimination against foreign language speakers!!! We found this place on yelp, it is close to Roosevelt Island where we live and decided to take there our guests from Europe. Place was nice and cosy, food was good as well as wine. Service was really the way we like it , not pushy and aggressive to sell and kick as out to turn table. We taught that we finally found perfect neighborhood place. But, then we got a check, with 20% gratuity included on party of 4 people. Waiter didn't say anything, didn't circle the gratuity on the check hoping that we will not notice or complain. And we didn't notice at the first place, so we put extra 20% tip on already self-tipped check to the Mr. Master of the Waiters. Hopefully, since we have a habit of taking checks with us, as soon as we walked out we saw what happened and went back to fix things. There is no sign on the menu that there will be gratuity included on parties of 6 or more, and specially not on the parties of 4!!! Yes that is illegal by the NY State. I guess that we got miss-judged(discriminated) because off foreign language that we spoke inside, and that non-attentive service that we like, came from his decision to charge us not 15 or 18, but 20% for his poor service. So for us that was First time, Last time and never again in Sofia Wine Bar.
