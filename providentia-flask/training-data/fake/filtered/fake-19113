One of the best kept pizza secrets of Brooklyn!  It's not easy to get to, but the pizza is actually some of the best you can find anywhere in NYC.  They have 3 different baking options (I believe): wood-fired, gas, and pan.  The "grandma" is a surprise, and I wouldn't have thought to order it, but they gave us a free slice at the end of the night and it's one of our new favorites.  Calamari salad is delicious.  Good atmosphere, great food, and some of the friendliest staff around.  Don't tell too many people ;)
