I give them a 1. (food was very good, nothing else was.) We had our Christmas Party there 2011. We had a buffet and ran out of food, They only gave us 1 portion pp, which they did not mention at $33.50 per person.There was no Bread,The tip should not be 18% we waited on ourselves. They would not put pitchers of water or soda on a table. 1 bowl of salad for 32 people, placed at the end of the Buffet. Worst Holiday Party ever. I sent them a letter complaining, and they did not even respond. I have never in my life been to a buffet and they ran out of food. Everyone in our party of 32 complained. I was horrified and will never suggest this place to anyone. We should have just ordered off the menu for half the price. Whitney is young an inexperienced and I'm guessing she opened my letter and trashed it. Now I feel I have to inform others of this disaster. They don't know what the customer wants and I'm sure she has never worked a party before. By telling, maybe they will get it right for your party. Do you want to risk it? So Sorry I did.
