great little place. I used to go there for lunch when I worked at the school next to it. they were first the best service, always got greeted right after sitting, and menus just as fast. the food also came quick, esp good because I normally only had a 1/2 hour. it's very much like you went to your mom's house for lunch too, Â which is nice!
