This is definitely the sort of restaurant that you go to on a special occasion. The waitress was very helpful and attentive, without constantly hovering, and she was happy to make recommendations. The food itself was fantastic; fairly high prices, but worth it, and decent portion sizes. Nice ambience, quite small and close to other tables, but it didn't feel cramped.
