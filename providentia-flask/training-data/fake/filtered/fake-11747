I really saw this place as a decent American version of Chinese food the first time I ate here. I noticed they have a poor attitude and are not very friendly but I looked past that. I have however decided this place is a no go. The second time I came here they messed up my order and their chicken did not taste fresh at all. The last time I ordered, I found a piece of metal scrubber in my food. As soon as I found it, I spit everything out and threw it away. The metal matched the scrubber I had in my sink. It makes me sick thinking about it.
