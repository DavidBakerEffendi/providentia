amazing!! and the staff makes everything even better! i called for info - the lady that answered was super helpful. when i came in, everyone was so friendly! the music was great! i came in for brisket and it is a must eat! the sides are unique and delicious as well. if in brooklyn and hungry - this is it for sure.
