I just left your establishment and wanted to leave a comment. First I was disappointed that the menu was not the same on that I had originally seen when I found your restaurant on Restaurant.com. We ordered the mini skewers, which were very good. I had the French onion soup which was ok. My boyfriend had the port ribs which he sai...d were second only to Rib Rack in Phili..they were very good. I had the NY bone in strip steak. I have to say it was the worst steak I have ever had. It was fatty, had alot of grissle, and I could not eat 90% of it. I tried...trust me I tried. I thought, no problem...there is always dessert. WRONG!! I was excited to see creme brulee on the menu only to find out you had none. Nor did you have my second choice...flan. We decided on lava cake and apple cobbler, which again were ok. Our waiter was Danny who started out to be delightful, and attentive. But by half way thru our meal, he became too busy to really check on us. I told him about the steak being horrible, he apologized, but never offered to compensate me for it. We ended up sitting for 20 minutes waiting for our check, and another 20 to pay the bill. Not so happy with Danny now. But he again did apologize and at one point during the meal he did send someone else over to check on us...that was very nice. Over all it was a very unenjoyable evening that ended up costing me $80 without tip...$27 for a meal that I couldn't even eat. We may be back for the ribs..though I don't think I will, but I can't say I would recommend your place. Thought you should know. Kim
