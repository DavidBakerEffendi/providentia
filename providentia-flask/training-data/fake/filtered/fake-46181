My husband and I went to Cafe Orlin on 4th of July at 1130am. We didn't have to wait to be seated as we were happy with sitting indoors. I ordered the pumpkin pancakes and my husband ordered the blackstone breakfast set. Our cappuccino was not hot. His eggs were mediocre and my pancakes were bad. The batter was not fluffy, but extremely thick and mushy. There were 4 pieces of pancakes - I finished 1.5 and left the rest. I didn't even want to pack it back for my dog. Very disappointed. If you're in the East, I would say definitely go to Shopsin's. It beats this place hands down anytime.
