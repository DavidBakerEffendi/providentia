I love the VPB. I always order the pulled pork pie and sweet potato fries. I'm finding less and less items I can eat now that I've been relegated to the gluten free penalty box. I'm assuming the fries are off limits for me (but I've never asked actually. The issue would be the fryer and being fried with non-gluten-free items in case people are wondering.) I have had the pulled pork since my diagnosis, and haven't had any ill effects (though I have since found out I can't have vinegar either. Sometimes you just don't realize what you can and can't have when the diet is a new thing to you.) However, regardless of my restrictions, I love the food.I love the onion rings and the calamari. The only dish I've ever had there that I didn't like was the meatloaf, and that was because it had onions and some other veggie chunks. I personally like a smooth meatloaf. I don't drink beer, but I do love the blackberry seltzer. All of the seltzers are delicious, and one of my favorite drinks is their seltzer with vodka on the rocks. So good!
