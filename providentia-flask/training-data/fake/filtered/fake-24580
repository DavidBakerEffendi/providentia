their famous soup dumplings never dissapoint.  also delish are the scallion pancakes, the new year's cakes with veggies, the eggplant dish is good enough to convert non-veggie lovers and the double cooked pork (a little spicey) was an enormous hit!  i go here to celebrate chinese new year each year.  it's not much for ambiance, and there is always a wait (even if you reserve) but it's sooooo yummy!  beer only
