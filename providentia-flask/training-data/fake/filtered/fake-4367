We went one night recently, and there was a lady bartender who made our experience so miserable that we left before ordering our meal!  She was rude, unhelpful, and very unwelcoming.  Granted, my husband and I were with our daughter (1-1/2 years old), and were hoping for a nice meal out as a family.  Our daughter was pretty well behaved, but i asked for a plate of fruit to help her sit still.  Apparently, they do not serve fruit, not even as a garnish for drinks - nor did they offer another suggestion.  The bartender was completely unaccomodating, and, I presume, she didn't think we should be there with a child.  When I asked for the bill, I noticed there was a slice of orange in my drink!! Her attitude was so palpable that it ruined the rest of the evening for us.  I left with a horrible taste, and will never return.
