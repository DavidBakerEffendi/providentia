This is a wonderful place wether you are vegan or not. Â I love breakfast there and even though weekend mornings you'll have to wait, it's definitely worth it. The coffee cups are always full and their French toast varieties are to die for. The owners and staff are so nice that we've become regulars there. Their evening menu is also wonderful and the offering of vegan daiya cheese makes a lot of people happy. I love this place!
