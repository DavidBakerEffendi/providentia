The restaurant is beautiful - rustic and clean interior with clay pots hanging on the ceiling and even utensils that match the table. The food was excellent - everything we Â ordered was fantastic: the meat sausage, baked giant beans, moussaka, and for dessert phyllo with custard and honey (excellent and I am still thinking about it!). All the staff is extremely friendly and attentive. Our waiter was great! I will definitely go back.
