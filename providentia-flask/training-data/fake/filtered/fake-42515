I love their guacamole!  I've been there for brunch a few times, and the food is always good.  I agree with other reviewers that the fish tacos are excellent.  What surprised me though, was that I got one of the best burgers there too!  I wasn't really in the mood for Mexican, but were meeting friends there, so I got a hamburger, and it was simply one of the best burgers out there!  Perfectly cooked, a nice dressing, fresh bun.  Try it, you'll like it!  And go to Capogiro across the street for dessert!!!
