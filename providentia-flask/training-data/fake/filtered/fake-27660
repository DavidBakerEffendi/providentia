better than trellis, but thats not saying much the menu is ameture. you can tell it was created by a hobbyist, and not a chef. it has no congruity or flow, too much variety with not enough total items available. the food tends to be either really unhealthy (fatty, salty, fried, cheesed, gravy'd, etc), or bland and unpalletable. there is not a single healthy option on the menu besides a side of carrots and celery (mind you, it comes with blue cheese dressing). i have purchased several different meals from here, both dine-in and take-out, and have yet to be pleased with anything. add to this the fact that the food is priced as if it is balducci or cittorella quality, yet delivered closer to mcdonalds quality and this place is not for the hungry. the drink selection is reasonable, prices are reasonable during happy hour. besides the drinks, the only thing this place has going for it are the cute girls that work there (they cant wait tables, but they are friendly and nice to look at), hiring young cuties seems to be the only good business decision the owner has made. my advice is to eat a sandwich at home and hit this 2nd rate hooters for cheap_o pitchers of coors light. then jump on the tram and hit the strip club for a nite-cap. my advice for the owner is to firre the chef, hire a professional, write a real "grown up" menu, and feature 3 distinct healthy entree options. also establish a complete prix fixed brunch menu that includes a morning drink and coffee, AND CHOICES OF DECENT OPTIONS, for under $17 and youll get my business back.
