I think Doma is terrific.  The space is clean and attractive, and the staff is friendly and knowledgeable.  The menu is extensive and the food is delicious and beautifully presented.  One of my very favorites is the Korean taco.  Scrumptious!  Most important, Doma has the best sushi I have ever tasted in Philadelphia. Go, you will not regret.
