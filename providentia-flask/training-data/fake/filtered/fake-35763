One of the worst places I have ever been to! I travel often and often eat brunch on Sundays. Went here as recommended and the service was awful. Overpriced and rude employees. I spilled a drink and NOT ONE person offered to help clean it or offered napkins to me. I will never go here or recommend anyone waste their money on this place! I even asked to talk to the manager and he laughed in my face and admitted he saw me spill the drink but didn't offer to help! HORRIBLE service.
