I have been here twice now, both times at the request of my starstruck friend (he saw Gisele here once). No exaggeration this is the worst restaurant I have ever been to. I'll start with a generous positive. The food is somewhat decent (but not worth the negatives of this place--see below). As for the bad, where should I begin? Maybe with the incredibly rude staff. The aforementioned 'black guy' has to be the rudest wait service employee I have ever met. I know I am young, but I am paying your salary, so please act accordingly, you fool. Oh and if you seat our party of 6 at a tiny circular table in the front corner of the restaurant with a lot of foot traffic, I would prefer if you wouldn't keep telling me to scootch my chair in, thanks asshat. As for our waitress, she may have well thrown our food at us. To top it all off, the added a 20% tip to the bill. 20% is standard for me everywhere I go and I may add more if I like the person. Here, I was about ready to walk away without tipping. Service is atrocious. Portions. This will always kill me because generally, I'm a fat. That said, I understand these froo froo restaurants are expected to give you measley portions. When the food is excellent I really don't mind. When the food is 'meh', the service is filled with d-bags, I mind. My steak au poivre looked like the servings in a fancy feast meal for a cat. They were gracious enough to throw a few french fries on my plate. I was hungry when I left the restaurant. Place sucks. Don't fall for the pretentious allure of this joint. I've had better food at Carls Jr.
