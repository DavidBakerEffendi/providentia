Jesus Puerto, owner of Soul de Cuba Cafe, What an inspiring man! After a near death experience in 1993 he decided to dedicate his life to enhancing the human experience. Hello, my kind of person! When we met in 2004 and Jesus described his background to me, souldecuba.com Â I just had to check the restaurant out. In the first few minutes i was inside, i was enjoying my first experience with Cuban food and i was hooked. The staff is friendly and down to earth and the artwork, music and general ambiance all bring a story of Jesus' West African, Cuban and South Florida roots right into the dining room. Oh, and the food is fantastic. As the name says Soul de Cuba Cafe (CUBAN SOUL FOOD) so you can expect that many of the items will be paired with rice, black beans (grandma's recipe) and plantain. The meats are traditionally marinated in mojo (traditional cuban marinade made with garlic, citrus, vinegar based) so there is a lot of flavor but the food is NOT SPICY :). After experiencing this magical place and participating in it's development every day since that day in 2004, i just had to express how special Soul de Cuba Cafe is to me.
