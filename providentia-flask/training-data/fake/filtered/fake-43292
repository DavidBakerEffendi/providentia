I really like what this place has become. There's a perfect balance between neighborhood/irish pub and craft haven. Jesse, the owner/GM has been putting a great deal of thought into his draft beer selections. There's always a variety of styles, flavors and brands. Whether you're looking for sweet, sour, hop or malt bombs, you'll find something here. I regularly see the draft tech in cleaning lines which tells you just how committed Poor Henry's has become to the cause. The burgers are a staple for me, but I can also confidently recommend the sliced steak, crab cakes, and chicken pot pie. The garlic sauteed broccoli is bangarang. Stop in on a Sunday night for bottle share. All the servers are friendly, whether you're in for the first time or 100th. They try hard to make you feel welcomed and move you in and out quickly at lunch time. Worth a visit.  I hear there's tap takeover in the works.  Better check the calendar.
