My friends and I were here the past week for restaurant week and we loved it! I had the -Zucchini, Arugula & Pecorino Insalata for an appetizer (good if you are a fan of arugula) - Sweet Corn Agnolotti for the entr√©e (delicious) -Pistachio Cake with Macerated Berries for dessert (my favorite part of the experience) *my friend had the tartufo and it is a must have if you decide to go. We had reservations for 12:45 and were seated as soon as we arrived even though we were fifteen minutes early. The staff was really friendly and the food was incredible. I would definitely recommend this to everyone I know.
