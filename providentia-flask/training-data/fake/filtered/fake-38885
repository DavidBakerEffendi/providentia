Jake's Sandwich Board is pleasurable a sandwich venue as one could hope to experience.   Firstly, one must acknowledge the staff.  Attentive, energetic, and consistent, you can see them working and assembling or prepping food throughout the day with vigor in a well kept cook area.  They are personable and prompt and in my many visits, have a fairly high degree of consistency even under heavy load. The environment is well adorned with photos and a 5lb Challenge Wall of Fame/Shame.  Not going to touch on that because the proportions deserve a look in person, as well as the overwhelming number of failed attempts.  Quite amusing.  However, a personal highlight are the well crafted chalk boards which offer seasonal flair, clean lines and a very consistent style, which lends a nice air. The food selection consists of a standard board offering variations of pork (until the recent porchetta experiment my favorite), brisket, steak, and a couple of chicken options.  For the grain/wheat averse, Jake's also offers the option of going breadless and having the meat over a bed of greens or on fries.  I typically opt for the former as the greens offer up the drippings of the absolutely fantastic flesh and accompaniments. Speaking of, while the bacon and sriracha permeate all things Jake's, I highly recommend either the Picante or Gringo, which utilize Jake's Fire Sauce.   I really cannot sing the praises of Jake's adequately, other than to say that their naked bowls really show off the meat they prepare.  As I mentioned, I favor the pork and mentioned their porchetta.  This is another aspect of Jake's that I like.  There is usually something special in the works, and it has never failed to please. TLDR:  Eat at Jake's.  Now.
