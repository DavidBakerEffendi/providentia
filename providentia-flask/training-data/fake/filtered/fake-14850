I called to order and pay over the phone because I don't actually live in Little Falls.  I was buying food for my boyfriend who was studying at home, and was going to surprise him.  The girl who took my order over the phone was soooooo sweet, helpful, and just extremely pleasant to talk to.  She even listened to my requests and left him a cute note with the food :).  I wish I would have asked for her name. He got the food and said it was amazing and that it was "steaming" so I'm sure it was super fresh (chicken marsala) for it to stay that hot even after delivery.  The delivery man even stayed in front of the house extra because he wasn't home initially.   Overall, very nice people! Will be coming here again for business for sure.  They made me feel so comfortable!
