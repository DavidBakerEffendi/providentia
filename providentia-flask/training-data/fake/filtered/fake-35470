Awful service, pricey drinks and mediocre food. All of which I can deal with and normally would not get me to write a review. However about an hour later I felt really sick and that was the last straw. The bad reviews for this place do not lie. It was empty when I got there for a reason, but I took a chance cause I wanted some Gastropub food. Too bad it stood with me for 12 hours. Lots of choices in Hells Kitchen take this one off your list.
