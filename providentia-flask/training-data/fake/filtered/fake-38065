I usually stop at raindrop next door to where i work, and in fact i dont have to even leave the buildning i just go through one door to the next and their salads and raps are so delicious and they really fill you up. I usually go to lunch at 11:30am and by the time i get finished eating their salads its like im stuffed for the rest of the afternoon. Also they have great customer service and very nice personalities, they really put customers first and its a pretty neat environment. I really love going there and i really dont see anywhere where they need improvement at the particular store. They are really and A+:D
