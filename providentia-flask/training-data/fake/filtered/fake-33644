First up, if you have a party of more than 13, this is not the place to be. First the wait times easily will Be more than 2 hours, they will not be able to give you one table for everyone to sit together. You will have to sit in two groups, which to me defeats the whole purpose of dining out with your friends or family. The manager we saw was totally inconsiderate to whatever genuine concerns you might have. They think that because their food is good, patrons will put up whatever nonsense management has to offer. One more thing, if you ask for a table for a group of let's say 15, they will not only give you two tables, they will not seat you until you have all 15 people they can see. In other words, if you have 13 people in house and 2 people are outside looking for parking, they will not seat you until they can see all 15 people.  This is also a problem because now the front is unnecessarily overcrowded.  I have not seen more bureaucracy in any restaurant, no matter how good the restaurant it is.  In short, if you have lot of time on your hands and have a small group, this place is fine. Don't even consider for big groups...
