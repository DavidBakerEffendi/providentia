The Brickhouse does neighborhood bar right.  The bartenders are friendly as are the regulars who drink here.  Most of the time I'm there Steve is bartending.  He's an attentive, friendly guy who is working hard all the time.  The beer selection is good for a place that is not trying to be a beer bar.  I'm particularly happy to find Snake Dog IPA on tap.   As others have noted there are plenty of TVs which is good if you want to watch a game and perhaps a bit distracting if you just want to talk with friends.  There are a couple of pool tables if you want to shoot some pool.  The deck allows for outdoor seating with a view of the parking lot.  Should you prefer to smoke and drink at the same time you have the option.  There is bar seating and a few tables and booths. by no means is this a big place. The food is limited with the kitchen and menu both being very small.  It seems to me the approach is to do a few menu items and to do them all very well.   I'm particularly impressed by the burgers they serve.  I'd put them side by side with a burger from Plan B, Goldburger, or Prime 16 any day.  They only make 3-4 different burgers, but the buns are excellent fresh bread, the beef is juicy, flavorful, and cooked correctly to whatever temperature you ask for, with fresh tasty toppings.  The wings are also done well. The place has a slight identity issue with Finn McCool signs hanging around.  The bathrooms aren't great but they aren't gross and have definite signs of regular cleaning.  The jukebox might come on loud enough to drown out your conversation, but I'm betting that if you said something it would be adjusted without hesitation.   Overall a very good bar.
