Hope Garage is a little gem in Brooklyn! Outside of it being located in a cool revamped garage (hence the name) the food and drinks are spectacular!! Â The staff is so sweet and recommended some really delicious items for us to try. The hand crafted cocktails and beers were my absolute favorite!! If you ever find your self walking around Willliamsburg, this is definitely a place to pop in and check out.
