Fresh food, good food...Very pleasant staff, just do patrons a favor and put specials on a menu, it's a huge recital, by the time waiter is done you have forgotten what he mentioned first, if you even understood what he recited at machine gun speed, in an accent...Worth the try if you happen to be in Astoria, with that being said not sure how the location and ambiance can reflect or excuse their prices.
