Nice atmosphere, good service, friendly staff. A definite favorite. Authentic home-cooked vegetarian dishes. Vegetable uttappa, thali, chana bhatura, etc., etc. among my personal favorites. The dishes are light, not heavy, and they are happy to adjust the spice level according to your preference (mild to hot). Highly recommend Samudra!
