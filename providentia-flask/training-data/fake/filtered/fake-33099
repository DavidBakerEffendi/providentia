This place has without a doubt the rudest, most obnoxious bartender I have ever encountered in three decades of going to bars and restaurants throughout the northeast. From the surfer-boy appearance to the steady under-his-breath comments about customers, I can't believe this guy still works here. I have been here twice: once two years ago on a business visit from New York, and once more recently, and the guy complained constantly about restaurant patrons being "alcoholics," "annoying," "pain in my ass," etc. etc. The food is decent, and the setting and location are great, but the bartender is the worst I have ever, ever seen.
