Whoa! The super long lines tell it all: good food at reasonable prices. [It was a lot of food for me and, sadly, I couldn't finish but half of it so next time we'll just order one and share.] The combo plate is the best. The white yogurt sauce is delicious and the red sauce is mighty spicy but very good too. Eating in the street outside a skyscraper on 6th St., along with tons of other people holding the same aluminum container as you, added to the whole experience. Mmmmm!!!!
