My employer always raves about this place, and he finally took me here for a business dinner.We arrived late for our reservation, but we were still greeted warmly and seated immediately. Our server was very prompt and knowledgeable of the menu and specials. I started with the beet salad, while my companion had the lemongrass soup, both delicious. For entrees, we had the salmon and the nightly special, veal wienerschintzel. Â Both were very tasty, prepared and seasoned perfectly All in all, ambiance was excellent, service was great, food very good. The only reason I am not giving five stars is because I think the menu could or should have some more options or edge. Would return or recommend for a lovely dining experience.
