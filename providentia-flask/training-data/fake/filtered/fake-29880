Excellent Thai food. Its more fast food Thai than authentic that I've found in big cities. Very reasonable lunch special. Always get "spicey" shrimp soup, rice and entree. Lemon grass beef/chickn yummy and chashew chkn good. Their eggroll sauce is to die for. Also love the spicey oil they put in soup..dont enhale or feel the burn. They are much for service. Just hustle u in and out , but thats fine for when I want a fast lunch/work day.
