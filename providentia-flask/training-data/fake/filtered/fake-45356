I visited SoCo on 7/14/2012 for a birthday celebration for my brother along with 8 others. The wait time was Â RIDICULES, almost 2 hours and the gentleman at door the door was NOT friendly at all might I add. His attitude was the WORST!!! Yes, we did you a reservation however since two people (the guess of honor & the person bringing him) wasn't there at the reserved time we could not be seated and our table was giving away. I was told there's ONLY 1 table for large groups. NO ONE apologized or tried to accommodate in anyway. The food was great and so was our waitress (Tank). I would not go back...
