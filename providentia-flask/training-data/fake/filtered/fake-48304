That was one of the worst cheese steaks I've ever had, and I've had many.  Filled with fat and gristle. First bite pulled half the meat out of the bread because so much gristle it wouldn't pull apart.  When I showed the staff all the fat they said "that's how we make em.  Don't like it? Write an email to the owner." Obviously they hear complaints a lot.
