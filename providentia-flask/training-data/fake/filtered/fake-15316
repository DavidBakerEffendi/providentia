My girlfriend and I had a pretty good time at Cafe Ghia. We got the tempeh reuben, the pulled pork sandwich, and split a cup of soup. The soup had great depth of flavor, and we both enjoyed our mains. The pulled pork was tender but nothing special, and the sauce was a bit heavy on sugar and light on vinegar, but that's the way most barbecue sauces go I suppose. Their coleslaw was exceptionally flavorful, and the bread in my girlfriend's reuben was terrific, but the soup and these other parts of the meal were not enough to really put the meal on the whole onto a higher plane of quality. The service was friendly and the ambience was nice (quiet and dim giving a sense of intimacy and relaxation while also playing a relatively eclectic selection of music that didn't interfere with conversation), and as I mentioned, some aspects of the food were even better than good, but at $12 for a sandwich or burger and upwards for a proper dinner entree, I just couldn't justify the cost. I did enjoy it enough that if I made more money I could easily imagine wanting to come back. As it is I'm in no rush.
