Ordered "Jumbo Shrimps with Asparagus", only 4 shrimps, far not jumbo, costs 14.50 - are you kidding me??? Asparagus was not so good either. Tried my wife's order of Pad Thai, not the worst I tried, but far not the best either. Service was good, place is clean and cozy. Just was not excited about the food at all, specially at that kind of price.
