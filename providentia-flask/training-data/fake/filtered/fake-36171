All of the food was excellent. Service was good enough, ambiance somewhat less so. If you are about the food, try this place - but make a reservation. Â The fried calamari was light and crunchy, not overcooked. Eggplant rollatine was very good, and the arancini (rice balls) - OMG you have to try them. The standard side salad was nothing special, Penne Vodka was OK, Veal Sorentino was pretty good. They also has a pork chop with peppers and such, we had it with hot peppers (they were happy to accomodate) and it was excellent. Servings are generous but not overwhelming, so you can get a salad and entree with a side of pasta. The waiters try to be attentive but are sometimes overwhelmed when it is busy (as it was on a recent Friday night), and the ambiance is 'crowded room', but don't let that sway your decision much. Kids are welcome and accommodated well. 5 stars because for me, it is about the food, and this was really good.
