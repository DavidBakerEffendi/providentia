So I ordered a salad for takeout lunch and was I ever disappointed. The salad cost $7.99 and it was a handful of leafy lettuce with two slices of tomatoe. It had four thin half slices of red onion and that was it.  I was like really this cost $7.99.  I was so shocked I actually showed everyone in the office. I wish I took a picture to post. Anyway, I wont visit this place again.
