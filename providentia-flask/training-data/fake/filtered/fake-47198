My wife and I went with some friends of ours and for the most part, enjoyed it. We were given the option of sitting outdoors in the courtyard, but the day we went it was a bit muggy out, so we decided on indoors.The ambiance was pretty nice, good mix of music, had some nice middle-eastern inlaid wood tables and beeded chandeliers. The service can use some work, I'd give that 3 stars. We were seated right away (on a Thursday night, not sure if I'd expect that on a weekend). Our waiter came by and took our drink order and brought them right away. She swung by 5 min later to ask if we were ready to order, but we asked for just another minute...bad choice. 20 min went by before she returned and at that point we had eaten all of our mixed pickles and pita. When she did return, our waiter didn't seem she knew the menu too well, she had a difficult time answering our questions. If it wasn't for great company and us eating dinner at a regular time that night and not being too hungry, we would have probably asked for the managers. For an appetizer we ordered the sampler and some cheese filo rolls. It was outstanding, possibly the best part of the meal. (I could've ordered another sampler for dinner). For dinner, I had the Shrimp tripoli-$17 (Jumbo shrimp in a spicy pepperoncinni sauce) served over rice. My husband had the filet mignon kebob - $19 (filet tips grilled and served with basmati) . Nancy and Jack had the swordfish kebob $19 and Lamb special $18 . All were delicious and great portions. **If you're ordering a special, expect a very large portion! Jack had leftovers... I'd give the food 5 stars. It's as authentic as can be. If service improved, this would be our regular weekend choice.. but we'll be back to see. If not for dinner, possibly for take out or catering.
