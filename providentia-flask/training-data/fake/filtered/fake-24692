It's great to have another falafel joint in lower SoHo. I always found the service at Hoomoos Asli really rude, so much so that I swore not to go back. So it's great to have a place to satisfy my falafel fix when I can't get to Azuri Cafe uptown. The falafel was good, a little messy, but good. I tried the zataar bread everyone talks about, it was good, but probably not something I'll get again. Welcome to the neighborhood!
