The food is really amazing as is the service and it feels like a "secret spot" being located in the basement of an office building.  If you want sushi, this probably isn't the place for you, but if you want actual Japanese cuisine, you will really love this place.  Be careful though, if you are hungry, you'll want to come early, or come late.  It's busy busy during peak dinner hours.
