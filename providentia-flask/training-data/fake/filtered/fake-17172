This place is great, I don't think I've ever had the steaks because I love the pulled BBQ pork and the ribs so much, the loaded baked potatoes with a lightly salted skin and the house salad with a variety of all house made dressings are excellent. The buns are great and they have a special mon-thur if you order or do take out before 6pm they have more than 10 of the meals half price!  I work in New Haven so I can call in the order with extra buns, loaded potato and all the condiments for 2 people for less than $25. This way I can eat at home in peace after a long day at work.  Also a great place to bring the kids, my son still can't get over it being ok to throw the peanut shells on the floor.
