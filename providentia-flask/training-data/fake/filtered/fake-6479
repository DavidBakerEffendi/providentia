Went to 501 for the first time not knowing anything about the place. We arrived on a Wed at about 2 pm for a late lunch. The place had very basic chairs and tables and was small. A middle aged Vietnamese man quickly sat us down at one of the few remaining tables. What you have? he asks my wife. My wife asked to see a menu. "No menu, we have beef soup small,medium,or large-You do not need menu." I looked at her and laughed and asked her if she wanted to go elsewhere as we were both starving. We decided to stay and ordered 2 mediums. We ate the soup and were amazed at how good it was. This place as limited as the menu is as limited as the size is and as limited as the customer service is will now be on our must have list. We have been back several times and the experience has been the same. You do not leave hungry instead you leave full and happy. I could not give the place 5 stars because of the few negatives I already mentioned. You will not taste a better soup anywhere in the world.
