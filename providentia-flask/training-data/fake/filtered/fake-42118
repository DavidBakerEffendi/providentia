My FAVORITE authentic Italian pizza place outside Italy! This is not NY Italian American pizza, this is what you will most likely get in Italy. I love the Italian music videos that play on the screen when calcio isn't on. PLEASE move up to my neighborhood. Frederick Douglass Blvd between W110 and W120 st. The newbies (the thousands of upper middle class young people who bought condos up here) in the hood are desperate for restaurants and delivery options, especially PIZZA! Â Per favore!
