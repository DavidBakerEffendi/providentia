This is an excellent place to take your kids to! I took my little diva to an outdoor back to school event here and she had so much fun! We even went inside for a dance party they were holding for the kids. They had a DJ and all the kids and parents were having a great time dancing. This place really is great for a variety of reasons: eco-friendly, kid-friendly, outdoor market in the summer, great food and great atmosphere.
