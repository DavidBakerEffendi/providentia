Did you know that Roberta's caters? They do, and it is fantastic. Roberta's and their catering staff worked hard to make sure our wedding meal was memorable and delicious. They have a team of dedicated planners who made sure we had thought of everything - because we sure hadn't. We really would have been sunk without the help of A. and T. who worked with us on everything, set it all up, and then packed it all away at the end of the night. On top of all the logistical support, we had selected a great menu of antipasti, salads, and of course pizza. Nothing but good things to say. 5 stars, would do this wedding again.
