Amazing. Period. As a vegetarian, I'm always afraid there won't be that many options. Even though this place has a rather limited menu, every vegetarian dish was delicious and flavorful. Had: eggplant baby artichokes radishes olives monte cabra cheese Everything was fresh and wonderful. Having the wine store inside is also a major plus! Can't wait to go back.
