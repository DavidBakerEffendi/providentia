Every time I go here the service sucks!! I have never had a good experience. The first time I went was for happy hour and the server didn't show up to our table for a little over 5 minutes. Finally we ordered an app and he didn't come back to our table until we were finished with the app. The next time was a bit better but service was still slow. Finally, the last straw was tonight when my friends and I were forced out before it was even 1 AM. So annoyed with this place.
