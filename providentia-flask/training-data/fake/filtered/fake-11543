Truly a rare find in Bergen County, NJ. Asian Grill in East Rutherford offers friendly and attentive service while preparing mouth watering meals. Whether it's sushi or exotic Chinese meals they have never dissapointed. My wife and I eat here every week. Our friends travel from NYC and Westchester County because the food and service is awesome! To illustrate the type of people who work here, my wife came down with a serious illness. Our friends called Shu at the Asian Grill and had dinner sent in 3 nights. Fiona new exactly what we liked and recommended 3 different meals for us. On top of that the folks at Asian Grill sent a tremendous Flower arrangement which help cheer my wife up during a very trying period of her life. Those that write negative reviews of Asian Grill it is my sincere opinion that you shouldn't stop taking your meds just yet...the guys in white coats prescribed them for a reason! We love the Asian Grill and will continue to eat there every week.
