I live directly down the block but only ate here about 4 times. The wraps are sooo delicious. Chinatown, chris' special, and lets not forget the delicious barbeque sauce they have. Its fruity and tangy, to die for. I would say i wish it wasnt as overpriced as it is, but that doesnt stop me. Awesome place!
