We read the reviews before visiting and we were not disappointed. We received a very warm welcome by all staff, our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and the specials of the day. Our food was served quickly and all 3 courses were delicious. We found it to be great value for money, $140 for 2 for 3 courses with cocktails to start and coffee to finish. Would definitely recommend this place and return.
