I really wanted to love Han Dynasty. Everyone else does! So here's what I liked: - our server was my best friend by the end of the night. She was awesome. I laid down the facts as soon as we sat down (I love spicy food but I can't handle it...) and she did everything in her power to accommodate me. - Dan Dan noodles are great, and maybe even better the next day. We requested them a degree or 5 milder than how they are typically prepared. What I didn't like: - we requested the other two dishes to be fairly mild, the same degree of heat as the noodles (I think a 3 on a scale from tame to ridiculous) but... I couldn't eat them. I know what you are thinking: "go big or go home". I tried! I really did. But it was way hotter than we'd requested. My mouth was numb for over an hour after we left. Our server was really concerned because I was not eating my food, but she told us she can't control how the cooks prepare the food... Â She can only pass on our request. It may not be honored. Lame! - cork fee, way too high. Come on. I'm not sure I would go back. If you love really hot food, go for it. But if to are a sensitive type like me, you might want to give it a pass. It was probably the most uncomfortable meal I've ever had and I left hungry. No good.
