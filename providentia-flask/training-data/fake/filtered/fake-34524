Simply put, there is no better pizza. OK, New York pizza fans SHUT UP and you Chicago folks? Don't make me laugh! There is no such thing as pizza in Chicago. Granted, I may be partial to this place because I grew up around the corner, but I have turned on at least 20-30 people to this pizza and the concensus is unanimus. Forget that it's in a semi-rough neighborhood, or that the decor dates from about 1975. They have perfected the art of pizza. Super-thin crust that is slighly chewy except for the crust, which is crisp. Beautifully savory tomato sauce and equally good cheese. Also the perfect amount of 'grease'. Â  These are standard 16" pies, but you can easily eat a whole one yourself because they're so thin. My record is 2 pies (I'm not proud). Being a purist, I normally don't bother with toppings but the onion is superb. I would advise you to check it out if you're in the area, but it's actually worthy of 'destination restaurant' status. I now live an hour away and still pay a visit when I can. Go there! Eat the pizza! You're welcome in advance.
