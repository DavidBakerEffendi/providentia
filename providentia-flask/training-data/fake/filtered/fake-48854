I used to live right around the corner and developed the bad habit of stopping there for take out 2-3 times a week...BUT it is all so very very good! I've had many things on the menu, Jerk Chicken, Garlic Shrimp, Macaroni and Cheese, a simple salad...like I said I tried many things and everything is the BEST! There is often a line out the door and if you eat in it's a small little loft dining space that's charming and cozy! Â I moved to Washington Heights in Manhattan so I don't get there very often any more...BUT I was there on Friday for the first time in about a year and the two great ladies who own and run the place still remembered me! The food is great and the company is just as great! Now if only I can get some of their wonderful receipes! My favorite place to recommend and take my friends!
