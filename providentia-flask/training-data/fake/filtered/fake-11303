You are not a real New Yorker until you eat off the street.  This is pretty much the r best halal to get in the city.  The lines are so long they have "do it yourself" sauce which is great bc you can get what and how much you want.  In addition to white sauce and hot sauce the have BBQ sauce as well.  The portions are huge -- one is good for two to split.  Must go.
