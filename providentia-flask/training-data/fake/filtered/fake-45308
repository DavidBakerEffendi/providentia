The prosciutto on the flatbread was way too salty.  They don't even have a fig, prosciutto and arugula flatbread or pizza---a classic italian pie.  When I asked for that, the server said they only have dried figs.  They have fig jam and fig "infused" balsamic dressing, but no fresh figs!  The prosciutto arancini had hardly any prosciutto and it was very bland.  The sauce that came with it tasted like canned sauce you could buy at the grocery store.  Rizzuto's has a generic menu.  The high-end decor is deceiving.   The acoustics are horrible. If you do end up dining at Rizzuto's and you find yourself with a table full of less than savory left overs, don't bother taking them home--you'll regret it.
