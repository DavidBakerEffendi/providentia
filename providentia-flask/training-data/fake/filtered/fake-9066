After everything else (except WAWA) has closed, and you still have more night left, there is only HH.  You must go, and you must get a whole #16 with hot peppers, and you must eat half before you leave your parking space.  You can eat the rest with your friends when you get back to where you were.  It is not safe to drive and smell a cheese steak unless you have consumed half before you put the car in gear--trust me.
