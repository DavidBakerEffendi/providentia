The food is consistently good. They serve basic Mexican fare--nothing fancy and the staff is outstanding. Sangria and chips with hot and mild salsa make for a relaxing evening. You can bring your kids there and it is even good for date night too. The place is always bustling so no one seems to take notice if it is a romantic night for two or a night with tired kids after school. They have a pretty nice bar area and they also serve food outdoors on warm evenings.
