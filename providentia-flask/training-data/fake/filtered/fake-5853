I have been to this restaurant more than any other place in NYC, and I've been living in the area for 28 years. The calamari is TO DIE FOR, the service-friendly, their spaghetti is the best I have ever had, every.single.time. You'll want an app, dinner and save room for dessert!!!! I love this place, its really romantic, or a good time for friends to meet. The location on Washington and Christopher is nice if you like to check-out the Hudson, or some of the cool local shops. I could literally write a book about how much I effin love Malatesta, but do yourself a favor and give it a try! Ridiculously good prices for ridiculously good food!!
