Always hunting for a good Thai restaurant I was excited to try Rhong-Tiam. The ambiance is peaceful and clean. Our dinner was excellent. We has the Thai salad ( the peanut sauce dressing was delicious) and Satay Tofu. Both were very tasty appetizers. For dinner we had the chicken pad-Thai noodles which was also very delicious. I can't wait to go back. I highly recommend Rhong-Tiam
