This place is always packed for brunch. And with good reason their French Toast. Take thick slices of buttery, flaky brioche, dip it in a rich, creamy vanilla flecked crème brûlèe batter, throw it on the griddle and top it with pure Vermont maple syrup... and you're starting your day right with moist, luscious indulgence .
