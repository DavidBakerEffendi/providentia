I went there recently for my friend's birthday. We ordered a bunch of different items off the menu and shared. The Mac and cheese was a big hit- it has crunchy shoe string Onion rings on top. We all also thought the burger was delicious! To start, I really enjoyed the arugula salad. Prices are extremely reasonable, staff was very attentive and food was great. The dj came as we were finishing dinner so we stayed ton dance and have drinks. Great vibe for a neighborhood place! I will definitely go back and recommend to my friends!
