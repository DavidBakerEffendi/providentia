Skip it! If you want to be pushed back at the door because you came too far into the restaurant (that's the extent of the greeting ;( ) Then after waiting, you get told to go upstairs...Hot as hell up there, no one to "greet you" and then told to sit in the middle of the table that was so close to the other diners that you'd think you were breaking up a party...asking for a better table is answered by scowls both upstairs and down..Go to the REAL original grimaldis a few doors down and get a friendly, comfortable, and air conditioned restaurant with great atmosphere and great pizza! I'm from NY and I know when a name in a guidebook outlasts quality.
