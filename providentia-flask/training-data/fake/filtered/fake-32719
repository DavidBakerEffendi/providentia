I love their paninis, but it's their roasted carrots, feta cheese and black olive oil that won me over! I recently looked at their menu and was surprised to see that it wasn't there anymore? I hope they'll bring it back, because it was amazing!! I'll still be going here no matter what because their food is top quality, delicious and their customer service is wonderful!
