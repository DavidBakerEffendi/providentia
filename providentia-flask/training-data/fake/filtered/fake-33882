Let me start off by saying that, as a rule, I don't give anyone 5 stars. For anything. Ever. Anywhere. I don't believe in "perfect," but if there is such a thing Pamir Kabob is a textbook example. This place is amazing! I got the Bulanee Kachaloo, Kabuli Palaw, and Baklava. The Bulanee was crispy and well seasoned without being soggy or greasy at all. The Kabuli Palaw was somehow even better! The lamb chucks were tender and well-seasoned, and they gave me quite a few of them. The rice with carrots, raisins and nuts was in all seriousness one of the most flavorful and well cooked rice dishes I've ever eaten. The cooked spinach was literally perfect, and reminded me of my own grandmother's. I could go on and on about how good this place is, and how it's going to become a weekly stop for my lunch breaks, but why would you sit here reading about their food when you could go get some of your own? You won't be disappointed. My only complaint is that I didn't start coming here the day they opened.
