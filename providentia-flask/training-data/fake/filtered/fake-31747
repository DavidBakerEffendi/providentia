An Indian restaurant that is racist against Indians !! They always tend to seat Indian people in the side area or back room. Not sure if that is there marketing strategy or simple stupidness. This valentines when an Indian couple was waiting there for Â 30 minutes .. one of the waiters gave a white couple a free pass who were behind and on questioning acted rude and arrogant with the sweet Indian couple who finally decided to leave. Me being human have decided to not go to this place anymore and anyone who is not a racist and is against racism should not go to this place or atleast Spice Grill should realize there mistake and treat everyone equally!
