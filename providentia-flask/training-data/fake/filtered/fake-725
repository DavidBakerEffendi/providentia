Pats give Philly a bad image. So does Ginos. Ok let me put it this way: do you want THEIR cheesesteaks to be THE defining food coming out of the city of brotherly love? I mean let's be serious here...Would you: 1. Get a pork sandwich with broccoli rob from Dinicks 2. That sloppy mess of a sandwich from Pats And its expensive for what you get?
