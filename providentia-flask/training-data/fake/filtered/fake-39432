Always have a blast at Aksum Aksum corkage fee is less than all the parking tickets I got trying to dine downtown ........to make ice you need electricity. Wine glasses are not cheap specially Aksum wine glasses. Â all that = corkage fee When it comes to food, a wise man once said "good things no cheap, cheap things no good"
