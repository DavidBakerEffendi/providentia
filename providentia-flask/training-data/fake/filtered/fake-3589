Solid performer with great food, great staff and a wine list for even the most picky wine lovers.  As a neighborhood local I try to eat here a few times per month.  Not great for kids or families with toddlers as the tables are close to each other and stroller access is tight (except during summer months when the outside garden is open!).   Do come with a date and time is abundant.  Don't come if you are starving and need to eat quickly.  Expect a line and a small wait but enjoy the cocktails and/or wine list at the bar.
