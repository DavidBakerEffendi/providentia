Awesome foods and awesome dudes! Two thumbs up! The Reuben is damn near perfect! But don't sleep on the Southwest Mac! Killer tots if you're into that! And I don't mean they'll kill you! I mean they're crispy and tasty! I've never had anything here I didn't enjoy! They deliver late! The whole place looks like you're inside a piece of cheese! What's not to love! And to those people complaining about a greasy grilled cheese.. Seriously? Grilled cheese is greasy. What did you think you were getting yourself into? Go get a panini if you want a dry sandwich.
