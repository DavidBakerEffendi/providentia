First off, wow. Just WOW. I was blown away by the atmosphere of the restaurant and the quality of service that I was given. Alison, the bartender, went above and beyond to make sure my first time here was memorable. I had a 3 course meal that consisted of the Beet Salad, the Mushroom Tempura, & the Prince Edward Island Mussels. Every single course was just as exquisite as the last. I also enjoyed a cocktail titled The Pear Sidecar which "peared" well with every bite. Overall, I would recommend this place to anyone and everyone, and I am looking forward to trying everything on both the food and drink menu.
