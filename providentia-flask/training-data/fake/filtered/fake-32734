I had the butternut squash and pomegranate salad which had such wonderful flavors.  My husband kept oohing and awing over his beet salad.  The salmon and pasta dishes were great.  My glass of wine was not good, so I told the waiter, he immediately took it back, told me he had tasted it and it was a bad bottle and brought me the cabernet that my husband had ordered.  Such wonderful service.
