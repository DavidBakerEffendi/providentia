Had a reservation- did not get seated until 40 minutes after our reservation time- which did not bother us as it was girls night out so we sat at the bar downstairs having cocktails before we sat at our table.... be careful of the bartenders as they tried to say we finished out bottle of wine prior to going upstairs to have dinner when in reality we only had 2 small glasses out of it. Problem was solved 30 minutes later when they finally found our bottle of wine after us complaining and telling them that we did indeed have almost a full bottle left- the manager anded up opening a new bottle and not charging us for it which was the appropriate and nice thing to do. Dinner was not good. Presentation I guess was nice but the food itself did not have a good taste. Â Portions were small and expensive. If you want a good Italian restaurant in the city do not go here. Dessert was AMAZING- we got the chocolate doughnut dessert- only good thing we had at dinner. We left hungry and ended up getting Pizza after we ate and spent close to 100 bucks each.
