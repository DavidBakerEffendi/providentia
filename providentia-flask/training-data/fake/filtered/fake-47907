You gotta be kidding...true a large amount on the chicken grinder, but the cutlets are like thin sliced cold cuts, thickly covered with bread crumbs. Basically a bread crumb grinder wih a hint of chicken. Totally less chicken than in years past when they built their reputation. So this time I opted for baked sausage & pepper parm. Well, 1 small 6" pc of sausage buried in mozzerella. Ironic how sausage is cheaper than the cheese yet there was very little meat compared to the cheese. All this for almost $7 with tax. No side of bread either....very dissappointing!
