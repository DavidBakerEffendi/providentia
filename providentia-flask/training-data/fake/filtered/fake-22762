It's fantastic.  Honest and real. But I'm here to address Kedar.  Hey, pal, check this:  Chinese cuisine does not differentiate 'vegetable' and 'meat' dishes the way your Western vegan team does.  Almost all vegetable preparations from Hunan, Szechuan, Jiangsu and Shandong cuisines involve meat components to impart flavour.   I'm sorry the world doesn't revolve around you.  Meanwhile, a little less egocentricity when salting on someone's food will probably serve you--or at least the rest of us--well in the future.
