Last night we visited MP Taverna for a post managers meeting dinner. I called in the morning for a 7PM reservation. Although they could not secure our table for 7PM, the hostess (Elizabeth, I think....) quickly suggested a 6:30PM reservation. We showed a few minutes early and were seated immediately. The food, from entrees to desserts was delicious. Above all, the service is unmatched. By far the best service in the area! The staff was competent and mostly very pretty. I work for a company that prides itself in "memorable service". MP Taverna, you have a believer! A must visit place!
