We live down the street and strolled into this restaurant randomly the week it opened. The food is amazing. The staff is friendly and will hang out and take a sip of your BYOB wine with you and go out of the way to accomodate. My boyfriend and I did their 9-course Valentine's day dinner and we had the place to ourselves. My favorite restaurant for dinner in Williamsburg.
