Wonderful little establishment. We stumbled upon Dos Toros Taqueria last night on our way from a show to another bar. Each of us got soft tacos that we LOVED. Staff is so friendly and will let you try just about anything. Be wary of their hot sauce, it is kicked up like 100 notches. All together fun little place with great food, ambiance and awesome staff.
