The first time I walked into Molly's, I was charmed by its authentic Old World ambience, with the sawdust on the floor, the darkness, the wood paneling, the booths, the bar with the quiet TV. I was already happy when we sat down in a cozy booth and ordered some beers (a slightly boring selection--I had a Smithwick's). Then I got my hamburger--OMG it was so good. The beef was so tender, it almost melted in my mouth (I ordered it medium rare.) Â I put a bit of salt on it to make it even tastier. It was too big for me but I couldn't stop eating it! God it was good! The fries were dark and irregular and delicious. The salad was very fresh, with a simple and tasty vinaigrette, although the tomatoes were hard and flavorless. The service was efficient and friendly; as far as I could tell, everyone working there had an Irish accent. I've been there on Saturdays and Sundays. It is crowded but not annoyingly so. We have always gotten a booth with no problem. I love this place and will come back over and over.
