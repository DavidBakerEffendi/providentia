I was excited to see that another restaurant opened in place of Coaches sport's bar.  Upon arriving I was seated and drink orders were taken right away.  Here's where it goes south, appetizer order was placed along with entree, we knew what we wanted and b/c it was lunch time didn't want to waste any time (12:44p).  Well we sat... and then waited... no appetizer's came up, (1:15pm) no waitstaff came to check, until our glasses were empty.  We were told our meal would be right up, so we said fine we will have it to go, and so we waited some more, by this time it's now 1:30.  It wasn't a large order apps were fried pickles and entree, burger and fries, and grilled chicken sandwich.  Now it's 1:35 and waitstaff is bringing up orders of patrons who walked in 40 minutes after we did.  At this point this is the 3rd time wait staff has assured the meal would be up since 1:15 p.m.   Long story short we walked out, I have to say the water was good, but doesn't merit a 1 star.  Sorry I wouldn't go back, i wish I could have rated the food but just couldn't get beyond the poor service.
