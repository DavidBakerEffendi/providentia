Inexcusibly bad service. Only one guy does multitasking - waiter, cashier, packing for deliveries etc. I placed an order for catering. I came 30 mins past the time I was given to pickup the food. I waited an hour for my order to be ready. The order was finally ready, 1:30 hours after the time I told them I was going to pickup. Meanwhile the guests were waiting at my home...very embarrassing. The manager threw in an additional appetizer to bury the hatchet. I am not pleased. Food was not good either. That is another tale of woes. I was given stale food. None of the guests ate much. We threw away most of thd food. Very disappointing....
