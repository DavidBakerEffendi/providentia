To save time, I will paste the feedback I sent directly to Pacifico: I went to your club tonight with my dance partner, Vinny Mwano. He is an accomplished dancer (credits include Dancing with the Stars) and we were just looking for a place to salsa. He was turned away because-- to quote your bouncers-- he was wearing sneakers. However, the bouncer did offer to trade shoes for fifteen minutes, for fifteen minutes with me, the female partner. Moments after I refused this archaic, offensive, and bigoted request, a white gentleman was allowed in, wearing sneakers nearly identical to the ones Vinny was wearing. Your bouncers claim this was not an issue of race, however, had no other valid reason for turning away an accomplished performer and instructor. You will be losing our business, as well as the business of our staff of over 100 people who dine there regularly, and are personally offended by the unjust actions of your bouncers.
