We went there friends who recommended this place as they had enjoyed it before. The ambience was a good and the food tasted great from heavy Italian dishes to light salads.  Unlike many restaurants, they let you enjoy  your meal in peace. Personally, the calamari and cannoli were excellent. I highly recommend Mulberry Street!
