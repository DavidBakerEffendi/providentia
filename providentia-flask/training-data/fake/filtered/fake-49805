I went to this place after my horrible experience at Udu cafe. This was my boyfriend's second time in trying hotpot so I really hoped that this restaurant had good shabu shabu. As starters, you get to choose between couple of different shabu dishes. We choose prime-rib beef for our shabu. They give you your salad which is very good and crunchy. Then they give you the broth, the sauce and the vegetables. We had to ask for rice which was interesting because it says it is included in the meal. The meal itself was very good. Mind you this is Japanese shabu shabu so the broth is more plain then Chinese hotpot. The sauce they gave was pretty good and fitted with the vegetables and the meat. Even though the portion do look small at the beginning, its actually filling after you eat them through. Then after the hotpot they give you an ice cream and hot tea which is probably an oolong tea. Overall, I sat shabu-tatsu is a really yummy place to go to. We also tried sukiyaki there and that was also really good too. The price is a little pricey because you can easily spend 60$ there. If you want a really good Japanese shabu shabu place then this place is a good place to go.
