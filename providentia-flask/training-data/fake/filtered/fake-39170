Truly disappointed! Stunning decor but our server could not have been less interested. Literally had to chase her down just to pay the bill after a $150 worth of tasteless drinks and food. Would not recommend to anyone with so many other great choices in the Times Square area. Walk in, take a look at the decor and go somewhere else close by for quality service, drinks and a meal.
