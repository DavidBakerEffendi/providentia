Great menu!  You can't go wrong with any of their chicken dishes.  They are all fantastic.  Their salads and falafal are delicious as well.  It's a great find for the area as the food around here isn't the greatest.  I read an earlier review about the falafel price and you'll be happy to know that they have come down to a very reasonable $3 for it.  So they are adjusting as they go along.
