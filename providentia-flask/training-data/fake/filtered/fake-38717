Really enjoyed my dinner at this cool new HK spot!  Very nice atmosphere.  They did a an amazing job decorating this place.  Absolutely delicious homemade bread and butter.  The wood oven gives a really unique flavor to the food.  This was definitely among the best burgers I've had in awhile.  Great quality meat (much of the menu appears to be locally sourced), homemade bun, unique woody flavor from the oven.  Delish.  Definitely want to try the chicken or the duck next time I come.  The people next to me ordered dessert and it looked amazing but I was in a rush.  Also, the staff was so attentive and lovely.   Great addition to the neighborhood and they're open till 4AM!
