First off I want to say that I was really impressed with how accommodating the staff was, even though previous reviewers weren't happy with that. I called on Saturday afternoon to change the size and time of my reservation and they happily fit us in. When we arrived, the table was ready to go and we sat immediately even though we were still missing half of the party. Throughout the night, the servers were attentive and really friendly. As for food and drinks, both were delicious. I tried the sangria and the smoky jalapeno margarita. The margarita really was SMOKY so I had to take my time but it was delicious and unique. I also got an amazing fish entrée that everyone at my table wanted to try. It was fresh and cooked to perfection. The only reason why I am giving this place 4 stars is because of the price.  It is slightly overpriced and while I'd love to make this a regular hangout, I wouldn't be able to afford it. I do want to come back for happy hour though!
