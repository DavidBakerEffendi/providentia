Great service from our waitress. However quality of the food and menu were not what we expected. Anytime we are in south jersey, we eat at the Atlantic city location. This experience was nothing like it. The only thing these  restaurants have in common are the name and the large statue. We'd had the edamame ravioli in AC, where's they were delicious, flavorful and melted in your mouth. Our kids went thru 3 orders. In Phili, we couldn't get our kids to eat them, tasted like soy sauce on an gritty filled piece of raw dough. The noodle selections were weak with just Pad Thai and Lo Mein.  We went with the Pad Thai which was just a funky sweet and sour sauce with as much onion as chicken or noodle. While they removed them from the bill, the experience and anticipation had been crushed. At this price range It's about the quality and consistency of the food. Wouldn't go back here if it was free.
