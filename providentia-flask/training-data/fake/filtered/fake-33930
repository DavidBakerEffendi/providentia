I work in advertising and frequent some of the best restaurants in NYC and throughout the world. I was recently looking for a restaurant in Princeton for a business meeting and found Mistral by chance. All I can say is that this place is incredible. I love Tapas to begin with, but the truly innovative, fresh and complex dishes and flavors makes this place a standout among standouts. I loved it!
