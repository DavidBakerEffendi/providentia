Great open space, great tunes, great regulars, great range of customers, great food, great staff, and great beer (served via very well cared for lines). This place has a constantly changing selection of microbrews from across the country selected (is "curated" too strong a word here?) by a true beer guru; forget about Brooklyn Lager - if you're going to the DW prepare to try something new and delicious. Yes, you may have to read a bit - but glancing through the menu - complete with witty remarks and enthusiasm - will only take a second compared to the countless hours it must take to research and find these beers. And if you can't decide (you won't be able to decide) the bartenders are always happy to serve you a taste. Yes - I'm a big fan of this place - and while you might hear me through the beautifully built panel windows discussing a novel you find obscure - I'm actually not a yuppie hipster transplant, or whatever you call it - I'm FROM Windsor Terrace. So when I say FINALLY A PLACE TO DRINK you know that means something.
