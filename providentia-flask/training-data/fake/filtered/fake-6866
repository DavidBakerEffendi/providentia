My experience here was pretty awful! It took me forever to find metered parking outside. I was placed at a booth and given a menu. The menu was extremely unhealthy with limited options. I gave the server my drink order and she came back 10 mins later and said they didn't have it and would I like something else. I gave her a 2nd order and she promptly returned and said they were out of that also. Then I asked her to give me a recommendation and she came back with a foul tequila cocktail. It took another 15 mins before I got a chance to place my food order. I ordered the soup and the cowboy steak. It took another 20 mins before the soup came out by which time a group of 20 Yale kids came in and took over the place. I had run out if time and I could not wait around any longer for my steak as I definitely was a 2nd class citizen to the new patrons/regulars. No atmosphere, bad service, crap menu and very unorganized. Plenty of other better restaurants in the downtown area
