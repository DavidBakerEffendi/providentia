An absolute gem in a great neighborhood - Spring Glen. There is SO much going for this place - welcoming and caring owners Harry and Larry (both Hamden locals), Â a revamped kitchen/menu from Tom and Jason Sobocinski of Caseus (a real fave!) and a new executive chef Tom Schultz who is passionate about what he does and his customers. The staff is also great - Jeff, Christina and Pete behind the bar in particular. Options include the cozy tavern side, a beautiful outdoor patio and a more formal dining room (I am not a fan of it but for those with bigger parties who don't want to be near the bar it might be okay). The food is pretty much without fail - devlied egg appetizer with pork belly (yum!), fried oysters with great sauces, carpaccio and always great seasonal specials. Favorite entrees include the Pressed Chicken (crazy good!!) - crispy with unbelievable flavor and mashed potatoes. The Seared Tuna I had came with an interesting spicy pear "base" and grilled bok choy - fantastic. They have specials on Sunday (1/2 price wines from a very respectable list), Monday is the night to go for a burger and beer - lots of topping choices and beer flights too! SO nice to have a spot like this to go back to again and again. Bravo to the whole team, I'm a big fan.
