Wow! All the poor reviews.  My bf told me about this little cheese, beer, and wine spot that he stopped in a couple of times before I went there.  Initially, I was intimidated by the atmosphere and the lists of wines and cheeses but quickly got comfortable.  Each time we are there, our servers were knowledgeable and patient.  (I had no clue which cheese should accompany which wine or beer).  The restaurant is for those who want to experience funkier cheeses .  I would not recommend anyone to try to have a whole meal there because it is more of an "upper crust" appetizer spot.  One can experience a bit of the hoity toity foods without paying too much and without a bunch of snobs surrounding you.  I will return several times and recommend it to others.
