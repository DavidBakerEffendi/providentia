What a great spot!   Fantastic oysters & food (get the salmon toasty thing), beautiful cocktails (get the Bimini Twist and pretend you're floating off to sea), and sweet & classy crowd. How many places do other patrons offer to move down a stool for you?  And Reynold & Carlos are just the perfect hosts. These guys are hospitality pros & you can tell that they take pride in what they do (rightfully so).  This place is gonna be a summer staple for me.  Far cheaper than trying to go to the Hamptons!
