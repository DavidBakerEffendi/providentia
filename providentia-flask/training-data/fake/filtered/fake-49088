We came here and we were not sure what to expect. The reviews were excellent, but we were skeptical. We were pulled in by the reasonable prices and the BYOB. So I went around the finer to get a nice red wine and we ordered, the calamari was awesome! Truly great. The derive was amazing. The corn soup was deadly. Too creamy for me, but excellent. The udon noodle dish was unique and very tasty. And the braised short rib meal was simply wonderful with a side of white rice. I got the props from my wife! She said, "You chose well honey." That just topped the night.
