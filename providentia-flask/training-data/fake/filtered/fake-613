Hands down THE BEST ITALIAN FOOD IN BUCKS COUNTY! My husband and I are BOTH Italian American and i am an avid chef and baker. Used to do it for a living for many years. I KNOW GOOD, TRUE ITALIAN FOOD! And this place has it, in spades!! A true cut above the rest!! The REAL DEAL! Owner/Chef Jerry and his professional, friendly, attentive and capable staff always make us feel welcome, and we always leave feeling very satisfied. Great food. Tasty, unusual specials on the menu each and every week! The MOST IMPORTANT compliment that i can give Non Solo is that they are CONSISTENT! Food and Service are top notch every visit! Do yourself a favor and go to Non Solo Pasta the next time that you are craving REAL, FLAVORFUL Italian food!! You will be hooked!
