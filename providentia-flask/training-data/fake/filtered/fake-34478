I have had the pleasure of stopping at this diner for the past 10 years and it's just as good as ever.  the food doesn't come out of a can and onto your plate it's done from scratch with an exciting menu.  the classic diner rocks as the real thing is hard to find these days.  Staff is always friendly and food is plentiful.  I recommend the house favorite corn choder soup and you can never go wrong with the special.  Definitely worth a stop in!
