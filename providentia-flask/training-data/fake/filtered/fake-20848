My favorite bar in the greater Hartford area.  Amazing and friendly staff, huge list of imported beers, super tasty food, and a chill/relaxed/diverse crowd .  Go for Boozeday Tuesday trivia, weekend brunch, or $2 Irish pints on Wednesday.  They have live music Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays, which can be a bit loud for the size of the place, but the bands are usually pretty good.  Street parking can be difficult on the weekends, but just park in the lot next to Burger King on Farmington Ave.
