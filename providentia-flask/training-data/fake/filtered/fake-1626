If you like thin crust and consistently delicious pizza .... look no further. The best pizza in the area! Been going there for 15 years. Since I only do take-out, I cannot comment on the in-restaurant service. In the summer, there are always lineups. Also, they do not take AMEX so I cannot give them 5 stars.
