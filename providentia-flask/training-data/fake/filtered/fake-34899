Been to Freeman's many times before. Last two times though, including tonight, were terrible. Generally speaking, the food is good, but the service here is a complete joke. The staff simply doesn't care. Last two times I was here, it took 30 minutes for waiter to take drink orders, 1 hr 15 minutes to get first course, and main course took over 2 hours to arrive. On my visit tonight, we waited over two hours for dinner, only for the manager to walk over and tell us the kitchen was backed up...it was already 11:30pm when this happened. Then my dinner came out looking like it was thrown together by a trainee and was undercooked to the point of not being edible. By this point in the night, our waitress had disappeared and we were passed off to a new waiter. After the joke of a meal they made us sit through, they had the nerve to offer us free cheesecake to make up for the slow service, then tried to charge us the stated 20% gratuity for  parties of six or more (did I mention the 20% tip was huge because of how big our liquor bill had become while we were waiting for our food?). Bottom line, this place used to be awesome when they understood that customers come first...now they are so well known that they think they don't have to earn your business...like customers should feel privileged to eat there. I don't mind when a restaurant screws up, but when they don't own up to it...give me a break! Don't waste your time and $$ here...there are soooo many other places in NY (and the lower east side) that have equally good food and a staff that  actually gives two hoots if you go home happy.
