Delicious! And the waitstaff is incredibly friendly, helpful, and welcoming. Honestly the nicest hostess and waitress that I've met in a very long time. The food came out at just the right time-- not too fast as though they're trying to hurry things along and not too slow so it doesn't get awkward for you and your guest. I feel like their vegetarian option is lacking so that may be something to watch out for if people in your party don't eat meat. The filet mignon with foie gras is absolutely delicious! Just the right portion size too.
