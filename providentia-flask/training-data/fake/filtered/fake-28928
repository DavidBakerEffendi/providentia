My boyfriend and I were sick of the normal commercial coffee/donut places & were driving around looking for a different place that was open at 6:45am for coffee & donuts. Well, we found Orangeside. They are NOT officially open at 6:45, however, the owner was nice enough to let us have a seat, he put on a pot of coffee for us, and we were able to sit & have coffee & a donut, and some nice conversation with the owner as well. What a nice way to treat customers!!!! We were very grateful. Anyway, the donuts were TOP NOTCH. I'll never go back to Dunkin Donuts again. The flavors are absolutely incredible.... Almond Butter Crunch, Snickers, Mounds, Fruit Filled, chocolate glaze, old fashioned (which he can dip in powdered sugar or suger/cinnamon upon request), etc etc... The coffee was also very decent. For Breakfast, they also have omelettes, pancakes, french toast, etc. Next time I will go in for lunch & try out something from their good sized menu which includes raspberry chicken, sandwiches, and burgers. Â All in all, we had a fantastic experience at Orangeside. I gave it 4 stars only because I have not tried the hot foods or sandwiches. But its also worth it to mention that the donuts go fast because they are extremely delicious & they run a special in the mornings, a large coffee & donut for $2.99.
