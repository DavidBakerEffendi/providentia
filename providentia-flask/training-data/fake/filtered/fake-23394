This place was great! I had no reservation, the host made special arrangements for us because the place was packed full of people. Sat right in the garden, and even enjoyed a special shot of chocolate grappa on the house. They made us feel so special, the food was great, atmosphere was very intimate. We went downstairs to enjoy jazz music after the meal. Great night, great place! Highly recommend
