Very rude.  Just called- found a great "last minute weekend package online."  Just had a loss in the family and really needed a "last minute weekend getaway." Called the first time, was abruptly put on hold and hung up on.  Called a second time and went straight to voicemail.  Called a third time, 30 minutes later, was told that 6:45 was too late to book a "last minute," last minute weekend getaway.  Woman working asked me, "what do you think we are going to sit here all night to wait for you to check in?"  I live 45 minutes down the road- was looking for a cozy "home away from home," to retreat and heal.  Thanks for your "hospitality."
