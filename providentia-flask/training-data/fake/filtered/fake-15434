the first time i went to delorenzo's was in 1987. all i heard was people raving how good it was, and i thouhgt how good can a pizza be???? first of all how wrong could i be.? it is not a pizza and should never be called that. it is a tomato pie. nothing else in the world compares to it. Â it is a family tradition, and i saw three generations preparing them, first sophie and chick, then gary and his wife, and now the new one opened by gary's son sammy in robinsville, and they are all identical and fabulous. i moved to fla. but every year when i come up, delorenzo's is tops on my do to list, so can't wait to see yous in april 2013 . ron cerelli
