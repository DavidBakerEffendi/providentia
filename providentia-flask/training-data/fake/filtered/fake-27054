I had heard a lot about Crescent Grill from a friend who lives in the neighborhood.  Craving a good, spicy Bloody Mary and with kids and husband out of the house, I decided on the spur of the moment to take the E train to Queens on a snowy Saturday.   I was glad that I did. I enjoyed the Wagyu beef burger and handcut fries, which were superb.  The burger was a real medium-rare, just as I had ordered it, and the fries were perfectly cooked: crisp and golden on the outside and soft and hot on the inside (sounds like food porn, so please forgive).  And I washed it down with two of the most delicious Bloody Marys that I had ever had.  The bacon really adds to the flavor.  Yum.  I'll be back...
