You all must be kidding me.  We went the other night and were astounded that this restaurant has such great reviews.  First, the young lady who I presume is the owner's daughter could not be any ruder if she tried.  Her entire attitude was obnoxious,  If you ask her a question she answers you as if you are a moron.  The food was unremarkable to bad.  The crostinis were acceptable but not great.  The shrimp special was so terrible that it was almost inedible.  The shrimp were soggy and rubbery.  The braised beef was overcooked, tough and stringy and was  served on a plate of mush that was supposedly polenta.  The bread was tasteless.  The owner came out of the kitchen and made an effort to welcome everyone.  The place has no atmosphere unless you like stark walls and communal tables.  I am amazed that so many people have been duped into thinking this is a fine dining experience.
