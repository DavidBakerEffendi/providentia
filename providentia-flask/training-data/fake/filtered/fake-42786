Love love love this spot! Food excellent- I think the concept is genius. I like the traditional food with the chef's own flair. It makes the meal more special. I have tried everything on the menu and each different flavor is delectable. The prices are extremely fair for such high quality food. I die over the green mango salad. I crave it. The iced coffee is another favorite treat. The restaurant is very clean and cute. I love the design asthetic alone, it makes for a nice dining experience. To sum this up in one word.... GO!
