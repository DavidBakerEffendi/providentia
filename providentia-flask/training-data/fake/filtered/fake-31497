This is the first I am eating at this restaurant decided to celebrate my wife's birthday by eating here. The food is good the drinks and atmosphere as well. The biggest I had was and is the service I had made reservations for 6:00 I got here early they told us to sit at the bar and that we would be seated as quickly as possible. From the bar my wife and I saw a lot tables empty and we were not seated until 6:15. From there my wife were waiting at our table for at least 20 minutes before floor manager asked us how we are doing and asked if our love waitress had come by yet. We told him no and he took our order it took our waitress almost an hour to ask us if we needed anything else. Since then we have yet to see her I was really excited to come and try this place but I will not be coming here again.
