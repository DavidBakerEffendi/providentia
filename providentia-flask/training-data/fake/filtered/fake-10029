I would have recommended this restaurant a year ago but my experience this week was a total nighmare.  The staff was unfriendly to the point of being rude when we asked to see a waitress after sitting for 10 minutes with no one else in the restaurant.  The food was a total disappointment.  It started out with the bread being left in the oven too long and had a rancid taste. I ordered the pork chops wrapped in prosciutto and the meat was dry and tasteless.  My son lucked out with the fish as it was tasty and of good quality.  My husband had the worse experience as he ordered the paella and was brought a bowl of "casuelas de mariscos" which is seafood in a clear broth with a scoop of black rice in the center.  We mentioned to the waitress that this was not paella and her response was "if the waiter calls it paella then I have to believe that's what it is!"  Needless to say we didn't stick around for dessert and will never return.
