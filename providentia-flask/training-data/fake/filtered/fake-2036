My wife and I simply love this place. We drive from Abington which is about 45 minutes away to have a romantic date here as often as possible. The mussels and calamari are prepared with a delightful taste and the specials are never ending. Beer selection is unique and Â the crowd is trendy, yet conversations are kept to each table due to the above average music. Great spot for a first date!!!!!
