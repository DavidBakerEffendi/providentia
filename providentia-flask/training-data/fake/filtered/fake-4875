whooaaaa! Talk about options! I couldn't even decided what I wanted to eat...that was kinda annoying but at least it wasn't a lack of choices! You can have anything from a wrap to pho, even sushi. I chose to have lasagna, it was pretty good. Next time I will have to go with something opposite of lasagna. What that will be??? I am not sure, cause I can walk in wanting meatballs and end up ordering chicken wings....I'm telling you A LOT of decisions to be made. You better know what you're in the mood for or you'll be standing there for awhile (like me) trying to make a decision. But, that's just me sometimes...indecisive, lol.
