I have never eaten here, so I am not judging based on the food. I am judging solely on the poor attitude of the business. I have considered eating here, but that idea vanished when I stopped at the Dunkin Donuts Harry's shares a lot with. The side of the lot closest to Dunkin Donuts was packed, so I parked closer to Harry's. As soon as I passed the Harry door, an employee came from the side of the building yelling and threatening me for parking illegally in his lot. He said if I didn't immediately move he would have my vehicle towed. He refused to listen that I was a paying customer of a co-business of the lot and I would only be a minute. I ignored him and carried on. I later told other people of this issue and came to find out that Harry's is notorious for threatening to and towing people. I was astonished to find out that they even calls on employes of the other businesses in the lot. I have heard that the pizza is mediocre, so I won't bother risking my car towed and being treated rudely to try it.
