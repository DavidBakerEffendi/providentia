Pizza was out of this world amazing I preferred the classic regular pie vs the one with extra toppings Came with a group of 6 and waited outside in the chilly spring evening for 2.5-3 hours only because they couldn't "find a place to seat us all" However, they let all the 5 group people cut Us in the line multiple times. So we were very frustrated. Like add one more chair or something to the 5 table for us! So very unhappy about the wait and customer service. Customer service was terrible. No one offered us water even after asking the many waiters many times. I went and got my entire group water and refills 2-3, as well as utensils and napkins, many times myself! Next time I'll order out. :(
