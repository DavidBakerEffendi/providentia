i made reservations for my family last weekend and i was disappointed. i have heard nothing but good things about this place so I had higher expectations. they had 2 parties going on at one time... one was in the back, partitioned off; the other was in the restaurant. they diverted people from entering and exiting the restaurant through back hallways so as not to disturb the front party. it was extremely loud and crowded. the wait staff was overwhelmed and confused. in general the food did not measure up to the hype, although the clams casino were delicious and we ended up getting another order. i might give this restaurant another chance at a time i know they won't be busy.
