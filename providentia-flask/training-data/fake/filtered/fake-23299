Yorkside is that perfect little college pizza place. They are family to so many Yalies. The freshly made pizza is the best, as are the moose track milkshakes. I can't say no to their slouvaki sandwich, though! Now that I'm no longer in New Haven, I miss this place more than any other. You can't replace Yorkside!
