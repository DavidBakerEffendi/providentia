Such a beautiful lil restaurant, amazing service and delicious food. Perfectly casual but special. Incredible vanilla pear jam, had to buy two jars for $10 each. We ordered the huge Jezebel wings, 3 to share between 2 was plenty. Prawns and grits and netty biscuit. Mini biscuit side was a great taster, had to finish off with the chocolate cake. Very memorable!
