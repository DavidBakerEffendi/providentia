Good food. Nice brunch environment. Service was good- our waiter was attentive, polite and actually was very funny. I have only tried brunch here but I head lunch and dinner is good too. I had the eggs with salmon that came with a drink. $17 - decent price. 4 Stars because the food was't that amazing but I would come here again to try lunch or dinner.
