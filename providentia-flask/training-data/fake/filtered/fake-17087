I wanted to give it 5 stars and I would have after the first two menu items that I tried, but several items I tried later were 'fishy' tasting. Having said that my colleague and I absolutely LOVED two particular appetizers: scallops and crab cakes. LOVED them. We decided to create our own 'tasting' menu since the restaurant did not offer one. We ordered the Seafood Sampler, Scallops, Crab Cakes and SFG Salad. The only two items that we agreed that we did not care for were the clams (on half shell) that were included in the Seafood Sampler and the SFG Salad. We realized some time into our meal that the common 'fishy/oceany' taste we had identified was likely the clams since they were the common item we thought tasted un-fresh. We also LOVED the white fish pate that was served with the bread which was also yummy. In fact, my colleague said that if we had stopped after the white fish pate, scallops and crab cakes, he would have given the restaurant a 5 star rating. I agree. Is it worth the visit? Definitely. Their cocktails were also outstanding. If you are looking for a quiet spot to have conversation, I recommend sitting at the bar. We had drinks there while waiting for our table. Once we were seated, the noise level increased. That section would have been great if we had a large, high energy party but not great for quiet conversation. Again - it is worth the visit. Would I go back? Yes, because what was excellent was truly excellent!
