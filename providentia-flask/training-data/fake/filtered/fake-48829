I live in Manhattan the most diverse, undiverse place on Earth. Ive been looking for a great caribean restaurant since moving to NYC 4 years ago, and thought I got a good tip after watching a review on a cab - probably my first mistake. So I travelled to BK. Here is the deal, the food is good, and its cheap. But the wait is absurd. The restaurant is so absurdly disorganized. It took almost an hour to order and grab food. An hour wait!!! Its just not that serious. For the record I had the jerk lamb with rice and peas. Good stuff. My friend had curried goat with white rice but it didnt leave that good yellow curry. Not sure what kind of curry they cook with. If this hole in the wall gets its act together it could have hope. In the meantime, on to the next place
