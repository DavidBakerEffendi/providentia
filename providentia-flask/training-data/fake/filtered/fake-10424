The former Rolly's Bistro now Zinna's is a breath of fresh air. It's casual, but cozy with hard wood floors, nice music, BYOB and some very fresh food. Â From the bread to the salads and off the charts shrimp Quesadillas and the Risotto is to die for. Reasonably priced and some of the friendliest wait staff you will ever see. We plan on making Zinna's one of regular local spots to enjoy a relaxing casual evening meal.
