Great place. Great food. Great staff. I have been to another Thai place which is right down the street and it really doesn't compare. The other place tries to come off as fancy but if you ask me doesn't do a good job. I'd rather have the better food and the more reasonable prices at Thai Awesome. I went there on Saturday night for dinner and it was great. They have an issue with parking but if you turn down Treadwell and take your first left, Marne Street I think, there's parking over there and its a short walk, but so what, get over it.
