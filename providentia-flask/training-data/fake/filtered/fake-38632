Decor is rustic and a bit industrial. The concrete floor makes for a loud restaurant so good for groups--which we were (group of 12). The fish selections went from basic (grilled) to inventive with ginger curry sauces. Portions were impressive! The favorites at our table were the Monkfish dish, the Shrimp & Lobster with crispy spinach, and the Big-Eye Tuna. The waiter talked our table into family-style sides and appetizers so that all would have a taste of several items. We had piles (actually a bit too much!) of different items from raw oysters to lobster salad sliders. This seemed like a great idea until we saw the bill and realized the waiter thought hundreds of dollars of appetizers and sides was sufficient for a party of 12. Service was attentive, all enjoyed food, and we were "unbugged" post dinner to finish our drinks and talk. I would go back but not when looking for a quiet dinner.
