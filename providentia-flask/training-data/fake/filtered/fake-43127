My husband and recently moved to the area from New York and was really excited to try out this place since I am a seafood lover. Unfortunately our experience was not reflective of the reviews posted. The wait staff was less than professional, the food was subpar. I ordered the New England Clam chowder which lacked any flavor, the potatoes was grossly under cooked and the claims where not washed properly. For the main course I had the Chilean Sea Bass which was glazed, the Sea Bass was dry and tasted awful, my husband has the fish and chips which was okay but nothing to write home about.
