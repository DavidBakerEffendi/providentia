I so want to like this place. Cool concept, nice decor, fun place. But frankly, the sushi is just not very good. The conveyor belt gets loaded with non-sushi items like buffalo chicken rolls, the rice is a bit gummy, the fish skimpy. Â Eats more like supermarket sushi than restaurant quality. Fun place if you don't care too much about the sushi, but otherwise there are much better options around.
