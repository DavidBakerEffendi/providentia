Keep going back.  Best Turkey dinners on Sunday throughout the year (don't have to wait til Thanksgiving).  Always a baked potato after 4:00PM any day of the week. Friendly staff and manager,  Conor, is there to greet and make all welcome.  It is a relaxing place to have lunch, dinner or a light snack ..or on some days just dessert!
