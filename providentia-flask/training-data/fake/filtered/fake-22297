Love this place, I've been going here for years.  They remodeled recently which really opened the space up, it was a bit cramped in the past (hence "Elbow Room" I guess).  The Mac and Cheese is absolutely heavenly--fans take notice.  The burgers are also pretty awesome.   Service isn't always up to par and I've run into multiple occasions where something on their extensive wine list ends up being sold out (sometimes many items).  But go here on a quieter evening mid-week and they'll make it worthwhile.
