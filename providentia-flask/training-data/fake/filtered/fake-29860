Visited Tinks on Friday night to have dinner with friends ended up staying for nearly four hours so I can sample nearly everything on the menu. Atmosphere was amazing, very cozy and inviting which paired nicely with the comfort food on the menu. The menu is designed for sharing and thats just what we did. Started with pretzel crusted fried chicken which was surprisingly sweet and delicious. Next up was "Grown Up Grilled Cheese" with Gruyere and pickled pumpkin (perfect for the season), and Angus sliders with cheese sauce. The meat practically melted in your mouth it was so delicious. My friends and I shared a dish of Crab Mac n Cheese which you could also get plain. Service was amazing, we never felt rushed and always had refills on our water. To top the evening off we had Chilli Hot Chocolate which was amazing, we even took a cup home. So happy to find this restaurant and I will definitley be going back.
