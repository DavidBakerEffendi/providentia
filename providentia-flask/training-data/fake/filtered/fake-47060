My wife and I went to Rubirosa during our Christmas season trip into Manhattan.  We saw great reviews on Yelp and in New York Magazine and made a decision to eat a pizza for lunch.  The restaurant is very easy to find, just being a block from the Spring Street #6 subway stop.  We ordered an appetizer of fried calamari and a small fresca pizza.  The circles and tentacles of the calamari were crisp, lightly breaded, and not greasy and were served with a small cup of delicious marinara sauce.  The pizza was unlike any we've ever eaten.  The crust was flavorful, very thin, and crisp.  A slightly chunky tomato/pizza sauce covered the crust with wonderful globs of fresh mozzarella scattered about and topped with chopped bits fresh basil.   There were small bowls of oregano, crushed red peppers, and parmesan for sprinkling.   The amazing thing about the pizza was that it got better with each bite.  Our only mistake was ordering the small instead of the large pizza.  Our server was very good and placed a carafe of water on the table before taking our drink orders.  The pizza was one of the finest tastes we enjoyed during a 5 day trip.
