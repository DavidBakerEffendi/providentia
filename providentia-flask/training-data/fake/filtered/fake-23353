Thank you for resurrecting yourself into a new restaurant. I love this place. The burgers are great and the beer excellent. I live right around the corner and was so disappointed when it's precursor Pomme deTerre closed.  But, in the end I find The Ox Cart to be be better and I have become a much more regular patron then I was at Pomme deTerre. I like it better because there is a bar with a happy hour, a TV to watch sports, and hearty less expensive food. Like Pomme deTerre the service is friendly, social, and attractive. It's cozy. I was a regular at the Farms on Cortelyou Rd.and I still like it, but now that I've found the Ox Cart I rarely go there anymore. I prefer  the location and the happy hour drinks. I am a draft beer drinker. I'd love them to have a larger selection and this is my main criticism. They only carry 3 choices and sometimes make choices that I wouldn't. The Farms does have better beer, but they charge too much for it. I like their burgers better than many more expensive places I've visited. I only have a burgher maybe 4 of the 15 or so times I've been here. The specials are good also and the portions large. I love the trout. I would like them to have more seafood and a regular mussel appetizer. Also the bread could also be improved and served with more meals.
