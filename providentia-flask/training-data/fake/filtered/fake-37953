Oh Cheese Truck, how I will miss you when I leave New Haven. Great lunch option in the Yale College area -- they have great daily specials (a daily grilled cheese as well as a daily sausage special), but my heart belongs to the classic grilled cheese with grilled red onion and jambon de paris. The sourdough bread is crisp and buttery, the cheese mixture is great. They tweet (@caseusgrilled) where they will be for the day.
