They may have a fabulous delivery service, they may even have good pizza..... I wouldn't know.     I went at 9pm on a monday and was the only customer in the shop.  I ordered, paid, and WAITED..... 35 minutes later they hadn't even put my pizza in the oven.      I ended up leaving without food, or a refund. If I could give it 0 stars I would, as that is the amount of food I got after paying (and prematurely tipping).    Definitely don't go there in person.... good luck with the delivery service - by all appearances it is more succesful.
