This place is so awesome that I want to give everyone who works there a hug every time I come in. When I get pick up, it's hot, fresh and delicious. And guess what? When I order delivery, it's hot, fresh and delicious. Impossible? I thought so, too. I'm torn on what's the best. If the owner doesn't know it already, you should - your employees are AWESOME. I've never had anyone greet me who was anything less than friendly and enthusiastic. A+ on your hiring methods. From cashier to cook to delivery dude, all are fantastic. The mere fact that you can order a half order of fries tells you they're customer friendly and certainly appeal to people like me who want to try a bit of everything. And if you're a fan of including a whole bunch of sauces? I ordered an extra honey mustard AFTER I was totaled but before I paid. Total before extras? 11.07. Total after? 11.07. Love it. I've had almost everything here....pizza, paninis, wings (FANTASTIC - not many places in NoLibs that are), and it has always been amazing. Trios, Im having Thanksgiving at my place...wanna cater?
