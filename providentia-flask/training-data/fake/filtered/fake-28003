Rarely have I been so underwhelmed or totally disappointed in a restaurant. We followed the reviews and couldn't understand how anyone could like this pricey, bland food. Â I understand tapas, but these portions were microscopic; providing you even wanted to eat it after the first taste. The ham and bean soup was mostly water, the stocks are richer in Russian gulags. The black cod made catfish look gourmet. Cheese plates were razor thin slices of what might have been 2 years ago, a flavorful morsel. OK, the steak was good but that can be had anywhere.. If this is Jose Garce's landmark restaurant I'd say he should give up his day job and head back to chef school. An awful waste of good money. Stay away...
