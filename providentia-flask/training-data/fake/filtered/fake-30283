A coworker suggested that we try out this place for lunch the other day. When we arrived, the line was so long it was almost out the door. The wait wasn't too bad (about 15min) and we got our food a few minutes after ordering too. I only carry credit and debit cards, but this place is cash only. A little disappointing, but it's how the place is. Now, the service was alright. The guy who took my order seemed to look down on us because we "didn't know how to order our food properly." Excuse me if there's a certain unknown etiquette to ordering a simple Philly cheesesteak. In the end, the cheesesteak was really good. Not sure if it was worth all the hassle.
