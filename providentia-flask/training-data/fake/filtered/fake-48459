Disclaimer: one of our team members tends to be overly-critical. That being said, our visit to Pat's was awesome! The cheesesteaks were delicious -- the bread was perfect for soaking up the whiz and the steak was so good. You gotta go to Pat's! Plus, Geno's is racist soooo there's only one right decision. The reason this doesn't get a 5 is because (despite objections from the Philly native in our group that this criticism is blasphemy) it was really freaking cold and there is no indoor option. Our hands really got so frozen while trying to do the thing where you use your finger to lick up all the cheesy cheese on the wrapper.
