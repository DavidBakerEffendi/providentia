I highly recommend the dessert called rice ball in sweet wine!! It may looked like soup or porridge, but it was more thick and sticky. Â There were lots of tiny sticky rice balls that had white or light yellow color in it, and within a small portion of rice wine, it was an visual and taste enjoyment. I was falling in love with the dessert,and I could feel the sweetness remained and melted in my mouth slower and slower. It really made my day!!!
