The food is delicious and that's the only reason I keep giving Peaces chances. They have the worst customer service except for one waitress who went out of her way to get me some fish and grits today. She's new that probably why. Reason I'm slamming this restaurant is in the hope that will read these comments and improve. Do not arrive anytime after three thirty because they will make you wait until five to order from from the main menu . Me and some other patrons I spoke with hate this policy. I don't know if this restaurant just doesn't want to employ their waiters full time or what but the turn over policy is stupid. The wait time used to be horrible but they seemed to improve since expanding
