Sublime food and a step back in time to a more elegant time. At Bustan you won't just find an amazing menu with delicious preparations of traditional and not so traditional takes on Mediterranean classics, you will also get a dining experience resembling the elegant times of old. While the food is the definite star of this restaurant, the art deco decor resembling the Orient Express and all the supporting details (such as old school champagne glasses faithful to the period) round out a truly wonderful experience. I can't wait to go again.
