i ordered food from paradise when i had lot of frends at my place. I ordered chicken biryani but i got veg. food was not great either. I really like the one on oak tree. when i called and asked, they said they dont have any to send the food and asked me to come again to get it. I hate this service and would never go again or recommend to any of my friends. guys, b careful if u r making a big order..
