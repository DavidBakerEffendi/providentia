After reading the reviews on Stacks we decided to give it a try. We later regretted that decision. The breakfast was tasty however our server Missy totally neglected us during the meal. She never offered to refill our coffee. She never once came over to see how we were doing. However we noticed that she visited other tables and refilled thrir coffe cups.To make matters worse when my fork was accidentally taken I asked her for another fork. She asked the bus boy to replace it. After waiting more than 10 mins for a new one I asked another server for one. He gladly handed me one from a server station right behind me. Our server was standing in the exact same spot when I asked her for a fork. All she had to do was reach up and hand it to me but neglected to do so. The manager was informed of our displeasure and he discounted the bill. We would return but if the server is Missy again we will ask to be seated elsewhere.
