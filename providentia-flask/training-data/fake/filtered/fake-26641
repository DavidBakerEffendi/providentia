i"ve had such a great experience at stone park cafe last night. i had a three course menu the first course is frisee Salad with a great taste with a crispy poached egg (my first time) . the main course is Pan seared Catham Cod. WOW the fish is so tastey. i finished the meal with a chocolate brioche pudding caramel ice cream. the service is very good and provided by Megha,
