Here's the first thing you need to know about Vic: if you're looking for a chic sushi bar, look elsewhere. This is your classic hole-in-the-wall great find. Their 3 rolls (8 pieces each) for $11 deal is stellar, and it even includes typically "special" rolls like philadelphia, etc. It's great quality fish, plus they have oodles of specialty rolls, all of which are packed with tasty ingredients. I think the common thread in other reviews is the service--I'll be the first to admit that this isn't a high-class place. They have bottles of water in a cooler in the corner, and there effectively isn't a waitress. You come in, sit at the counter (or the small table right by the door) and order straight from the sushi chefs. They put all of your food on a big plate and hand it right to you. Although I'm a fan of snazzy, classy restaurants, I've also always been a lover of little side-street places with great food. Vic is definitely the latter, and I can't wait to go back again.
