Disappointed in recent visits after really favorable early stops.  Chicken tenders have slipped from perfect to mixed with gnarled, tough chicken meat.  Lobster rolls have slipped from perfect portion to almost skimpy.  Also think TLG has expanded its menu to unmanageable proportions.  Too many choices to do all of them right.
