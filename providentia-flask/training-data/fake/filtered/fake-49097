The farmer's market is a bit out of the way for me but I like buying local.  Buttons is inside the market and this place is so unique.  The food is really good, made fresh with local ingredients and the people that work there are all so customer friendly.   The salad dressing is the best I've had and the apple cake is as good as any Jewish grandmother could make.  My husband had the quiche and after he ate it he got up and ordered one to take home!  I highly recommend this place.
