The thing I like most in this restaurant is there veranda. It's nice when you can see the panorama of the city. People are walking along the streets, holding their hands or hurrying back home and you are just watching them, drinking your wine or coffee or smoking a cigarette. The atmosphere is disposes you to romantic and at the same time philosophic mood.
