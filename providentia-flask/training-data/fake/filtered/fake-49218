This place is absolutely beautiful ! My friends and I go out to dragonfly every time  we are about to go to AMC.  My favorite dish is the sizzling Mongolian beef, then I'd have to pick the Thai wings! Omg orgasm !! The hostess are so warm and welcoming, the lighting is perfect, the servers are funny! I've been here so many times I've had them all ( almost). Ryan is awesome, laid back and makes good recommendations.  Brian is very good with food allergies, a joker yet fast.  Michele and James are so sweet and polite! A couple months ago a couple got engaged at the barbecue session, it was so cute! That same night a man made the sweetest toast  to his lady! Always a fun time! There should be more places with such a good energy.
