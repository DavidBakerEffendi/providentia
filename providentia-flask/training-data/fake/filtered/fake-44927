I have been to Brix quite a few times, i love the food, every thing is so yummy. the prices are very reasonable also... the owner Steve and his wife are the nicest people and the service there is great... i would recommend this place to any one.... i'm even having a birthday party there for my mom's 85th....way to go Brix
