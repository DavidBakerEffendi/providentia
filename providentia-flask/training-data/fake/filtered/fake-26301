Joes is def the most amazing experience I have ever had in a rest~it started from the moment I walked in the crew is so welcoming the made me feel like family as I work my wa into the rest the smell of garlic & oil frying with other amazing smells made me feel like I was home with my mother on a Sunday afternoon my mouth is actually watering as I'm writing this from appt t my main course everything was sooo bangin I think. Licked my dish & of course had to top it with dessert with a almond mascapone piece of cake (oooo how I wish I had that whole cake in front of me right now Lol) top with espresso (make Joe make it for you he's got this lol) def my new rest at least 6 maybe 8 could be 10x a month thank u joes for making me fee like family & for making me the happiest girl in the world
