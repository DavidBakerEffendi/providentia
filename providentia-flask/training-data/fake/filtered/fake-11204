I was sooo excited about going because i am a culinary student and love fine food. Well i left with a headache. The store was not crowded because it was only 3:30pm. But what a mess, cunfusion, and just too much shit going on. I would never go during lunch or after work. The place is nice and new, but the flow is off some how. I expected it to be expensive and that was not a problem for me but customer service is very important to me. If im am going to spend all this money in your store, at least smile and make me feel appreciated. Some people where friendly and offered assistance, but most just ignored us. Chef Butelli was in the building and we became excited although he looked like he did not want to be bothered so my friend and i just watched him.  A woman came up to him and ask for a picture. He replied "if you have your camera now".  He took the pic but didnt even smile in it. My friend and i looked at one another and nodded our heads. How rude. I mean dam, you are in your store and you cannot smile and be social to the idiots (like me) who would even think about buying $15 chicken breast. We just walked out and said we would never go back. There are too many great, fabulous, cheap and friendly places to eat and shop in the city. Why subject yourself to this mess.
