My wife and I were on vacation in Philadelphia and, while shopping, got quite hungry. We queried Siri about "great food nearby" and the 3rd option was Kanella. Not that the other options were bad or better, we just wanted something different so we chose Kanella. Boy, did we make the right decision! Since we had never had any proper Greek Food, only Gyros. We were as lost as you can be when reading a menu of food you have never tasted. The waiter, while courteous and eager to help, did not help us make a decision on what to eat. Enter Constantino! Constantino the Chef (I guess he's the owner too!) came in and just took step by step describing in detail each and every dish, every drink, every dessert. I'd like to remember the names of the dishes but they escape me. Sorry about that. My wife had a goat stew and I had lamb patties... both of them absolutely delicious! He took extreme pride in his craft and we ended up tasting a piece of Greece. He made constant rounds around the restaurant and was always on top of everything; that's leadership for you there! When the time came to order dessert he again suggested and described all the options available. I jokingly said "Don't tell you're going to give us brownies, ok?". He then looked at me straight in the eye and said something I'll never forget: "I never compromise!" meaning he only served 100% deliciously authentic Greek food. He upped the ante by saying "the dessert I just recommended is the best in all of Philadelphia!". Well... let me just say that I still dream about it! It was a sort of pastry with a creamy filling with orange syrup. Absolutely delicious. If you're in Philadelphia do yourself a favor and go to Kanella... which means Cinnamon, by the way!
