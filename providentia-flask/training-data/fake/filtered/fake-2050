Have eaten here several times before and the food is usually decent. This time I ordered a margaharita pizza and an order of wings. The pizza was fine but the buffalo wings were disgusting. They were battered like you would batter fish, over cooked and dry. Oh, not to mention they tasted like the were cooked in dirty fish/shrimp oil. I could not tell if the chicken was bad or someone had no idea how to make wings. I called to let them know about my uneatable food. NOTHING! No sorry, no come back for a credit or refund just a ok I'll tell the boss. Last time I go to this place.
