Place is awesome. Kids eat free Monday and Tuesday. Portions are bid and everything on the menu is great. I don't under the prior reviews, but I guess everyone has a right to voice it. I had a party for 30 on Saturday and the staff could not have been better. Great for a family or a date or just a drink.
