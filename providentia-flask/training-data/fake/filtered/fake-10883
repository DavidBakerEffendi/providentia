Tried the lunch buffet on March 27.  Food was very good as was the service.  The waiter went out of his way to bring separate servings of a carrot dessert that had run out at the buffet table. The lack of 2 more stars is due to the same issue brought up by reviewer JR in a review from 8/22/12, namely that the Yelp deal restrictions listed on the Yelp site do not correspond to what this establishment accepts.  I bought a $15 for $25 coupon.  When we arrived at the restaurant, we saw a large sign on the door clearly stating that the Yelp coupon is not accepted either for takeout or for the LUNCH BUFFET. While the former is listed as a restriction on the YELP deal, the latter is not.  I did not try to argue the point at the restaurant as a) we were happy with the food and b) we live in the area, so returning for another visit for dinner was a reasonable possilbility for us.  However, if either a or b weren't true, I would definitely be very unhappy. Bottom line:  BEWARE THE YELP DEAL COUPON. Either Persis and/or Yelp has not listed the CRITICAL RESTRICTION - you can't use it for the lunch buffet.  Since this issue has been around at least since 8/12, my assumption is that Persis / Yelp don't plan to fix it.
