Who doesn't Love Finger LIcking good Dumplings? Don't be fooled by how the resto looks but wow their menu are all tasty.  It is perfect when you are coming back home from a crazy night our with your friends and end up here. This place has fast service, tasty dishes and to top it all, it is also very very reasonable compared to other places.  Their dumplings are fresh and not soggy like other places. On the weekend can be really busy but come one, that's what you expect when a place is Super Good. There's a reason for waiting in line! I will for sure come back here again, thanks to my friends recommendation. Eat your heart out! Thank you for the lovely meal!
