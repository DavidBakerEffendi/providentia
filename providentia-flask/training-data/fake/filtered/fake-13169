I love this place and it's definately my first choice when it comes to Thai food in the New Haven area. I have enjoyed everything that have ever ordered. The ginger chicken, pad thai, and drunken noodles are some of my favorites. Yes, the prices are a little higher than i woudl like to pay, and the portions maybe could use a slight size increase; the food taste which is most important is excellent. I regularly visit the Terrace to get my Thai food fix.
