One of the better restaurants I have ever been to.  I loved the ambience and the decor was too cool.  West Viilage is a great place to visit as tourist from S.F., very similar vibe.  So I had the scallops and corn custard.  the scallops had a nice falovorful sauce on them and the custard was perfect, sweet like corn.  I tied my daughters burger, so good!  The shoe string fries were to die for.  I had a gin and tonic and another gin drink with giner that was very refreshing, very tasty.  The portions are medium which I enjoyed and the desserts were perfect a blueberry tart and a flan.  I would go here again but my pocket book doesn't allow it.... Go...now!
