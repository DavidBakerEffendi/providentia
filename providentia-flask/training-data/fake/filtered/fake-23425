A really great greenpoint bar-nice back area, generous dance floor, cheap food menu etc.  Also the cute tatted bar tender who made me a perfect manhattan doesn't hurt either:) It would be a five star for me, but the decor/theme is a little sportsy which works against the aesthetic strengths of the space, imho.  i am looking forward to seeing the direction this place goes.  highly recommended overall~!
