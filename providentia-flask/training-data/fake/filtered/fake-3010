This was my 5th time having Thai food, and i must say it was very pleasurable. the atmosphere was very nice and relaxing, the waitress was very friendly and very helpful.    we ordered four main courses, I had the Pad-seew beef...... it was a little too salty for me but I didn't say anything, however the waitress saw that I was not eating my meal and ask if every thing was OK...... So, I told her it was a little to salty for me and she said back to me " I'm very sorry, let me take the plate back and make you a new one". In about 3 min or so, she walk to our table with my new plate!!!! It was awesome!!!!!      I was very happy with this restaurant, food was great ,service was even better!!!! CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT DATE NIGHT!!!!!!!!  o BTW it's BYOB, but there is a huge liquor store right across the street!!!
