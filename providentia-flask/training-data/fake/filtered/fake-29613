They should take away all fusion southern or "creative" southern comfort and keep it a classic menu. My friends pulled chicken looked great with Mac n Cheese. My Hippie Banjo, not so great. The sprouts tasted odd with the fried egg. Most of all, this sandwich does not come with a side dish!! (If ur aim was healthy, don't griddle the bread and provide a scoop of that watermelon or cucumber salad---indicate "healthy options") Tip to the chef: If u are gonna do Southern, keep it classic. Don't confuse your customers. I should have gotten the chicken waffles. GREAT SERVICE. The waiter was very courteous when we asked to move tables due to a loud group of babbling high schoolers/middle schoolers(?) Â  I hope I grow another stomach or a heightened metabolism to taste their epic pies, donuts and the chicken waffles.
