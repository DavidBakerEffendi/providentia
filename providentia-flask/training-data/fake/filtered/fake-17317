We made reservations for 8 pm and weren't seated until at least 8:30 pm because they had no tables for our party of 4.  When we finally did get seated, we were greeted by a less than friendly waiter who hardly provided any service for the remainder of our meal.  When we ordered coffee to start, he didn't bother bringing any cream with it, so we asked again, twice, until finally another server brought us some.  The "Brooklyn Bread" was a big disappointment, cold italian bread...nothing special.  After placing our orders, we didn't get our meals until 40 minutes later, and boy were they disappointing. We ordered the rib eye steak - completely bland, dry, and a waste of $32.  It came with gorgonzola fries which were just Ore Ida fries with gorgonzola melted into a greasy mess. We also ordered the Tre burger - bun was cold and too hard, meat was bland, and you couldn't even tell there was cheese on it.  It came with a side of fries that again, Ore Ida must have supplied, because they were definitely not house made and were overly greasy.   Lastly we had Papardelle with exotic mushrooms and chicken - the chicken was completely bland, no taste whatsoever.  The rest of the dish was too greasy and not very flavorful.   The only thing good at this restaurant was the coffee :/ If the service had been good, we might have overlooked the overall bland flavors of our food, but when you're paying $100+ burgers, etc. good service is the least you can ask for.  The elderly man who seated us was very apologetic and kind, but unfortunately it did not make up for our rude waiter.  We could not get out of there fast enough, but even getting the check and paying it took at least 20 minutes.  Would I go here again?  Never.  Big waste of time, money and calories.
