I have been to vitae at least 2 times before this past experience. We had an Â  8:15 reservation and sat on time. Our main dishes did not get to the table until after 10PM. We were not happy! When we asked what the problem was, the waiter blamed it on my husband's meat and said it was because he wanted it well done and that was the reason for the delay! They also got his drink wrong three times - he asked for lime and they brought him a lemon - a small mistake but a mistake nonetheless. We also had to ask them to clear our plates after the appetizers sat on the table for at least 20 mins longer then they should have. Service was terrible and we will not go back! the server was Edward
