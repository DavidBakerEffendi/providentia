Food quality is absolutely disgusting. Mixed drinks are gross. Â The customer service is---let me put it this way....THERE IS NONE! My friends and I once sat at the bar and never even got a menu......and good luck getting their attention once they've already brought you your drink. They do have good beer specials throughout the week...but even then...sooo not worth it.
