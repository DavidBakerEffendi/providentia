My husband just brought home some surprise sushi at 9pm. I have been bugging him to pick up a menu from this place. Â I'm glad he stopped in. We got a sweet potato roll, california roll and a philly roll and they were all sooo good. He also said the owner was very nice. The owner threw in a house salad and it was also very good. We will definitely be back for more.
