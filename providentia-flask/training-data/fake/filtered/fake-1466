As an Austrian living in New York, I Â can say, this is the best Austrian food outside of the country. I try to come here whenever I'm in the area, which unfortunately isn't too often. The atmosphere is above average, but not amazing. It lies somewhere between casual, and classy, with both being acceptable. If you have some extra time, I recommend you check out the Neuegalerie (If you enjoy art of course) The food is nothing short of amazing. I won't recommend a specific food, but you cannot go wrong with a Wiener Schnitzel, as there is a reason it's the most famous. Just make sure you know what you're buying before you do, as some other people reviewing this place clearly haven't. The Desserts are what you'd expect...amazing. I'll go ahead and just recommend everything, but once again, make sure you know what you're buying. In conclusion, it's definitely worth it. I'm not a fan of pricy restaurants, but some, like this one, are worth it. The best Austrian food in the US, and better than a lot in Austria itself. Give it a look if you're in the area
