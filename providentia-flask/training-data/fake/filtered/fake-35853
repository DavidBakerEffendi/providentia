The food here was unbelievably disgusting! Okay, now that I have that out of my system, I was invited to a friend's birthday dinner to eat at Amici's, and allow me to say, it's not "fine dining." The place was EMPTY (on a Friday?!?!?!), except for a few people at the bar. There were only eight of us there and it took an hour to get the food out. I took one bite of my overcooked cappelini and was immediately ready to send it back. Not wanting to embarrass my friend, I pushed the mushy-as-hell pasta around my plate, avoiding another gag inducing bite. The food is also terribly overpriced. I had no appetizer or alcohol, and it cost me 25 bucks for pasta and cake. Are you kidding? The atmosphere was disappointing as well. Poorly decorated, with holes in the ceiling. The bathroom, just as MV stated was also gross.
