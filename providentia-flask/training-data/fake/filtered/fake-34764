My dining experiences at Il Michelangelo have been some of the best I've had to date.  Between the fabulous service, atmosphere, and food here you truly cannot go wrong.  The warm inviting decor is really special.  In the summertime, there is a beautiful patio that I always request and in the colder months, it is always decorated superbly.  I always request the table in the back near the window, as it is my favorite in the house and perfect for all occasions.  The service is always attentive, knowledgeable, and thorough.  I find that the waiters are so in tune with the guests that they often remember exactly what I will be ordering and know just what to recommend.  It is a family owned restaurant and the owners are always present and make sure to make guests feel welcomed.  The chef is also the son of the owner and he has visited my table on a number of occasions and helped make us feel at home.  I can't say enough about how kind both the family and servers have been.   As far as the food, I have not had a bad meal yet.  I always start with the rock shrimp and the calamari chino (this has somewhat of an Asian flair to it and is hands down the best calamari that i've ever ordered).  My favorite dishes happen to be the wonderful and tasty veal ortolana and the shrimp fra diavolo.  I also love the panzerotti, which has an awesome brandy cream sauce.  The prices are affordable and the portions are large as well.  The desserts are also great.  I happen to love their cheesecake and my date the last time that we were there had a terrific chocolate lava cake.  I will continue coming back for more great dinners here in the future and would highly recommend Michelangelo's.
