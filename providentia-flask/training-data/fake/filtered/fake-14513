I've always had great food and experiences here. The ingredients are fresh, the staff is great and their specials are inventive. In my personal opinion Nomad has nothing on this place. The porcetta (sp?) pizza is amazing. If you have any special requests all you need to do is ask. And by golly, if you don't like something (which I haven't experienced) simply just speak to them personally. They are super accommodating. I don't understand the people who leave hurtful and sarcastic reviews just for the sake of entertaining themselves. Just go! Experience it for yourself. I've been to Italy and feel that this is as close as you can get without breaking out your passport and hopping on a plane.
