I have eaten at Piccolo Angolo many times and cannot stop raving about the food.  However, the service at this restaurant is horrendous and the owner is extremely rude and disrespectful.  I understand that it is a challenge to get reservations; however, I was there two weeks ago and was totally taken aback at how rude and insulting the owner was to my friend.  The restaurant was virtually empty and a staff member the previous day had told me on the phone not to worry about a reservation since I was planning on being at the restaurant at 5:30pm.  When my friend arrived at the restaurant the owner in a very disrespectful way told her that he did not have anything available even though most of the tables were empty.  She left after this exchange, where I not knowing what had transpired, arrived at the restaurant to ask for a table and told him I didn't have reservations.  After some reluctance he proceeded to seat me.  When I called my friend to tell her about the table, she told me that she had arrived earlier and had been turned away.  I don't understand this double standard.  Needless to say I will not be returning nor recommending this place of business to anyone.  NYC has too many restaurants with great food and service for anyone to be subject to this type of behavior.
