I like to consider myself a true pizza conisseur. I've had slices and pies from The Bronx down to Brooklyn. I even keep lists. :) Among the pizza lovers I've known and talked to, most of them think that it's overrated. I think that this place gets a bad rap because it's been so hyped for so long and that's unfortunate. Sometimes things are hyped because they're really, really good! I think that's the case with Grimaldi's. The crust (for me) is the perfect thickness and is not too doughy without being "burnt crispy". The sauce is tasty and the toppings are always fresh. Is it #1 on my list? It's not. But it definitely makes my top 10. If you can deal with the often insane wait, definitely give it a try. Worth the hype!
