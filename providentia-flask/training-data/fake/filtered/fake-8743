The most embarrassing time I ever experienced in a resturant. First of all I had signed a contract my reservations were at 8pm sharp. As per the contract they can only hold your table for 15 minutes before they give up your table. I got there at exactly 8. I got a text message at exactly 8:17 to go to the host that our table was ready. Still nothing, at this point I'm very annoyed and my guest are annoyed because I specifily told them to be here at 8. At the end it was discovered that we could not sit down because there was another party sitting in our table who had already paid but didn't want to leave. They did not sign a contract so they couldn't force them to leave. So why did I sign a contract for? And reserve ? I felt like I was not being taken care of. My reservations were made for 8:00 we finally sat down at 9:43 how ridiculous. All the manger kept saying was "I'm going to take care of you" he gave us sangria pitchers. At the end the family style portion was not enough to go around for everyone. Out of my party of 12, 4 didnt eat I was so embarrassed !!! I will never go here ever again, I cannot believe the embarrassment I had to go through. I made a Yelp account just to write this review... that should tell you something.
