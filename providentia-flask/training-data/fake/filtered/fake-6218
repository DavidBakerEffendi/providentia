The best pizza in the area! I mean overall all of their food is good but their pizza.... just wow. Recently they started delivering and its fantastic. Â The Sicilian is hands down the best in NJ but their round pie rivals Benny's in Hoboken. Baked ziti is good, eggplant parm is good, the chicken parm sandwich is good, could use more sauce but that's the only complaint. Service is always good whether at the counter, booth or in the more 'formal' dining in the back. Answering the phone is never really an issue, they're prompt with that too. As far as italian places go this is well worth it.
