Went to the Carmine's in the Upper East/West side of Manhattan. The food was great and we brought some home with us. The staff sucked. It was my friend's bday, and it was a large group of us. We spent a lot of money there on drinks and food. They had the nerve to charge us for the small piece of cake for my friend's bday. Isn't that usually complimentary? So not only did they take forever to serve us.
