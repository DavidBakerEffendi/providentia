I usually like the food here.. but as the other reviewers have mentioned, the delivery service is seriously lacking, which is really poor considering so much of their business comes from delivery. We ordered our food at 6:50, the food arrived at 9:05. We called them four times. They hung up on us twice, made excuses about the website that we ordered from (they don't like paying a percentage of their profit for the online service-but why did they agree to those terms...), made excuses that the staff answering the phone speaks poor English (why have her answer the phone?) and outright lied about delivery times (oh it'll be 10-15 mintues). When the food finally did arrive they gave no apology. Every delivery has been at least one hour with them, but this one takes the cake. This isn't how you treat long-term costumers. I'm really disappointed with them. They made no attempts to make amends or treat their customers with an ounce of respect. This is how you lose customers. We've eaten at their quaint restaurant numerous times (they have one table that seats 6 and a counter with stools). We usually like the curry noodle soup, Jeera fried rice, and tom yum salad. Might give this place another shot if their service improves.
