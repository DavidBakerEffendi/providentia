This place is awesome, everything is good, about the salad, gyros with the very delicious sauce the "tsatsiki". They have so many different kind of food. Â The price inexpensive and very good quality food. Also they have all day breakfast. By the way last weeks they have something new, the famous Greek coffee "Frappe" cold and "Nescafe" hot and also they have late or espresso if you want to wake up "very fast". I "love" this place. One of my favorite restaurants at Penn,
