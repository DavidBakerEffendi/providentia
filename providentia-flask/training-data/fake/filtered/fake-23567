Clearly people in Hartford have nasty taste. Been trying to find a decent restaurant since visiting. Thought this was the light at the end of a tunnel. No, it was terrible. Seriously just bad. Worse than Panda Express. Wish so much that I could just un-eat it. Tasted greasy, dirty, super sweet, etc.. Luckily it was cheap, unlike the other terrible food I've had in this city.
