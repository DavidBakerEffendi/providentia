I was told by a friend to give it a try, he said I wouldn't be disappointed the least bit have to say he was right....this is the best place to grab a shake and a crepe.  When I walked in I was greeted by a lovely woman Liza with a few customers eating on retro style table and chairs. I thought wow this is kinda cool. The prices are very reasonable. I purchased a La Colombiana it was amazing..I wish I took a pic so I can show everyone. The decor on the dish was absolutely astonishing. There are others to choose from but The La Colombiana caught my eye and i am glad it did. I'm stopping back in a couple hours to get smoothies she makes with Indian yogurt and a vegan shake as soon as my friend gets here.  See ya soon on my next review....smoothies here we come
