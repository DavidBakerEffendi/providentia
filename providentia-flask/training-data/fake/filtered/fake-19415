I guess I am a glutton for punishment.  I've been to Plenty three times, and each time the service has been horrible.  A friend from out of town went this morning, texting me how bad his service was, too.   A run down: First, the personnel are about as welcoming as wet rags. While I can't say anyone was actually rude, the vacant eyes and absolute indifference to the most basic niceties (would eye contact or a smile really hurt) would drain the good will reformation right out of Ebenezer Scrooge.   There is a palpable sense that no one is quite as cool as the barista and, should you forget it or fail to see the obvious, you are being treated with a chilly, smug indifference to make the point unmistakable. Second, after ordering a coffee and bagel with cream cheese (same bagel every time, cream cheese $1 extra!) on three different occasions, I've somehow managed to be charged three different prices. Third, I had a coffee spill into the saucer, which caused a little mess; I placed a napkin over the mess and drank the coffee. When I got a coffee refill, the clerk handed back my original saucer, soaked napkin and all.  I don't know if the clerk was passively aggressive, completely unimaginative (really? it you have to be told to replace the saucer?), or what, but I can't imagine that happening anywhere outside of the Soviet Union. All in all, the place should be avoided.  There are too many good coffee shops in the neighborhood to waste your money supporting this place.
