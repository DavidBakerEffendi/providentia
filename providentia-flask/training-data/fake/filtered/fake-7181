I ordered the Italian and the American sandwich platters for a last minute work function for new years eve, and only had about 4 hours between ordering the platters and picking them up. I can't comment on every single sandwich, but overall everyone at work loved them. I had the prosciutto and fresh mozzarella, it was like... heaven on Italian bread. I don't remember the last time I had such soft deliciously salty prosciutto and fresh mozzarella that tastes so fresh. I am originally from Brooklyn and this place is the real deal, like what i remember Meat Supreme to be. Â If you read this, thank you john for all of your help with the order. You guys are awesome. I look forward to trying more of the food here.
