Spent an amazing weekend up in Valatie, NY  Stopped at Hour Time Bar and Grill at 2819 route 9.  Staff was great inviting,excellent service.  Food was excellent, beers served cold and refreshing.  Facility clean and comfortable to be in.  They have everything your looking for in a great bar from OTB, Keno, lotto,darts, pool table, video games and a great Juke box. Very modern, had such a good time spent most of the late day and evening there.  Customers all seemed to be having a great time and very friendly.  If you dont want to miss out on a great time this place is a must visit if your in town even worth the trip just for a fun time out.
