I hardly ever write reviews but I had to say something about this awesome place. We tried to come here for dinner before our show but they were booked. The hostess Bella was very apologetic and invited us to come back after the show and she would make sure we were taken care of. We returned at 11 and the place was still packed but true to her word, Bella found a place for us at the bar and then proceeded to bring chairs over for all 6 of us. Who knew you could find such personal service near Times Square? She kept checking up on us to be sure we were happy. The drinks were well made and quickly delivered. The scotch selection was pretty decent. The bar munchies were also good. If you add in the really unique Victorian decor this place is worth a visit. I'll be back for sure.
