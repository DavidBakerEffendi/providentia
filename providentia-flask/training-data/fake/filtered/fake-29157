Fire the staff!.  Food is good but we won't go back because the staff is rude and obnoxious.  There were only two tables with patrons but the waiter wouldn't seat us because he preferred to sit our party at the larger table rather than split us into two tables among the ample empty tables.  After 40 minutes of waiting for a table and no new patrons entering the restaurant we left and will not go back.  Really unfortunate because we were always big fans.
