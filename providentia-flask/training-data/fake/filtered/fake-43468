Paisano's is a great place.  I have eaten there many times, the food is always delicious and the service is great.   The chicken parm is one of the best I've ever had!They have really good specials and home made pasta..  and now that it's nice out they have a great patio for outdoor dining, which is also lit up very nicely at night!
