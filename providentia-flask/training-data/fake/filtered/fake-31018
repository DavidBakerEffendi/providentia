Amazing place!  I love the rotating tap list.  There is always something interesting on tap and tons of beers I can't find anywhere else.  Not to mention these beers are half price at Happy Hour and 4 dollars on Mondays and Tuesdays.  Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable. Whiskey selection is pretty stellar.  If I could make one recommendation it would be to include more scotches.  They carry Talisker and Ardbeg which are both very heavy, peaty, and medicinal tasting.  It would be nice if they included a Glenrothes or Dalmore for a customer seeking delicate taste in scotch. Food is unbelievable.  Been to several beer dinners and had countless entrees and I've never had something I didn't like.  They really take time to season and prepare their food, and the menu has pairings on burgers that sound strange but work brilliantly together(fried egg and pico de gallo??).   Overall, a great place to go to eat and drink.
