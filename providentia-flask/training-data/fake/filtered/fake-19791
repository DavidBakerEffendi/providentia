Well if there is 0 or negative stars then this place deserves it badly:-) The wait staff has absolutely no smile on their face. The food is 1 or 2 stars but the big issue is cleanliness. If  North Brunswick food inspector is doing his/her job properly this place would be closed down yesterday! Let me tell you However, the hostess was the grumpiest I have ever seen. She had no smile and never spoke a word with any one. She took a piece of b'day cake and eating it hiding it . { I don't mind she taking the cake but not sure why she was hiding the cake as she ate it}. Time to eat food ..each EVERY plate was so unclean,  had so much left over food layers from previous 10 different parties that I decide to pass the dinner. So next I said let me eat some milk sweets..The sweets served tasted made with slimy sweet milk. Clear sign that sweets  has been sitting in the fridge for 10 or more days. My family member who ate the food had major stomach ache. More over I also saw the manger was looking at his watch since the time party started...he was trying to shut the party down as soon as he could. So don't go there if you really want to enjoy your party. N. Brunswick food inspector or some police officer if you are reading : Pls shut down this place and save some lives please, before some one gets seriously food poisoned again!!!
