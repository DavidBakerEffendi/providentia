I have no idea what some people are talking about on here! This place is awesome! Food is amazing and creative, drinks are fabulous, the decor is on-point and hip, service is good, I love the happy vibe, location is great.... Clearly, some people have their heads up their butts because this place is just great! The only thing that's a tiny bit of an issue is the seating and parking is a bit confusing; other than that, once you get there, this place keeps you for sure! I am a fan! =)
