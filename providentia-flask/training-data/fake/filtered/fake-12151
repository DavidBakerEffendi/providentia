First time there this weekend to celebrate a birthday, and a great experience. The staff was friendly, and the menu is really vast, a little bit of something for everyone. I recommend the Hot Antipasto appetizer which gives a really big sampling of a few specialties on the appetizer menu. It was more than enough for two people to share, and so tasty. Everything was perfectly done, quaint, just a great place in general. I will definitely go again.
