I used to love Roberta's. I used to go to Roberta's every chance I got, and when I got the opportunity to take a few visiting friends, I jumped on it. We were told the wait would be 30 to 45 minutes, and waited outside at the bar for an hour, when a hostess came up and told us it would be an extra 15 minutes. Fine. It began raining. We were told to wait another 15 minutes. Food was served at the outdoor bar area, but when we asked to be served, we were told that table had already ordered before it rained so they had to be served. Fine. Another 15 minutes asked of us. After 2 hours I asked the hostess to serve us outside as they had done with the other guests, and she looked me straight in the eye and said that they didn't have food served there. I said we watched them eat it next to us. She looked around and said like it was a challenge, "I don't see any food." Not fine. I stopped the waiters and asked them to confirm. They did. She rolled her eyes and avoided our table for another 20 minutes until someone came outside and took us in. When I told them half the party had left because we waited 2.5 hours, they offered us free bread but no apologies. It arrived after our pizza. We were charged for it. Don't ask me why I waited 2.5 hours. I loved Roberta's that much. That being said, I will never go back. I have never been treated that poorly at a restaurant without any apology or offer to compensate us for our patience. Roberta's, you are dead to me.
