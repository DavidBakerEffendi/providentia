This is one of my favorite places in Philadelphia and should be a stop on every tourist's list.   While many convention people come by during their lunch hour, few realize that the market has evolved and changed over time, but still remains close to its roots--as a  place for every day Philadelphians to buy food to prepare at home.  So many of us take the Terminal for granted, and expect to run into at least one person we know there, whether shopping for dinner or grabbing a quick bite.   My favorites are 12th Street Cantina, Le Bus Bread, The Tea Shop, Termini Bakery, and Salumeria.  And I really do love the beer garden, which is a great place to hang out on a Saturday afternoon. Don't be afraid to ask someone if you can share their table when it is busy.  You might make a new friend!
