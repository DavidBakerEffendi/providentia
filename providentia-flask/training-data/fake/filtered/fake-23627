This place is so overrated and overpriced.  Yes, Overpriced.  Bring your money and go somewhere else.   I really have a hard time to understand where the good reviews come from.  We ordered the burger and french toast, the burger was $20 (cost is $3 the most) and the french toast with blueberry sauce was $15 (cost is $2 the most), the price is not justified because the rent should not be expensive and the decoration is ancient.  Besides the ridiculous price, the service is average and took them 25-30 mins to bring us the food.   I was on my way out the door not to prolong the suffering from the wait , but the food just came across us so we went back to our table and eat them while we were starving. Whoever wrote good reviews of the burger, I encourage to think again that you just paid $20 for a burger that does not even come with tomato and lettuce.   A burger from Shake Shack is tastier at a fraction of the cost.   If you look for burger,  read this review from cbs.   newyork.cbslocal.com/top… I could not find any good words to describe this place, service: 2, food: 2.5; decoration: 2; price: 1.  Meh .......
