Frankly I find this place overpriced and overrated everytime I come. I've been a handful of times over the years and I just dont get the hype. Its always packed even if you make a reservation and there are plenty of other places you can get better food. If youre looking for someplace on the "fancy" side and with a lot of "esteem," you can certianly find a way better meal nearby and still pay 100 bucks ----before you include booze ofcourse
