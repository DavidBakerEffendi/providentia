Loved Bubbys! I wish I was there right now eating pancakes. My husband and I stayed in Tribeca for Valentine's weekend and Bubby's featured prominently. The first night, we ordered take-out. Fried chicken with rosemary-bacon mac and cheese, pickled beets, collard greens, cornbread and chocolate cake. The portions were huge and we easily could have just split the chicken (breast, leg, wing) and the two sides it came with and still have had some left over. It was all really, really good. For take-out, they had it ready fast and it was nice and hot when we got back to the hotel. We went to brunch on Sunday morning and got in around 9:30 just before the rush. Big line outside when we were leaving. We had the Michigan pancakes with sour cherries - seriously the best pancakes I've had in years. Thick, fluffy, flavorful....and again an enormous portion that is easily enough for two people. I also had a side of bacon which was okay - I liked how thickly-cut it was and it was perfectly crispy, but needed some smoke or something to boost the flavor. My husband had matzoh ball soup and the biscuits - flaky, fluffy, perfect biscuits that you can only get by using lard :) I didn't taste the soup, but it looked great - lots of veggies and chicken and two matzoh balls. He was very happy with it. Service: overall it is great - very friendly, efficient, fast, and welcoming. Â Our waiter for brunch did become a little less friendly when we declined to order drinks...Other than that, we had two great experiences there and can't wait to go back.
