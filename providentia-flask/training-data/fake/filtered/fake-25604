This hidden gem may not look like much from the outside but I can assure its worth every last bit of naan to check out. I am an advent Indian food cuisine connoisseur if you will, and have been to some of the best of em and this matches up quite nicely if not exceeds their tastes. As soon as I walked in I was taken care of extremely well by the restaurant owner. The food was prepared and ready for me rather quickly and as for the taste...AMAZING!!! Especially for the price. It has the cheapest prices in town and that goes without sacrificing quality in the least. So If your in the area or simply just in the mood for some really good authentic Indian food that we've all come to love so much then Bombay Grill is where you wanna be.
