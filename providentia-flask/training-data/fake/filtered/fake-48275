HEAVEN ON EARTH. If you're in the east village, def. stop by! It's a hole in the wall, but all they make is fries, all day long and have the most delicious sauces to choose from!! Soo good! Bring a friend!! You won't be disappointed. PS- they totally let you try different sauces before you order, so do that if you are having a hard time choosing!!
