We were passing through NY recently for my husband's 30th birthday and a few friends recommended this new restaurant near their apartment. He wanted to go somewhere else but I am so glad we convinced him to try something new. The venue is beautiful, and the food delicious - simple food, done well, and with a little twist (eg the carrot, ginger and lemon soup is enlivened by toasted chilli marshmallow). The best thing, for me, was the cocktails. They even make their own whiskey! Try the chocolate souffle with S+P whiskey - you'll want seconds. We will definitely be back!
