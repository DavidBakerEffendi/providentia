We both had the Eggs Benedict. Fresh focaccia bread holding up two perfectly poached eggs and bacon. It was the hollandaise that blew me away. Every bite hinted of warm lemon meringue pie. The service was outstanding but the old school wooden folding chair made this 260lb reviewer a bit nervous. I'll be back!
