100 % NOT RECOMMENDED, it's so dirty !! Before Paris open, i always go to Banh Mi Saigon because I have no other choice, it's near my school and i love to eat banh mi. But now THANK GOD Paris open, why? Let me tell you my experience in Saigon... One time i just got off school and i was starving because i didn't eat anything all day, and I didn't have too much cash because I just paid for the books so i decided to go for a Vietnamese sandwich because it's cheap and i knew it would fill my stomach. So i went there to order the the #1, the pork banh mi. The bread was pretty big for that price,the pickled vege was not bad but the meat was too salty. I then ordered a che ba mao, the viet 3 color dessert to go. When I got home  omg...that night was one of the worst night in my life , i had the most painful stomaches and  diarrhea for 2 hours....then the whole night my stomach was on and off in pain  for a very long time...i almost slept in the bathroom.... The worst thing is that I had to go to my first class of the semester the next day so i had no choice but taking a lot of pepto bismol. I didn't know if it was the sandwich made me sick or the che made me sick, i knew  that was all i eat all day because i was so busy running around getting books in the campus...but i am sure it was this place that made my day so unforgettable. I am definitely telling all my friends about my experience and i'll never go again !!!
