We originally were going to have dinner at Barbuzzo, but decided to try Spice 28 instead. The reviews on Yelp seemed encouraging and it seemed like the place was going for a different experience than a typical old-hat Szechuan Chinese place. I'm really glad we went; It was a great experience. The service was prompt and friendly, and the menu (especially the appetizers) was creative, tasty, and rather reasonable. Overall, the food was really good, especially the ahi tuna dumplings that others on Yelp have mentioned. It was just my wife and me, so we only tried one entree, the dry pot chicken, which was good. I wish we had more people with us so we could have tried more of the menu. We went late (around 10pm) and, since it wasn't too crowded, were able to chat with the wait staff and the owner. Â They were all very friendly and interested to hear what we thought about the restaurant and the food. It's nice to see a legitimate Chinese restaurant that isn't just a copy-cat take out or PF Chang ripoff. I will definitely be going back here over the next few weeks, and hope to bring some friends so I can try a more diverse sampling of their very intriguing menu. My suggestions: 1) Get that liquor license, pronto. BYOB is cool and all, but if the cocktails are as unique as the food, it should be a great place for drinks. 2) Once you're off and running, hire a wait staff to go with the chic and trendy ambience; the waiter we had, while helpful, didn't have a great ability to articulate what made specific dishes special. But, like I said, we went pretty late so maybe the staff is different during prime time. 3) Consider giving patrons chopsticks by default. It just feels weird for me to eat asian-y food with a fork and knife, and I didn't even grow up using chopsticks.
