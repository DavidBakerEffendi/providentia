I wish I could give more stars to this place, since the food is terrific.  But I was there on a date and one table had one woman who was very loud.  The management refused to speak to them about it.  It was so loud that other guests had to be moved to a different table.  Management should really take more care to make sure that all their guests, not just attractive drunk women, enjoy themselves.  I could hardly hear my date and she could hardly hear me.  We joked about having been left "deaf" on the way back to her place, but the noise detracted from the experience.
