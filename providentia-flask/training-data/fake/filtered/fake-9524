We ate there last Friday and arrived at 8, so basically the worst time on the worst day you can go to any restaurant. They told us it would be about an hour through an hour and a half but we weren't in a rush so went to an area bar and headed back for our table an hour later. It's not an ideal setup if you're a 2-top, as there aren't that many ideal 2-top tables, but the room is lovely, including the bar. The menu reads nicely. In the end we started with a bronzino crudo with green tomatoes, and a simple green salad with gorgonzola. The crudo was fantastic, if maybe a little salty. The salad was tasty, but wouldn't have minded a little more gorgonzola. We had originally tried to order an italian pinot noir, but they were out of it so tried a Dolcetto instead. I've never sent back a bottle, but I was not loving this one (really boozy and particularly tanic, even for a dolcetto-13.5%! abv). I wasn't sure what to do, but the server, after seeing we weren't thrilled, took it upon herself to speak to the owner, who happily offered to swap it out for something else. My point is, the service over all was really fantastic, and this is a tight space that had every seat filled. We had the roast chicken and fluke as mains, and both were very tasty; although, the polenta that came with the chicken was just meh. The chicken was very juicy, and the fluke was also cooked perfectly. Â We split the chocolate pudding for dessert which was great, with sea salt and olive oil (maybe a little too much cinnamon in the mix?) I think this is a place I would go back to. The menu reads like a more italian version of Farm on Adderley, it's got a homey room, and the service was fantastic. Good addition to the neighborhood. Probably best to avoid on fri/sat unless you want to wait a while.
