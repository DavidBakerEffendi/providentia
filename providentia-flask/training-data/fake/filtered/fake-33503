Holy crap... this is the best restaurant in Brooklyn.  Such a comfortable atmosphere and some of the nicest people I have ever met on staff.  I live in Queens and have been just about everywhere in the city and this is by far one of my favorites.  If you haven't had a chance to check it out put it on your to do list!  xo
