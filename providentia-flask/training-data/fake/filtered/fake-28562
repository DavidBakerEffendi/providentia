Come here for the food (which is pretty good). It's pricey, though, especially for college students. The servers are pretty rude, and the delivery guy never seems to be there. They also seem to take a break every day from 2pm - 4:30pm, so service can be erratic. Variable delivery times, ranging from 40 minutes to 2 hours (yes 2).
