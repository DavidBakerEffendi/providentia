Waited 40 minutes for a large. Moots with pepperoni & mushroom. Waitress was nice, pizza was also good. Waitress realized that order had not been " sent in" after 30 minutes. A nice couple at adjoining table noticed that we were waiting for an extended period & offered us a few slices of their pizza Return doubtful
