If Modern Apizza on State Street didn't exist, I'd consider this the best pizza on Earth and give Pepe's five stars; the four star rating should be interpreted relatively. You'll really love the pies here. Pepe's has a style similar to Modern's, with sweet sauce and tangy cheese, plus just the right amount of charring on the dough. They also have a couple other advantages: the most pleasant decor of the Big Three, plus extra capacity in The Spot next door (which was the original restaurant and still serves the same pies). I think Pepe's pies are slightly better than those at Sally's down the street, but there are plenty of Sally's aficionados who will disagree. One thing that can't be argued, however, is that Sally's is much smaller and does not seat people in the order in which they arrive: their pies are available to VIPs first and you second ... or third ... or fiftieth, spending on when you show up and how many friends of the family walk casually in before you, ignoring the line. This means that if you actually want to eat pizza on Wooster Street, and not just watch other people eating it, Pepe's is the better bet.
