I was in New York for the weekend and staying with a friend who lives near this cute neighborhood bistro. I liked the feel of it and seemed people knew each other which attests to its appeal for locals. My friend and I had cocktails to start (try the Sciolto! It's wonderful!) and then moved to wine after that. They have a nice wine list that works well with their food. We shared everything (that works well) - we had the giardiniera (wonderful!), the beets and a 3 cheese plate. We also shared the daily pasta special with clams and the veal and porcini mushrooms. And do NOT miss the tiramisu! The food was excellent - fresh and interesting and the service was attentive yet relaxed. We sat at the bar and chatted with the bartender. I will make sure to be back next time I am in New York!
