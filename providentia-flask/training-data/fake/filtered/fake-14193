Amazing burgers!  Big, juicy, home-made, delicious.  That's all I've ordered at Molly's, because they're too good to pass up. Great atmosphere, with a nice warm fireplace.  Another review said this place was what "New York bars used to be like pre-Guiliani", which made it sound a little rough.  But it's not at all...it's just a laid back bar with sawdust on the floor.
