Amazing service, dog friendly and they indeed treated my dog with such respect and love.i really loved it. the waiter,mark, was awesome, so were the hostess, food runner and manager, who came outside (it was cold) to greet us and my dog and brought him treats. great food, excellent fast, good wine selection and price. definitely i will return. awesome food and wine and made my night.glad Â i live just a block from them. a sure 5 stars.
