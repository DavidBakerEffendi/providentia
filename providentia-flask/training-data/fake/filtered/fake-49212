Heard talk about this place from a colleague of mine, whom said it was quite delightful. Took a chance and made a stop by for an early dinner to check the place out. Great atmosphere, aquarium was very tasteful, Hostess seem very pleasant and gave a short summary about the menu as well as a quick tour for my seating preference. I went for a subtle by the sushi bar area, close to the aquarium. My server was very knowledgeable about the menu explained and answered my questions very well. I went for the coconut Wine and butter poached salmon which was extremely delicious and choose the fried caramel banana cheesecake which was just as delicious as the entree. Service was timely and had the manager come check on tables to see if everything was in order. I do appreciate the staff of the Dragonfly to touch base in every way to accommodate my needs, great food, great service. Will be returning ! Would love to see more fish in the aquarium however.
