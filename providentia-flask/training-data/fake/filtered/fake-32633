I loved this diner the first time I went there for lunch with my daughter 7 years ago.  The first thing I noticed was how very friendly everyone was. I thought they had us confused with someone else.  The food was excellent and the coffee was out of this world!. Since then I have been coming to this diner at least a couple of times a week. They spend more time and effort to cook the meals using the best oils. When I order poached eggs they are done exactly as I requested and they are simply the best ever. You will be hard pressed to find a more friendly owner and group of waitresses. I highly recommend this diner.  It is definitely a must to stop in and see for yourself
