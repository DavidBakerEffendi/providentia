When it was Danny O's it was a dive bar full of nearly homeless, hookers, and cokeheads.  Now that it's been cleaned up, it's a dive bar full of nearly homeless, hookers, and cokeheads.  And their "star" bartender (a guy) beat up a female patron (also a bartender there) last week, but wasn't fired.  I was there a month ago and the service was lousy, the patrons downright mean and after hearing about last week I am recommending that nobody go there.
