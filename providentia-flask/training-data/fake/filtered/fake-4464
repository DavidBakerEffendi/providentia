Horrible restaurant. We went there for lunch. For one thing, it's filthy. My napkin stuck to the sticky tabletop. Secondly, the service was awful. There were like four customers in the place and yet we waited like twenty minutes for our drinks. Thirdly, I ordered the huevos rancheros and it was without a doubt the WORST I have ever had it. Two eggs coated with some black bean sauce, barely a handful of black beans, on a taco, with a few greasy harsh browns. The only positive feature was the free nachos with decent salsa. Otherwise disgusting. Stay away.
