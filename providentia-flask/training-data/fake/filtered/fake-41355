We just came from dining at NEB. We waited for over an hour for our food , and this when the restaurant wasn't full either. The Reuben sandwich was the highlight. Chicken rustica had no veggies except limp charred Brussels sprouts. the worst was steak frite. It was the toughest piece of meat I ever ate. Since the steak took over an hour to cook , they left the fries with cheese on the food warmer. Guess what- the fries became limp and greasy with absolute hardened cheese on top Awful ! Never going back there again
