My wife and I sat at the bar for lunch, assuming that it would be quicker than waiting for a table.  After waiting an hour, we still did not receive our food.  The bar was nice and the bartender friendly and apologetic for the wait, but it was terrible having to wait that long with nothing in return (except for a beer).  We paid for our drinks and left without receiving our food.  This is NOT a place to go if you have a time constraint.  It might even be a good idea to eat before you go.
