My go-to. Great prices, large portions. Love the massaman curry and pad see ew. Quick service. They can make everything without fish sauce and egg which can't be said for Q2 thai and some other thai restaurants in the city. Only cons are long waits and dark lighting (food+drink+dark atmosphere = nap time)
