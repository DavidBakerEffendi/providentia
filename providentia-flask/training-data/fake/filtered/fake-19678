I always jump at the chance to try a new place to dine, especially in Brooklyn.  When a friend mentioned Peaches, I was very excited to try.  Unfortunate for me, I did not have a good experience this past Labor Day weekend.  The food was "okay" at best.  My scrambled eggs were extremely wet and runny; my french toast was burned on one side; and the potatoes were very hard and overcooked.  In spite of the bad food, this was not the most disappointing thing.  I was most disappointed in the poor customer service.  It took almost 20 minutes for the staff to acknowledge me and my friend after we had already been seated.  I actually had to flag down a waiter as if I was calling out an SOS on a deserted island. If it hadn't been for the fact that I was extremely hungry and did not want to have to start the process all over again somewhere else, I would have gotten up and left.   After our order was finally taken and the food was delivered, the wait staff NEVER came back to check on us to see if we need (1) additional napkins; (2) condiments; (3) water / refill of beverages; or anything else.  Unfortunately, I cannot support a restaurant like this.  Service trumps everything to me and this place made a terrible first impression.  I do hope for the owner's sake that they "get it" and change the way they handle their front office - client interaction.
