The best pizza place I've found in the area.  Dough is not remotely tough, sauce is a bit sweet and pizza is freshly made.  It's not five star pizza, but they get extra points for being very nice people.   FYI Yelp map is off a bit - they're near the corner of Newark Pompton Turnpike and Main Street.
