Love their Tuesday deal with Guinness and oysters ($12 for a pint and 6 oysters), plus live Irish music!! Hard to beat! The only drawback was the service was a bit slow and we waited a while for our water glasses to be filled, even after asking our server numerous times. It was okay though, the music kept us entertained while we waited.
