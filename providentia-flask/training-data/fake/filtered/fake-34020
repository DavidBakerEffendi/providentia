Excellent service, great ambience, awesome carribean style restaurant. My wife and I had lunch here and we must say, we were impressed with everything. From the smart menu in an otterbox type frame, simple with not so many items, but just enough to leave your mouth watering and curious of every item. Anyway, lets get to the most important part, the food. I had jerked chicken wings with okra fries. I must say, ive eaten at plenty carib. spots but this jerked chicken takes the cake.  I love spicy food and this was right down my alley and I love that they have a non spicy bbq option as well if thats not your thing (my wife). It wasnt hot sauce type spicy,  it was a natural spicy that was spicy because of the natural herbs and spices! I prefer okra fries over all fries now as well, thats how good they were(this was my first time eating okra fries). Theyre fried in a special plantain flour that make your mouth water as you eat them. My wife had the salmon burger with chips. You cant go wrong with the salmon burger, seasoned and cooked to perfection served with chips [(also can be served with okra fries (recommended)]. Even the chips were made with a seasoning they make there that was absolutely delicious. And all this was washed down with a wonderfully made sorrel which is one of my favorite carribbean drinks(served non-alcoholic, but restaurant is B.Y.O.B so bring rum if you want it loaded!). Oh and the water is served with a lemon and a cucumber slice which makes it so refreshing it might be illegal. This place is truly special because of the way they cook healthy food, it leaves wanting more plus you leave feeling better than when you came in. This is a truly special place which I will come to frequently because I feel it truly is vital, all pun intended!
