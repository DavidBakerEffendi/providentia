To me, this is the ideal cafe.  It is big and inviting, with lots of tables and space to spread out.  They serve enticing-looking baked goods, coffee drinks and sandwiches, along with the famous ice cream and blend-ins.  There is music on Saturday evenings and a general nice vibe.  Definitely a nice place to meet a friend or just relax.
