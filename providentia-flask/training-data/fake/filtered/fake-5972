Bottom line:  Great American bistro on a side street in the heart of the Flatiron district that has a billiards room in the back!   Tips:   Check-in to Almond on Foursquare for a free app / side dish!   Ask for Brad as your waiter - he's as sweet as the French Toast. Food: It's hard not to fill up on the delicious biscuits and jam that come to the table as soon as you're seated.  But knowing what's still to come, pace yourself!  So much goodness, so little space in the belly! As a Foursquare check-in special, we selected a side order of the homemade brioche French toast with bananas, walnuts and dried cranberries - perfect French Toast!  Not too thick, syrup on the side, and just the way I like it - crunchy on the edges. The presentation of my Huevos Rancheros with red and green chili and black bean refritos was nice (see pic below) but it soon became a mish mosh of eggs, tortilla, beans, and chili on the plate.  Probably not the best choice on a brunch date, but if you don't mind asking for extra napkins and owning the messiness, go for it!  Just a hint of spicy, too! Omelette of Braised Greens with goat cheese was described by my friend Kathleen as "one of the best omelettes I've ever had" - and she is even more of a brunchaholic than I am!  She did ask to have the dish without the tomatoes, but the braised greens and fluffy eggs were cooked to perfection. Drink: No drink specials, but an extensive wine list! Atmosphere: Rustic, casual, spread out.  Even as it gets crowded, there's always room to move about - even in the coveted outdoor space, you won't feel crammed in.  The billiards room adds a special charm that you can't find everywhere.
