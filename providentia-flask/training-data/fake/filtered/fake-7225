I've been to Fork on several occasions. I would say that the food is very good but not the type of dishes that would wow me to tell my friends about. The specialness about Fork lies in their attention to detail and service. The bar area is a great place to catch a good view of things, enjoy your meal, and have a nice cocktail. Also, they shine with their seafood dishes. I realize its American bistro food, but there is something missing that in the flavor department. Again, the food is consistent and good, just missing the 'wow' factor.
