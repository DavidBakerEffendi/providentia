We just ate here last Saturday for my sister's 25th birthday. I had a great time! The restaurant is absolutely GORGEOUS and we got a really nice table inside right by the window overlooking the water. You can also eat outside and I would like to try that out if I ever return. It's a very romantic atmosphere and there were many couples on dates as well as a wedding taking place while we were there. Our waiter was amazing! I really wish I knew his name. He had such a fun personality and great sense of humor. He had us all laughing and he really knew his stuff when it came to the menu. Even though the tip was automatically included in the bill because we were a party larger than 6, he still went above and beyond for us and helped make our whole experience great. I got the pecan dijon salmon and it was delicious - tender and juicy, over mashed potatoes with perfectly cooked vegetables on the side. I also got the oatmeal cookie martini and it was incredible.. definitely one of the best martinis I've ever had! My dad got the bass and my brother got the lobster pasta which they both enjoyed. Unfortunately, my sister and mother got the steak and were a little underwhelmed by their meals. My sister's steak came out a little too pink but our waiter was more than happy to take it back and fix that for her. They also gave my sister a complimentary piece of cake with a birthday candle on it which a message in frosting on the place that said "Happy 25th birthday!" The rest of us decided to get desserts, too. I got the chocolate souffle and it was delicious. The bill came to a little over $300, but for the atmosphere, food, and service we received, I think it was well worth it. I hope to be back some time soon on a date! ;-) I also recommended this place to my good friend who will be proposing to his girlfriend soon.
