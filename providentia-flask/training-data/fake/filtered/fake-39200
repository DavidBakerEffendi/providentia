We were lucky enough to visit Lillie's on the first night of our 6 night stay in NYC - what a cool bar with unique d√©cor, a great vibe and special staff. The warm welcomes and great service and recommendations from Jessica made Lillie's become our local bar for the rest of the week. The Tuesday night live band was awesome and fun to hang with and helped make our birthday celebrations very special. The fact that the cocktails and craft beers were never disappointing also helped a lot! Thanks to Jessica, and her colleagues, for providing us with good times and great company and also a special thanks to Naesha for her friendly service and lovely smile. We will be back!
