The specialty rolls are delicious. Great value for the price. Sashimi and sushi are fresh. I try to go there after the lunch rush - around 1:30pm or later - because you get better service that way. One time, I made the mistake of going there just a few minutes after Â 1pm, and although I was able to find a free table immediately, I had to wait 20 minutes just to get a menu, and another half an hour for the food. That experience docked 2 stars from this review.
