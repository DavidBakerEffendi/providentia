A couple of us came here for a special occasion and it was pretty fun.  Unfortunately, we were seated on the lower level, so it wasn't as great as it could have been.  There is a live band that plays on the first level so it would have been awesome to sit up there with the band.  Anyway, we had a few mojitos (yummy!) so I guess it was alright.  We tried the ceviche, emapanadas, ropa vieja, and the churrasco.  The ceviche was really good and so was the churrasco.  Everyone on yelp raves about the ropa vieja, and while it was good, I just liked the flavors of the churrasco much better.  I'm sure we'll return for round 2 some time, and hopefully be seated where the band plays!  Also, there is an old dude that rolls cigars at the front of the restaurant - not sure if you can buy them though.  But why else would they have him?!
