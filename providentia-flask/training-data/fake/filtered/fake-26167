Placed take out order for two. Got there and they had 5 Blt's ready to go. Told them I didn't order and one of the owner's/ "cook"(questionable as far as cook) comes out and TELLS me I did. Told him I'm not paying for what I didn't order (he's still insisting that I ordered 5 Blt's). Then he told me never to order from them again (very snotty). Long story short. Food sucked, customer service sucked and their owner has bad business etiquette. NOT WORTH THE HASSLE!
