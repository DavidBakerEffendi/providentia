My family and I visited Talk of the Town recently and we were very pleased! The owner was very helpful and courteous. Restaurant was clean and had many small tables. By the time we left it was packed! It, of course, featured a Bollywood movie playing on a TV for everyone's entertainment. We ordered 2 samosa, aloo tikki chaat and gobi paratha. My daughter (4) had some basmati rice and dahi, with a few tastes of our spicier selections. The chaat was seriously delicious and I think next time we will order more of that. Paratha was also very good. It wasn't dry and it had a nice spice level (even being mild, lol!) and the raita and pickle were super tasty. Â I would say the samosa was just alright, perhaps it's more of a south Indian type style that I am not used to. Sauces on the side were spiced nicely. We wanted to order dessert but we were very full; next time. Thank you!
