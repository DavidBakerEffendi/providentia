I went here with a coupon from a popular internet site. it was an inexpensive night out so i can't complain that much. la fourno is not a fine dining establishment. the front part of the place is a pizzeria. it was very loud. our waiter was fairly clueless. the zupa di marre was good though. i wouldn't go back, especially with so many better italian options in the neighborhood.
