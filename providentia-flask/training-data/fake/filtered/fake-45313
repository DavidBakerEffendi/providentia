Hit or miss.  I have been to Rizzuto's many times and have several decent experiences with excellent service and good food, but the last two or three times were very disappointing.  Went last night for dinner with the family and it was not good at all.  About ten minutes after ordering the waiter returned to inform me that they were out of the flat iron steak I had ordered (it was 6. P.m. So not sure when they ran out) despite it being a regular item on the menu.  The menu had no other beef option so I ordered the chicken piccata which was soaked in butter and overcooked without much seasoning at all.  Not only were they out of the steak, they also brought my son a shrimp dish that he did not order for an entree.  Not sure if we will risk another night out at Rizzuto's.
