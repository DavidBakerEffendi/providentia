I love their Chives And Pork Fried Dumplings. They are cheap and good. Don't go to dumpling house which is very close to prosperity dumpling. The dumpling house is more expensive and not that good. However, when I bought their frozen Chives And Pork Fried Dumplings and cooked them home, I have noticed how much fat came out of them, and it was too oily to eat. I guess I need to know a better way of cooking them or try boiled one.
