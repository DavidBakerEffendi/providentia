In the mall it's like $6 for a small one and fries. I'd pay $6 ANY day for the lamb & rice and you get A LOT! Totally worth it for a NY Tourist trying to save some money. Has enough to share with someone else! Thank YOU YELP and REVIEWERS for all your help! My NYC wouldn't have been the same without you! What I LOVE is all the "local" spots not just the "advertised famous spots to go to".
