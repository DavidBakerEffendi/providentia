This place is definitely an off-the-beaten-path gem in the LES.  The paninis and salads are super fresh and delicious.  Gaia, who is also the hard-working business owner, bakes her panini bread daily and after one bite, you'll wonder why you ever ate any other sandwich in your life.  The prices are ridiculously reasonable for the quality and amount of food.  I haven't tried the entree dishes yet - that's for future visits.  Impossible to regret a visit to this shop - Go!
