I've been meaning to write a post since August! Love love love.. First impressions say it all..Super friendly staff with manners!! They accommodated us (a large party of 30 plus kids) last minute and on their off day!! No place does that! Everyone's meal was delicious, fresh, and quality, the prices are excellent & it's BYOB which is awesome. They didn't rush our courses like other places either tend to do. Awesome secret gem! Can't wait to return.
