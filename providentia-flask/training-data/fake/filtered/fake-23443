Glad we popped-in unplanned this past Sunday night over Memorial Day weekend 2013. Was at Dylan's Candy Bar and noticed it so I pulled up my Yelp app on my phone and was sold. It's a clean, laid-back place so don't expect super amazing or lightning quick service. Almost like being in the Caribbean as far as the service and speed goes and that's not a complaint - just an observation over one trip in. Music was great and seemed loud at first but settled in nicely. Decor fine for a date that you're trying to impress. Not 5 star by any means but a solid 3-4 place with charm. The food spacing and timing was spot on and tasted pretty much excellent and drinks pretty tasty too although the small specialty rum drink at $12.50 was a little price shocker (even by NYC standards) compared to the reasonable $9.00 margarita served in a hurricane glass. The beef patties (more like empanada - in fact exactly like) were a great starter for two. Salads rock!!!! Overall just a great place so I wanted to chime in.....thanks Cabana
