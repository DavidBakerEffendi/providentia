First of all, would have been nice to know that they have a CASH ONLY policy before the check came.  I even looked on their website to double check the hours before we headed there.  Checked again after I got home to see if maybe I missed something, no mention of it anywhere.  Didn't notice a sign in the window, nothing on the menu, nothing to tell me until we received the check.  Luckily between my 3 daughters and I, we were able to dig enough cash out of our purses. Pizza was good although a tad oily.  Loved, loved loved the sauce. Crust was good.  Extremely disappointed in the house salad (the center of a head of iceberg, a chopped beet and sliced tomato o/v only). Soup was good.  Not much to choose from on the menu, no apps.  Basically, I'd recommend a plain pie and bowl of soup while you're waiting.  Oh yea, no free water either.  The decor could absolutely use some work.  That was very disappointing, verging on "ew".    Go on a week night and avoid the crowds.  Definitely not worth a long wait but good to grab a delish pie after a long day of work.
