WOULD HAVE BEEN 5 STARS BUT YOUR SERVICE SUCKS When I lived in Burlington I would get a pizza takeout and feast for two days.  I love your pizza, seriously love it.  But on the three occasions I visited the dining room alone I got the worst service of my life.  Each time.  Hey guess what I'm a great tipper and I don't ask for much.  But you know what I do need?  I need water.  And I need someone to bring me a bill, and my change.  Bare bones here people.  Maybe it would even be nice if you checked in with me after serving the pie to make sure it tasted good.   Three times I got sh*t service.  Three times.  What are you doing over there?  It was not crowded, it wasn't even a full dining room.  I got a small pie and a salad.  Not really what you would call high expectations.  Hello -- just water and the check please.  Serving 101.   Flatbread is one of only two places in my life I left a $0 tip.  This is why.  The pizza is terrific and I'm usually a great tipper (over 20%, especially when I'm alone, and I only just recently realized that most people calculate tip based on the total BEFORE tax.  I never even knew that). So right now I'm pretty much being Julia Roberts in pretty woman, walking past your window and holding up my multiple shopping bags and saying, "remember me?  you wouldn't wait on me yesterday?  you work on commission right?  big mistake.  big.  huge!" to be fair, the two times I've gone in with more than one person we had decent service.  i don't know why you hate single diners so much but it's only taking money out of your pocket.
