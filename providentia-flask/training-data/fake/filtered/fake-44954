Flippin' Awful! Ordered a Peperoni and Sausage pizza and received a Peperoni, sausage and mushroom pizza. Called them to complain and they said it would take another 35 minutes and also claimed that it was us (group order) trying to run a scam and get free food. Really? Extremely rude and disrespectful to customers and the wings were crap as well. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY HERE. I personally think the man who took our order purposefully messed up so that he could have it because in order to get a free pizza that was 'messed up', I have worked in a restaurant before, I know how the world works.
