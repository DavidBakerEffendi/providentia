Tried Chef Lin's for first time today.  No online menu but phone was answered clearly and my questions were answered and the order was correct.  General Tso's chicken was excellent, rice was not overcooked, wonton soup was very good and so was the pepper steak. Egg rolls and spring rolls were hot and crispy.  Food was all very fresh and hot and well flavored.  I will be ordering again.
