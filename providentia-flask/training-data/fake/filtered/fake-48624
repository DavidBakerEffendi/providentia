We went to this place, a mile down the road, because they had a restaurant.com certificate. While it looks like a basic pizza parlor from outside, it has a nice restaurant and the decor in similar to something you would see in the city, older building decorated with an old world charm - really sweet. It is a byob, which is a plus sometimes. Being someone who cooks well and often, I am usually a critic. I ordered egglplant rollantini and it was excellent. It was cooked homestyle, and the ricotta was fresh ricotta, almost unheard even in the 'top' restaurants in the Princeton/Montgomery area; I knkow the tast immediately. The filling also had spinach - not frozen but fresh baby spinach. The sause was a delicious tomator based marinara. My fiance had scallops with risotto and vegetables. We both eat healthy and always fresh ingredients - that said, he was very impressed with the preparation and flavor of his food. We will definitely try here again. Truly a great casual place with a 'real' family cooking the food. You can tell by the preparation and taste.
