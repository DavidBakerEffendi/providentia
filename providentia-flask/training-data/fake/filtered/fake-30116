We love going to eat here!  We've brought so many of our friends and family here so they can love it too.  The tzatziki and hummus are delicious!   I haven't found anything on the menu that I don't like. The fried zucchini appetizer with the garlic dip is amazing!  The service is personal and friendly.  I love that it's bring your own. For dinner, I recommend the chicken platter or the Chicken Mykonos special with orzo.  All of the desserts are delicious as well.  I would highly recommend this restaurant to everyone!!
