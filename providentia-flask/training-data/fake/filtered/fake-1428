A group of girlfriends and I came in saturday night for dinner and drinks. The outside patio was full and on a 45 minute wait. We went inside to the bar and waited outside at a high top table till our tAble was ready (about 30 minutes later). Once we sat, we got a shrimp flatbread and crab & melon for apps... they both were delicious!!! for dinner, all of us had salads.Everyone of the salads was good, although the chicken on mine was not very warm. Overall, we were very happy with the service and the meal, and of course the cocktails! Our server was very friendly and saw how pleased we were. In the checkbook, the restaurant hands out not only comment cards but business card sized papers encouraging guests to go on tripadvisor and yelp. I thought that was a great way to advertise what they are doing in social media and decided to sign up!! Thanks for another good ladies night!
