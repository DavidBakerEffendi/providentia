Went there for the first time last night for dinner. The restaurant is very cozy, they mostly have long tables that you share with other guests, but they also have a couple of two tops and four tops. The atmosphere is very low key, so no need to dress up. They have an extensive wine list,  although they only offer 4 whites and 4 reds by the glass, which felt a tad limited,  but I was very happy with the choice the server recommended. The food is amazing! I felt like I was having a home cooked meal by my grandma.  Everything is prepped a la carte, so they are flexible on making modifications to the menu. My friend is vegetarian and has a few diet restrictions and they whipped up a pasta dish with olive oil and sautéed zucchini without a problem. We also got the cheese plate for an appetizer which came with delicious homemade plum preserves.  I got the rabbit dish that was served with a spinach and cheese torte slice - I devoured it all. For desert we got this warm cake that was topped with nuts and preserves and was served with a side of whipped cream. It was delicious!  They give you a huge piece so I would recommend splitting it with someone. The best part of the restaurant is, of course,  Anna. She does all the cooking and she makes a point to come and talk to each table for a while. She truly makes you feel welcome and comfortable. I look forward to being a regular here.
