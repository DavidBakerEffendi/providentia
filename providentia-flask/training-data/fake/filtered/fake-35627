Just wow.  So many games I felt like a kid again!  We had no idea there was an ugly sweater partty going on but it was really cool and helped get us in the holiday spirit.  The bartender helped us navigate the food menu, which looks pricey at first, but it was explained its all farm to table and local so we went for it.  Thought it would be just pub food but nope, it was Farmhouse level grub and we go there quite a bit.  Now we can eat, have a perfect beer pairing, AND play pinball.  So glad this place opened up.  The staff seemed really busy but got to us quickly anyway.  One employee, with an VERY ugly sweater and snowflake tatoo on his forehead (nametag said Blender?)  gave us his gifts from the event, and we tried to buy him a drink but he turned it down like a pro.  Can't wait to come back when it isnt so busy, did not know it was kid friendly so we hope to book a mellow birthday party.  Thanks Tilt for the awesome night!
