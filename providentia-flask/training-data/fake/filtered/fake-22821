Minor oversights... no hooks under the bar or in ANY seating area. Purses on the floor? Ew. Â OPENING night and the toilet seats in the ladies room were coming off the hinges. Used the space well and for German food, the menu is yummy. Huge well priced beers make up for the odd ping-pong tables (advertised as beer-pong??) and lack of atmosphere. STAFF IS WONDERFUL. Kudos to hiring team. One last comment - Steven, You've been open for a week now, and you had plenty of time to prepare - get a real website!!!!!
