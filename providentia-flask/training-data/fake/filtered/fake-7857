I have been to Sweetwaters several times in my life, having gorwn up in Burlington, and been here for the past 25 years.  I was never a hug fan of the place to be honest.  However I have gone 5 times in the past month and it mainly has to do with one of the best bartenders I have EVER had.  I have worked in restaurants, bars and catering companies my whole life, and have to say I wouldve hired her in a heartbeat.  Courteous, kind, knowledgable and a great conersationalist.  Our food orders and drinks were delivered promptly, She is the single reason we will come back again and again.  We can get food like that almost anywhere, but service like that is a diamond in the rough.  Kaleche was amazing!!!  We love her and will tell our friends about her and her service as long as she is there!  Thank you to Kaleche for bringing us back to Sweetwaters!  AND KEEPING OUR BUSINESS there.  I will definitely be booking parties there in the future as long as she is in the house.
