My overall experience at the Clinton St. Baking Company was completely satisfactory. I came here with my sister because we read some reviews with the guidebook. We arrived here around 1:40pm to Â avoid the peak hours, but still there were lots of people and we waited 2 hours; however, it was worth the wait !!!!! The quality of food and atmosphere were pretty good. We ordered 1 pancake and 1 sandwich. This pancake was amazing. It's very soft, sweet, and melted in my mouth. The combination with blueberry sauce was wonderful. At that time, we totally forgot that we were waiting for 2 hours. The sandwich was also really tasty. It's voluminous, but not heavy. We really loved it. The atmosphere of this restaurant was also really good. Inside of the restaurant was warm and clean, and the restroom was also really clean. Because there were many customers, this restaurant is vibrant with life ! However, this restaurant cannot accept credit or debit card, only cash is acceptable. Actually I only didn't like this point. However, this pancake is really great. You have to eat at least once in your life. I would definitely recommend coming here when you visit New York City !!!
