Was walking by and noticed them open for business but i was by myself and wasn't really in the mood to eat alone so i made plans with my girlfriend to come here during the weekend. We arrive around 8pm on a saturday and it was packed but we were greeted right away and luckily we got a table the moment we walked in. Our server Ron was awesome!! he gave us a breakdown right away and described everything properly! I got the Grindhouse with the elk and it was so good! my girlfriend got The Hudson Salad and she loved it. We shared a fries and onion ring combo and i loved the sauces that came with it ! i highly recommend the Special sauce!!!! We were too full to get desert but i will def get the Flourless chocolate cake. It was so good i came in 3 days later during the week adn got the lunch special with the standard, french fries and Draft soda. it was only 11.85$ before taxes! what a great deal with such good burgers! I highly recommend this place to anyone who wants a good burger!
