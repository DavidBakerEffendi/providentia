When I came here on a Tuesday, there were some great early bar specials. The hard cider was not too sweet, and my companions enjoyed their beers. As for food, it seems like this place does bar food well - burgers, sandwiches, anything friend. My Cajun chicken breast was very dry, but the rest of my meal was fine. My friends' entrees were hit or miss. The Asian noodle bowl was enormous. Pizzas all had burned crust. A few side items were missing and had to be requested. Our service was slow, but that may have been due to the fact that we were a large group hidden on the top floor.
