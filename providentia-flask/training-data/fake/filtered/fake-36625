I was told the burgers here was the best. The burger was great...everything else not so much. The drinks at Applebee's or Chilis r stronger, they didn't have a good selection of liquor. The waiter seemed more interested in holding a conversation with the bartender. When we walked up the door hostess was sitting at the bar after she sat us she went back to sitting at the bar. It took forever to get napkins, water and the check cause the waiter was talking to the bartender. If u want a good burger, horrible drinks and bad service I highly recommend.
