Thursday night, 7:30 the wait was just over an hour for 2, 14th party on the waiting list.  20-seat Ramen shop in Midtown West.  They will periodically check to see if you are on the list and cross you off if you are not waiting outside the restaurant.  For parties of 4 or more they will break you up into smaller groups. Once you're seated service is pretty quick.  Behind the counter they have three large pots of the soup stock going and use the rest of the compact space to prepare the other ingredients like blowtorching the char siu (so I'm fascinated by fire, sue me).  I had the Totto Miso Ramen which is the paitan chicken-broth ramen with a scoop of miso and ground pork.  The broth is a little different if you're used to the pork based tonkotsu ramen but it is still good.  The noodles were wavy and cooked to a firm consistency and the two pieces of char siu on top melted in my mouth.    The Totto Spicy Ramen had the same base and non-wavy noodles.
