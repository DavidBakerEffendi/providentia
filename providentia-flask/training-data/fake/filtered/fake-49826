Great for GLUTEN FREE!! My first experience at Xixa was incredible! The staff was extremely attentive to making sure I knew which dishes were safe for me to eat and which were not. I was dining with other people who are not gluten free so they made sure to warn me if something was brought out that was not safe for me. For the dishes that normally have gluten, they modified them so I would be able to eat them. I wish I remembered the waitress's name because she was one of the best I've ever had. I've never had such a great gluten free dining experience. I'm also sensitive to soy and they made sure to be attentive to that as well. Some of the dishes I recommend: rice and beans, flan with crab, brussel sprouts, ceviche, cantaloupe with haricot verts....really everything. It was all amazing! The atmosphere was great and service was excellent. I highly recommend this gem!
