This place is amazing. I'll admit I was skeptical of the some of the more adventurous items on the menu but I'm happy to say I'm dead wrong. The owner knows a lot about food and a lot about what people like--including aesthetics and just really, really high quality, sometimes local food. I also don't always love communal sitting, but I really haven't had a meal here that suffered from it. Great place and worth the money.
