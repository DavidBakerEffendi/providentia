I just ordered a large sub from here and just... wow. Been a while since I had a sub that satisfying and actually on the larger side. You know the ones. Where they are longer than your fore arm and thicker still. I loved it. Going to be my new sandwich place. If only they did online ordering, it'd be my dream place.
