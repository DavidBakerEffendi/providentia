I remember the last time I was there was 1996 and I took my family from Boston there and they loved it.  Now I live on the South West Coast near Vegas.  And I have tried Fajitas out here and they are nothing compared to Jose Tejas.  Trust me this place is great compared to most others that I have gone to.
