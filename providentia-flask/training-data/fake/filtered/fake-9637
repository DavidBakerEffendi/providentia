I grew up in the Burlington area and attended UVM. During those 4 years, we often made the trek to the Red Onion and even had them cater a few student association events. I now work downtown and have gone there at least once a month for lunch. Never again. I received unspeakably rude service there today, in front of out-of-town friends. The part-owner of the company was behind the counter and was incredibly boorish and offensive to them. She told us to "open her eyes and read the board" and also yelled out to us, IT WOULD REALLY HELP IF YOU HAD SOME CLUE BEFORE STEPPING UP TO THE COUNTER. This was all because my mother in law dared to order American cheese when it wasn't an option written down. My husband and I spoke up and she gave us and evil smile, total attitude, and continued to mutter under her breath. We had paid for our food and were standing there in shock. People behind us left and everything! NEVER AGAIN. They've lost my previously constant business and that of my co-workers, friends, and family.
