Owner advertises organic tea, yet when asked if food and juices are organic says he doesn't believe in organic! The combinations of crepes are weird and there is so much stuff that doesn't go together. Asked him if I could customize my crepe and got a response that if it's not on his menu it's probably no good. Asked for sauteed mushrooms and was told he has no pan...??Really.
