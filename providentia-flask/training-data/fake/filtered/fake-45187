We are long time S.O. residents who were anxious to try Ricalton's but have held off because of the unflattering reviews.  We finally did decide to give it a try and were VERY SATSFIED!  We ate downstairs in the cozy Snug where I had an excellent plate of Fish n Chips and my husband had the burger which he said was very good.  (We were told they just revamped the menu.) Aside from the good food I think what really impressed us was the knowledgeable and well trained bar staff which is a rare find these days.  You absolutely must visit the Snug at night to meet Jon and Cailin- they are very welcoming and personable.  Jon is an exceptional bartender having designed a number of fantastic signature cocktails!  We highly recommend Jon's "special coffee" (we have been sworn to secrecy on the ingredients but trust me you'll never order an Irish coffee after tasting this one) and his spin on a Tropical Lifesaver.    I tried his bourbon "South Bound" which is apparently a takeoff on an old prohibition classic.  Very creative!  Cailin knows the menu inside and out was very helpful in helping us decide what to try - also a refreshing change nowadays.   We checked out the upstairs restaurant and it had a good crowd.  They had an acoustic duo playing at just the right volume so that you could enjoy the music and still hold a conversation.  We plan on trying the menu there soon.  Also love that they have a fireplace! We definitely recommend the place and would suggest giving it another try if you were dissatisfied the first time around. The bartending staff at the Snug are 5 STAR.  We will have to eat there again before i give a 5 for the food but the food is a solid 4.
