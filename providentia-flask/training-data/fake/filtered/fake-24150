Hands down my favorite ramen in the city.  salty? yup.  fatty pork? yup.  the fact that quite a few people on this page are complaining about such things doesn't make sense.  Soy Sauce salty! Slow cooked pork is fatty!  So Good.  These are all the factors that build a perfect bowl of Ramen.  This place is consistent.  I eat here once a week and am never disappointed, the service is beyond attentive... Get the Kimchi and pork gyoza to start and then move on tot he "Basic" or "Minca Sio"  Simply said: "Minca is King".
