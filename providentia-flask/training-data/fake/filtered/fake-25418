Definitely one of the better pizza joints in New York though not the absolute best despite what many have written.  Pizzas come piping hot from the coal oven with a thin crust and melted fresh mozzarella.   Also, if you're looking for just a slice, you'll probably have to look somewhere else.  Not sure if they've changed the policy yet (probably not) but last time I was there, they only sold by the pie.
