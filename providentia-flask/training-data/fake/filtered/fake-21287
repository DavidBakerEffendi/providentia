I went to Bogota last week and this is the one place I will drive to Brooklyn for. Â The drink specials are awesome, especially the mojitos, the food is consistently good (vegetarian options adds points), and the service is friendly. Depending on the time you go, you may have to wait up to an hour, but when that has happened, I have either sat at the bar or walked by the stores of 5th ave to pass time. It can get loud by the bar, but who cares? People are enjoying themselves. All in all, a nice casual spot with good food and friendly service.
