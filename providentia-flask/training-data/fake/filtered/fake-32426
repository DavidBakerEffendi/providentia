I went to Via Quadronno to have a caffe latte based on the reviews . I have to admit it was a bit disappointing as the latte didn't pack much punch..in fact it was quite weak and for the price I'd rather make my own at home for $0.25 cup rather than pay $5. I didn't have any food so perhaps I'll go back and try a panini and I hope it's nothing like my latte experience.
