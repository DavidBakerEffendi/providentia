This is exactly what Forest Hills needed!! The food is delicious and their selection of beer is great. My favorite is Left Hand Milk Stout and their truffle fries are to die for! Friendly and efficient waiters and bartenders. great for groups but it can get pretty loud so not ideal for romantic dates! This place just needs to be bigger because it can get pretty crowded pretty quickly.
