So...got a flyer on my window while at another club-and the flyer looked hot so I figured-lets try it girlz! SOOO glad we did! The music was bumpin and on point the peeps were fly and the drinks were delicious-not to mention CHEAP!!! No joke-$6-$7 a drink!! wait...wait...the best part-I didn't have to stand outside in something that resembles a dog kennle to smoke!! u can totally smoke inside!! what an added plus! Went on a Friday night-can't wait til this weekend!
