I am a huge fan of sushi and sake of course.  No matter where I go, I cant seem to find a place that has the best of both worlds.  When I finally decided to try sushi lounge I couldnt believe they had the best sushi an tyku! This will definitely be my new go to spot when in jersey, especially cause the prices are so reasonable!
