My wife and I and our 13-year-old son went here on Valentine's Day. They told us that they weren't using the regular menu and that they had a special 5-course dinner prepared at $45 per person. At first we weren't pleased because they should have noted this when we made the reservation, but we decided to try it anyway. The owner and staff were incredibly nice and helpful. Our son wasn't interested in the dishes that were included in the special dinner and the owner offered to make him a veggie cheese steak, which he loved. And my wife and I both enjoyed the "seafood" meals quite a lot. The desserts were average. We definitely plan to go back next time we're in Philly to try the regular menu.
