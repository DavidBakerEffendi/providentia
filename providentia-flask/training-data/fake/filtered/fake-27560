Even though I've been gifted with living near by, I can say they place is worth ever mile traveled for their square. Nothing compares. You can taste quality in every bite. Their traditional "round" is decent nothing to brag about. The restaurant side is your typical family style italian restaurant . I'd Compare it to Don Pepes. I would also try ther spiking icec cream. Doesn't matter if it's the winter or summer, always delicious.
