I have been to Italy many times, and know italian cooking well. After reading the reviews I had high expectations for Il Pittore, I was disappointed. The appetizers were quite good, tasty and innovative. For the main course we ordered pasta, as the menu stated were all made in house, and I expected them to be great, they weren't. I had a lobster tortellini. If there was lobster in it, it was unrecognizable, I never tasted it, and the pasta was overcooked, sitting in a decent but not great sauce. That pasta dish was $$27 for an entree portion. My wife had a fusilli with crab. There was one piece of crab in this dish, and you could barely taste it.  We both ordered glasses of wine. The wine was good, but it was the smallest pour I have ever encountered in a restaurant. $14 for an italian white, was an outrageous price,  considering the tiny amount poured. Service was excellent, too bad the food wasn't.
