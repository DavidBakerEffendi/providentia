Just dropped in for a sampling of small plates and was thoroughly pleased!  There is plenty of variety, and lots of interesting ingredients delight the palate.  Try the drunken chicken livers or the duck confit appetizer. The mussels with fragole pasta is a must!  The interior is a careful period complement to this historic building. And here's to places that offer Ketel One and aren't limited to Tito vodka.  Perfectly attentive service made this an outstanding Village option.
