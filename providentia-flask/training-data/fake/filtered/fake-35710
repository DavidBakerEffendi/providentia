I don't know how this place passes the Health Departments inspection. One time my partner was there and told me he saw the guy cooking sneezed while cooking and didn't cover his mouth.   Another time I was told that a broccoli fell on the floor and the cook tossed it back into the pan. That's totally disgusting.  We all know critters run around in any restaurant floor. Why would you toss food from the floor back in the pan!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! PEOPLE, DON'T go there.
