This place was amazing. We had a party of 11 including 2 small kids and they treated us like royalty. Hard to recommend anything specific as everything was amazing - Go family style on the appetizers so you can try them all and share a pasta and a meat/fish dish with your date to get tastes of those. Or just go back again and again and again ....
