We went Â to Caseus last night. Party of 5. 30 dollars for a very small pitcher of sangria? The cheese plate had some of the smallest cheese slices I have ever seen. I have been to many wine bars and tapas places many in Manhattan and have never felt as ripped off as here. My daughter is a vegetarian a fact we told our waitress when we ordered. She ordered the salad special which clearly contained bacon or ham. The waitress insisted it was cheese and only relented after I insisted she remove the salad. What gives? I was very excited to finally be able to try this place but was extremely disappointed. Would not recommend this restaurant to anyone.
