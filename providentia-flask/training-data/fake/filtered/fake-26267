I was a frequent diner at The Terrace as recently as March 2011 and have to say that this is hands down some of the best food that I have ever had. I have brought family and friends, etc...and was always very pleased with the food and service. Jungle Curry, Terrace Salad, and Basil Fried RIce are among my family's favories. A part of the dining experience, however, is to feel that your privacy is being respected. With that said, the owner of this establishment was arrested for videotaping female patrons without their permission. Please see the following article for details: nhregister.com/articles/â€¦ Please use your discretion if you decide to eat here.
