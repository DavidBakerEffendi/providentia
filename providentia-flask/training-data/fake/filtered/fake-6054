A few formalities to be aware of before your visit: (1) it just opened so complaints in other reviews about inconsistent service are unfounded, unrealistic expectations; (2) cash only so far; (3) no take out; and (4) no veg option (yet, but in the works according to the staff).  Also, I have no experience with "real" ramen prior to visiting this establishment so please keep that in mind.  With that said, in a word, this was heavenly. I went just before the noon rush.  Seating is moderate and it was packed with 20-30 people within 10-15 minutes of my arrival.  The atmosphere is modern, fast causal.  The stero played great indie/punk music in another language which I enjoyed immensely.  There was no wait to order and I ordered the Karai in the regular size with an extra side of pork belly.  The clerk was very friendly when ordering (and humble when I asked her about veg options in the future).  I waited 2-4 minutes, my name was called, and I picked up my bowl at the counter (forks are nearby for those unfamiliar with chopsticks).  My order arrived before that of others perhaps due to a more complex meal waiting for an egg?  When my extra pork belly was ready, the CHEF hand delivered it humbly.  He was also very friendly and I tremendously appreciated his efforts primarily running the lunch rush orders and hand delivering an extra side during the lull while I was already being satiated by the bowel of Karai in front of me.  A regular sized bowl was a generous portion and filling for a guy like me of average height/weight.  The Karai was a medium spice in my opinion although I like spicy food so those inclined to less spicy options may find it more than medium heat.  The broth was rich, the pork belly tender and flavorful, and the noodles undeniably perfect.  A 5-star experience in comparison to all other noodle/broth experiences so far.
