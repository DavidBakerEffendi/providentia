I have to give this place a 5. cheap, delicious, quick, I must have tried almost everything on their menu and almost nothing on their menu has failed me so far (except for the Thai Salad-TOOOOO SPICY) and I do order from here almost all the time. This place is not specifically Thai its fusion, tastes like Thai mixed with indian, spanish and american all at once. Their plates always satisfy my taste buds!
