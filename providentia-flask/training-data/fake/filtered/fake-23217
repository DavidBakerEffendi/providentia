I love this place!  I am a sucker for good chorizo and theirs is great.  Try the chorizo nachos for happy hour, fantastic.  Also great cocktails, happy hour.  I love the cucumber margarita.  I have been here about 5 times and love sitting at the bar.  You can chat with the bartenders who will give you some free tastings if you are nice.  I didn't give it 5 stars because I don't love fish/seafood and there is a lot on the menu.  I wish they had a little more land roaming animals on the menu.  Friendly hands on owner is a plus.
