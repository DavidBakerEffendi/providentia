I didn't even want to give this place one star. The food was the absolute worst. My father and I went out for dinner and thought this place had a good vegetarian selection. The food we got was frozen and microwaved and came out in a minute. The staff was friendly so we felt bad and quietly finished our food. It is wayyyy over priced. 31 dollars for two frozen entrees. NEVER GO HERE.
