Sketch burger is probably the BEST burger you can get in Philly! It's such a fun and unique place and the food is seriously AMAZING, plus they provide crayons and markers so you can make fun drawings while you wait for your food and eat! My family and friends are all foodies and/or artists so I try to take as many people as possible to this gem of a burger joint. My favorite burger is definitely the cyclopes, but I also love the chicken breast sandwich with cheddar and garlic aioli. Go have some yummy food and make some fun drawings, you definitely won't regret it :)
