While the building was interesting, my experience there was far from pleasant. My husband and I went here with 4 of our friends for dinner just last night. To begin with, the service was extremely slow. We weren't there during a busy hour and there was plenty of staff but our waitress frequently disappeared for long periods of time. She forgot to take some of  our drink orders, was very pushy with the expensive items on the menu, and didn't blink an eye when I told her that I had found a small rock in my dinner just two bites into it (Mantoo). Not wanting to finish my meal, my husband said he would take it home and have it tomorrow. She wrapped it up, ROCK AND ALL (he showed me it today when I came home from work). What little I did have of it that night was nothing special.  I know my experience was not the norm, but I know I will not be returning here. Not worth it in my opinion.
