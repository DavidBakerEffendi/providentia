We'll..... I can't wait to go back! Everything was awesome and fresh quality ingredients :) I loved my meal...everything from the salad and clam chowder to the grilled salmon! Not only was the restaurant and food great but our server Mike was so professional and accommodating it just topped off the whole experience. I'd request him as a waiter! Fast, delicious and friendly. See you soon!
