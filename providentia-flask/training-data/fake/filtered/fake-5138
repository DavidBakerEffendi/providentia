The food is ok and the price is good.  However, the service is really really bad.  One of the waiter actually punched the wall in front of their customers, because he wants to kick their customers out of the restaurant and leave on time.  What kind of service is that???  The manager actually allow this to happen???  This is not professional at all.  I don't know if I will go back although their food and price are good.  I had the worst dining experience.
