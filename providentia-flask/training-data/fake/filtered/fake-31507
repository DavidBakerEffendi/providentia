Beautiful restaurant..the rest. Eh. I dined here this week with the hubby and was super excited since everyone's been talking about it. Once we walked in the hostess was very warm and welcoming and sat us immediately. Our server approached us and we ordered our food. Service wasn't slow, our server was attentive. For appetizers we ordered the lobster Mac and cheese. It looked really good but once I tried it that ship sailed. The flavors are way too overpowering. I don't even know what I was supposed to taste! Whatever. We left that to the side and waited for our entrees. We got the blend burger & the surf and turf. The surf and turf was AWESOME! The burger was okay nothing special. The fries were sooooo salty. Overall it was alright. I'll probably come back to check out the bar
