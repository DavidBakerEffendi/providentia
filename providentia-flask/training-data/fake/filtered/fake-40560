A great find. Food is prepared fresh and oh so tastey. Coffee is supurb. The crossient with the scabbled eggs was like nothing I ever tasted. The baked goods are beyond belief. The setting is quaint and very friendly. I'm so glad they have dinner for takeout on Fridays. Great way to begin the weekend. We'll be back for sure.
