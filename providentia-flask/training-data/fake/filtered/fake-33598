We had an after wedding celebration there. Â We ordered alu phingsha and it was tasteless coz they forgot to add salt and had more water in it. It was one of the item that I wasn't satisfied with. We ordered thukpa as well and it has so much soup in it. It wasn't the first time I encountered with such dissatisfaction. Hopefully it be better next time.
