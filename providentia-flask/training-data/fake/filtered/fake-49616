Totally disappointed. We were excited to give this a try after some great recommendations, but will give it only one more strike before it's officially out. The young lady who took our order was unable to answer even basic questions about the ingredients in any given offering, and in the end, got our order wrong (which we only discovered upon arriving home). Ordered chicken, never received it. Items we requested omitted, were included. Though the dishes had taste potential they both wound up going to waste as the noodles were overcooked to the point of gumminess. Wish we just cooked in.
