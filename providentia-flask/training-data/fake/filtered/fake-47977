I've eating pizza all over bayonne but nothing compares to pizzalinos! By far the best pizza I ever had in my life..you could tell that they use high quality stuff..I highly recommend the grandma pie and the white pie and of course you cant go wrong with the regular cheese pie which blows pompeii or pizzamasters right out of the water..my only issue is they close so damn early! My buddies and I were looking to order 25 pies the other night for the whole bayonne bowling team to try and it wasnt even 9 yet! I feel if they were open later that would be the go to spot for late night eats as its my family and friends favorite pizza joint ..check them out on spike tv as well on the show hungry investors ..great episode great family and the best pizza you can get in bayonne..truly a hidden gem
