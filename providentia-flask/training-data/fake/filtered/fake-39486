Do not go here if you are Black,you are not wanted here--as it was made clear that our party was not wanted here.   Our party that was 95% black had reservations for a party for an absolutly fabulous 4 year old.  We arrived and the main room had two of about ten hibachi tables full...we were escorted (relegated) past them to a back room (that never had another party escorted to...as the other room filled up to capacity with not another party that looked like us).   We had a chef that was very nice and considerate of the kids...but had obviously spent more than his career there about 5 years ago.  He was nice to the kids, but the food was cooked terribly unevenly...the bottom pile of shrimp was burned beyond recognition and the top barely touched by heat.  All the while the other room that was full of people not containing us was full of dynamic, electric chefs and disco lights for other kids (not our kids) birthdays.  Its ok, there are plenty of establishments that we are all welcomed to.  So please lets not us of all races that want to be of one reward these people with our money.
