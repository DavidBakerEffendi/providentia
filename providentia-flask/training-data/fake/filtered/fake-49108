Here's the thing... the first time I went to Salute! I had a lovely experience.  Our waitress was vibrant and fun, the food was delicious and we even went home with that little bag of Biscotti another poster talked about... Then came today, we arrived at 12:45 for lunch and waited nearly 15 minutes for a waitress.  We then waited another 30-minutes for our meals and not even the garlic bread could hold us over.  To top it off, they didn't stamp our ticket for validation and we had to pay full price for parking. Not sure they'll get another chance to disappoint me.  The food is good, but the waitress was invisible, service non-existent, and the parking situation pushed me over the top.  It really is unfortunate... the gnocchi is almost too good to pass up. C'est la vie.
