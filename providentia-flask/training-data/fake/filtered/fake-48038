3 words... "YOU MUST GO!"  An excellent addition to the area.  Food...Superb!!! Beer selection...Amazing!!!  Service...One of a kind!!!  Away from the overcrowded typical Times Square bars, this place gives off a vibe that brings me back time and time again.  My favorite are the mussels with the diablo sauce.  Then again, the fresh selection of oysters are great as well.  Being from the West Coast and living here now, the seafood is as fresh as it gets.  Bring an appetite, because they feed you well...  Get ready to meet new friends, as the bar staff are great.   Ask for Heather, Jerry or Keiron... Tell them Chris (Jim Beam) recommended it... Believe me, they'll know!
