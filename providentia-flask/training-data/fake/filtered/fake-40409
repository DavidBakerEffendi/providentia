Went there on a Saturday evening.  Great food!  The Pad See Ew was really good.  But by far the best thing there was the ribs!  The dipping sauce went really well with the ribs. The ribs were a must have!  The calamari was pretty good too.  The only negatives were that it was pretty loud and we did have to wait about 45 min - 1 hr to be seated.
