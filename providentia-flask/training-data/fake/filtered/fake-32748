I heard about the grand opening from my coworker so we went by together and they had an amazing variety of foods. My coworker and I went recently after work and there's no doubt, Room 55 has the best tasting white wine sangria. I definitely recommend this place for some great food. I will be stopping by really soon with my girlfriend.
