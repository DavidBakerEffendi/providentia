This place is a great new addition to the bar and restaurant scene in new york city. The atmosphere, as my girlfriend said was "electric" as we walked into the bar with a party on the Mezzanine Level that we were attending and another party down stairs.  Great music by DJ, very nice hospitable staff. We loved Paul with the  Irish Accent, excellent bartender with a great knowledge of beers.  I was so happy for my friend Alan, he chose this place for his party and what a party it was! it is also his "afterwork hangout" during the week with friends. It is just a pity I work so far away from the "Three Monkeys" otherwise it would be my hangout spot too. GREAT PLACE!!!!!  Next time we go back we will check out their food menu, looks Amazing
