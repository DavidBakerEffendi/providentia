I LOVE the Market. I only recommend AVOIDING the DOWN HOME DINER. They ripped me off. They charged me twice for a bill and balked and balked and never did a thing about it--after going there two or three times and 20 emails. It's OK though as the food is only merely fine, so you won't be missing anything. So yes, go to the Market just FORGET the DOWN HOME DINER. THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO RUN A BUSINESS.
