Let me start by first saying that if you love beer, you'll love Hawthornes. Great selection and relatively good prices for build your own six packs. I've been here numerous times, mostly for take out, but have eaten and drank there as well. As far as the food goes, it's OK but above all is very overpriced for what it is. However, what drives my low rating is an encounter I had with the owner last time I visited. A friend and I stopped in and got two beers each to drink by the fireplace. We were almost ready to leave when the owner came over and with a very strong tone informed us that we could not drink takeout beer in the restaurant. Confused, I replied that we bought the beer with the intent on drinking there. He essentially repeated what he said in an even more aggressive tone but then assured me he wasn't yelling at us. If you have to tell your customers you're not yelling at them, that's a serious problem. He then said if we were drinking in we could not get the to go discount. Having been in numerous times and well aware of the rules I told him we didn't get the discount since we only purchased 4 beers (discounts start at 6 beers). He then flashed me an angry look and then actually proceeded to violently slap open the empty shopping bag next to us to find a 4 pack carrier. He said he was just letting us know as he stormed off like a child throwing a tantrum. Absolutely inexcusable behavior to paying customers. Its a shame too because if it wasn't for the owner this place would really be something special. I'll be heading to the Foodery in the future.
