I think Freemans combines all of the best elements of a breakfast/brunch restaurant. It's tucked away on a quit street on the Lower East Side and the decor and direct, but open staff make you feel as though you've uncovered a place thats hidden and refined (even though it is quite easy to find). The food is excellent as well as the coffee, definitely put it on your visit list.
