Dined here last nite.  I ordered the tilapia special with mashed potatoes and vegetables. The fish was interesting an was a healthy portion.  It had an browned avocado crust.   I ordered the Sauvignon blanc from New Zealand.  It was sweet and crisp.  My dining partner ordered the Asian chicken salad which he said was very good as well.  Overall another great dinner at the Jane.  I've liked this place for years for a step above pub food in the west village.
