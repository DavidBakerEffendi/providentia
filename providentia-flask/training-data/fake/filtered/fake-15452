I went to Smokin Bettys to celebrate my birthday on 6/22. The food was great as it normally is however this time there was ROACHES the size of small babies....NO EXAGGERATION running up and down the walls. The worst part was everyone seen the roaches and when I let the waiter know, he played it off like they were suppose to be there. The roaches completely killed the idea of ordering more food.One off the roaches crawled near a plate of food. I dont see me ever going back. If theres roaches crawling up and down walls, theres roaches in the kitchen! If I wanted to eat among roaches, I would have just arranged to have a party at a dirty whole in a wall for less.
