Probably has the best bar food I've ever eaten. It's rather pricey, but this is Manhattan--actually, this is a gorgeous historical building in Manhattan 2 minutes' walk from Battery Park, so it'd be astonishing if you didn't have to spend a little. My friend and I split the Spanish Charcuterie and Cheese plate. Our conversation was put on hold for about fifteen minutes, with the exception of the occasional "Oh my God" and various inappropriate pleasure noises. Whatever cheese plate you order, make sure you choose the Idiazabal. The Happy Hour special of 3 oysters with an oyster stout is also delectable. Best of all, it feels very relaxed, unpretentious and not what you'd immediately associate with Manhattan atmosphere.
