We went this last Friday night, Dec 14, it was really nice, me and some friend got a table, the place was packed. We got the shrimp saganaki special, really got. Somebody mentioned to me that the place have new management and it shows; quick service, nice food and people smiling. We meet some nice gals there, that is another plus, they were commenting about how good the food, we tag along with some beers. Nice Friday at this place. A note: the bathroom needs a little work.
