I was glad when Mighty Quinn's set up their brick-and-mortar location in the East Village.  I can't get enough of the brisket. Highly recommend it.  For sides, the burnt-end baked beans are delicious (almost as much meat as beans), and the sweet potatoes are good as well.  The place can get crowded and it can be hard to find seating at peak times, but turnover is relatively quick.  This place is one of my favorites in the East Village.
