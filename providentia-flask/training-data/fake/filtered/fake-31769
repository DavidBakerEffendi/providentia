Amazing atmosphere in a very creative set-up. The food is fresh and unique, like the fancy grilled cheese (smoked bacon,home made tomato jam and aged cheddar) or the spicy shakshooka! They serve stumptown cold brew on tap. The service was great and the vibe is very family oriented - best place for Brunch!
