This is truly a Philadelphia gem! The space is very small so prepare to pack against the wall, but the food is worth the effort. Definitely try whatever terrine they have on special. My favorite is the guinea hen. The lamb shank meat falls right off the bone, no knife needed. Servers are very experienced and attentive. Usually Pierre will come around and greet his guests.
