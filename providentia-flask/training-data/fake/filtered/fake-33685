I have been going here for over 10 Â years. I get the fajitas combination with steak and chicken most of the time with a margarita. I have noticed over the last year or two they took the filet mignon option off of the menu. They also have downgraded the steak. The steak doesn't taste as good as it used to, its to chewy and rough. The chicken has remained the same, tender and succulent I would say the overall quality of the food has gone down from an A- to a B-. I don't know if its a new chef or management buckling down. What ever it is, it is making me go elsewhere for dinner. I am coming to Jose Tejas less frequently. They need to address this because I have been telling everyone. Thanks, Less then pleased.
