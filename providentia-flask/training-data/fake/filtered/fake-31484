Was visiting Philadelphia for the weekend and had the pleasure of stumbling across this place when I was in South Philly. First of all, it was the best welcome I ever had to a coffee place ever, Liza is really nice and made me feel right at home. I went for a delicious savoury crepe with Tikka Masala which was excellent and really hit the spot. I was a tad hungover and it is great comfort food. Before I got my flight home I decided to come back for round 2! - this time had a great cup of coffee and tried the banana/nutella crepes.These are amazing and this place is a little gem! Really enjoyed the music and conversation here as well. If you are in the area, don't just come for Pats cheesesteaks, get some dessert at Liza's Creperie! It's fun, it's delicious and it's a breath of fresh air to meet an owner that is so kind to her customers. Big thumbs up from me, check it out!
