Applewood's food is delicious, its service is great, and the dining room is comforting. My lady and I have eaten there twice and had great experiences both times -- the food prices are very affordable (most expensive entree is $30, as of March 2013), and the drinks are similarly affordable ($11 for all in-house cocktails). I don't normally write Yelp reviews in general, but I was pushed to by an especially good experience we had there last night. In ordering the charcuterie option for an appetizer, we didn't ask what it would come with, and it arrived as duck pate and pork terrine. Neither of us like pate/terrine, and resultantly ate very little of it. Our very friendly waiter picked up on us not digging it and insisted he take it off the check as he hadn't explained what the charcuterie dish came with (not that he had to! we had already discussed how we should've asked, so this was really just a very nice gesture from an observant man). We were also seated at a not so great table, and he offered to move us as the restaurant's tables opened up -- very nice! The braised short rib I ate was rich and flavorful, and my girlfriend's hake was very tasty as well! Sincerely can't suggest Applewood enough -- great food and great attention to detail. Much appreciated!
