Very nice atmosphere for such a small cafe, I ordered an espresso and it was very good.I adore this coffee. It is perfect.The sandwiches and scone I tried were also pretty good. it's such a treat from the Starbucks in the area not to mention the employees are friendly.The only recommendation I would have would be to label the teapots somehow as they come out.
