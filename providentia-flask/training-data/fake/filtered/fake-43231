My oh my how things have change. This place used to be OK and even more than that. Nowadays, this place is one to avoid. It is nearly always empty (I pass by quite often) and started noticing it after I was in one day and thought how deserted it seemed. The next thing I noticed is how this place lost its 'diner' qualities. It just looks and feels like a run down lil 'ol restaurant that's struggling to get by. Even chain diners feel more authentic than this joint. I guess things are so bad that most of their display cases are half empty. Nothing more than what they expect to sell I presume. Almost no sign of cakes, pastries, etc. The service was horrendous. The waitress couldn't care less about her occupation or the people she's supposed to be serving and helping. We had to signal her to come over every single time! She didn't introduce herself nor did she ask if we were ready to order. No recommendations, nothing. It was like ordering from a brick wall that walks and sometimes moves its head in recognition. After our food was served she sort of disappeared I guess. Never came by to ask if we needed anything else or if the food was OK. I had a nice burger. When I say nice, I mean it looked nice. Flavor wise - not the most amazing thing you'll eat. I don't remember the burgers here being this bland before. I dare say it was slightly overcooked to my liking, but that was the least of my worries. The fries were drenched in oil. Seriously, it was like being served oil with some fries as garnish. Also, they were lukewarm. Not cold, but not good enough. They must have stopped using Heinz due to pricing issues, but the ketchup we had was a no-name brand that seriously doesn't stack up. I mean, you're an American diner! Heinz ketchup should be the first thing on the tables! It just looks and tastes right. PS - Don't go to the bathroom.
