I love Fat Salmon, partially because I live near by but mostly because it is excellent, creative, delicious sushi at a good price.  If you do it right (one drink each, avocado salad to share, a special roll and two regular rolls to share), you can have a Saturday night dinner date out for ~$50 total.  I always leave full and satisfied.  Take out is delicious, too.
