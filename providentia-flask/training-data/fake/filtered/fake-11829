After the first visit to Da Legna we knew this was going to be our new "spot" to come and get some amazing food and a great atmosphere. The pizza leaves you wanting to come back again and again. Not heavy leaving you feeling weighed down, just tasty and perfect. The small plates and salads are also delicious. Pair that with the lovely bar setting and the friendly staff along with the brand new building and renovated space this place is really a home run. We can't wait to come back. If you have not tried it yet you MUST put it on your list. You'll be a fan immediately. Promise!
