Had a lite lunch at Parc the other day, and the food was lovely as well as they had a nice Riesling which was perfect for a late afternoon lunch. I would recommend this restaurant for a relaxing lunch or a sunday brunch. I would also reccomend this as far as location considering its right on the square. The hostess was friendly, and very prompt in seating us, but I would say that her attire was not appropriate. She was wearing a spaghetti strap tank top (the kind you wear under a nicer shirt or tank) which was not appropritate given the restaurant. Also we waited forever to have our bill taken when we were finished. This was something that ususally would not be a major issue, but this was business lunch and we were on time restrictions. I would definately go to Parc for a leisurely Sunday brunch with friends, or even if I was lunching with friends. Not a place Â I would stop in for a quick bite.
