This place is aight, definitely overrated. Chicken enchiladas were not'in special- being a Mexico native dude I know what good enchiladas taste like. The chicken was dry and the sauce didn't have that authentic sabor that it should have. The staff is cool and all- real hipster place. Anyways, three stars cause it is overrated and because it was just maso menos but the service was good. Adios!
