Levee rocks. It always has, and always will. The bartenders aren't jerks, if they're mean to you it's just because you're simply not cool enough to be there. That's only half sarcastic, seriously don't come here if you're lame, go to the beer garten across the street with the rest of the yuppies. There are only a handful of things you can do to have a bad time here, so let me save you a trip....The drinks listed on the chalkboard are there for a reason, stick with them and you'll be golden. If you order a Mojito you're gonna look like a jerk, and you may be directed to the long list of novelty drink bars along Bedford where the bartenders aren't burdened with patronage, and have all night to make your girly drink...Also...Do yourself a favor and never try to play pool. This bar has an unfortunate wanna be thug infestation concentrated in the area around the pool table. You can distinguish these vermin from regular patrons due to their color coordinated outfits, aroma of axe body spray, and the following cry (which scientists believe to be some sort of mating call) "yo it's last pocket dawg"?!? Avoid the above mentioned, and you can't go wrong.
