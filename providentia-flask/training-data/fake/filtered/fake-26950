I recently had one of the best birthday dinners I can remember at Butcher Bar. Having recently enjoyed several delicious meals there in the past couple months, I thought it would be fun to bring along some friends for my 25th birthday. (Everyone I know lives in Brooklyn, and they refuse to believe that there are decent places to eat in Queens.) I was concerned about bringing a large group to a relatively small space, but the folks at Butcher Bar were incredibly accommodating; they set aside a nice large table for us, brought over lots of free appetizers, and even gave me a slice of apple pie with a birthday candle for dessert. Everyone in my group had a wonderful (and delicious!) evening. Part of the reason I like this place so much is the high quality of the meat. My girlfriend and I are massive carnivores, but we always had trouble finding sustainably raised, locally sourced, grass-fed meat in western Queens. Not only is Butcher Bar's meat responsibly raised, but they're extremely knowledgeable on the subject, able to answer all the annoying questions we had about the food's provenance. Everything is also very affordable, and deliciously prepared--I don't know what they put in that rib sauce, but it's definitely got me hooked. The whole place has a really nice atmosphere, comfortable and trendy without being too self-consicously hip. The wait staff are really friendly and very prompt, even on crowded evenings. And the management is interested in making sure you have a great time, generally accommodating whatever special requests you might have. In my humble opinion, Butcher Bar is a unique and wonderful new addition to the Astoria foodie scene. I hope they stick around!
