Shocked that this place doesn't have more reviews?  Only 13?   Oh we'll, I'll guess I'll be lucky number 14! This place is set back on Passaic Ave, a little hard to see, but it was still light out so it was no problem.  They have these really cool multi-colored lights on the restaurant at night.  Decor is fancy, upscale, simple but fancy.   Now for the food.  First off you can tell everything is fresh here because it's definitely not a place to go if you want to be rushed, or to get in and out.  Appetizers took some time, but they came out hot and delicious (Long Hot Peppers, Calamari). The SEAFOOD RISSOTO is basically to die for.  DIE FOR.  Period. Really romantic as the sun goes down and they light the candles, live entertainment was fun too.  Can't wait to go back!
