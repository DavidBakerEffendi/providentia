Juliana's is the place to go if you want awesome pizza in Brooklyn. Period.  The prices are a bit high, so I can't give it 5 stars.  (I am partial to the $1 pizza spot on Fulton!, which I'd give 5 stars if they were on Yelp!) haha. All in all, if you're not afraid of spending $20 on a decent pizza to feed 2 or 3 people, this is your place.
