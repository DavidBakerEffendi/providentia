I heard so much about this place so i had to go and see the uproar for myself. I came out the other night and got the brisket. Fist off it was super tender and the side dishes of steamed veggies (i asked for) were amazing. When i was done i honestly had to sit back for 15 minutes just so i can start to move again because i was so full. All i can say is that i will be back again, with more people ;)
