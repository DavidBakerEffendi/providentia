My gf and I were in the mood for some good sandwiches and a good friend of ours told us about rye. We didnt want to go anywhere to far and this place was literally 3 blocks from my gf's apt. When we walked in we thought they were still closed but they were just opening for dinner(around 545 we walked in). They allowed us to sit at a table of our choice and have a cocktail while we looked over the menu. It didnt take us long to figure out what we wanted bc we knew we were getting sandwiches and only had 3 to choose from. My gf took the short rib sandwich was delicious. Meat was cooked perfectly and tasted really really good. I had to try the rye meatloaf which is a combination of beef, pork, veal, duck and shortrib. Ive had some tasty , delicious, juicy , mouthwatering sandwiches before but I cannot remember the last time I had had one this good. I mean i savored each bite and ate as slow as I could. I didnt want the taste to go away and almost a second sandwich to-go to eat later but figured that was a little much. lol. we also had the mac and cheese which was pretty good, pasta was al dente just the way i like it. I def recommend this place if your in the mood for a good sandwich in williamsburg!
