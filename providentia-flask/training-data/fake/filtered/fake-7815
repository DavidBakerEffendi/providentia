My wife and I were visiting our friend Laura that had just moved to New Haven.  As we walked around Yale's surroundings for a place to have dinner, Geronimo caught our attention.  We continued walking but we ended up returning; it just had too good energy.  We got the best table next to the sidewalk and the nicest guy waited for us.  The menu offered the typical mexican options and also some alternatives.  We decided to go with the unusual.  It was all phenomenal.  Beautifully presented and delicious. I had ordered Pork Relleno, a stuffed pepper that had the right balance of hot and spicy.  My wife ordered the vegetarian version made with quinoa.  She loved it too.  By the time we finished dinner, the local crowd energized the place and it slightly started to turn into a bar.
