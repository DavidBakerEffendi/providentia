I'm a huge seafood fan and I heard that the mussels are the thing to order at the Belgian Cafe. I was not disappointed! I ordered the mussels served "herge" style with jalapeno pepper butter, cilantro, orange zest, and belgian wit ale. The mussels and broth were both excellent. The meal was also served with fries (small, thin, and mushy, I prefer a little more substance but the dipping sauce made up for it!). The beer selection alone is enough reason to come here-it was slightly overwhelming, but it helps to dine with beer connoisseurs who can point you in the right direction. The wait staff was very attentive, our drinks (beer and water) were replenished and food brought out in a timely fashion. The only problem we encountered is parking-there's no lot, and in this part of Philly, expect to be driving around a little to find a space on the street. Arrive early!
