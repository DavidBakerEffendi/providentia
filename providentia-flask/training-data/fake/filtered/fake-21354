I've been here several times and I've never been disappointed. I love their tortilla soup, the empanadas, and pretty much anything on the brunch menu. For dessert, the Xangos are amazing. The last time I was there, when the waitress brought the dessert menu, I knew I wouldn't be able to resist, even though I was already stuffed. Also, great atmosphere. I love the lighting and the decorations, though it does get a bit cramped sometimes. It's not exactly a place to just pop into when you feel like grabbing some cheap food, but honestly, I come here even when I can't afford it. Yum.
