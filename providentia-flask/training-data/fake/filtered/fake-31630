I am a health counselor and I frequently stop in to Eco Bean & Juice because of their ingredient integrity. I also have a ton of food allergies and it is so nice that there is a place that offers a choice other than dairy or soy milk. I have never had a problem with a wait and the staff has always been friendly. Reading some of these bad reviews is odd to me, I have never had a bad experience. We should be thanking them for being in our area and caring about what we put in our bodies.
