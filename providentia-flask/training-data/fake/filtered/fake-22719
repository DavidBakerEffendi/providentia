Went in 1 hour before closing on a holiday weekend.  We didn't realize the time, but the owner and staff were still so welcoming!  We sat at the bar for awhile and Tom the bartender was so friendly and made great drinks!  We had the tuna tartare appetizer and the blue cheese salad both were amazing!  They brought out dessert on the house and invited us back for movie night later this week.  The decor is fun and welcoming and the owner is all about food and service.  Also, really nice outdoor seating area...super charming!  Great addition to the community definitely give it a try!
