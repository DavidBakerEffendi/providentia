We ate at Marigold Kitchen last year and it was outstanding. We eat out at least 3 times per week and we ate there last night and I was beyond extremely disappointed. On the positive side, most of the courses were delicious. The chef did try (and succeeded) to make some very interesting and unique dishes. Â On the negative side, the portions were ridiculously small. I left hungry and ended up making myself a sandwich when I got home (this is after spending $610 for dinner for my family). The pace of service is the worst of any restaurant I have ever eaten at (I have eaten in some of the finest restaurants in the world). The problem I had was that we got served an extremely small portion (I mean teeny) and then we waited 10 - 15 minutes for the next teeny portion, then another 10 - 15 minutes for another.... in the first hour I literally had 4 to 5 mouthfuls of food. As I said, the food was delicious but they take the term tasting menu to a the worst level. I suppose if you want to taste really good food it would be great but you need to eat before you go (not kidding) - Whatever you do don't show up hungry because you will be hungry throughout the entire meal - they simply don't give you enough food fast enough. My wife was the only one in our group who felt there was enough food. My son, daughter, and son in-law all left hungry. The only poor course was the desert. It was a disaster (and teeny). The meal took 3 1/2 hours - way, way too long. I will never go back.
