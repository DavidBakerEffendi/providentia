I came here with a group of friends a few weeks ago. The staff was very friendly and fun and even got us all up to take pictures on their "Addicted to Cheese" prison wall! The food was absolutely DELICIOUS and very good portions. I had the truffle Mac and cheese which was outrageous. I think I inhaled it. I also tasted the manchengo cheese sticks which were AMAZING. The concept is great, especially for cheese lovers. They even have a gluten free option! I would 100% go back here and highly recommend it! They are doing a great job after only just opening and I can't wait to try something (everything) else!!!
