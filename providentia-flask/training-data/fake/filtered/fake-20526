We had read about the restaurant in an NYT article and this was on our bucket list. My GPS had hard time to find this place but if you get out of Sheraton, the restaurant across the street on a little hill, slightly on the left. The place has excellent vibes, full of buzz, has beautiful lighting and its kinda hip! The food is Israeli contemporary, and its all five star! This is truly gourmet food. The hummus is so smooth and buttery- it's something to die for and it goes so well with their fresh made lafa bread. They do very unusual paring of best ingredients and we wondered, why no one thought of this before? They have small tapas style plates, expected to be shared and it worked well for four of us. There is a dish with dates and cottage cheese, reminded me of paneer, it was out of this world. The cocktails are unusual and ingenious at the same time. I enjoyed whiskey harifa, which had fancy ingredients I can't pronounce, but it was goood!!! It was just a little pricy but certainly worth. This is a good place to celebrate something special..The manager (I think Brian or Ryan) was very accommodating when we did not like one of the drink. The staff was attentive...I will be visiting this place every time I am in Philadelphia.
