This place is ethereal, awesome, enchanting, incredible, DELICIOUS!  Do you get the idea yet?  I wish I was creative enough to come up with more superlatives to describe this store!  It has to be the most awe inspiring shopping experience of my life.  The produce is unreal.  Their selection of dry goods from Italy are extensive.  Their staff is so friendly and knowledgeable.  Their customer service is definitely as beautiful as their products.  I highly recommend their cheese and cured meats.  NOT to mention their outstanding collection of wines.  What else can I say? GO THERE!!!
