If there was an option for me to give this restaurant a negative five star rating I would. The food is cheap I can tell by the way it is made, coffee and soda are extremely overpriced none of the decor in the restaurant matches. It's all random from the classic cars lining the ceiling to the cheesy Mexican decorations on the wall. And to top it all off Cisco himself the guy that works in the back that cooks your food is the most unprofessional to day the least. The only this that place has going for it is the lovely waitress that works there during the week. She is so kind and is attentive to whatever you need.
