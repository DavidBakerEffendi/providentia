Third visit to Delorenzo at 4:30 on Friday nite. We stood in the tiny waiting area staring at the empty booths. After 30 min. we were seated. Immediately I ordered large plain pie & two sodas for the kids. Soda was a cup filled to 1 inch below the rim with ice and some soda. They dumped forks, knives and plates on our table and ran off. My son took a sip and handed me the cup wondering where was the soda?  I asked the waiter to please put some soda in the cup you gave me filled with ice. He dumped some ice out & refilled it. After 30 min. the pie arrived- dropped on our table & the waiter ran off again. He never asked - do you want anything else? Or sorry for the long wait. Nothing. it was rush rush rush. As for the quality of the pie:  I was not impressed. It looked & tasted oily/greasy. There was a ton of crushed tomato and very little cheese. Some parts of the crust were black & burnt while other parts were not. I like a thin crispy crust pie. This place has been touted as 'The Best" and I am sure to some people it is the best. But not to us. Its true: The kids were starving & they ate most of it. Pies from the first 2 visits seemed to be a little better. IMHO they appear to be sliding downhill on quality b/c they are churning the people in & out. The bill arrived & I was surprised to see the charge for an extra soda. This bothered me. When I asked the waiter "Why" and explained that they shorted my son on soda by filling it nearly to the top with ice, the waiter merely shrugged his shoulders & said "Sorry I'm not your waiter". He did nothing about it. He returned to my table after some whispering with the well dressed Host. "It's our policy to charge for refills". I did not agree & felt this was not fair. They need to treat their customers a little better - even the ones they don't hug/shake hands with. And for the price of a $1.50 soda, thats just petty. My hometown pizzeria would never treat us like that. And their pie has cheese !!
