Wow let me get started by just saying that for a place with entree in the name, they surely don't love up to expectations when it comes to the actual meal. My boyfriend and I decided to stop at a nice little local place while on my business trip from LA and let me tell you we SURELY picked the wrong one. Now while I usually don't indulge in red meats I've had my fair share while on my travels and surely know what WELL DONE means. Making sure the waiter knew how I wanted my steak I eagerly awaited the meal. Boy was I wrong, my meal was rarer than a fresh kill, I'm pretty sure it was even cold in the center. My boyfriend and I aren't usually ones to make a scene so I tried to finish my meal without trouble but couldn't get past a couple bites as I was gagging the whole way down. We asked for the check and our waiter apologized immensely saying something along the lines of "sorry our chef is a little off his game tonight". Well sir if you're "off your game" then maybe you shouldn't be cooking people food. What if I had gotten sick? I'm warning you people to steer clear of Entree BYOB. With blatant disregard for patrons health I wouldn't be surprised if a customer got food poisoning. No thank you, next time we're in Philly we'll be dining somewhere else. Regardless the service was amazing, our waiter was very polite and cute xoxo ;)
