I've always loved this place for their fantastic (and fast) to-go vegetarian sandwiches and delicious sweet potato fries. HOWEVER, the first time I sat down to eat here, the waitress was rude and curt, and when we left her our payment with exactly 15% tip, SHE ACTUALLY STOPPED US FROM LEAVING AND TOLD US WE HADN'T GIVEN ENOUGH TIP. This is so incredibly unprofessional. I will not be coming back or recommending this place to anyone. Plus, their only vegetarian pho option is very bland.
