AMAZING! The North End Bistro is definitely my new favorite place to dine on dates or with family in the Princeton area.  The staff is extremely friendly, helpful, knowledgeable, and attentive. I ordered the Lobster Roll and was thrilled with how delicious it was.  The wine is locally bought from Hopewell Valley and sold by the bottle (prices range between 20 and 25, GREAT deals).  The menu was very diverse, I can't wait to come back and try everything! There are even plenty of vegetarian options. Overall, my dining experience couldn't be topped. I will be going back with all my friends as often as I can. DELICIOUS! Also, it's incredible that they have a parking lot!! That's almost unheard of in this area and a huge plus for the restaurant in my opinion.
