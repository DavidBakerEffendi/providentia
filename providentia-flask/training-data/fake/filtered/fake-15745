Spoke twice (two separate times) during the week to employee at restaurant - made reservations for a small party early on a Saturday night - was assured they could accommodate us celebrating a major family milestone.  When we arrived they knew nothing about our reservations and said the employee was "new" and should have never booked our party.  Basically we were told we could wait for availability for a table but clearly that wait would have been very long.  We opted to leave - and go somewhere else - definitely not planning on going there anytime soon - quite disappointed obviously they have issues with who they have working for them.....possibly need to up their training for new employees.  Also - only has on street parking - had a lot of difficulty finding a place to park on a Saturday night -
