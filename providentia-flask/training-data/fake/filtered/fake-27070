I tried Oak Haven when a friend brought me there for some drinks and brunch.  I'm not a huge brunch fan, but I will admit I was impressed.  Portion sizes were good, my omelet came with a side salad.  There is pancake, omelet, french toast of the day.  The server explained it's because of fresh ingredients and availability.  I ordered sausage hash, tasted like my grandmothers, which was an amazing nostalgic feeling for me.  I ordered several bloody marys, perhaps too many.  Neighborhood spots like this one are good because you can walk home after.  The fig bread was delicious and the butter spread that they brought over is not your typical butter.  I would like to check this out again, I'm only in town for another week so I have to make it over at least one more time to try their dinner.
