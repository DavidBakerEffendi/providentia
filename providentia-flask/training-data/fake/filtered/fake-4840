I rarely write in on restaurants, but felt compelled to do so. I have eaten here quite often as of late and now bring a group every week and the group has grown from 12-18 to 46 people last night. The staff was awesome, our regular girl is vacationing so she selected her replacement and the 2 girls got hit with a HUGE group. They handled it like pro's not one complaint. As always the food was better than average and the staff was so awesome. Julio the manager is always on the move making sure all (not just our group) are attended to. Just want to say for our group we alll give you 2 thumbs up!
