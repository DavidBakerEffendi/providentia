Not sure why everybody is so crazy about this place. I went in with a friend, and was shoved in at the same table with 4 other people.  Not usually an issue for me, but it was pretty cramped and my friend had to get up about 5 times to let people in and out. Our waitress was a bit snobby with us -- not sure why.  Was it because we were taking advantage of the BYOB by bringing in a few Coors Light tallboys?  Maybe.  But we only brought them as an alternative to the bottled "tap water."   We ordered the Shrimp Paste Crepe to start.  It was pretty bland and small.  I can see why they call it a snack and not an appetizer.  All I could taste was Lime. We shared 2 plates -- the Fried Rice (with Crab), which was revieiwed here on Yelp.  Pretty bland. Nothing exciting. Small portion.  We also shared the Pad Kee Mao.  Also pretty bland and a pretty small portion, too.  I wanted to try some of the other dishes, but I don't eat Pork so many of them were off my list. Left the restaurant pretty hungry and unsatisfied.
