My father is from New Orleans, and I am making a point to take him to this spot!! What delicious food there is here! The gumbo is very good, not exactly my favorite style but that's a preference thing. Friend catfish, jambalaya, grits and this place gets it right where it counts! Friendly service and a Louisiana-style rotating draft list. Don't forget dessert! The apple betty is delectable.
