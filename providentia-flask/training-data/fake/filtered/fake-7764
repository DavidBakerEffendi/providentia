I went to Geronimo restaurant on sunday 09/03/2012 it had a menu posted outside saying that it had a gluten free menu.  I tried to order the vegetable tacos and was told that they did not have corn tortilla and they only had flour.  So than I tried to Order dish and she said it was not gluten free. Than I notice that many of the dishes had black beans in it and was made with siera nevada beer.  I asked the waitress and she said it was only a little.  A little so too much for someone with Celiac Disease.  My family had already order and I ended up eating a salad.  People who are gluten intolerant do not always want to eat salad.  The waitress was not helpful and I was extremely disappointed.
