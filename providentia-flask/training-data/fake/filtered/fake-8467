Sabrina's, your waitstaff was outstanding - speedy, courteous, understood my dietary restrictions and allowed me to have the bill rather than fight with my kids over it!  :-)  Unfortunately, due to dietary restrictions, I needed to stay with a rather plain scrambled eggs and fruit.  The eggs were cooked well and the "2 eggs" looked like they were 4 or 5 eggs.  The fruit was tasty, as was the coffee.  The other members of my table were raving about their food.
