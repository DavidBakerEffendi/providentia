Love going to brunch here!  Perfect location and I like the "family" atmosphere, not stuffy or pretentious.  The baked goods are delicious and my favorite thing to order is the potato pancakes benedict, AMAZING.  They also do take-out, which I have ordered and to treat myself to brunch in bed :) Only downside is that during the busier hours there can be a long wait.  But that's only a sign of how good this place is.
