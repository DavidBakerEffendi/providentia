Sadly, I must agree with others that Bubbys has faltered. Service was terrible; I had to leave the table in a quest for a second cup of coffee at breakfast. It wasn't even crowded. The pancakes are way too big; the sight of them nearly killed my appetite. Sausage was bland and undercooked. The place is frayed and has lost its charm. I don't know why I have to travel to the Midwest to get a decent home-style breakfast.
