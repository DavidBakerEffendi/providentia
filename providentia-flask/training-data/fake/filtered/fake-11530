Ordered the BBQ Spare Ribs Cheap  small  and expensive  their one size order is equal to a small order at any other place the only difference is at another place there would be more meat on the bone and it would cost less.  I also tried their noodle soup that was ok but same quality as a fast  take out place just at a higher price.
