Went here yesterday because I was told this place was awesome. My girlfriend and I decide to double date with her sister and her boyfriend and at first everything was fine, place wad clean and it wasn't busy at all. But then we had what seemed like the waiter from hell. He was very short with us, never asked if we were okay or needed refills or anything, and took an hour just to get us our appetizers. I could understand if the place was super busy but as I stated earlier it wasn't. I will say the food though was very good and so was my service at the bar. But when it came down to my waiter, he is the one that killed the experience for me. Especially when it came to getting the bill payed. I see no reason why it took him literally 20 minutes to come back with my card. I would love to give this place a better review but with the waiter I had this is the best I can give it.
