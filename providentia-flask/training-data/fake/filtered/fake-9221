I have been a loyal follower of your tuna sandwiches for some time now. I just purchased one for lunch and all I can say is how disappointed I am with it. Using the ends from a loaf of bread, turning them so they face inwards to the sandwich, and trying to pass it off thinking I won't notice I'm biting into a solid end piece of bread is pathetic. I've worked in food service for over 10 years and never did I send out food to a customer like that. I know all about cutting corners in a kitchen, but never at the expense of a paying customer. Would you want to spend $9 on a sandwich where all you can taste is bread crust? It really overpowered what was once the lovely taste of your tuna (the lime or whatever citrusy edge you give it is great). Not to mention there was about a third less tuna on each half of the sandwich because the end pieces couldn't hold it. The best part of this meal was the pickle on the side. May I suggest recycling the end pieces of your bread into crutons? That way you can cut down on food cost as well as keep your customers happy! How about that! Now I'm not one to write off some place I used to like for one misstep such as this. I'll try again sometime when I feel like taking a risk at lunch.
