Never again! After our (it was a delicious meal) we were commenting on the extra charges on our bill. The owner of this establishment came up to our table to advise us of his $6,500.00 monthly rent and the cost of groceries! Hence his outrageous charge to opt for a side of vegetable instead of a pasta dish (4 minuscule pieces of asparagus hardly equates to a side dish). And by the way, to the owner, yes, I do know what groceries cost in the supermarket. It may be in the owner's best interest not to speak to his clients as he did. I am not your sweetheart and ma'am is a term you ought to use in very specific circumstances. You have lost 6 diners tonight and we will spread the word to everyone not to patronize your establishment. You clearly do not have your customers best interest at heart. Frankly, we do not care what you pay for rent. Do we come in telling you what our monthly expenses are? We choose to dine out Â to get away from our daily cares and woes...not to hear about yours.
