I first tried Houston's in Orlando during a business dinner. I was so impressed that when I stumbled across it in NYC, I naturally gave it a try. Houston's has since changed their name to Hillstone, however, not much else has changed. My favorite aspects of Hillstone is the decor, ambiance, live music in the bar and the friendly staff. Decor - Elegant, darker themed restaurant which is perfect to wind down at the end of a long day. I would come here for the decor alone. Ambiance - Great place to take Â a date or to enjoy a nice dinner and have conversation. Bar music - while waiting for a table, we waited in the bar and were pleasantly surprised by a 3 piece act playing soft music in the back ground. Very nice touch. Friendly staff - the staff is very professional and personable. Hillstone does not take reservations, however, their waiting list is pretty exact. The wait does not exceed the time given. They transfer your bar check to the restaurant to avoid the pain of having to cash out and go find the rest of your party being seated in the restaurant.
