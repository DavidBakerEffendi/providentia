My husband, son (2 yo),  and I had dinner here last night. This isn't a "family" restaurant per se, but #1 we know our son is generally a good kid, and #2 we came preparred with crayons, coloring book, sippy cup, and Cars on the iPhone. The staff actually complimented us on the fact that we came fully prepared.  The endamame  dumplings were absolutely delicious as other reviewers stated. I had the chicken special which was 2 fried cutlets with a creamy lemon sauce and micro greens, delicious. My husbad had the dugeness crab fried rice, which was very good, but lacked that wow factor. There were no prices next to the "sides" and I didn't realize that the food was supposed to be served "family style" (our server didn't point that out) so we didn't get any... But that saved us room for dessert! The 5-spice donuts & dipping sauces (made to order, still hot in the middle) and the chocolate bento box (6 bite sized desserts) was outstanding. Our server was very nice, as was the bus-boys and other help. The portions are on the small side, and the prices were on the steep side, but what do you expect. This is not a run of the mill family/chain restaurant. The overall feel and decor is trendy and relaxing.  Have a glass of wine and enjoy!
