Get your crepe on! Cafe Triskell occupies the former space that was Lil Bistro 33.  As I mentioned in a previous post, I loved the Lil Bistro-can't stand the new one AND Cafe Triskell is not to be missed! The space is small, real small but the food is delicious with big flavor and generous portions.  The wait staff are helpful and the chef-owner knows what he is doing.   Savory crepes are HUGE, filled with fresh ingredients and take up your whole plate.  There are many options to choose from but I keep going back to my old standby crepe-delish!  Salads, also huge, are creative and filled with fresh ingredients.   If you are still hungry after your entree crepe, try a savory crepe.  These are off the hook!  Even if you think you are too full for dessert, the owner may surprise you with a dessert crepe and you will definitely find room for it (this has happened several times).   This place is great for brunch, lunch or dinner with friends or a romantic meal with the love in your life.   What makes it charming is its size but, that can also be a negative.  It gets crowded in here quickly and the air conditioner does not work that well so, it can be a bit muggy but, order a glass of something cold and relax.  Your meal will more than make up for it!
