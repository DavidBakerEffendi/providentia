I must have went there on a bad day or the people giving this diner high marks have no taste buds. I am all for supporting my local businesses however this diner surely does not mark high in my book.  The decor, service, and food was so outright deplorable, that I refuse to ever go back unless of course they get a major overhaul of some sort.   Me and my fiance went there one day because we would always pass there and look inside and see lots of people and the parking lot packed.  We decided to see what the hype was all about.  First thing I noticed was that my glass and silverware was dirty.  It had residue of some sort on my glass and pieces of dried up food on my fork,  My tea cup was cracked.  I was like ok...I will use my fiance's extra fork and clean the glass with my napkin and just ask the waiter for a new tea cup.  It was not off to a great start at all.  Not to mention our drinks were sub standard and my salad tasted old.  Anyways... I ordered shrimp alfredo and my fiance ordered the steak dinner.  I believe they forgot to season the food that day.  My shrimp alfredo was the blandest thing I ever tasted and the shrimp was not even frozen dinner quality.  It was just plain horrible.  My fiance ordered medium well steak and it came out overcooked and tasteless.   I can assure you, I am not picky by no means but I've been to a few diners in my days and this was my worse experience ever.   I would rather spend my money elsewhere thank you.
