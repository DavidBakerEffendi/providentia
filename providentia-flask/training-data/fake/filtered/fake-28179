DO NOT EAT HERE. I don't even know where to start. My coworkers and I all ordered this for lunch one day because it sounded delicious... but it was everything but delicious. When we called to make our order at 11:00am they already ran out of half the menu. Really... it's 11am. You should have enough food for the day.. especially when it is your specialty like the fried mac n cheese. When we received our food it was so cold. I got the burger mac n cheese and honestly I could make better mac n cheese than this. I would prefer making kraft easy mac any day. The flavor was so bland. But I ate it because I was starving. My co workers all ordered different types of grilled cheese sandwiches. They didn't even look appetizing. A real grill cheese is made with melted butter on the bread. There was no butter. They also mentioned the white bread tasted disgusting. Wonder Bread is better than the bread they used. On top of it, the sandwiches were so small and sloppy definitely not worth the price. They literally just shoved it in a small aluminum container. Another coworker got the bowl of soup for $5-6 and it was the smallest cup. You could go to Panera and get a huge bowl of soup for less or about the same price.. To even top it off, a coworker and I ended up getting food poisoning. We threw up all day and I've been sick for 2 days with a fever from it. Let's just say this place doesn't even deserve any stars. If you specialize in cheese PLEASE actually specialize in it. I don't know how to cook and I can make better mac n cheese than that. And please be more sanitary. How the hell is it possible to get food poisoning?? Such a disappointment.
