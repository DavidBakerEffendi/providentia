Pass on this place. The space is very cool and fun but the food and service are not worth your time.  I recently had lunch here and tried the beef rice bowl special which comes with soup or salad.  I opted for salad, which I have trouble even calling a salad.  It was a sad, stiff, small pile of cabbage in a nasty dressing. It was awful. The rice bowl was actually pretty good but my problem was that it was literally two small bites of beef in a big bowl of rice and vegetables. When the waitress asked how it was and I said I was surprised by how little beef there was she just said ok and walked away. If you are a vegetarian it might be ok as long as you aren't looking for great service.
