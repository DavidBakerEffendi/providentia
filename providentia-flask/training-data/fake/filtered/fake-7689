Great food at great price. I made a reservation because I had a larger party. They seated us right away. The wait staff was quick and friendly. They had several specials on weekend to accompany the regular menu. Everyone's dinner was very good. I highly recommend the spinach gnocchi. Dessert and dinner was even great!
