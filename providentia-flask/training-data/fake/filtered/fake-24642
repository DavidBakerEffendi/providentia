I have been wanting to try Amis for about a year and I must say, I was disappointed.   Don't get me wrong, the food was good----especially the linguine with corn and scallions and the entrees. But, the hostess was downright rude (and yes, we had reservations) and our waiter was slow and not at all into his job.  It took us 15 minutes to get a drink (just a glass of wine) after it was ordered and while the entire staff was preoccupied with refilling water glasses, the offer the clear plates or get another drink for us was slow. And then after my partner said no to another glass of wine, he received in anyway because the waiter couldn't hear us.   And that's my biggest complaint; it is really NOISY for a fine dining restaurant.  Part of that is due to the building which is a lovely use of the space, but do you really need to play the music that loud?   And.....dining to the Stones and to the Ramones "Blitzkrieg Bop"?  Especially when we were some of the younger folks in the restaurant?
