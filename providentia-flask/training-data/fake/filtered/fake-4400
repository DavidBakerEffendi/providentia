The Bluebird Tavern is easily the most appetizing and delicious restaurant on the planet. Taking a bite of whatever one chooses to order at this place is like taking the best day of your life and putting in your mouth. The veggies on my salad were so finely chopped that I had to come up with a new phrase to describe them, "Supa Chopped." Not to mention, the Tater-Tots were so good they were Dictating my taste buds how to react to the mellifluously coalescing flavors in my mouth. The ambiance, I have to say, was a little overwhelming if one considers that the artist of choice for the music was Justin Beiber (can you Belieb it???), but that was totally compensated Â for by the quality of the food and service. All in all, this place was grade A. If you arrive, the line is long, and you do not have a Plan B, do not Disperse. Wait, and I promise you it will all be worth it.
