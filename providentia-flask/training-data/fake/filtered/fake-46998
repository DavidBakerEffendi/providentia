My husband and I were driving and saw Pietro's so we stopped by because his great grandfather name was Pietro. We enjoyed a great lunch and we met the owner. It was a pleasant setting and service was top notch. My husband enjoyed his pizza. While I was eating the spicy wrap I made sure I had some blue cheese.
