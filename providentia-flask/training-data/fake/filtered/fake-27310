This place went from cool to douchey overnight.  When it opened, it had a real feel of a neighborhood pub - everyone was nice, friendly and laid back.  They started getting more popular, and now it feels like any other middle off the road pub in nyc.  Really disappointing.  We live around the corner and had high hopes. Good comfort food, but you will be hard-pressed to find any alternatives for healthier-minded friends.  The Peacok upstairs has beautiful rooms,,,or will when it opens fully.
