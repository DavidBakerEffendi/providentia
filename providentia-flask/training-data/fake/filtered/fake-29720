I heard great things about this restaurant and I finally had the opportunity to try it for myself and I agree with all the rave reviews.  Great service, and the fois gras is the best I have ever had.  The best, most authentic French cuisine in the city. Book early, or you will not get a table.  It is worth planning ahead for.
