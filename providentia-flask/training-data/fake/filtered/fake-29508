I had went down to the city from Utica, NY it was my bithday so my sis had told me about Amy Ruth and i was wanting to try it and it did not disappoint. Right in Harlem i had the fried chicken with green beans and sweet potaote. The chicken was moist and delicious not greasy just great tasting and the Sweet potato was excellent just the right amount of spices it was just a wonderful meal when go down will visit it the place had a nice setting not crowded and the wait staff we had was very formidable and friendly. Â Heck they even had Koolaid whch my sister got i was like koolaid have not had that since i was 10 yrs.
