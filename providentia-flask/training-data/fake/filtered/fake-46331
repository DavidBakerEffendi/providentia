I was greeted by an incredibly well groomed hostess upon entering and had a pleasant meal over the course of the rest of the occasion. The waiter was incredibly pleasant and offered a little more than just a robotic volley of small talk. The ramen was incredible and made for a sad day indeed when i looked down to notice nothing left. It was followed by some sake with a side of sake and I can honestly say ive never had a similar meal done any more adeptly. Recommend this place highly.
