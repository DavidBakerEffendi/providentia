Food is ok, but I went here in the Summer and I didn't know that the stove was right there not in a kitchen, it was nice to look at but it got up to about 95 degrees and this was at night. The place is also kind of dark, hard to see waiters and menu. Not for the faint of sight waited a few minutes for the bill may need a glowstick to get the waiters attention.
