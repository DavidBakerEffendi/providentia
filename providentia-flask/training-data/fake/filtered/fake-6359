Great neighborhood spot. Great beer menu, draft and bottles alike. Great dinner menu, but slightly pricey. Worth it to me though. I used to live 2 blocks away and hit up this spot on a weekly basis, but no longer living so close I get there maybe once every few months and it's a treat. I think it's a great spot for lunch, especially on a nice day. They do a good job with the outdoor seating. Careful, it gets loud and crowded for games! Get there early.
