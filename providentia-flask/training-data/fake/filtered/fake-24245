Went to this place after seeing the good reviews at Yelp but came out hungry from this place. I went there with a co-worker during lunch hours and literally waited 45 mins for the food to get out. We ordered the Tom-Yum soup which came out about 15 mins after we ordered, was good but cold. I thought must be busy so whatever. Then the food took another 30 mins to arrive after the soup. We ordered two dishes, the first one came out (cold again) and then the second entree arrived 10 mins later. At that point both of us did not have time to sit there and eat so just had to leave after sharing entree number 1. Still had to pay for the second entree (lunch box special). We had asked for potstickers (reason behind getting the lunch box instead of regular entree) and it came out with a spring roll. Highly disappointed!! Avoid if you do not have time during lunch hour. I haven't tried dinner there and don't think I will but could be a better experience during dinner.
