The first time I came here I painstakingly had to dip after about an hour of waiting due to a non believer. So be prepared to wait, and wait, and wait.  I know, awesome, right! I got turned on to BuzzTable here, which doesn't make it any less of a wait, but gives you a vague idea of when your table might be ready. And waiting this visit gave me an idea of how I'm going to approach it next time.  And there will be a next time. Go in, they check you in on their Ipads.  Go to the bar, order drinks and appetizers. Stay calm and carry on.  The bartender has a tattoo on her tricep of an avocado that says "Made in California".. hahaaaaaaaaaa.  The best.  I love this place.  We did the pork buns, the other 6 million people who raved about them in their reviews wernt lying. When buzztable texts you and tells you you're table is ready, go stand by the mirror wall and don't harass the kid flying back and forth with people into the dining room, he'll either ask you your name or call it out.  And when he does, it's on, buckle up. You walk into the dining area and everyone is screaming something or other in Japanese, even the white kids.  I couldn't help but laugh, to me that's fun. You may need to sit at a communal table, also fun.  I've been to Japan, it felt like I was in a dream about it. I had the classic, she had the wasabi... both of these ramen bowls were incredible. Great place to bring a group, you get a great big booth table, but not a good place to linger, the pace in this place is fast (Just like most noodle places in Tokyo). Just dipped my toe into the pond of this menu, can't wait to go back. If you have them, don't bring your kids.
