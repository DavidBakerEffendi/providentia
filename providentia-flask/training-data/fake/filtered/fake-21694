Just loved the food here!  We had the Anjeeri Tikki ,Samosas , Tawa Scallops, Chicken tikka masala and Batak uthapam.  My favorites were the tawa scallops (Seasoned scallops grilled) and the pippali special the yummy batak uthapam a duck breast hand rubbed with cracked peppers,grilled with Portobello mushroom uttapam.  The food is amazing. Perfect amount of spice, tons of veggie and meat options, delicious appetizers. It's a great addition to the neighborhood and I can't wait to go back
