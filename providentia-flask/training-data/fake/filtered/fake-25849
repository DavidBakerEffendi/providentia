I swear we went here for the first time because of the name but I have to admit the name doesn't disappoint.  It is truly awesome!  We get takeout from here a couple times a month.  Food is always very very good.  The staff is amazingly nice.  We have a young child or we would eat in.  The dining room although small is very romantic and quiet. Don't fight traffic to go to New Haven for Thai - just cruise to Hamden.
