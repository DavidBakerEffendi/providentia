You get what you pay for so I didn't expect to be treated like royalty. But one waitress made me so uncomfortable after staring at me for so long as I drank my milkshake I had to move seats. Our food took forever, the philly cheesesteak didn't taste so great but since I had ONLY taken two bites I decided to take it home. When the waitress asked if we wanted our food wrapped up she only took my fiances food. When she came back with the wrapped food she threw it on the table as she quickly walked away from me to sit at a a table with the next group of her customers who were clearly her friends. I tried to say, please wrap up my sandwich but she wouldn't acknowledge me and sat promptly at the table chatting it up completely ignoring me. This was the last time I will ever pay for their crappy food. Not nearly as bad as the experience at the other diner in Bayonne. But like I said, you get what you pay for.
