The food was great, light, and the recipes (some simple, some complex) were wonderfully executed with regards to taste and presentation. I'm a light eater, so ordering two appetizers (the hamachi crudo and a roasted beet salad) was perfectly filling; I definitely appreciate their portion sizing. It was a little loud, but mainly because the place was packed and everyone was in close proximity to everyone else. The atmosphere was fun and trendy. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they were able to make a reservation for (two) us 'day-of' on a holiday weekend (9:45pm). I did have to call, though, as they stop taking reservations on open-table at 4pm daily. Service is also very attentive and great; our waiter, Peter, made a great wine recommendation: Barbera d'Alba "Vigna Clara" (1995).
