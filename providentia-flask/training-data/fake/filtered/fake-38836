I'm most impressed with the coffee.  This neighborhood lacks a good espresso (the closest being on Smith St or way up State St.)  These guys make the perfect cappuccino.  The owners are super friendly and the food is simple and lovely.  If you live in Brooklyn Heights, you finally have a good coffee spot.
