This is a wonderful restaurant. The people are so sweet and professional. The food is fab! I decided on this restaurant when my friends from California came to visit. We had a lot of delicious food and the atmosphere was great! We were able to enjoy dish after dish of perfectly prepared food. The risotto was so creamy and the bread was hot and delicious! The prices were average and we had so much food, that we took home a lot! At least this restaurant's staff was professional and a pleasure to sit down to a good meal.. I will be back this week with 10 to 15 more friends and family.. LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!
