We have been here a number of times, sometimes small groups and others larger--about 10-13, and each time they are very accommodating.  The service is superb and the staff is courteous and friendly.  We have tried almost everything on the menu and it always tastes amazing, as do the drinks!  I would definitely recommend Yerba Buena to anyone looking for good, quality food that is not overpriced!
