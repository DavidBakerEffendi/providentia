First the decor is very warm and welcoming.The food and service were top shelf.  The house was packed with people enjoying themselves.  I couldn't have asked for anything more.  Friendly staff, extensive menu and great beer selections.  The food was well prepared and plenty of it.   Went home with a 'doggie bag.'   We came here with a party of six to celebrate my daughter's birthday and we will be back for more family celebrations.  Yelp Seat Me made the experience even more pleasant by having the table ready when we got there.
