If your looking for a place to load up on fine wine & carbs, this is the place to go! The ambiance is very upscale and classy. The front by the bar is a bit crowded so if your waiting for your table it can be a bit uncomfortable, but trust me it will all be worth it once your seated and eat. Their bread basket is so unbelievably delicious, I had to tell the waiter to take it away before i was too full to enjoy my dinner. I'm a vegetarian, so my options can sometimes be limited, but I was not disappointed on my simple choice of the spaghetti. Fresh noodles & the most flavorful sauce I've encountered. I think we may have gone through a bottle or 2 of wine (this is why i really love Italian), both bottles were so rich it was almost another course itself. It was hard to decide on the dessert, so the waiter suggested the chocolate cake. This is definitely crack cake BEWARE!! It just melted in your mouth, it was hard for me to share. They also gave us a complimentary variety dessert platter (I think they saw me scarfing down the cake & figured the other guests should have dessert too). This definitely won me over, anything free & I'll forever feel special & have no problem coming back over & over. The restrooms are a little bit scary to get to. After a few glasses of wine, i was definitely starting to question my safety going down those stairs (luckily i made it out alive). Oh also, don't come here if you plan on hitting the town after. You'll be so full, your dress will start to feel like a corset.
