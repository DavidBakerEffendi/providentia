On a day where you've just backed your car into a fence, food is the last thing on your mind. With flexibility (a lack there of) being the only thing keeping me from kicking myself in the face, I decided to Â give up and check out Wafa's with a buddy of mine. Best Decision all day! Eating at Wafa's is like being invited to the owner's home for dinner. The food is Authentic, fresh and tastes homemade. I've had my fair share of middle eastern food, both good and bad, and Wafa's gets a big thumbs up. The prices will have you feeling like you actually owe Wafa some more money. Its also fair to say that you're half a moron if you leave Wafa's without trying the Bakhlava. A great place for a casual lunch.
