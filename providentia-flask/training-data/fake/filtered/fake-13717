We had such a wonderful time up until we asked our waiter for directions. When pasty started yelling at him because he was talking to us too much. My husband and I didn't get it ? ...all we needed was directions? Pasty spent more time flirting with me than talking to my husband. All I can say is that our waiter was fast and efficient and didn't bother us at all. In fact he was busy taking care of his tables while the other waiters just stood around. We left the place wondering how the he can take that kind of treatment. The food is good and the service better. Just skip the this nasty old dude. P.S. I had to repost this review again. People should know about this restaurant.
