I have not tried the hibachi or any drinks, so I can only comment on their sushi. Â Sushi spots have always been hit or miss for me, but since this place was right next to school (Rutgers) I thought I'd give it a shot. I've been here no less than 20 times now and I've never been disappointed with the sushi. The ingredients have always been fresh and the prices are excellent. I have even gotten their party tray for a bday and everyone loved it. Staff is very friendly. All in all great spot; highly recommended.
