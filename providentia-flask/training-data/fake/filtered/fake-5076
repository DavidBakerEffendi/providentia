We Went to this place last week. I really wanted to share my experience with my family and friends by the time I came out of dosai place. At last a nice indian restaurant in NJ. They can provide the customers an amazing delicious food. After visiting this place you may even totally stop thinking of going to any other Indian cuisine i swear. U can find variety of food what you can not find else where. I would recommend this worthy restaurant to anyone. We love dosai place. Their service should be long lasting.
