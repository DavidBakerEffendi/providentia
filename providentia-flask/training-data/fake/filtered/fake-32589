Pros - Ok dinner price for a French restaurant - Bistro like atmosphere Cons - The Moules-Frites is a bit too 'sandy' for my liking.  I bit into sand a few too many times - Stereotypical 'French' attitude a bit on display.  We had the lean French guy waiting on us, and seemed to have a chip on his shoulder.
