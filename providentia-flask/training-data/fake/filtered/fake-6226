Terrible food! I am Cuban and can 100% say, don't waste your money. The place may have cute atmosphere ,but the food is absolutely awful! The rice was dry , the platanos had no taste,everything I tasted was over cooked! Â I would never return and would never recommend anyone . Over priced also! Stick to Bergenline Avenue, this place is not even Cuban! It is an embarrassment to Cuban people to call this a Cuban Restaurant!
