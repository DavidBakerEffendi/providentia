Went to Ilili for Summer Restaurant Week recently and was happy with the all round experience. Our waiter was fairly new, but was great with his recommendations and an absolute pleasure - had a perfect balance of humor and professionalism. A lot of the dishes we had - Chicken Liver, Lamb Shoulder - were VERY rich but balanced out well with the yoghurt sauces etc., and lighter dishes lik the Octopus and Cod were a good contrast. All made for a very affordable dinner with a bottle of wine, definitely enjoyed it and would gladly recommend to a friend.
