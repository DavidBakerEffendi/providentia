WIth a great beer selection, relaxed vibe, and excellent pub food, it's a great spot to spend an evening or just grab a couple of drinks. Be sure to try the house made tater tots (be warned they are larger and better than anything you've had before) and fried pickles. The wings are solid, too. The IPA fries, fried green tomatoes, the fried chiken . . . With all that fry going on, it's a great thing that the beer selection is so big. The bar tenders are great about making recommendations and letting you try beers you don't know yet. The selection changes often, so definitely a place to come back to again and again to find new favorites. I know I'll be back.
