I took my husband here for a birthday lunch. We arrived at 2pm on New Years Eve and was seated as a party of 4 immediately. Good because any longer I would have ran to the back and scrambled a cheeseburger. Reservations are not required/recommended.  Parking in New Haven was not bad. New Haven itself is quaint. The waitress could pass although she took forever to take our order. Whaaaaa??? The place is darn near empty lady. The burger section of the menu is where you feast your eyes.  The upgrades on the sides were ridic. Really? A extra dollar for half potato/sweet potato fries.  I ordered the NY Steakhouse Burger a la Yelp Review. A Cowboy Burger, The Maui Burger & The Salmon Burger were all stationed at my table. The meat itself was just OK. The toppings were great. I got a chance to bite the Maui Burger. It was better than mine. I hate when that happens. Pineapple on a burger. How is that possible? Afterwards,  I felt very thirsty but did not reach for the beer menu. I would go back if coaxed.
