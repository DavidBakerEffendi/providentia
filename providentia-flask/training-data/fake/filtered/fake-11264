This place is yummy!!! Super great brunch! All the food was amazing. Good service. They were very kind to bring me vinegar, lemon, honey and hot water for my sore throat. Our party ordered the apple gruyere omelette, spinach mushroom omelette, Benedict, and spinach goat cheese croissant. All were excellent. The fruit bowl side was also very nice. Crispy potatoes were perfect and the side salad fresh (ps. I really like East coast bunch serves a small salad with the entree; makes the meal so balanced and I feel healthier for it). Oh yeah, coffee so excellent I could drink it black. I'm curious to try Le Barricou for dinner, and I would probably return for brunch- more for the space and trip to Williamsburg, than for the food.
