Food: The chocolate croissant was a bit cold and honestly a bit chewy. I love croissants, this wasn't bad but I would not recommend it as a good croissant. The Shitake sandwich was very delicious with braised greens (spinach), the potatoes had a citric hint to them. I did enjoy the sandwich. HOWEVER! I sat at the chef's counter and guess what my company was? FLIES! I counted at least 10 of them standing on the mirror/wall next to me at once. I took a picture of the mirror and managed to capture 3 flies in the photograph. They stood on the plates that were "clean" waiting to be used by the chef, the napkins waiting for new customers, it was disgusting. I asked the chef about it and he just accepted that since all their windows  on 18th st were open, they had a fly problem. So bottom line, no shitake sandwich is worth having lunch with 300000 flies.  Go during the winter when you can be rest assured you won't get worms from eating here.
