My siblings, housemate, and I went here during our winter break. It was my housemate birthday so we ask them to put a candle on the desserts, which they didn't. The waitress give us water with ice when we specifically ask for no ice. Then she was rude to my brother by cutting him off when he was talking since she wanted ladies to order first even though we have not decided what to order. It took a very long time to bring out the orders. The chocolate was over sweet. The hot cocoa taste like powder from a packet. Plus, the waitress screw up the order by giving us two of the same dishes and the wrong sauce. Â The people that work there keep staring at us which made us rush to eat faster since they handed us the bill before we were half way done and they started cleaning up. We had such a negative experience here.
