This is a conglomerate of my entire table's opinion.  First of all, you come to this place for the ambiance and interesting serving-ware.  My guests' fondue was good (but how can one screw up melted chocolate fondue?). The milkshake was thin, but not too sweet.  I think the mark of a good milkshake is thick, so this is a major downgrade for me.  Baskin Robbins would have done much better.  The chocolate pizza is a nice concept, but tasted awful.   Also service was very poor.  On a Saturday night you're busy.  I understand that.  But the server wasn't kind, friendly, and even a bit rude at times.  My friend asked for the specials and the server said back annoyingly let me collect the menus first, one thing at a time.  I gave her a look and then she got a little friendlier though.  Unfortunate because we were a large party and had to pay 18% tip no matter what. Go for ambiance, but not for food and not for service.
