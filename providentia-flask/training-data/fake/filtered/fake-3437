went there last night after being turned away at Pepolino and Blue Ribbon brasserie bc we did not make reservations. Everywhere was packed! fortunately got seated promptly at Les Amis. Place was very cute and service was good. Good prices too considering the area. I had the mussels dinner entree - a large portion with meaty and well seasoned bivalves. Husband had french onion soup and steak and frites - he liked it. nothing to write home about but worked quite well as a plan B!
