Today is May 11, 2013 My husband grandson and I just left the restaurant and I have to say this was the 2nd best Greek restaurant that we have been to (number 1 is Ithica's in NYC) but this was a close second the food was out standing and the service, a wonderful young lady named Kelly if you get her your in luck excellent service! Also if you like seafood the grilled seafood platter for 2 (you will need extra pita's to dip into the juices delicious!!) Also kudo's to the chef Lefty, outstanding job. We will be back.
