Get the sangria, come hungry and with good company. Eat anything that appeals to you. Everything on the menu is delicious (I've tried almost all of it) Great place to impress a date. It's tapas and perfect for long dinners with good conversation. If I made more money I would come here monthly. Staff makes you feel special. You won't be disappointed!
