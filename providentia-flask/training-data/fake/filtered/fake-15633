The atmosphere of the Rabbit Hole actually deserves a five - especially in the summer with its vine draped patio. The interior is equally beautiful, having dark wooden-bar, lowly lit with chandalier- and candle-light. Then, there is the food!  Every item I have yet ordered is absolutely divine.  Last night, I ordered the red lentil soup and the red beet salad.  I would definitely order each one again, though the red lentil soup was my favorite.   The only thing that sets this restaurant back is that most main course items do not come with sides.  You have to order everything a la cart, which makes a meal quite expensive.   My soup and salad combo ended up being $14-15.  The perfect thing to do in this case is to share a salad and a sandwich with a friend but only if you want a light meal.  The portions are quite moderate.  That said, I already know what I will order next time... the black bean burger and the red beet salad.   I have also been to the Rabbit Hole for breakfast, and I think this might be the best time to come.  I ordered the breakfast sandwich both times I went there, because it is simply that delicious.  Oh, yes!  And it is also only $6-7.  Although it doesn't come  with any sides, it makes a good meal.
