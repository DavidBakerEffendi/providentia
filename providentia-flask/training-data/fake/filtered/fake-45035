We came a cross to this spot that looked very cozy. We saw a line in front of the entrance waiting for the table during the brunch time and decided to stay and try the food. I must admit it was worth the wait. The egg benedict was delicious and their fresh squeezed orange juice. The reason why I am giving 4 stars is because it's a bit small, crowded and you don't get as much privacy to talk.
