I don't get all these post about this pizza being "just ok."  where are you guys going that's so much better because in my opinion this place is AMAZING as far as pizza in the city goes.  there is nothing gourmet about it.  just good fucking pizza.  and fries!! the only thing is their hours suck.  Dolce Carini!  can you please open on sundays?? or stay open later on weekends?  I love you!
