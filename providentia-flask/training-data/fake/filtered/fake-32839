Went to Sol Mar last September and it was a great Here is my ratings Service: B My server was from Brazil and she was very friendly. However, another table order some food, and almost gave it to me. Something she need to pay attention too considering that it was not that business, and it was Thursday. Atmosphere: B- Majority of the people frequent Sol Mar was probably from the neighborhood. However, I did get some funny looks from the guests maybe because I was the only black guy in the restaurant, but who knows. Also got looks from  two guys when I took pictures of the restaurant. but I did not careless.   Food and drinks: B+ I had Steak Sirloin and French Fries which was outstanding. Also the bread was delicious nice and warm.  The Portuguese beer which I had two was great as well. Ironbound is my favorite place to go to in Newark. Have diversity and variety that someone who is originally from New York City would like. Overall Sol Mar is a wonderful restaurant, and if I am in Newark, I will definitely go back.
