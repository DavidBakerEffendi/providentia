as a fat person, i reeeeally love pizza. even mediocre pizza is a treat, right? and, done right/wrong, sometimes even "BAD" pizza can be a guilty pleasure. but this pizza is suckstown. the crust would be booted from the United Nations of Pizza, if it existed. it's like an annoying cracker that tastes like burnt crumbs. Meanwhile, doesn't cheese usually have a taste? At Mix, the cheese is sort of just a yellowish coating on top of the sauce (which, i think maybe on its own would be pretty good, Â because their tomato pie is very flavorful, and only undermined by that chump crust i mentioned). if only the owner could loom around the place like a rockstar who probably bothers the hell out of his servers while they're trying to work.. oh wait, he does.
