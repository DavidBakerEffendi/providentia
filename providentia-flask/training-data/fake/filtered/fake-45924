Catas is a brand new spot which has a little bit for everyone - you want to see sports they have numerous flat screens all over to enough. You are hungry well pretty much everything on the menu is great - you want to drink they can have pretty much everyone's favorite beers and your choice of liquors - you want to dance . the DJ's keep you making your dance moves when you arent to busy making moves on the hot ladies which surround you - and finally the bartenders make great drinks, get what you want fast and are extremely CALIENTE .. P.S. if you wnat to have a great time show up on RED BULL NY game day and experience the Viking Army SC pre-game and post game - you will not be disappointed ..
