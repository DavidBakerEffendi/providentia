Came to this restaurant after finding a good review online. The staff there were a bit on the rough side, lack of customer service was definitely present but if you are looking for something really quick, cheap and extremely delicious, this is the place. We ordered four large items and paid $9. We could not finish our entire meal and the dumplings were some of the best we ever has. Check out if you are on the Lower East Side. I've had a lot of dumplings from a number of dumpling shops throughout NYC and other areas Prosperity Dumplings gives you a lot of food for your buck. I bought a bunch of dumplings cooked in a variety of ways, plus two large soups for just over $10.00. It is your normal Chinatown take out shop. What this shop lacks in size, you get in quantity. The food has a fast turn around. The food has to be good, when the shop is always packed with locals as well as visitors. You can always tell a good place to eat, when you see the locals packing the place We go here everytime we visit New York. The place is super small. There are 4 bar stools with small counters in case you are lucky enough to grab one. We got 20 Dim Sum (1 order of vegetable and 1 order of lamb) and the total was $7.20. They steam them, don't boil or bake. It started to pour so i wads lucky and got two of the bar stools and chowed down. Dang it was good. i ate the rest in the hotel room that night. You aren't here for the ambiance, you are here for the food. There is a line out the door and folks stand outside eating their dumplings and chatting. Don't miss Prosperity Dumpli.
