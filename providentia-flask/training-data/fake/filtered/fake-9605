I come back with my whole family for the Xmas dinner,my daughter was begging me to come again since we got back from OTAIKO last time.I think this place is worth every penny. My family and I decided to go to try the hibachi this time . The service was amazing, a girl explains you everything you are eating in detail. This is a culinary experience. From the appetizer to the hibachi meal.Kids loves it,my daughter was screaming from the beginning to the end.and also,the Dessert"GUAVA MANGO FLUTE" was FANTASTIC.Make sure you drink SAMURAI Sake sampler.
