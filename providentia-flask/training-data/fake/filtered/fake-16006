This restaurant is not bad itself, the food is good but staff that works there... no words. I can speak and understand Russian and I did hear how two girls who work there (one blonde at a bar and another brunette chubby girl (the manager), were discussing customers in a very negative nasty manner saying bad things about group of people seating there and were laughing at them. They thought no one heard them Â when I was passing by. I was very disappointed at how two faced these girls were laughing at customers but smiling to them pretending to be nice. I wanted to throw up. Never going there againg. I don't want to be discussed by their staff. Imagine what they say about customers when they leave...
