Avoid this place on a friday, what a mess! stood at the door for 10 minutes with no one saying a peep - had to ask the bartender what the deal was. he told me to go to the back door and wait for someone to take my order. ok so we stood around in a crowd for another 10 before placing order, waited another 20 for a seat at the bar no less. By now Im thinking this pizza must be great right? WRONG - nothing to write home about at all- average at best! plus its a rip-off: pepperoni and sausage large pizza plus a drink at the bar was $28.00!! never going back here!
