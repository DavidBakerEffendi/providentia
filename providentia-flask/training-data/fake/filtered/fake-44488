I have been to McLadden's Pub on a number of occasions and have found the staff to be pleasant, the food (especially the wings and fish and chips) to be perfect. The draw is really the beer selection- which is outstanding! I have noticed improvements in service since the opening. Would definitely recommend this pub.
