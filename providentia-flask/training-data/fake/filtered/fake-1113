This restaurant is fun for happy hour or for a casual dinner before a night on the town.  The decor is imaginative and the swinging chairs are simply joyous to swing in.  I would highly recommend the BBQ quesadilla ---this dish is amazing! Although I was initially a  bit hesitant to try this dish, it ended up exceeding any expectations that I cold have had.   The cheesesteak egg rolls however, were a disappointment.  Not only was the roll way too fried but it was also lacking a lot of flavor.  It's not something I would recommend.
