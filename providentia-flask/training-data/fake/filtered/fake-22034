LOVE this place :) I live in old city but my friends and I can't stay away for long! The "small" portions are perfect and the "large" and HUGE! I always walk away with leftovers I can't wait to reheat.  I'm Gluten and dairy free but still get choices, not just one designated gluten free option.  If you've never been here, or are visiting the city, The Continental is a MUST to try!!
