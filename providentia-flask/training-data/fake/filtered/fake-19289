For such simple food, Rybread is SOOO good! I'm a big fan of their breakfast sandwiches -- and I really appreciate that they are made fresh, not a warmed up patty. Their sandwiches are STACKED with meat. Sure, it's like $7-8 for a sandwich, but it's totally worth it. The sweets are awesome too. Chocolate peanut butter cupcakes? Aw yeah. My only wish is that they tweet soup of the day every day. It's kind of annoying to have to call. I'd also appreciate more vegan and dairy-free options. But otherwise, Rybread is absolutely perfect and I've never eaten anything I didn't like from here.
