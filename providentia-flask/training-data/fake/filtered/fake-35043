Wasn't sure where I was going to find vietnamese food in new york since I'm here on business for the next week but I managed to get a recommendation for Saigon Shack. Â I was pleasantly surprised I didn't expect much so in that sense they exceeded my expectations The serving sizes are generous and the pho soup was authentic enough.
