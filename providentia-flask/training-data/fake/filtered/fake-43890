Llama Tooth was the perfect location for dinner before a concert across the street at a new venue called Union Transfer. The food and drink were creatively delicious and intoxicating with plenty of variety for future visits. Our waiter (tall guy, glasses, gray hair) was a great host and helped us make the right decisions regarding the menu. I would highly recommend it!
