Have been here many times, and I've never had a bad meal or bad service! The staff is incredibly friendly and accommodating, the drinks are excellent, and the food is consistently good. The lobster mac and cheese and their lobster risotto are personal favorites when I'm in the mood for some comfort food. But my all-time favorite is the seared Ahi tuna! Always cooked perfectly (rare). Also, the key lime pie is a great dessert option when you're feeling sinful! :)
