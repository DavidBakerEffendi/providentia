AMAZING. Service, food, prices, sangria, everything is just perfect. Chicken montaditos as appetizer, then the sweet cachapa, and flan for dessert. It's just what you need. Bartender, the funniest person on earth, couldn't stop laughing (and neither could the waitress). Perfect atmosphere. Go check it out!!!
