Food is decent but the service is really bad.  We were a party of 5 with reservation.  When we got there, they did not have a table for us so they asked to wait 5 minutes.  Fifteen minutes later, we realized that our table was not going to be available for another  30 minutes so we decided to order for takeout instead.  We placed our order but they missed one of our orders so we inquired.  They looked at us like we were crazy for wanting our missing order.  They did not even bother to apologize for missing one our orders. The waitress who worked there the night we visited was extremely rude.  She was pushing us while we were waiting in line for our food.   Very rude!
