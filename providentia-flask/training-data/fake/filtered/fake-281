I really do not understand the lay-out of this bar. So you walk in, and there's a small bar. Then you walk upstairs, and there are 4-5 more little bars. But none of the bars are directly connected, you need to walk through small little hallways to get there. Then, when you get a certain bar, it may be overly crowded so you have to navigate to another one through the tiny, windy hallway. All of this for a beer. To make matters worse, on a weekend it can be a mob scene of not the coolest of crowds. Like a bunch of angry bros looking to get smashed and start trouble. Overall, it a generic, poorly set-up bro bar that I would avoid at almost all costs.
