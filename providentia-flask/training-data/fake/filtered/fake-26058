This is a great restaurant for groups, I went with three other friends (so 4 in total) and we all split everything (it was a good amount for all of us to be full). We ordered the Pumpkin Ravioli, Linguine with cream sauce, chicken Parmesan, and chicken Francesca. Great service, the server stepped in with the specials of the day, such as the Pumpkin Ravioli. Seems like a strange combo but it works! The filling brought out this sweetness that regular raviolis do not have. I think it was topped off with some goat cheese. We chose the Linguini (which were fresh for the day) with cream sauce, and the Chicken Parm because a lot of Yelp reviews praised this dish. These were perfect and really complimented each other. Our meal totaled up to approx. ~$80 (with tips/tax), which they subtracted $40 from the voucher, leading to us chipping in around $15 dollars each. Not bad for a meal of authentic Italian cuisine! The deal sold me in coming to this place, and I'm glad I tried it! My name is Shelly, and I also keep a amateur food blog-- Check it out here! alreadyhungry.wordpress.â€¦
