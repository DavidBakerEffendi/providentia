This place is horrible. I never had such terrible service to say the least. The waitress could not be found so another waitress took our order. I never received my coke and it took forever to get our food. Our waitress finally came upstairs and went right to the register to yap with the other waitress. Then when the food finally came it was served by some waiter who did not know our order. She finally came over to see how the food was, what a confusing place I had know clue who the waiter / waitress was. The food was ok but I would go across the street the service is good and the food is so much better. Might not be as trendy as this place but to me its all about the food and service not about the decor and people who dine there. Â The best part was our waitress came over for one second to give us a check and had the audacity to give us a rating card for her service, well here is your rating . Quit your job and go back to school.
