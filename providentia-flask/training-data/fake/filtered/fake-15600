Incredible: one of the most astounding meals I have had in a while.  Crisp kale salad with papaya and cucumbers (this was the best dish with its exotic and robust flavors), sweatbreads à la meunière, and duck with radish and plums.  The service team was both friendly while remaining steady and informed, and the room had that illusive Brooklyn high-energy-and-cool-yet-classy-and-unpretentious mix.  The wait was long-ish, as expected, but it's understandable given the buzz, high-quality and tiny space.
