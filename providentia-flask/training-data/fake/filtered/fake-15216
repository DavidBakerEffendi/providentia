As an Aussie living in Astoria i have to say that I waited for years for someone to open an Australian restaurant. It gives me great pleasure to say that The Thirsty Koala has finally opened - and its AWESOME!!! The staff are so nice and friendly. The owners including the chef mingle and check up on you every now and again to make sure everything is Ok. Great people... THE FOOD: was delicious and so fresh, you can really see the quality Â they are using. Overall the menu has such a great variety to choose from and don't leave without trying the Pavlova and the Triple T tim tam dessert - HEAVEN on Earth! The atmosphere of the restaurant is real laid back and comfortable. Overall i have to say that this is my new Hot Spot. If you cant make it down under then u definitely need to pop in and try out the Thirsty Koala!
