I have gone here a handful of times now, and have not been disappointed yet!  The appetizers I had were delicious, especially the buffalo wings.  Their margaritas were super yummy as well.  The atmosphere is very comfortable and family friendly, and the staff is very accommodating.  I would definitely come here again!
