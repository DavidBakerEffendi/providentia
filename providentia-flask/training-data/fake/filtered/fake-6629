My husband and I love this restaurant. The food is very tasty, delish. Our favorite dishes include Massaman Curry, Grilled beef, Flat Rice Noodle w. Black Soy Sauce and offcourse Chicken Pad Thai. I don't understand why so many bad reviews, if you know a better place than this, please let me know, but as far as Thai food, it was not able to find a better place than Thai Essence. Thanks! P.S: my husband is on his way to Thai Essence to pick up, tonight we are going for Green Curry (first time) and Saute Chicken Hot Pepper. Yum!
