The new Gusanoz is a disappointment to me and my wife.  It used to be our favorite place to eat out in the Upper Valley.   Some changes we didn't like- the new decor (too bright and "fast foody"), fewer menu items at a higher price, no more specials, lack of salsa bar (although I here this may return).   I have talked to some other regulars who feel a bit let down....don't think we'll return.
