Ok, I'll make this as quick and to the point as possible. I noticed that the reviews that are 3 stars or less must come from people that have a stick so far up their butts, that they are probably tasting the wood from the handle and not the food that they are eating!  I'm not from Philly, nor do I have any "experience" with cheese steaks (other than here and there when visiting), other than the typical wanna be cheese steaks from Charlie's, Subway, etc... (I know, you CAN'T compare them with REAL Philly cheese steaks, so please don't bother with a wiseguy comment lol).  My GF and I stopped by while visiting Philly today, and both got cheese steak subs. I got the pepperoni pizza cheese steak sub and she got the chicken cheese steak sub, along with a cannoli. Since we weren't terribly hungry, the gentleman (Dave I think his name is), offered to wrap them to go, so I agreed to that and within 10 minutes I was handed over two big subs wrapped in aluminum wrapping and packaged up nicely with our cannoli separately in two white bags.  Since we live in Dover, DE, I figured our subs would be a little cold and mushy, but WE WERE BOTH WRONG!! Not sure how, but both of our subs were not only STILL WARM, but DAMN GOOD!!!! No, let's go with AWESOME!! Keep up the good work Del Rossi's and don't let the "parade rainers" ruin your day! We'll be back over and over and over again!!! A + + + + + + +
