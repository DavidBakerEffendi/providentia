I took a friend out to lunch at the Farm yesterday. We were seated right away but it took at least 30 minutes for someone to take our order.  We both ordered cheeseburgers and we both specifically stated no onions (which the waitress wrote down).  When the food was delivered my burger was smothered in onions.  I know most people like them but  I can't tolerate them.  Consequently, they were removed from my plate. After we finished eating I asked for the bill.  It was promptly brought to me.  It totaled $32.66.  I handed the waitress a $50.00 bill and asked for change.  My change should have been $17.34.  She brought back $12.00.  I asked her to come over and showed her the bill and my change.  She said, Oh, I owe you $5.00.  I said, "Actually, you owe me $5.34".  She said, Oh, we don't make change, we round up or down. REALLY??????? I know it's only 34 cents, but the principle is all wrong.  I looked at her and she told me that it's just the way it is and they don't make change.  But they certainly benefit  by this practice if the patrons  get shortchanged all around.   No one I know has heard of a restaurant doing this (many of my friends own restaurants in Brooklyn). Well, guess what?  I don't tip in a place like that won't make change (and I always tip 20%). If they don't want to make change they should price every thing at an even dollar amount.
