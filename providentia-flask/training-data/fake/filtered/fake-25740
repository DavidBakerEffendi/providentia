When I am up visiting the area, I have to stop by and have lunch. The go-to sandwich is the Pastrami which is my favorite. I tend to have an aversion to fat so I ask for it lean and they usually to to follow my request. I am a big eater but usually this sandwich is piled so high that I take part of it home. For starters, the lentil soup is good but sometimes a little salty for my taste. They did a recent renovation to expand their take-out and it is a nice improvement. The pickles are wonderful and the staff is friendly
