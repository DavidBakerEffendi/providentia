So disappointing! We had a Groupon for this place (spend $15, get $30 of food) and were so incredibly disappointed I'm going to contact Groupon for a refund.  This was some of the lowest quality food we have ever had.  The celery sticks were thin, wilted, brown, and it was obvious they had been cut quite a while ago.  The cup of blue cheese "dressing" that clearly said "keep refrigerated" arrived warm.  The boneless wings - essentially chicken fingers - were soggy and had no flavor.  The fries and onion rings were soggy , flavorless, and all-around awful.  you would be better getting some frozen food at Walmart and baking it at home on a cookie sheet.  Skip this and go elsewhere. We ended up calling the manager to complain about the poor quality of food, a lost delivery driver, and incorrect charges on our receipt.  He was cool and offered us a free future meal.  I'm not sure I want to give this place another chance, but at least he tried to help make up for our poor experience.
