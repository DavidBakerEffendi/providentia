I had my bridal shower luncheon at The Blue Cat. The service was fantastic and the food was delicious. My guests loved the intimate atmosphere and everyone had a great time. The portions are large, and the staff is so friendly and personable. I can't wait to go back for dinner! Thanks Blue Cat for an awesome shower!
