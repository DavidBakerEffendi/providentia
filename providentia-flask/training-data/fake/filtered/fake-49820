This place is great! They have a daily list of about 4 or 5 specials that are only $12.95. They include your entree, soup, salad, 2 sides and a desert of your choice. I have been in this area training for a new job and have eaten here 3 times now. It's probably one of the best places to eat in Hightstown. The service is good but not great, but the owner or family of the owner stops by and asks you how everything is. So the place is very friendly and does have a lot of locals but is still friendly to outsiders like me. Â The food portions are very large and the menu is really fair. The meals range from $6 - around $20 and the menu is very large with a lot to choose from. The rice pudding was especially good for dessert.
