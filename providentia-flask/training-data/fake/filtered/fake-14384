Went to dinner with friends and found the place okay.  My friends' burgers were under cooked - medium means rare and rare means RAW.  The sloppy joe was so-so.  The sauce was good but not really enough of it to be "sloppy ".  The chocolate beard pudding was excellent, enough for the three of us to share and the best part of the meal.  They do have a great selection of beers. The service was quick and friendly and the atmosphere was cozy.
