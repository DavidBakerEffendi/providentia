A guy that looks like Scotty J. from Boogie Nights ( aka Phillip Seymour Hoffman) with the short shorts and the blond hair and coke bottle Â glasses pulls up to give us our sandwiches. Guy is friendly, pets my annoying ankle biting dogs and goes on his way. I sit down to take a bite out of my italian sandwich and everything in it was stale right down to the soggy tomatoes. My mother ordered the chicken sandwich and she got mostly bread and cheese. My dogs weren't too crazy about it either, I'd give it one star if it weren't for Scotty J. Other than that it was pretty bad.
