Enjoyed a dinner for 2 for a special occasion...7pm res on a Monday and we sat in the back area which was already bustling (in a good way) considering 7pm is a bit early for a dinner in NYC's west village. I'm not one for long reviews, but this was good enough to provide some light: Service was very personable though it was a bit strange to have not one but three servers throughout our meal. Maybe it's an efficiency technique or just the way they do it but I prefer to get to know & trust one server (they should know, it can also make for better tips!) However, all were so friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu. Sommelier recommended a fantastic wine called the "Agricola Punica Montessu Isola dei Nuraghi IGT" I know, a mouthful (no pun intended) and I've already tracked it down with the "Hello Vino" iphone app to buy a couple bottles. On to the meal: we split the monkey bread, bbq octopus, and tortellini before ordering our entrees. Everyone raves about the bread and rightfully so...that rosemary lardo is ridic. Octopus was tasty and the tortellini was mouthwatering...buttery sauce which I have to admit I'm a fan of. I ordered the duck and she ordered the halibut. Duck was perfect, but lots of sauce so make sure you can handle rich tastes. I would definitely order it again. She loved the halibut, but I found it a bit fishy (I would have ordered the sea trout). We probably ordered the wrong desert (white chocolate crumble...), which was a bit dry...but our expectations were towering by that point. All in all a 5 star experience and would go back often if it weren't for the steep pricing. With a cocktail each & a bottle of wine we were over $150pp after tax & tip. WORTH IT.
