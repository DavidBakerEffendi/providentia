Mediocre food and high prices is not a recipe for success. I've been there twice in 6 weeks.  Got take out pizza both times. Both times the website was down, so I had to order blind without access to any pricing. First time I ordered Quattro Stagioni.  It wAs good, the crust was perfect but it was not a Quattro Stagioni.  The big pie was $21! Second time my husband ordered a small pie with bufala mozzarella and artichokes.  The pie was as big as a dinner plate.  The sauce was bare and the artichokes were clearly canned or frozen.  The pie was $17!  I complained about the price and someone who appeared to be the manager said that the big margarita pizza was $15.95.  Exactly.  And it feeds 3 people for less money. This place has hosted a succession of failures over the last 5 years.  Given the average food and extreme pricing (the place was empty both times I went in but in fairness, it was past peak dinner hour), I cannot imagine the place will succeed. Next time, it's Ah Pizz for me!
