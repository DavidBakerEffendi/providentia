My family ate at this restaurant this evening for Fathers Day. The service was beyond dismal. It was disjointed and inconsistent. The portions were extremely small. The food was, however, tasty. For the quality, this is an extremely overpriced dining experience. New York has so many wonderful choices. Save your time and money, dine elsewhere.
