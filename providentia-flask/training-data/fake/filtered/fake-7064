Wow Kati rolls sound so good I just had to try, too bad I saw the kitchen food preparers smoking cigarettes outside with rubber gloves on and when they returned inside, they didn't changed their gloves. I also saw them throwing away garage with same gloves on. Â This place looks great but I will pass, I suggest you look at their hands before you buy food there.
