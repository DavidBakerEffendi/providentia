Absolutely amazing. I'm extremely picky when it comes to Indian food, but Zaroka knocks it out of the park every time. The Chicken Tikka Masala is a must. Â The sauce tastes even better on top of the garlic naan. My friend and I just tried the Chana Saag tonight which looks boring and bland on the menu, but was spiced to perfection! The meal was only complemented by the staff, who could not have been friendlier. As soon as my water glass reached the halfway mark, the waiter came over immediately to top it off. I would recommend Zaroka over and over again.
