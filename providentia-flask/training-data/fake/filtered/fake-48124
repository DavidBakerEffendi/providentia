I have to admit that I didn't have high hopes for Osteria Morini upon our arrival. We arrived for our reservation to a place so crowded that many people were waiting outside, unable to get past the guy who seemed like a bouncer at the door. After a long wait, we were finally seated in the back corner of the restaurant. The dining room is very loud--this is not the place to go for a quiet, romantic dinner on a Saturday night. I was very pleased with the food and wine. Appetizers: artichoke and cranberry bean crostini, and prosciutto and mortadella meatballs. Pasta: squash mezzaluna and my husband ordered the night's special pasta. Everything was simple and tasty. I felt like I was back in Italy instead of eating Americanized Italian food. Unfortunately, I felt rushed from the moment we sat down. The whole time we were eating, the staff was constantly checking in to see how much longer we would be at the table and to try to empty our bottle of wine faster. For this reason, I can only give Osteria Morini three stars. The food brought me back to Italy, and I would return for the great food, but not on a Saturday night.
