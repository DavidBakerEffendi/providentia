This is my favorite restaurant in New Haven. The burgers are amazing! My daughters and I love the fried pickles and we typically dont't eat fried food. Their sweet potato fries are almost as good as the ones I make at home. Service is always prompt and courteous and they do have some nice specials. The atmosphere is fun, energetic and comfortable.
