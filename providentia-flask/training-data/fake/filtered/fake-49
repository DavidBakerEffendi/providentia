I used to love this place when it was Xunta-a very authentic Spanish tapas bar, casual, informal bar with tapas and a great atmosphere - so I went for years, bringing many out of town visitors and friends for happy hour and on weekends. Now, sadly, I have to say that Nai is not the same place and not worth spending your money there. The new owner has made a lot of changes, for the worse, imo, and is very strange (looks like some dude from Queens)-he seems to be always there,with a scowl on his face, is neither inviting nor welcoming, and acts dismissive and like he is  doing you a favor even talking to  you-when we even show up early for reservations and have done nothing except wanting to patronize his bar! He runs the place like a formal dining restaurant..it feels like you have to be in exactly on time, spend your pricepoint, and get out-all very anti-tapas bar to me. At my  birthday celebration of 10 people, he actually did ask us to leave after 2 hours because he "needed" the table though we had spent several hundred dollars and were still eating and drinking! I was flabbergasted at how rude that was.  Also I noticed that since the change to Nai, the food is not as good as it used to be (octopus and other dishes not cooked well), with higher prices as well, and the sangria is now also watered down/sweet imo--just not a good value. And the décor now is blah (think tacky flamenco paintings from homedecorators.com)-does not have any of the charm or personality of the old Xunta. Sadly, after giving it a go a couple of times, I am in search once again of an authentic Spanish tapas bar.
