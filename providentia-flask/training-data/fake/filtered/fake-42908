Horrific! I called them for delivery because they are literally 2 miles away and I was working.  50 minutes later, I had to call again because there was no delivery. Over ONE HOUR later, it finally arrived.  General Tsao chicken was terrible, coated in some fat or something and it was cold. It sure didn't taste like chicken!  4 small pieces of broccoli included, for $10?  And extra for brown rice?  The WORST place EVER!
