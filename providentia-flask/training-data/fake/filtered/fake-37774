I have been to the Belgian cafe many many times and have seen families dinning there all the time. I was a little shocked and very disappointed when I was turned away with my 18 year old cousin. We went there to have dinner on Friday night and the hostess said sorry you have to be 21 to dine here. When there was a mother with an infant sitting outside eating dinner. We walked over 10 blocks just to he turned away. Great food but the hostess was very rude when making us leave, she said sorry that is just the way it is. We then went to a bar/ restaurant right around the corner and had a great meal. The Belgian cafe has great food but poor service. Not sure if I will ever return, I go there at least once a week in the summer for the muscles. I do not know if I will be going back.
