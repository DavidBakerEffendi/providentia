A great find! Colombian food is unique - not the hot, hot, hot of almost all restaurants I've been to lately. Very fresh and well presented. The Camaron Y Pina Asada (grilled shrimp, pineapple and coconut milk) came in half pineapple scooped out. The Paella dish was a feast chock full of the sea and enough for 4 people (be prepared to wait for this dish as its complexity requires more time to make). Impressive menu with a vast selection of Spanish favorites. Empanadas light and crisped just right - green salad with tomatoes, strawberries, cucumbers perfectly dressed. The restaurant has just opened - waiting for liquor license but has a separate bar area. Small, intimate and atmospheric with the Latin beat in the background. The owner and her staff were most gracious and attentive to our needs. We were treated like family...a very good attribute for a neighborhood establishment. I will certainly come back when I return to CT to visit my relatives - probably be our new "go to" place when we have the urge to eat out. Thank you for the wonderful dining experience!
