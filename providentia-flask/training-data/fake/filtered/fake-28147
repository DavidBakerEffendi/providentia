Rudest person answering the phone! 15 years been ordering from here but never again. My delivery order contained beef instead of chicken, Called them back and the rude woman insisted I ordered Beef and told me it was my mistake!? So much for customer Service? I was told that I could exchange if I returned it But I reminded her I had it sent delivery.  Did she expect me to drive It back there? In addition I told her I had been ordering That dish with chicken for 15 years and she should would recognize me when I got there. I drove down there in a rage beef screw up in hand. When she saw me she offered to exchange it in a flippant way But too little too late. She was still very rude and unapologetic. I gave her a piece Of my mind then  I Threw the food in the trash right in front of her. Take it from some One who has worked in the food industry a long time... If you treat your customers that poorly you definately don't care what quality Food you're serving them either. It took me 15 years to realize the greasey dingy atmosphere matches their nasty attitude. Shame on you Wah yan kitchen!
