After reading the reviews, I decided to Smokin Betty's a chance.  Made an on-line reservation for the next day and received a call confirming the reservation that day when I mentioned the sticky tables referred to above/below.  The reservationist said she would put me at one of the new tables, which she did, in the bar.  Bartender/waiter was very efficient and kind and the food was terrific.  Had the turkey meatloaf which was tasty and moist.  Highly recommend giving this place a chance.  Loved the decor!!
