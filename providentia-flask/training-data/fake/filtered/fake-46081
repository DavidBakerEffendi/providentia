My mother and I had breakfast at the restaurant a couple weeks ago.  The food was good.  Coffee hot.  Food was fresh, including the fruit.  My mother had waffles and I had French toast.  Delicious.   Our meal was made better by the friendly conversation held with fellow diners.  I plan to return and see if my findings are consistent.
