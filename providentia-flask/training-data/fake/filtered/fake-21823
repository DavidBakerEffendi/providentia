This dealer is really amazing. I recently bought 2010 Honda Civic from this dealer. I drove from New Jersey because the car prices these guys are offering are really chip. I had a doubt whether the car will be good or not. But after the test drive I made that deal final. These people are great people to work with. I was kind of afraid due to all the tricks the dealers have but these guys are about there business went in saw the car drove the car got approved and drove out couldn't have asked for something else stress free as far car buying experience would defiantly recommend them!
