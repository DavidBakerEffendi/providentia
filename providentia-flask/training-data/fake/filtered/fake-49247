Love this place!  Always great service, very friendly staff.  Mussels for a free appetizer -  you can't beat it!!  They will also sometimes give us a free dessert - and everyone always gets the small yogurt at the end of your meal.  My only complaint is that it's small so there is usually a wait on a friday or saturday night. My favorite place for great sushi at a reasonable price.
