There are many write-ups and reviews about this place. And often the more reviews there the more disappointing the meal ends up to be. But talking about fresh food.... It can't get much fresher than that in NYC. They do not have a menu to start with and write the dishes of the day on your table cloth once you arrive. That's based on the ingredients which they have available that day. The burger is a permanent fixture and worth trying. But given that it can be tough to get a table in the evening I recommend going for something out of the ordinary. I was surprised at what level they executed the food. I can't wait to go back there.
