One of the best in the state. I often look for an excuse to be near them at mealtime. Â Outstanding Salads! They have hearty portions and generally solid service. Breakfasts are always great, especially the omelets. Also, I highly recommend their Veal Parm. It's better than most Itaian restaurants. Best of all ... open 24/7!!!!
