I just placed an order of a regular pie to be delivered. They answered the phone quickly and kindly answered my questions. They said it would be $12.00 and only 20 minutes (in-town delivery.) I couldn't believe the delivery was actually on time and the pizza was pretty big. It was a thin crust and lightly seasoned. I appreciated the timely customer service on such a rainy night!
