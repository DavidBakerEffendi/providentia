Previously Nick's Café 72, this warm and friendly café is now owned by the same owners as Cugino's Italian Specialties in Pennimgton NJ.  The commitment to exceptional quality in food and service is evident in both places.  They have kept the American fare menu and added some unique items that cannot be found anywhere locally such as cajun shrimp and grits, biscuits & gravy, tiramisu pancakes and fig waffles!  The specials never cease to amaze as well.  Had a jumbo lump crab benedict with asparagus last week.  Highly recommended!
