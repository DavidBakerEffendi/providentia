This was the perfect place to order from for a group that all wanted something different, we ordered Greek salad, cheese burgers, pizza, chicken francese, turkey club sand which & Philly cheese steak. We ordered there and then went to the bar to have some drinks while we waited. The bartender made great drinks and the bar has 2 huge flat screens TVs to watch "the game". I don't recommend the phillysteak, but everything else was good. Â  I'm giving them 4 stars because they have a lot of variety, the service was great and they had a nice small bar.
