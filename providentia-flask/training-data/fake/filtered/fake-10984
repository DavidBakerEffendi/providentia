yummy yakitori and fabulous desserts, although overpriced... i left feeling great about the restaurant. then i came down with food poisoning, confirmed campylobacter jejuni, which is associated with undercooked chicken. i did have several chicken items there, including some half cooked livers, and those were pretty much the only chicken items items i had in that time period. just wanted to write a warning about the undercooked chicken they serve... i have eaten at a lot of other yakitori places in ny with no problems, so i will not be returning to this place.
