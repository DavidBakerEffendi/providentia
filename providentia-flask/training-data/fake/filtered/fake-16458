I have passed by this diner a couple times and figured id give it a shot since i was coming from the gym and my order was simple.  "How bad can you screw up eggs?" I thought to myself. I ordered a plain 6 egg omelet.  I made sure to tell the waitress i wanted whole eggs and no egg whites.  I also told them no toast or homefries and to have steamed broccolli  instead.  I also ordered a side of turkey bacon. Ofcourse they gave me egg whites and it for sure wasnt 6 eggs either.  I eat eggs everyday and I hate egg whites. I told the waitress it was egg whites and she looked at her order slip and told me she put regular..i mean im no connoisseur but, i think 99.9% of yelpers could tell the difference between a plain white omelet that tasted like egg whites and a 6 egg yellow omelet.   The turkey bacon was O.K.  But my sideof broccolli was weak.  I got 4 pieces of brocolli. My bill came out to $21. The 4 pieces of brocolli was $5.. Should have went to a steakhouse and ordered a prime rib instead for the same price and not have my simple order screwed up. At the register I was asked how everything was and I said "it was pretty bad actually" and nothing was responded to me, not even a "why?", as if she knew herself that it probably sucked. FAIL
