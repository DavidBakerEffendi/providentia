Definitely not the greatest Mexican food I've ever had but it's cheap and has big portions so should appeal to the masses. Service was confusing and all over the place. Waitress was texting up at the front when she should have been paying attention to customers. The door to the kitchen was open and we could hear everything going on in the back. Isn't there a reason there's a door to the kitchen?? Use it folks!
