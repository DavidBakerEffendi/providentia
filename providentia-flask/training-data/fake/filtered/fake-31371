Three things to know:  1) food is good.  very good.  but we are not talking gourmet menu, 2) prices are ridiculous!  Like egg breakfast for $23?  That sounds like Four Seasons hotel or something?  Taking $5-10 off of most menu prices seems about right, and 3) no credit cards.  Stupid!   Overall, I could have enjoyed the experience because of #1, but felt ripped off because of #2 and #3.
