Quality french food with a friendly attitude. I am originally from France and I discovered cafe Triskell through a friend who has often visited France. It was a great discovery since most of the french restaurant in the city are not the true reflection of what a restaurant is in France. This one is the case. Great and diverse food in a very relaxed and friendly atmosphere. The lobster and shrimp risottos are to die for. Add a crepe for desert and you have a very nice culinary experience without breaking the bank. Moreover Chef Philippe Fallait is not afraid to share some of his cooking tips. I go there frequently and recently have tried his foie gras that I have to say was one of the best I have ever tasted. The service is done with by the very friendly wife of Philippe and Mary who make you feel at home right from the moment you enter. Go there a second time and you become friends, a third visit you are family. A true unknown little jewel at the heart of Astoria. Not to be missed...
