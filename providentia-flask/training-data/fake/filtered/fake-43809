Where to start? A hostess that won't seat our party for drinks even though it's 5pm and the restaurant is empty; so we agree to order dinner. A waiter who doesn't listen to the guests when he makes recommendations; so we get a dish that resembles risotto when we asked for a pasta recommendation. A floor manager who will not allow an additional guest to join our party, even though we're spending more than a grand on drinks and dinner and the restaurant still has plenty of tables open...in fact, she ordered one of my party "I need your chair. Now." Oh yes, and then there's the night manager who tries to pick a fist fight with me when I tell him that the service is terrible. Stay away from this joint--it's all hype and no service; you'd be treated to a better dining experience at Olive Garden.
