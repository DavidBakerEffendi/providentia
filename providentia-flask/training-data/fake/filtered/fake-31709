I went to Havana Social over the weekend for a friends birthdays for brunch and was pleasantly surprised with how great of a place it is. I usually do not get involved with the Manhattan brunch scene but Havana Social really changed my perspective on that. They were very accommodating with having a large party while taking care of smaller groups that were eating as well. The staff was extremely friendly and attentive the entire time we were there. When it came time to take our order and refill drinks, they were always there to check on us throughout our meal. In addition to the wonderful service, the ambiance of the place was fantastic! The attention to detail was spot on and the decor was awesome. What might be most important to some people was that the food was amazing! Even the plating of the food was quite nice and an added bonus to such a great meal. I ordered the steak and eggs and I was surprised with how great it was. Usually you don't expect to get all of that in one restaurant and I can't wait to go back!
