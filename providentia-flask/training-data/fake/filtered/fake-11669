Very surprising for a Restaurant  in a Department Store.  Private elevator was nice, menu selection was a good one, service excellent, we were early for our reservation but was seated right on time, in fact a little earlier, and we never felt rushed in any way.   Food was excellent.  My husband and I had the steak for 2 and it was cooked to perfection. Coffee and Gelato for dessert was also excellent.  Walked back across to MSG saw The Grinch, got back on the LIRR and was back home in my house in 40 minutes.  Would recommend STELLA 34 to everyone.  Price was good also.  Only gave it 4 STARS  because there is always room for improvement no matter how good they are.
