I love this place!  The food and drinks are great, really reasonably priced, and they are KID FRIENDLY!  I love that I can take my boys here, get great food and not feel like I'm inconveniencing them by having kids.  They bring over coloring books and crayons, have cups with lids and straws, and a great kids menu! So happy to have found a fantastic family restaurant that I actually like to eat at and enjoy myself!
