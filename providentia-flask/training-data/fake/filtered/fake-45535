This place isn't good at all, it sucks. First off, they made me take off my beanie when i walked in the door, I understand if you're my mother and it was a old school familly dinner but this is a shitty itialian place in the middle of nowhere with old itialian guys wearing shitty mechanic shirts. Second, we ordered the fettuccine prosciutto, I love prosciutto. There was one major problem: there was basically no prosciutto. If you're going to put it in the name I had better be seeing it on the plate or tasting it when i eat, i got neither. Also- the bill was $45 cash only (nothing wrong there) I put $60 on the table and asked for change when the waiter came by...I waited for atleast 20 minutes and no one ever came back to the table. At this point I was fed up and just left. I would definitely not recommend coming here at all, I will never go back and make sure that everyone knows how bad this place is at the hotels in the area. PS: the sauce literally tastes like they got some Ragu from the store (the pasta was cooked properly though). My family makes homemade sauce all the time and you can taste the difference, this is totally canned junk. DO NOT GO HERE
