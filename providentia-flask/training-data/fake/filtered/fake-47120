I went with 4 other people and we decided to each order two small plates and share.  Everything was delicious. Everything. My only complaint is that the servings were tiiiiiny. They were called small plates but we still thought we were ordering too much food (mostly based on the price tags, I'm afraid-- how small can a 14 dollar plate of ceviche really be?) Quite, quite, small as it turns out.   The atmosphere was so laid back that the prices seemed out of place.  The ceviche was probably my favorite thing I tried, but I had literally half a fork full when it was split between 5 of us. The fried olives were fantastic, and I'm not even an olive lover.   There was a dish of shrimp wrapped in phyllo dough with flying fish roe and wasabi sauce which was also amazing. Perfect scallops, just... perfect.   The eggplant bruschetta, grilled pizza, and the roasted cauliflower with pine nuts were all lovely. Skippables were the quinoa salad, the pickle plate, the DIY hummus (the bread was nice but the hummus was pretty dull... as for having to grind it yourself- not really.  It was pretty much ready made hummus in a mortar with a few unground garbanzos on top). As delicious as it was, I'm not a heavy eater and I have to take home leftovers more often than not, and I was still hungry after this.  It was a good one-time experience.
