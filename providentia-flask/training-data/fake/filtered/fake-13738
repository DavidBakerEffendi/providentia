Tuesday night we had some of the best pizza in a long time. First of all this place has a warm and friendly atmosphere due in part to owner Patsy working the floor with a smile. Our server Dave gave us a few ideas to work from and with his lead he brought out our Â pizza that was so full of flavor... crust is thin, crispy, and salty. You can taste the freshness of the toppings in every bite you take. Thank you Pasty and to your waiter David (very knowledgeable about wine and food) for giving us a wonderful meal and super service to remember!
