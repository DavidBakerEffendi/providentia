This restaurant served me the worst meal of my life. Every dish was nothing but salt, salt and more salt; the actual featured ingredients were impossible to recognize. The albondingas were obviously deep fried (to black) and were lucky to be cut with a chainsaw. Every plate, be it tapas or entree, was basically inedible. It was hands down the worst meal I've ever attempted to eat. Â  But if you really like salt, go for it.
