I am obsessed with ramen, and i love Totto Ramen. I have tried every ramen on the menu, and they are really good, but I especially love the Totto Ramen. The miso ramen is way too salty and sort of heavy. The noodles are great, the waiters are friendly, and the broth is yummy. It's also ... clean. Sometimes ramen broths can be too cloudy and just a mess, but this broth is terrific.
