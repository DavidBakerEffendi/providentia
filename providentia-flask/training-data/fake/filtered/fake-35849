The food was delicious accompanied by friendly staff and a wonderful atmosphere, it's a must go when in Burlington Vermont. Everything is priced very reasonable, you can't go wrong. I've tried almost everything in the menu and I still want to go back for the rest. Maybe another round of the Mushroom Gnocchi and Fried Green Tomato BLT. I couldn't stop thinking of the Seafood Chowder and Grits with Seafood. Whatever you get at The Gryphon, you won't regret it. Atmosphere is warm, relaxing and filled with staff ready to get you what you want.
