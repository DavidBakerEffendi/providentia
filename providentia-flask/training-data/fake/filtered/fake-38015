Great food, brunch or dinner!  Only con is the wait time has gone up a lot since they first opened, but I suppose that means they are doing things right.  They do have a great system of putting your name in and texting you when your table is ready.  It's very convenient for me as I live a couple blocks away and can make it within their 5min window.   The bartender is very nice and ended up chatting with our group one night about a special drink he created.  His enthusiasm for it led to half our party ordering it and the other half wishing they had.   The other reviews about large portions are definitely correct!  I end up finishing my chicken and pancakes the next morning for breakfast.
