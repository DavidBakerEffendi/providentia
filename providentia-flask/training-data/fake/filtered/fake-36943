Just incredible. It started with great bread and spreadable sea salted butter.  Yum is all i can say about the soft butter with happy surprise of little pieces of sea salt perfectly spaced between bites.  The salmon tartare was perfect. Duck was the highlight of the meal. Perfectly prepared and will go down as one of the best duck dishes I have ever tasted. We finished with the bread pudding. Loved the combo of sweet with the salty sauce. Highly recommend. We will be back.
