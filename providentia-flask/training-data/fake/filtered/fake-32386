Love this place! Have now been a few times and its always been a great experience. Food is delicious - I've had the turkey burger: delish! Servers are super friendly and they'll bring you your food as you'd like, i.e. don't like onions, no problem. Very happy to have a place like this in the neighborhood, with a cool and comfortable interior and even a lovely patio for when its warmer out.
