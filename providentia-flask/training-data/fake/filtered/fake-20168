Stopped in here after an afternoon tour at the Tenement Museum. The neighborhood used to be known as Little Germany in the 1840's, so this was an appropriate choice.  Got a seat by the open window near sidewalk.  Great German beer, great lunch.  The owner/manager (not sure of his status) came by and chatted - nice guy.  This puts all the wanna-be Oktoberfest food out here in Jersey to shame.
