The Spotted Big was a precious little gem. Wonderful food and delicious wine. I highly recommend the Arctic Char. Our server, Will, was very kind and knowledgeable when it came to gluten allergies and the safest menu options. He did a wonderful job along with the fantastic hostess, who I also believe was a manager, who was full of spunk and life. Cons: The restaurant is very small and there is limited space for mingling upstairs. With that being said, a server upstairs, who I am told was named Sean, was very rude and did not acclimate to the crowded bar area well unlike other servers. He was very demanding and inappropriate to guests that were just trying to grab a drink at the bar during their hour and a half wait. Also, the wines by the glass are limited and on average are $15 or more so be prepared to spend Â extra on wine if that is your drink of choice.
