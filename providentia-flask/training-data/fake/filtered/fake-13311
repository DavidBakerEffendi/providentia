Really excellent brunch; both dishes we ordered were very well done: the parmesan biscuits and the polenta with eggs.  The service was also extremely good, and the coffee hot and refilled.  My only complaint would be with the space - on a sunny morning for brunch, it's a bit sad to be in a windowless room, pretty as it is.
