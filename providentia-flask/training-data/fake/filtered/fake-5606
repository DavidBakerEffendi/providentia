We went last night to celebrate my birthday around evening time. Definitely the best Indian restaurant we have been to in the area, possibly all over the states. The food was amazing and unique. I really loved the Dahi avocado chaat and my husband loved his chicken madras! The service was outstanding. Definitely will be taking family friends here!
