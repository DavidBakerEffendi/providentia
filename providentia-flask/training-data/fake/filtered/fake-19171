Even with reservations, it was a litle slow getting to our table, but once we were there, the wait was well worth it.   We got both great service and great food.  The pea/bacon flatbread was awesome.  One other highlight was good music in the background (not too loud), but enough to drown out the noise of the open kitchen (which put on a pretty good show).  Vernick is definitely a restaurant worthy of a return visit (or two, or more).
