The food was terrible and the picture stayed with us for days. Went in for early dinner on Saturday (5pm) . It started with BBQ spareribs that looked like they were precooked and refrigerated, dry and my wife said one was cold close to the bone. The main serving was overlooked. The staff just shrugged and walked off. We have dined there any times before, curious what has changed or maybe the lesson learned is ours. Never go early, in this case never go again.
