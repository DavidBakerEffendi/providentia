My friend and I went to Sanford's after a long day of work at 11pm. It was still really busy but the service was still very attentive. Â The food is great- I recommend the pecan crusted chicken salad or the herb crusted honey chicken salad. Great late night atmosphere, it's cozy, no attitude, really pleasant overall experience. Why did it take me so long to find?
