My boyfriend and I always frequent Teresa Caffe! The food is amazing, the prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is the icing on the cake. Not to mention that the proportions are perfect, especially for being an italian restaurant; typically you get 10x more than the average person can eat or not nearly enough, however at Teresa's the meals are a perfect amount! I will continue to drive the 25+ minutes to eat here, LOVE IT!
