Favorite spot in West Philly.  I feel like Manakeesh single-handedly kept my wife and I alive for the past three years.  The manakeesh are delicious, and the pastries are exceptional.  With the addition of Bliss, they now have smoothies and desserts covered.  Beautiful space, delicious food, friendly people.   Abd deserves to be singled out for being an absolutely outstanding manager.  He really makes this place special.
