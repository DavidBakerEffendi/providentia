Great space and location. Good draft beer selection. I hear the burgers are awesome. I don't eat burgers and was dissapointed to find not much else on the lunch menu. I tried a $13.99 salad (every item on the menu is priced with an added .99). The salad portion was tiny and very blah. Obviously this place is more for meat eaters. The pricing seems a little high for a gastropub but, this is Yardley after all. The Chef could use a visit to some of Philly's many outstanding gastropubs. I'll come back, but maybe just to sit at the bar for a beer and some wings and please DON'T MICROWAVE YOUR DINNER ROLLS!!
