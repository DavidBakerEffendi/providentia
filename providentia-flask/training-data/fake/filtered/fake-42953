Horrible service. Looks like the place doesn't have any of its old charm. Yesterday I was at this place for dinner and ordered just routine stuff. Ghee Pongal was as hard as rock solid . Asked them if they had ghee on top of it they said yes. It didnt look right. So I asked them some extra ghee and they gave me hardly I spoon of it in a tiny bowl. As last did not realize they charged 2.00 $ of it . Thats something I would call ridiculous. I wont be going back there anytime and also wont recommend someone to go there.
