For the price, I'm pretty impressed. I ordered some wings, a chicken cutlet grinder and a garden salad - and it was awesome. The wings were nice and meaty. The cutlet seemed handmade and cooked to just-crispy, with the bread being very fresh. The salad was a very generous size, with a good selection of veggies - instead of just the usual iceberg lettuce, there were bits of red cabbage, onion, peppers, cucumbers, carrots, and olives as well. Would definitely order again.
