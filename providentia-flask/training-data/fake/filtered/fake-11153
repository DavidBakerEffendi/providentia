The manager had a very nasty attitude.  My friend arrived just a few minutes late and he would not let her drink/eat  with us. He told her to go the bar and drink alone -- it was restuarant policy.  I will never go here again.  The service was lousy.  I am very appalled.  I will not experience this place again and will turn down invitations to eat here.
