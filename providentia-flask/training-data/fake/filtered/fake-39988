First off its BYOB so bring your beer & wine or whatever you drink. I had the guacamole & choriqueso for apps. both great. Then for my entree I had Fish Tacos. Yummy !!! Service was great, my waiter Rich was friendly explained certain dishes to me & he recommended the fish tacos that were outstanding. The best Mexican Restaurant in North Jersey !!!
