My wife and I now live in another state but when we both lived in CT, we were at Bella's Cafe EVERY weekend! The Sat. and Sun. brunch is truly as good as it gets anywhere. We love the amazing, creative specials. Get there early so that all of the specials are still available (and ask when you get there, so you aren't disappointed and have a "back-up" plan -- lots to choose from!!). In order to ensure freshness and quality, specials are sometimes in limited supply. The gingerbread (seasonal) chai is out of this world. Yeah, you have to wait quite awhile sometimes to get a table, but the counter is usually available sooner, and it is DEFINITELY worth the wait. Don't pass this gem by. It's a local icon and a best-kept secret by the locals. :-) Whenever we make our way back to CT, we stop in for brunch. We also enjoyed the dinners (complete with candlelight). Check it out and see for yourself.
