Well, every bad review I read here was right on target and I'm not sure what place any of the good reviewers went to to eat, because it wasn't the Pantry I went to.  Maybe they're confusing this place with somewhere else.  The service is AWFUL!  I can't believe the morons they hire as waitresses.  Do they interview them, or just hire the first rude and incompetent person who walks in the door?  I've never been ignored so badly or seen so many mistakes as a customer somewhere in my entire life.  My food was cold.  We had to ask for waters.  I'm really not sure that I've ever had to do that anywhere else I've ever gone.  And the food is not that good--let's get real...just ordered an omelet and coffee and it was't even that great.  I've made myself better omelets.   Since I don't like to make entirely negative reviews of anywhere I 'll say one positive: The decor is kind of cool, I thought this would have been a chill place to get breakfast, but it turns out it sucks.  Oh well.  I'll try a different place next time I'm in New Haven.
