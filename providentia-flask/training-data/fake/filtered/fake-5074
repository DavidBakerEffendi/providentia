I was at Dosai place with my family and everyone loved the food and the ambience a lot. The food is excellent and would like to go their every week. This became my top rated food place and would recommend all my friends. The Dosas are very good, with the flavorful sambar and chutneys they serve. Overall very good place for a decent price
