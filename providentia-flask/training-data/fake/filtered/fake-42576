I ordered a roast beef sandwich, the young lady at the counter looked at me with a very distasteful expression and said they didn't have any, she must have been a vegetarian.. I ordered a ham sandwich on rye with swill and deli mustard and got the same distasteful expression and was told they dont have rye bread, REALLY!!  My sandwich had a few shredded pieces of Swiss cheese mixed with slivered almonds.. The mustard was yellow, not deli... They must have taken the cheese from an already prepared salad.. The whole sandwich was very skimpy and dry not fresh... It was priced high. The quality was poor.  I will not be going back
