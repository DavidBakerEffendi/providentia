Very disappointed. Very happy to have gluten free options in my area, but the food just doesn't have the 'umph" factor that would leave you wanting more. Generous portions, but mediocre food. The restaurant has a nice ambiance but the service can be a little hit or miss. Often 'miss' unfortunately. The final nail in the coffin was getting charged $5 for bread when I ordered delivery. Huh? I have my own gluten-free bread at home, I don't need to pay extra for something that is usually given for free at the table. Too bad, I really wanted to like this place!
