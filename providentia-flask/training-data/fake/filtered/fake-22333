Long time reader, first time poster here. I felt compelled to post after reading a recent "review" by a cowardly abuser of free speech who felt entitled enough to personally attack the owner with barely a mention to the food. Yes, CIARA L., I am addressing you. As a longtime resident of WT, I was elated to finally have a place to shop for something better to eat than just decent or okay, and I am grateful to have Joe's store here in a sea of culinary mediocrity--and I'd like to keep him here. Given your 5 star reviews of other places that I KNOW are just okay (at best), I strongly question whether you deserve to eat anything at all. As for your vicious personal attack on the owner over what seems to be your dissatisfaction that sandwiches stop being made at 4pm. What works for you? 5pm? 6? 7? How would you like it expressed to you? Would a personalized email be satisfactory? Should the staff stop working, pull up a chair and have a heart-to-heart with you and explain all the reasons why the 4pm cutoff makes the most sense for their shop. I mean, after all, that's what it comes down to, right? Your entitled self-importance. To attack a business owner personally, call him names, make fun of the car he drives and where he parks it (I'm sure you're one of those moronic bicyclists that bark at cars and people for blocking your coveted bike lane, yet have no problem riding against traffic and will never, ever stop at a red light), and then you actually threaten him with physical violence... Seriously? You are a first rate BULLY hiding behind the comforts of Internet anonymity--and, clearly should be seeking anger management courses instead of wasting time writing baseless, ego-driven reviews. Â  For all others looking for delicious, fresh and well-prepared food you must try Brancaccio's Food Shop! You will not be sorry!
