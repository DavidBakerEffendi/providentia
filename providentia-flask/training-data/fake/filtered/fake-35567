We've been coming here for years and it never disappoints. There's not much to the decor, but the vibe is great. There's a bunch of tables and a long bar where you can eat. The bar separates you from the open grill and we love watching the grillmen at work. It's a tight space for them to work in, but they've got it figured out perfectly. And they turn out great burgers! Plus the fries are the real deal. Tried the wings but ordered them medium and were too hot for us. Mild would be a good choice if you don't like your mouth on fire. But we stick with the burgers and roll out of the place. That and a good on-tap beer makes a perfect meal.
