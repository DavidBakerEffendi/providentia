Went there for breakfast and was not impressed at all. I ordered sausage and I got kielbasa and when it was mentioned to the waitress she got extremely defensive and went into the kitchen and then brought a garbage wrapper out to my table to prove to me that it came in a sausage wrapper. She then went about her business without washing her hands. I don't want someone who doesn't wash their hands after playing in the trash handling my food. They didn't seem to care that I was unhappy with the meat. My boyfriend got home fries which were so raw they were hard as a rock and that didn't seem to bother them either. The wait staff blamed it all on the cook and when we called to talk to the owner he blamed it on the package plant where he gets his meat and then on his cook. I will not ever eat a meal at this place again even if they hire all new staff.
