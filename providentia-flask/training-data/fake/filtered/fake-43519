Visited twice so far and it keeps getting better! We have tried the ribs, ropa vieja, and the pollo asado (grilled chicken), each dish was amazing!!! The atmosphere is very authentic and inviting. Desserts and coffee are great too a must have! I am definitely visiting again very soon so I can keep trying everything else on the menu.
