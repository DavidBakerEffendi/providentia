My wife and I came in on a busy Friday night and were greeted by hostess, who was honest about the wait but promised that the food would make it well worth it.  Judging by the aromas in the dining room, we believed her and took a seat.  As we were served beverages as we waited and looked over the menu, time flew by and we were seated in less time than originally told.   The food was UNBELIEVABLE!  Homemade biscuits to start with sugar cane butter, country fried chicken with greens, short ribs on the bone and sweet potato cheesecake to end the experience.   The staff was friendly, drinks were on point and the jazz music provided great background music for what was one of our best dinners since moving to the Harlem Area last year.  We are so glad to have discovered this gem and we can't wait to come back and sample more off the menu!
