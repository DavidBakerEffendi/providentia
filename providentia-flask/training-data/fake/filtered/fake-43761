My family was in town and we were chocolate hunting (do yourself a favor and stop in The Meadow sometime) and decided we all wanted Tapas. A couple of map checks and we headed over to Alta. Wonderful interior, although very dimly lit. Service was quick and always at the ready. Everyone had a smile on their faces and each portion came out quickly. The food was AMAZING. Everything we got, that I could eat, was lush with taste and failed to disappoint us. Each item seemed more tasty than the one before it. After sharing 10 or so plates, we sampled a handful of their desserts as well. Superb! So, why not 5 stars? The price. It was a touch outrageous. I'm also still a tad disgruntled at places that only take Amex and cash, and yet still charge the amounts they do. And yes, we ate there during the hep scare. We had to get shots. But guess what, that's not the restaurants fault at all, so please spare us all your rants if that's why you are rating this place so low.
