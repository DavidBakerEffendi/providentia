Please stay away from this racist dude's sandwich shop. I was excited to come to Philly and try one of these cheese steaks but when i read all the signs and stupid sayings all over their walls it ruined the whole experience. it's really ignorant and disgusting how they wear their racist shirts and try to say its in the name of america. losers i will never buy from you again and i will tell all my friends to avoid your nasty shop.
