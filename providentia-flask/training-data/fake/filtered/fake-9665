I eyed this cafe on Broadway for a while before finally checking it out. I finally decided to go in and check out their menu. I ordered the falafel wrap and was pleasantly surprised! I finally dragged my parents to come eat there today and they fell in love with the pasta w/swedish meatballs and green lentil soup! Service is great too! :) Vasanta recommended the vegetable platter for our next visit, definitely will put in an order very soon.
