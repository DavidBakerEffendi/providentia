Went here to try the Prix Fixe Dinner.  Had the Market greens because I was ordering the Risotto with wild boar for an entree.  Risotto was perfectly cooked, creamy and loaded with flavor.  Had the Fried Brownie for dessert which was out of this world!  The Peanut butter Ice Cream was just right.  A great value for $35 for a three course meal.  Only giving 4 stars because when I looked at the 17 hidden reviews for this place, they were 90% five stars and I didn't want to be the 18th.  Anyone, curious about this place, I highly recommend looking at them.  Incredibly informative and helpful in making my decision to eat here.  Will definitely be back to try the Mac and Cheese and Short Rib that everyone says is great.
