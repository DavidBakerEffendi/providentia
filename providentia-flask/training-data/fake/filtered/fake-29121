The food was ok and I am Indian this is just an alias. The people at the restaurant expected us to eat with our hands they did not give you the proper utensils needed for certain dishes.Also all the plates were chipped.This is Indian food mixed in with fast food it will work if it is a late night but not if you want proper Indian food.
