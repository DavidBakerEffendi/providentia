I was going to be in Philadelphia with 24 other people for a long weekend, and was responsible for making the dinner arrangements for our first night there. (Italian had been agreed upon for the first night.) After narrowing the field to three restaurants (all highly rated on Yelp and elsewhere) and speaking with them, I decided on La Fourno. (Of the three restaurants, La Fourno was the only one that was both reasonably priced and willing to accommodate a group of our size.) Everyone in our group was impressed with the atmosphere, the wait staff, and the food (served "family style"). We started with the House Salad and the Caesar Salad. For dinner we had the Spaghetti & Meatballs Marinara, the Penne with Broccoli, and the Pollo Salsiccia (boneless chunks of chicken saut√©ed with sweet Italian sausage, mushrooms, and sundried tomatoes in a balsamic reduction). For dessert we had the Homemade Cannoli, the Cheesecake, and the Tiramisu. Should our group travel to Philadelphia again next year, I expect a return trip to La Fourno will be on the itinerary.
