I absolutely love this cafe.  It's so homey and the food is delicious.  I always meet my friends at this spot, we feel at home here.  BTW not only is the coffee great but so is the staff.  It's the perfect neighborhood cafe!  I don't know what I would do if Lava wasn't there! I love you guys! You Rock!
