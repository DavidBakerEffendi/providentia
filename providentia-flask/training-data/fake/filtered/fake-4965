I've been twice.  The first time I thought the brunch was great.  The second time I came for dinner and got the Moqueca.  If you ever have this in Brazil, it is a mesmerizing amazing dish.  There was a small place in the West Village that used to make a good one.  It was so disappointing here.  First of all it was a tiny cup of soup with 5 miniature shrimp in it. It was mostly onions and didn't have the complexity of a moqueca. It was not much of a dinner at all.  It's really sad to call this Moqueca if you have ever had the real thing.  The sandwiches are good and a good value.  I'd stick with those. Based on my previous experience I would have given this place five stars but the moqueca was very disappointing.
