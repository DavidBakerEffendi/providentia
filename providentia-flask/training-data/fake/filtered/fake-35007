Went for Sunday brunch.  Decor and vibe are great.  Food is generally great too - real focus on the locavore / farm-to-table vibe (as expected!).  Means that the portion sizes are smaller with real focus on the ingredients at all points. The sweet corn soup, the duck, duck, chicken and the house-made sticky bun were all really good.  The pork roll and french toast less so - both were good and no doubt executed with love, but felt a little overpriced and underwhelming on the plate.  So a side of pork roll, for example, is basically 2 pieces of bacon for $8, without being something hugely memorable.  Felt like there might be some expensive local ingredients being presented in ways that weren't quite making the impact the prices make you hope for. Oh and (espresso) coffees were way over-priced (or at least under-executed!) - $5 for a weak & watery cappuccino is hard to forgive, particularly in a place so focused on quality of the basics.  Some practice with the espresso machine probably required. But overall was a great brunch spot - airy and light, fresh high quality food, good service.  Easily 4 stars and would definitely go back, tho would be interested to see if they manage to tweak the menu in terms of price vs quality vs (perceived) value at some point...
