The server was the best part---so apologetic and helpful........talk about rude, the bartender (later find out the owners daughter) walks up to our table and points in my friends face (we earlier advised the waiter our steaks tasted burnt and we would like a different item from the menu) and stated "We already took the steaks off your check, your table has been a loss since you walked in and we are doing nothing else for you." Also my husband has a lap-band, as as you know it requires certain dietery needs and we requested his pasta cooked well (soft).  The waiter advised me he put that on the order, however, the pasta came out aldente---when my husband took his first bite and it became lodged causing him to vomit and ruin our entire dinner----the OWNER says "who eats  pasta well-done......" I forgot that the world has changed and the CONSUMER is no longer RIGHT -----since when we are dictated how we eat food when we pay for it-------Also do they think they are in Manhattan-------$9.00 a shot------and our tabloe was a LOSS-------------I wouldnt give them a dime of my money ever again and neither should you!!!!!!!!!
