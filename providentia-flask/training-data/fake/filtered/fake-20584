V-Nam Cafe is as seriously as good as it gets. I'm a frequent flyer there - I go once a week on my lunch break! They make the best vegetarian dish ever... not exactly sure what it's called but the owner starts making it for me right when I walk in the door! The food and staff are simply wonderful. I highly suggest this place to everyone.
