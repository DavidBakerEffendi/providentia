Amazing! Delicious pizza to eat and tons of interesting knowledge to soak up! Scott's got alot of enthusiasm, is hilarious, wildly entertaining, and I'm pretty sure he knows more about pizza than anybody else on the planet. Not just a tour for pizza appreciation, you'll learn all about the history of pizza, the ingredients, Italian and New York culture, and more! I went on the bus tour and it was great to get out of the city and see the beautiful borough of Brooklyn, as well as see places that are off the beaten path. A true New York experience that's great for locals and tourists!
