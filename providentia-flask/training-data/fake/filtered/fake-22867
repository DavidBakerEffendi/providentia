Food was mediocre and overpriced, much like most food in the University City area.  I love going out to eat at good restaurants, but you can easily make more flavorful chicken at home with the most basic cooking skills. But the real tragedy of this place is the staff and service.  Staff, especially the management, are rude to the point of aggression.  Don't waste your time going out to eat at an institution that doesn't even want your business. Edit:  I don't know how much Wishbone is paying Yelp to hide all of their bad reviews, but my review is certainly legitimate.
