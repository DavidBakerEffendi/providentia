My boyfriend, my sister and I are foodies. We eat at all kinds of  restaurants,  very expensive, budget friendly, etc.) This is why I  am SOOOOO confused  about these reviews. We were here  a few days ago with 2 other people. The reason we came here was because of the reviews. Please BEWARE.  4 of us ordered chicken and waffles and my sister ordered the  Mac and Cheese, Fried Chicken and Rice. Ok, were do I start  about the CHICKEN. We got 3 chicken wings a piece. They still had some HAIR on them  DISGUSTING!!!! They tasted like they were sitting in oil for days. My sisters Mac and Cheese was completely salty. Her chicken was also dry and greasy. They had owed my boyfriend 1 piece of chicken wing and he never got it. My sister asked for water she never got it. When the waitress finally came back to our table 30 min. after she served us our food, we mentioned about the wing and water and she blamed the water boy. REALLY. We also ordered the strawberry lemonade. Because in the reviews they mentioned it was really good. It is really good,  if you like water with a hint of strawberry and a pound of sugar. What was the most upsetting was that the 15-20% tip was already added to bill. The waitress deserved 1% if that. Well this was the biggest disappointment. Needless to say we would not be coming here again.
