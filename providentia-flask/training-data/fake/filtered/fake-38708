This excellent little gem of a restaurant has a wide selection of locally sourced and beautifully prepared food.  I stopped by with family on a weeknight; every table was full but we received attentive and personal service.  The owner was manning the door and stopped by our table more than once to make sure everything was perfect, and it was. Standouts were scallops wrapped in bacon, an artichoke gratin side, the kale salad.  For mains I had a sockeye salmon grilled on aromatic wood.  It was ever so slightly crisp on the outside and tender, just done, within, and not over seasoned, letting the fresh salmon do the talking.  Others at my table had the leg of lamb, quite tasty, a beautiful steak, and an enormous slab of meatloaf that was entirely consumed.  The focus of the menu is ideally prepared American dishes that highlight the pure flavors of the ingredients. For the price is was a good value, considering that it's within walking distance of Times Square.  It's unusual to have such a friendly and relaxing dinning experience in that busy neighborhood.  I highly recommend this place for dinner with friends from out of town or a special night out.
