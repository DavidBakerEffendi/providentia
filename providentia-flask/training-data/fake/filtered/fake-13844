Delicious for 75% of your party, or whatever percentage actually gets their food on time.  Food is outstanding, but when your server forgets to enter one of the orders, they send the misogynistic owner to deal with you.  He is unapologetic for any missteps in service that most places would smooth over with a free dessert or even the appearance of an apology.  4+ for the food, 0 stars for customer service, averaging 2 stars (had to round down in this case).  To the owner (or, I am guessing, Rodgee C, from the other reviews), you are an embarrassment to the hospitality industry and a discredit to your considerate staff who must be in hell, having to deal with you on a daily basis.
