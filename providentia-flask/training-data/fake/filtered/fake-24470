Should we talk about the delicious soup dumplings or about the fact that the Health Department closed the kitchen last Friday night at 7:00 when they showed up unannounced and saw whatever they saw back there. We were seated promptly, ordered our food and then waited and waited. Normally the food comes out immediately but last Friday our waiter kept coming over to apologize. When he said that it would be twenty more minutes before our food would arrive, I noticed many people getting up and leaving. At that point, having eaten there many times before, I sensed something was terribly awry. I asked a woman who works there if something was wrong in the kitchen. She did not hesitate to express her annoyance that the Health Department had shown up at such a busy time unannounced. I guess the fact that they saw something serious enough to warrant closing the kitchen immediately didn't phase her. Well it phased me and my husband and I can't say we'll be rushing back any time soon!
