I Used To Visit Sam's At Least Once A Week. The Food Is Ok At Best, But It was Convenient So I Kept Going Back. True What Reviews Say, The Price Changes Every Time You Order The Same Food Depending Who Rings You Up But I Still Kept Coming Back. Today I Went In There To Place An Order For Christmas Bagels, I Went To The End Of The Counter Where The Owner Was Packing Out Little Packages Of Gum. I Stood There While He Wouldn't Even Look At Me. An Employee Came Over To Me And Asked Me What I Needed, I Told Him That I Wanted To Order Candy Cane Bagels That I Have Buying For Years From Sams. The Employee Looked Confused And Asked The Owner. He Turned And Mumbled Something To Me About Next Week. I Explained To Him That Christmas Was Next Week And I Needed To Know If They Would Have Them. He Then Pretty Much Yelled At Me That He Told Me He Wouldn't Know Till Next Week, Yelling About How Expensive They Are To Make And If He Didn't Get Enough Orders He Wouldn't Do It!!! Well If You Don't Put Signs Up How Do You Expect To Get Orders????? He Was So Nasty And So Rude I Will Place My Christmas Bagel Order Elsewhere And Will NEVER Go Back There!!!
