I had a group on coupon and tried this place for the first time, had the chili, the bronco burger, and fries.  Everything was great!! The waitress was excellent!! Loved her :)  My nephew had a hang over and she took great care of him.  She was so friendly and attentive.   I felt like a regular and I had never been there before!
