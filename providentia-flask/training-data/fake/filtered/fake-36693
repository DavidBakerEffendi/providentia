My buddy lives right on 3rd street off Girard, so PYT is where we go whenever I'm there. The service isn't spectacular, but the food says it all. I don't have any complaints about the service, but it's a burger, so if I didn't have to wait as long as I had, then I would have 5 stars, but 4 stars should suffice.
