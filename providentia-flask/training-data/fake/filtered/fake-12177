I have been to Mamoun's a few times fairly recently. I have yet to have a bad meal at Mamoun's. Granted it could be considered a "dive" but I believe it adds to the feel of Mamoun's. The Falafel's are absolutely amazing and at such an inexpensive price, why not? In addition to a wide array of Middle Eastern food there is also Turkish Coffee and some traditional desserts such as Baklava. The Baklava is fresh and is also quite reasonably priced. The only thing that is a bit expensive at Mamoun's is to use the hookah. I had hookah with my friend there and it was $15 which is pretty steep considering a new hookah can go for somewhere in the $20 range. Sometimes it does get quite busy and can be a bit of a wait but overall it is a great experience and is authentic New Haven.
