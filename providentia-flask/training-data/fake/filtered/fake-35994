Great basic comfort food spot with a very cozy dining room and lovely garden. The kitchen was backed up on a recent sat nite but the hostess and servers, even busboys, were lovely and comped us desert for the trouble. We had crispy green beans, burgers, filet sandwich and trout, all of which were excellent. Â Great spot for a date or with family.
