I live in the neighborhood and I eat at this place 2 to 3 times a week. AMAZING! My absolute favorite sandwich is the Chicken and for warm dishes I like the Gnocchi. The cafe is cozy (there is minimal seating) and the atmosphere is cool (good playlist). There are benches outside you can hang out on and sip your coffee. Bottom line: food is excellent and prices are super reasonable!
