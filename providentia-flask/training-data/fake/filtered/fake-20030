Great atmosphere in a trendy setting, right in the heart of historic Philly (near Society Hill).  Whether it is appetizers or entrees, you'll absolutely love it.  Every time I travel to this area on business, I always try to dine here.  My colleagues always thank me for suggesting such a great and unique place.  It is truly awesome.  Check out the massive Buddha while you're there.
