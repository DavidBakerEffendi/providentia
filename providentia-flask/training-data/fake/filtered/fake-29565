we've been going to pies'n'thighs since it was over on Kent ave in the back of 'the' bar. fell in love with it. since they've moved, its been going steadily downhill. undercooked food. bloody dark meat chicken (yes, i know dark meat is dark, but there are limits). rude staff. messed up orders. and portions that shrink every time we order it. wanted to believe in this place. hell, weren't the ladies that run it on a game show trying to raise funds to reopen after the health department shutdown (totally unwarranted, i know -- outdoor kitchen) seems the buzz got to their head. i'll be looking elsewhere for chicken and collards.
