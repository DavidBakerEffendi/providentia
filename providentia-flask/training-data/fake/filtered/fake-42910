Visiting New York for several days, and this was by far the worst restaurant I ate at. The food was okay, but the service was horrendous. The waiter was rude and didn't seem to care for people's food allergies. First, he put a fork that was dropped on to the floor back on to a table for the next unknowing customer to use. After claiming that the meal is nut-free multiple times, my friend develops anaphylaxis after having the appetizer. The manager or the waiter said there were no nuts in the food, but found out almonds were in the appetizer after asking the chef. The manager hovers over us for the rest of the meal. Please save yourself and don't go to this restaurant.
