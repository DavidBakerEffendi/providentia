This place is literally the best Halal style food you'll be able to find in the whole city. Not even generalizing it. I've tried many different places and this one still beats them out on the quantity and quality of food you get. Freddy is always a blast to talk to and keeps the atmosphere alive as he and his coworkers are making your food. Try his own creation "Freddy's Jr.". Completely worth the $7 you're paying for it. I'm a fan of spicy food so nothing from this food turns me away. Don't let other reviews discourage you! If you notice, 95% are 4+ stars, so if a couple of people rate it a bit less, that's all on them and how picky they are. King of Falafel and Shawarma definitely deserved their Vendy, and its about time they got it.
