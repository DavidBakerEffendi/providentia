What an oppressive atmosphere for an "authentic" Italian restaurant! Besides the forced formality, there was also a touch of the surreal.  People supposedly enjoying a meal were so hush-hush that I thought that maybe I was losing my hearing. I overheard a man ask to start with the arugula placed in "the center" of the table. Another man barely looked at the waitress while she fetched his half eaten meat. Was I not conservative enough to eat here? White starchy table cloths where I am afraid to drop my fork. But who is it that is really looking? I think this place confuses being formal with being high quality. The two don't go hand-in-hand. The staff, customers, and food were equal to the table cloth: scant, sterile, and bland. What happened with the decor? Pottery barn furniture scattered inside of a small square with a cafeteria-like ceiling in the middle. The bar looked like a built-in for a cheap stage set.  For the price, I expected "Amore," but what I got was Kenny G. For real Italian, try any place on Federal Hill in Providence, RI.
