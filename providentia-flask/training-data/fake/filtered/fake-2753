Visited the restaurant for the first time the evening of  12/17/14. Had problems finding parking near restaurant but found a for-pay parking deck a few blocks away. Wait was about 20-30 minutes. Food was above average. Ambiance very festive (do not bring a date here if you want quiet). I was overcharged $64.00 for a $32.00 meal  after waiter presented bill. Not sure what the mix-up was about since I followed waiter's instructions for correct payment via debit card. Spoke with Flor on the phone and she promised that Cuban Pete management  (Reesa) will call back after promising they would straighten out. I would suggest bringing cash to make sure you are not overcharged. Hopefully, I can get credited as soon as possible.
