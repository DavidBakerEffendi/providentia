Trumbull Kitchen is my all time favorite restaurant, but I unfortunately live in Detroit. My boyfriend lived across the street and when I would visit we would go to Trumbull 4 out of the 5 nights. The curried noodle appetizer and calamari the best I've ever had, and the Hanger Steak was always perfect. I miss Trumbull and its mojito's so much!
