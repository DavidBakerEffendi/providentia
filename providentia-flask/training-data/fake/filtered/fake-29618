Food here is amazing, service is great..most of the time. Last thursday i had some friends in from California and we wanted to order delivery. I called and this girl answers and she pretty much yells at me when i asked her if they delivered to my house and said no. So we decided to walk over. We get seated and im catching up with friends and this waitress, her name is Isabella, just starts rushing us . I told her i liked her Waynes World shirt and she just looked at me. She asked me if i was done with my food when i had half of a chicken biscuit left.It seemed like she was rushing us which was funny because there wasnt a line anymore. So we didnt feel comfortable and we just finished our drinks and left. OH and then to make matters worse, while we're paying she says "You dont want change right?" seriously...SERIOUSLY...ive never had anyone be so rude to us at Pies N Thighs. It kinda sucks that a person like that is on the staff but maybe she was having a bad day.
