I tried to schedule a three day juice fast with Asana House.  Jess was rude over the phone. I was expected to pick-up three days worth of juice on one day.  Who would ever use 2 and three day old juice for a cleanse? Totally defeats the purpose as you do not get full nutrients from juice that is not fresh.
