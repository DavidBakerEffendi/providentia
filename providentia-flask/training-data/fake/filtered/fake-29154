The staff at House of Chao is HORRIBLE.  While the food is great, I no longer frequent the establishment because of the horrible service and the rude woman who works there.  She has gotten my order wrong on more than one occasion and always acts as if it was my fault.  I'm really surprised the owners have not addressed the issues with customer service already, as it severely detracts from the culinary experience.  I second the person who posted: FIRE THE STAFF.  Yesterday.
