Last Monday, shortly after sitting down, we ordered one salad and one sandwich. Some 45 minutes later I asked the waitress about our order. She said it must be on its way. 5 Minutes later I put $3 on the table (which should cover the iced-tea my wife had, although I now regret even that) and we left. Had a couple of excellent salads and roasted mushrooms with turkey at 55 Fulton Market instead.
