Great new addition to the South Slope -- it's rare that a restaurant offers risotto on their menu, this place has over half a dozen risottos to choose from! The seafood risotto is perfect. The grilled calamari were sublime the first time and unfortunately rubbery the next...Pastas are fantastic too, done in true italian fashion. The place is cute and small, possibly a bit too noisy for an intimate dinner when it gets busy weekend nights. Definitely check this one out.
