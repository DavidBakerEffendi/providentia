We arrived at the restaurant on a Saturday around 12:30 for brunch. We were a bit concerned that we would have to wait since yelp had rated it highly, especially for their brunch which occurs on Saturdays and Sundays from 10-4pm (this info can be found on their creative website). Despite our concerns, we were seated immediately with seating on the second floor, which was loft-style, overlooking the entire restaurant. The bottom floor had a mixture of large diner booths in navy and orange (some snaking through the middle of the restaurant for huge parties) and tables ranging in sizes with perfect view of their multicolored chandelier. But the second floor was the coolest looking, we'd say. Upstairs had its own bar and patrons had a choice of sitting in sliding booths or swinging chairs that hung in the ceiling. (The swinging chairs looked really cool, but not a proper chair to eat in, see in our picture at the top.) Overall, this restaurant is attractive, inventive, and cool. Every table we saw had a either an interesting martini or a Bloody Mary (their drinks are equally creative). The only complaint we had were the proportions. However, this is a consequence of the trendy atmosphere that they are trying to keep up (i.e. "upscale diner"). While in the end, we found this restaurant a bit pretentious, it truly does have good food and a good chef, and it is a comfortable place to go, located in a nice area of Philly. We'd be interested in trying their dinner selections at some point, and we recommend visiting this place at least once to see their interesting vibe.
