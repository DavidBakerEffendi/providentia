Take it from someone that lives right down the street - this place is terrible. If you like raw, undercooked meat and receiving steaks/sandwiches other than the ones you actually ordered then this place is for you!!!! I've tried 3 times - just in case the first two experiences were simply due to the poor experience/attitudes of the people behind the counter. Nope - they all do not give a crap!!!!
