Of the six restaurants we dined at in New York City over the period of 4 days, this was the best experience. Hands down - no question about it. Food was as authentic as it gets - especially for an India like me who is very picky about his food. Service was better than expected. They took care of every little thing and more with a smile on the face. This was an amazing experience. We will definitely return here during our next trip to New York.
