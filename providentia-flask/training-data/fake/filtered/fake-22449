With a pretty fluid rotating menu, a friendly staff that remembers your name and your favorite booth you cannot go wrong here for brunch. It's cash only but hey, it's byob, and so damn charming. They are very willing to substitute to make sure that your food comes out vegan or vegetarian, and the fried green tomato sandwich is simply divine.
