Food was outstanding, and service was good.  NO ambiance at all, and terribly overcrowded. I don't enjoy yelling while dining, but the noise level was so high, we had no choice.  When we were seated, the waitress made a gesture to separate the tables,  by a whole inch. WOW.  There were two tops pushed together, so it was really a table for 10.  and that is how the entire restaurant was laid out.  no privacy at all.  They should have taken out about 1/3 of the tables so that everyone would be comfortable.  It is not set up as pictured on the website.  If you don't mind a "kesselgarten" then go.  otherwise, there are many nicer Italian restaurants in Philadelphia.  We won't go back.
