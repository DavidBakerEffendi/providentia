Last weekend during lunch time I went to this place for take out, they said that the management decided to allow the takeouts only after 2:30 PM, as of they are giving food for free, No the takeout also charging the same money... Well, I said very good decision and I said thanks and left from that place. The management  wants to dump all leftovers for takeouts instead of storing on freezer, very very funny and very nice decision, keep it up.. I will not go to this place any more and I will not recommend this place for any one as well.. Some chutney smells like week old.  Regular customers please be aware of old items serving on the buffet. when we eat in this place feeling very very thirsty.... Good Luck and Be Healthy...
