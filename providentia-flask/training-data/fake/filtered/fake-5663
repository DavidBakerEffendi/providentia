I  have been going for years but last 2 times had horrible service.  Prior visit at 3 in the afternoon, 5 workers and still waited 25 minutes for take out. Lots of staff standing around. Both times, a giant mound of steak was sitting on the grill as I entered.  This couldnt have been newly cooked and it was not lunch hour so it  must have been sitting there for a long time.  too much advanced, pre-cooking of the meat.  But smother it with cheese and mushrooms and the steaks are soo good....but best  if you eat in. If  you take out, the fabulous roll gets steamed by the foil wrapper a nd gets  all mushy by the time you get home.
