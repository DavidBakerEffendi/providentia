Thank you for all of those posting a review before I arrived at Han Dynasty, you spoke and I followed..  so worth not being swayed by the many choices along Chestnut Street.  The service was very friendly, we did make a reservation for 4  one day early and found a very suitable table waiting.  The atmosphere trendy & warm, great colors and art.  Now for the Dan Dan Noodles.... yummy, yes hot, but very yummy.  We ordered ours vegetarian style as some did not eat pork. in addition we had the cucumber salad, cold and crisp helped cool the palate between bites.  Finally we shared one entree of shrimp with scallions and garlic sauce, great fluffy rice and giant fresh shrimp cooked to perfection.  All of this fed 4.  Finally when asked what made the noodles so darn tasty... they told me the ingredients !!!   Sorry you have to go there to get that yourself.
