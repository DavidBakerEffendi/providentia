Terribly rude staff. Five minutes after purchasing a beer at the bar, I was told that I had to leave because that section of the restaurant had been reserved. No, I couldn't even move somewhere else. I was told to get up and get out immediately. Who do they think they are, and where do they get off treating customers this way?
