We were there on a Saturday evening. We had a reservation for 7 pm and we were seated at 6:55 in their upstairs room. The service was prompt. The waitress was a warm and attentive person. We ordered lots of cold mezes, all of which were delicious. Especially humus, cacik, and eggplant salad were heavenly. They came with warm Turkish bread which is always a big plus. Then we had tandir kebap which is very difficult to make right (I'm Turkish, I've had many bad experiences with it), but this was just perfect. We also had kofte kebap and grilled chicken and they were also pretty good. I don't think we needed a main course per person since the sizes of the appetizers were huge. But everything was so delicious that we even wanted to try their deserts and I would say we didn't regret. We payed $120 for 5 mezes, 3 main courses, lots of drinks and desert and I think it was reasonable for the location and amount of food. I will definitely go back next time I'm in NYC.
