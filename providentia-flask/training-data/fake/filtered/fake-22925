First ate here on my birthday and loved this place so much we decided to hold our wedding reception in their back patio two weeks ago. Â After planning a year in advance and solid confirmation of our reservation we arrive to the restaurant the day of our wedding dinner, only to be told "you're here for what?". Turns out our party wasn't scheduled in the calendar and they weren't prepared to host us. Despite the negligent mix-up and after crying in my wedding dress surrounded by our 20+ plus guests, the staff did an amazing job and scrambled to make it all happen. We actually love the food here and always make it a point to talk it up, but the management response to their own error was truly disappointing and tainted what was a promised to be an awesome event.
