Tucked away on an unassuming South Williamsburg block is the most magical coffee coffee place I've ever had the pleasure of entering. While many cafes set out to achieve the kind of cozy, inviting vibe that radiates throughout Mountain Province, few succeed because they lack the thread that ties it all together, an owner who cares not only about the quality of the coffee and food he serves, but about his customers. Ray is behind the counter every day, but he doesn't just remember names and "the usual", he knows the details. It's why ever detail of Mountain Province is carefully thought out and executed. It's why it quickly became a neighborhood staple. It's why you see only five stars and read only rave reviews. Try the breakfast muffin and wonder how he makes it that delicious with no butter. Just try not to like everything about this place.
