Pros: 1. The room is gorgeous. The atmosphere is classy and comfortable. 2. The flavors are fresh. We loved everything we ordered. The asparagus salad was simple and excellent. The arctic char was succulent and sweet. 3. The chef and everyone else in the dining room is friendly. Everyone makes you feel welcome. 4. No TV. 5. Simple, well thought out menu. Cons: 1. The portions are miniscule. My 6 year old son ordered the buccatini with clams. The clams were fresh; the pasta was chewy, but the serving was so small that after my son finished it, he asked for 2 more servings. We thought the waiter had ordered a half order, but when we saw the bill, realized that it was a full order. The entire portion was about the size of my son's fist. 2. The service can be sharpened. My wife ordered a glass a wine and it took about 15 minutes for it to be served, despite it being a relatively slow night. We saw bread being served but not to us--we had to ask for it. We were served the amuse bouche twice. 3. I agree with the other reviewer that looking out at the wash basins is a bit of a turnoff. Ask for one of the tables away from the bathrooms.
