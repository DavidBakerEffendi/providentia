I've been up and down from NY to VT six times this summer, and each visit I make it a point to stop in and have a pie... or three. Upon first entering the space, you might scratch your head at how diverse the clientele is; from young families, to couples, to lager parties celebrating, to seniors, to local celebrities, to those just enjoying a drink at the bar. The reason the Verita is able to cater to all these different types of people is two fold: The food and drink are the freshest around, and the atmosphere is incredible. The place is simultaneously alive with energy, laughter, and loud stories- while still having sections for those parties who aren't looking for quite as much excitement. The restaurant also does a great job of being aptly suited for couples of any age. Let's talk food. First and foremost- this is not Domino's. If you walk in expecting a New York or Chicago style pizza, you're in for a surprise. Three or four pizza's can comfortably feed a hungry family of four, with some possible left-overs. It's a thin, Neapolitan style crust with shockingly fresh locally grown ingredients. I highly recommend the beet salad to start. With healthy portions of avocado, beets, and greens, this undoubtedly changed my prejudice against beets for the better. As far as the pizza is concerned, if you can't make up your mind just close your eyes and point, you can't miss. And if you have a bit of a sweet-tooth definitely go for the Nutella dessert pizza or one of the Bindi's. Personally I can never finish the dessert pizza by myself, so if you're looking for something I'd say go for the Coconut Bindi. I don't even like coconut. It was awesome. Now I know this place may not be for everyone, and that's totally fine. But if you're in Burlington or just looking for somewhere new to try I really think this place is worth a shot. Enjoy!
