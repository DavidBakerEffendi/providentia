On a sunny day one of the best dining experiences in the City is sitting outside Oscar's Place on Hudson Street. The change over from Petit Abeille has been successful,with much thought put into items to keep on the menu and new additions. The lunch special with sandwich with soup, salad or french fries is a great deal. Its good food in a great neighborhood served with heart and that is what keeps all the locals coming back!
