Dickie Dee's is the best at ITALIAN hot dogs and PIZZA.  I grew up in Newark and every afternoon after school my friends and I would go to get a single with an extra dog, potatoes and all the juicy peppers, onions and ketchup.   Now, I go with my 17 year old, little sister, mom, and husband and we feel like we are in heaven, this place has it all the ave. the crew behind the counter that's been there forever and the great food.   Anytime you are in Newark go to Dickie Dee's and you'll see its just awesome......
