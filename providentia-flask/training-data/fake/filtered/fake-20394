Terrible food. We ordered off the authentic menu and each of the four dishes were not good. We began with an appetizer, whiche were so e cold slightly cooked tasteless vegetables on a playe with a bowl of thick sauce in middle. You could not e en dip it in the sauce so we ate a bite of the green bean and then a fork of the sauce. Then came the thai brocolli and a seafood dish with noodles, which was ver sloppy . One bite of the brocolli had me in tears it was so spicy. The seafood also was covered in hot red pepper toghe point where u could not taste anything. Whem the waitress came over while i was chiking she asked if everything was okay. I told her that The food was i edible and she said she could not take it back that should've Â known better. She ended up bringing me a dish of chicken and more taseless veggies that was not as good as the local chinese restaurant. 4 dishes, all bad.
