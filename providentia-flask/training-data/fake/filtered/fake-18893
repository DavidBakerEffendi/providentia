Pizza was aight, at best.  Greasy (they pour olive oil on the pie before  tossing it in the oven) and too thick for my liking.  My real problem, though, was that it took me 5 attempts before I found the place open.  Each time I went (all during normal peak business hours), the guys were in there, hanging out, drinking beer, but said they were going to open "later."  "When?" I asked.  "Few hours maybe."  Each time I walked away disgruntled. That arrogance really turned me off.  When I finally happened by when they were open, I waited on line for 45+ minutes and ordered an artichoke slice.  "We don't have that one today.  Just plain." It's obvious that they're riding on the hype and being super lazy with the business, and I hope that it bites them in the ass when the hype dies down, which it inevitably will. Blah...
