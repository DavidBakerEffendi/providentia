My husband and I, along with another couple, tried this restaurant for the first time a couple of months ago. Of course I am always late with writing a review!! It was fantastic. The ambience was nice and the decor was very cool. They have great selections of wine and the fish was delish! If you are in the neighborhood I highly recommend trying this place out. We will go again on our next weekend trip.
