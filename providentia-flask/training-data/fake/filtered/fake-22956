amazing drinks during hh! the reviews say it all. This place is awesome to have a cheap well done drink during their hh. However, the space is so tiny that it is so hard to come here with a group of friends. I am still giving it 4 stars bc of the delicious lychee martinis and how strong they serve them. It is a cool spot for after work drinks, but remember to get here early to either get a spot by the bar or by the couches!
