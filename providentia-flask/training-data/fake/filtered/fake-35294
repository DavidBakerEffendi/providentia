Great food! ~ The largest, juiciest buffalo wings I have ever bitten into! The tastiest bruchetta and pizza! Great Service ~ Unfortunately not enough staff to cover the busy times....but...Jud is great. Deserves a raise. One of the best personalities I have ever come across in a waiter/server. He cares for all his customers and treats them as if they are family. Great Atmosphere ~ The bar has a family feel to it...like Cheers!
