we had a party of five with two children, so right off the bat, we were not welcomed in there. we had a reservation for 9:15 pm, and we got the table at 9:35. we ordered 5 entree's anatra all' arancia, (roasted duck) which had neck bones and duck feet and was very dry. the 2nd entree was braciole di manzo (steak rolls filled w/ cheese) which, in my opinion, was not fresh at all. it was very hard and tough and salty. the 3rd entree was the pasta al forno, and the noodles itself were partially dry. the only good plate was the tripe.
