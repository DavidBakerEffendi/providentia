Made the trip from Long Island to meet friends from Staten Island who heard that this place was good. Ambiance-zero stars, crammed into a tiny table with very plain decor.  They didn't carry my favorite wine, merlot, which is not an unusual wine to say the least.  I ordered the duck.  The presentation on the plate was very unappetizing. The duck was very dry, filled with bones which was embarassing to have to pick out of my teeth in front of my companions.  The waitress never asked us during the meal if everything was okay, which it definitely wasn't.  My friends ordered dessert which they seemed happy with, but after my abysmal experience with the entree I was afraid to order dessert.  Prices were higher than average and I eat out regularly.  Rock music was loud, jarring, not really in keeping with the theme of dining at Grandma's unless your grandma likes blasting music unsuitable for hearing your companions' conversation.  My husband thinks they turned the music up at the end to get us to leave so that we would leave because the next sitting was supposed to start.  When we got back to Long Island we threw together some food at home because we were very hungry.  I have never written a restaurant review before but this place made me so annoyed I had to write this.
