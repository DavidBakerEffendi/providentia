What a waste of time and money. The atmosphere is ok nothing to write New Orleans about. The food was very disappointing. The PO boy tasted like eating fried anything on bread. Very Bland. Â The beer can chicken lacked the taste of beer but did surprisingly taste like a can. There is a taco truck a couple of blocks down save your money and go there or fasting is always an option.
