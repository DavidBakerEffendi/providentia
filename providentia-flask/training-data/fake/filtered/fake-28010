I was there for dinner last night 4/3/2012. Took family in from NYC to show them what Â Philly and Jose Garces had to offer. 1) Garlic shrimp - Received terrific reviews. Picture on the website looks amazing. It's to bad that's NOT the dish set on out table. We received 6,7shelled pieces of tasteless shrimp swimming in oil and garlic sauce. I was reminded of the Olive Garden. 2) Spanish Octopus - also looked nothing like the website. Over cooked and rubbery 3) Spicy Potatoes - burned (not overcooked) and NO spice. These had no spice at all - NONE. We ordered 11 or so dishes and 3 desserts. My favorite of the night the free tuna with capers and the flatbread with shortribs which at least had some flavor. This was my first Jose Garces experience and probably my last. The Garlic Shrimp was deceitful. The picture on-line is a complete lie.
