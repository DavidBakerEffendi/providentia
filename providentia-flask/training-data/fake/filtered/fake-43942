FOND is the best restaurant I have been to in Philadelphia.  Each and every course was outstanding, even the amuse bouche (divine cream of mushroom soup).   Pork rillettes app is my "go to" and the short-rib stroganoff was inspired.  Our waiter, "G", was funny, personable and always on point.  G will take care of you!
