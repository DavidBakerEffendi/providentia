I came here with a date because she's from brooklyn and I'm from manhattan so I kept it comfty for her. I actually picked this place because of yelp. Good choice. The vibe was cool, grown and sexy, the tables were spread out enough where you're not having a conversation with the other tables. Simple but classy decor. The service was the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. My waiter wasn't rude but he definitely wasn't personable. I told my friends about the service and they said that you don't go to thai restaurants for good service. I beg to differ. I'm always expecting good service. That's why I tip well. For good service. I'm an appreciative person, what can I say. The food was awesome. Quality and Quantity. We had simple plates but the patsee ooie, I'm sure I said that wrong was delicious. Overall, I'd definitely recommend this place. If I'm ever around Park Slope, I'll definitely be back.
