Luke 's Lobsters is am affordable hidden gem for the lobster,shrimp, and crab lover. Serving a heaping 4 ounces of meat on hot dog rolls with a tasty seasoning may sound unimaginable, Â but the food there is absolutely delicious. They allow you a choice of a combo which allows you a drink of your choice and a bag of chips (kettle in various flavors.) Their sodas are organic and incredibly delicious. I liked the Blueberry Root Soda. They call your order by your ticket number and their is little to No wait for it. The only negative about the place is that for it to be such a great place to eat, the seating area is very small. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants an affordable, quick, delicious seafood helping while downtown in Philadelphia.
