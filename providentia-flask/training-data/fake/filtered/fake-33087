I had my daughter's wedding shower in the private room upstairs at the Hinge - it was WONDERFUL.  Our waitress Kat was outstanding, the food was delicious and atmosphere delightful - fire burning on a cold February day - the Hinge made my daughter's special day just PERFECT!!! In the past, I've gone to the Hinge for breakfast, lunch and dinner - food is aways good and the staff is very friendly :o)  Great place.
