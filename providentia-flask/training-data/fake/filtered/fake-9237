Not New Haven Pizza??  Thank the gods!! As a displaced Brooklynite, I've been gagging over what people go apeshit around here in New Haven, and aching for decent pizza.  Well, this isn't exactly New York style, but it is definitely DELICIOUS!  Gourmet (not greasy), tasty (not tired), perfectly baked (not dried flatbread barely covered in sauce and cheese).   It's a little more expensive than the other neighborhood pies, but well worth it.  Not just for pizza aficionados, but for foodies alike.  Eat and enjoy!  I hope they last forever!
