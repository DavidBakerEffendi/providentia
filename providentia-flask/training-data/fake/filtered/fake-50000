Went to Hearth for dinner, and it was fantastic. The atmosphere is great, and the bartender, waiter and manager were all very accommodating and personable, even as they had a minor emergency in the kitchen (no fault of anyone on staff). I had the octopus to start and the lamb entree. Both were cooked perfectly. My date had the chanterelle trifolati and the roasted cod. We finished with the apple cider donuts and the goat cheese cheesecake. Everything was outstanding, and I know we will be back soon.
