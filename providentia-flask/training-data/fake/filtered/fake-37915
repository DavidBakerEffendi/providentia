This is the same Mr. Sushi that used to be in the ShopRite plaza in Lincoln Park N.J. They moved almost next door to Takei Sushi about 2 years ago.  The all you can eat deal is their biggest draw.  The sushi is average or below.  The service is SLOW, even if you order from the regular menu.   Prepare to wait up to 30 min to have your order taken, and if you order from the AYCE deal, you won't see your first portion for about 60 min.  BYOB ... it will give you something to do!
