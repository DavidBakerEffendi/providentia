I'm giving this place a hopeful review, because I'm hoping - hoping! - the owners and managers understand the potential they have in this place.  I live a very short drive away and have found joy in Amalfi's by going there to watch on those many increasing and wonderful TV screens they have the NBA games and World Cup matches (the American match there was exhilarating) and other such sports-related events that are best watched with others.  However, while Amalfi's has Happy Hour drinks and food, they don't really offer any interesting daily or even weekly specials with their wine/beer offerings and don't seem to want to experiment with specials in appetizers and entrees.  Why not?  And why not focus on marketing the bar as a place where sports-loving folks congregate and enjoy interesting food?  If we want routine stuff, we'll head to Wildflowers.  If we want a cut above, why can't we find it in Amalfi's?  Must we drive to Princeton or Route 1 or Forrestal Village for this?  C'mon, guys, start focusing in on your potential audience.  We're hoping you see us out here!
