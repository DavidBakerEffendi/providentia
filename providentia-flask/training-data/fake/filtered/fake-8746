I had eaten here before and the food was solid but nothing extraordinary. I called one night to place an order for pick up. when I arrived at the restaurant the girl at the register told me that they didn't have an order from me. I told them I had literally called 10 mins earlier and talked to a woman, and she told me she was the only women there so I told her I must have talked to her. after arguing with me for about ten minutes about whether i called in an order or not I decided a simple apology and admission that they had forgotten to put my order on would suffice and I could move on. But no she refused to apologize or admit her mistake and outright called me a Liar. I couldn't believe how rude she was. i mean would i really not call in an order and then go there and try to pick up. I will never go back there. they need to learn what costumer service is.
