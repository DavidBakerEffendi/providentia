This place was probably the best place we ate at in New York. Upper East side and on the outskirts of Chinatown this place was a little gem. Kinda tough to find (it is not on the main street "Chrystie" but actually in the alleyway! I felt sketch walking down the alley but once the doors of the restuarant opened up, it felt like home! Such a great chabby sofisticated chic environment. They took reservations which they held for us and walked us straight to the table. It feels like being in a house with dimly lit yet cool looking lighting. The apps were great (spinach and artichoke dip). I had the lamb sloppy joe which were just ok but I was eating off my other girlfriends plate and their food: 5 cheese macaroni and grilled fish plate were da bomb! Also had the chocolate souflee which I swear is better than Roys! I was really soaking up the atmosphere more than the food (it reminded me of a little farmhouse in Provence when I lived in France). I would give it 4.5 stars if Yelp did 1/2 stars but the ok sloppy joes and tough to find the front door dropped it a notch but I will definitley come back! They also have a wrap around zinc looking bar whcih I would love to have drinks at but since we have lunch at 3pm (we were till on Hawaii time) it's just an excuse to come back. Mahalo Freemans!
