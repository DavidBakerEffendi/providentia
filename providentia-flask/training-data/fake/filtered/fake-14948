I come here often. The food is great at lunch time. I especially like the 1/2 soup or salad 1/2 sandwich deal. I come here to meet with friends often on Thursday nights for a great glass of wine or cocktail. Rachel is our favorite server, but the whole staff is great. Everyone is very friendly and seems to really enjoy working here. It's a great atmosphere and a great way to relax and have fun with some friends.
