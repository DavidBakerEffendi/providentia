Great food and margaritas. The menu is a bit difficult to navigate, but we loved everything we ordered. The el sabor menu was a great deal. Homemade Guacamole for the table, a choice of appetizer and an entree for $29. Based off the entree prices it really is a fabulous bargain. The atmosphere is quiet and not as "fun" and lively as promised. It was a good quiet spot to go with friends.
