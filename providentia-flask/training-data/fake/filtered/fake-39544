I live close by, so I thought I would order some Pad Kra Prow to go for my boyfriend and I. I've ordered from Pat Thai before. It isn't my favorite Thai place, but it is close. When I showed up to pick it up I was shocked at how small the bag was that they gave me, especially since the order was $24. When I opened it up at home my boyfriend thought that they made a mistake and only gave us one order at first. The containers were sooooo small. It has been a while since we got takeout, and their portions have shrunk, but the prices remain high. It barely had any vegetables, and the flavor was mediocre. From now on I'm going to make the hike to Rockaway to go to Thai Nam Phet. I live in Parsippany, but Pat Thai is not worth it.
