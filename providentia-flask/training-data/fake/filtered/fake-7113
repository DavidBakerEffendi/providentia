A friend and I stopped here on her search for a nearby establishment that has good Indian food. Jyoti's humdrum appearance didn't impress me at first, and neither did the rather droll waitstaff, who only returned my smiles with looks of confusion, but the food made up for most of it. The rices were perfect, and so was the chicken tikkala, and the naan was amazing. I'm not altogether too familiar with Indian food, but I know delicious when I taste it, and this was damn good. Oh. Buffet's open til 3, but if you arrive there after 2, don't expect them to replenish the buffet, even if there's very little left. That last bit was so disappointing - by 2:15, R and I were ready for a second plate, but they were done making more food for lunch by then, and there was hardly any food left, and the food that was left was cold. Might be the place's downfall. My advice is to get there around 1.
