Just the best you can have anywher in the US. Due to my job, I travel a lot and I always love the spices, that's' why I have to eat mideastern food at least twice a week. When I am in Brooklyn, I basically come to this place almost every day. The food is as fresh as it can be. You are looking at it being made in front of you. The staff is very friendly. My son is 3 years now and he basically loves the hummus and the lentil soup. While pregnant, my wife consistly ordered delivery from there. Unfortunatly I moved from Brooklyn and we can only get this great food when we travel there over the weekend. I hope this spot will be here for a long time as it is already here over 20 years now.
