Went into Joe's for the first time yesterday, spontaneously looking for a quick sandwich.  Some of the workers were busy so Joe, the owner, made the sandwich himself and we watched him slice the tomatoes by hand and assemble the most delicious sub I we ever had.  He uses the highest quality provolone and meats and wraps it up with a loving touch. I highly recommend Joe's Deli for the quality, mindset, and energy of the establishment. Looks like a hole in the wall and we all know these are the best places. They also have a formal sit-down restaurant area by reservation only on weekends (BYO). We plan to go back!!
