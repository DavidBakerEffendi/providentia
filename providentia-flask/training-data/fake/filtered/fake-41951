I was very impressed with this restaurant! Sometimes finding authentic and delicious Mexican food can be a challenge. At Xochitl everything is fresh and exciting, from the food to the atmosphere. The staff was very friendly, and the layout and design of the restaurant stayed true to Mexican style. The menu is loaded with tasty options. Dishes range from the authentic guacamole, to tortilla soup, and the eclectic entr√©e choices. I decided to go with the camarones con caldo, which is a MUST! Seared shrimp, sweet plantain cake, chile broth topped with an avocado salad. Also the drink menu is a must! Nothing pairs better with a meal than a good margarita or martini. And lets not forget the most important part, dessert. The donuts come out with fruit dipping sauces to try from which is the perfect way to end the meal. I definitely will be back soon!
