The food is tasty and there's a great variety.  There is a lack of  veggie friendly dishes but there are some choices. They keep their establishment clean and the service is friendly.  They even have a little shop inside the restaurant with cooking supplies and little trinkets overall the atmosphere is great the food is delish and the price is fair....a little more than other area buffets but worth the price!
