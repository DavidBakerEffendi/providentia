Flawless (even with a flaw) The Best Service I've ever experienced.  The restaurant was extremely busy and although my chicken was not thoroughly cooked, they immediately made every  effort to "fix" our experience and more than made up for the mistake.  They took my husband's dish the same time they returned mine back to the kitchen (a nice touch, to allow us to eat together).   Every dish thereafter was spectacular. We were served numerous Amuse Bouches and left with pleasantly full comfortable stomachs.  This is one of the few places I've eaten that doesn't sacrifice level of service when they are jam packed with customers.     Beware when walking on their hardwood floors as they are waxed and extremely polished that I almost slipped several times en route to the ladies room.
