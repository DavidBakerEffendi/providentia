Great & Clean family owned business. Don't let the name fool you, they have ALOT more then just Bagels! A variety of bagels & breakfast sandwhiches & a wide variety of sandwhiches. Prices are very reasonable, staff is friendly & accomodating.  I ordered the Chicken Grilled Veggie wrap that included fresh (not premade: I watched them make it & spice it according to MY tastes) grilled chicken, onions, peppers and herbed mayo on sun dried tomato wrap.  I had to be a bit difficult & ask to also have sun dried tomatoes added as well, which were added right away with no fuss. Sandwhich came with a pickle (again very fresh) and coleslaw that was equally as delicious.  Everything in their displays (including tuna salad, egg salad, bagels, muffins, bialys, looked fresh & new (nothing looks like it had been sitting). There are alot of places in this local area to choose from when going to grab a quick lunch, but this is definitley the best by far. Says theyre open 7 days a week. Mon-Sat 5Am -5PM & Sun 5 AM -3PM.  I'll be eating here MUCH more often!
