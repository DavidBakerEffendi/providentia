WHAT HAPPENED? Wow... This was a good place to go but... Have things changed. I was there two nights ago w my wife and the place just looked dirty. We didn't eat there. My wife tried to use the Ladies Room but opted to hold it - til we got home to Hillsborough! That's saying something. She said it was absolutely filthy in there. The floors and tables in the dining area were filthy and the exit was blocked with pizza boxes and soda cases. Praying there's never a fire no one would get out alive. Anyway I prefer clean restaurants. Have to agree with some of the other recent reviews who say how it's really gone downhill. Sorry Pizza And. My family won't be returning even if you do clean up your act. We just couldn't eat in there.
