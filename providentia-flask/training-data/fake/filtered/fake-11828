Da Legna, formally Amato's. And that's the only connection it has to the old restaurant. New owner, more pizza varieties, and tasty small plates. I'm not a 1%, so I appreciate $20 spending pretty far at this place. Other than the name of the place was hard to pronounce (not Italian), the pizza has more variety than any other restaurant in New Haven (Gouda cheese, Mashed Potato, Breakfast Pizza on St. Patty's Day, etc.). Heck, there were HEART-SHAPED pizzas on Valentine's Day! Who does that? I'm not a heavy drinker, but saw they had infused Vodka, which was tasty. The bartenders were nice in helping me decide what to have since everything looks great. The BBQ bacon and warm potato salad is delicious. Da Legna offers a unique experience that is different enough to compete with the Ã¶ld school" pizza spots in New Haven. And I'm not sure about the other reviewers, but i've enjoyed my visits to the restaurants, whether it is to order a Clark Street Pizza (try it) to go, or order a house Merlot and a plate of meatballs and watch the pizza guys make pizza in their wood oven. Oh, and NO LONG LINES. I'm sorry, but waiting in line for pizza is so last century..
