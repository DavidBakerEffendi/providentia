We visited NIcolas on a busy Friday night without a reservation a bit after 8 PM.  We were seated within 20 minutes.  We had wonderful bread and bruchetta to start.  After large and tasty Caesar salad, our group of four had entrees that we all enjoyed: tuna steak over broccoli rabe, snapper with roasted vegetables, an enormous macaroni & cheese with lobster and shrimp and veal marsala.  All were well-prepared and generous portions.  Two of us topped off dinner with very creamy gelato and all enjoyed cappuchino.  Service was satisfactory.  Decor was more or less attractive - but the food -- it was superb! It was a wonderful dinner and we'll be back.
