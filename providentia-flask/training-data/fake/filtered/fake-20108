The last time I took my family to Jalisco was about 3 years ago and we had a great experience; the food was very tasty, the servers were welcoming, and on that day they had live music added to the ambiance.  Needless to say we were very disappointed with our visit today. Our waitress was friendly but inexperienced.  I had to change my utensils 4 times because they had either food particles, dishwater film.  She kept grabbing from the table next to ours without inspecting them to ensure cleanliness.  Our table was sticky as were the menus.  There was hardly anyone there which we attributed to it being a weekday but my hunch is that because quality has declined so have the patrons. I ordered my signature dish, Mole, which they had gotten right 3 years earlier.  This mole tasted as if the kitchen had used chocolate sauce from a bottle...way too sweet!  The other dishes looked thrown together without much thought for excellence or care.   What was most disappointing was the fact that the manager failed to come to our table to ask about our experience.  I did not think it fear to unload on our waitress and I did not feel like we needed to ask for the manager to share our experience (thanks Yelp!).  I believe he did not want to hear about our experience because it would not have been positive.   Unfortunately this restaurant will be going out of business soon if they don't change the direction they're on right now.  I don't know if they're under new owners or new staff that has not been properly trained, but considering the amount of money we spent tonight I felt it warranted a Yelp review in the hopes others can think twice about going there. There are better Mexican restaurants in the area (Manchester, Hartford, and West Hartford) for less.  We hope this review will help you to make a more educated decision for your next Mexican meal.
