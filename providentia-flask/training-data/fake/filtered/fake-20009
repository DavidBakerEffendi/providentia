Thanks folks for previous reviews. Right from the way we entered the restaurant we were given a special seat on the community table right beneath BUDDHA. That was way Awesome to sit under one of the greatest man of the century. I ordered for Peach Juice & Veg. Dumplings and it was too good. Followed to it I have ordered Vegeterian Rice which comes along with Coconut curry foam. It took a lil long to arrive at my dining table cuz the restaurant was full of people. The Veg Rice with Coconut foam & Chinese EggPlant with Garlic Sauce was one of the best dishes I would have had (Any Veggie Folks can Â give it a shot).. Simply Speaking it was AAAAAmAAZZZZIng... Jus that the dish arrived a lil late the waiter showed some real courtesy and sent to our all the possible Desserts .. Coconut Mousse, Crying Choclate, Choclate Gateau,DipSum Doughnuts ... This is the best part all of these were reallllly reallllly goood. THe BEST DOUGHNUTS I would have ever had. Thanks to that waiter for showing some courtesy. My Rating would be 4.5/5 Jus Loved the Buddha,Ambience,Courtesy and Finally the Dishes.You GUYS ROCK !!!
