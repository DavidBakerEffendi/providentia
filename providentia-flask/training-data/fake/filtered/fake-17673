Finally, Someone Got It Right! The pizza is fantastic, and we had a really fun time. Salad was amazing, and the brochetta was one of the best I've had. Â I used to work at one of the local chain-restaurants in Williston, and I can tell you that I personally watched my boss write one of the negative reviews on Yelp because he is losing sales. I know that other Williston places are doing the same thing, so don't be fooled! This place is great.
