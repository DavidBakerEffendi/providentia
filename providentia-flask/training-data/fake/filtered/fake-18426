It's fun to go somewhere for happy hour that you can't afford for dinner. The mojitos were delicious and very strong (watch out), and the appetizers were great. $6 dollars each. I guess that's how we ended up spending so much money-  great deals can really get you that way. What I really want to talk about is the chocolate tres leches cake, which I'm pretty sure  was the best thing I've ever tasted. Truly.
