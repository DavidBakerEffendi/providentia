This place is awesome, I have been coming here for about 4 years now and have seen it grow into one of this cities best kept secrets.  The brunch menu has something for everyone, crepes, frittatas, pizzas, lemon ricotta pancakes, french toast etc...  I strongly suggest going with friends and trying everything as the portions are very generous.  This place will not disappoint, oh and the same people that own it also own prohibition taproom which is a new beer bar a half a block away.  The owners tell me they plan to serve brunch at Cafe Lift  everyday of the week in the very near future.  So next time instead of standing in line at Sabrina's or Morning Glory give the Lift a try...  OH ONLY THING CASH ONLY but they have a ATM
