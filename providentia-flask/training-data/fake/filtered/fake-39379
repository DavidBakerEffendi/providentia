Appetizer wraps and sauce were amazing.  Funny- those were the cheapest items on the menu! The specialty pizza was like cardboard, and not just in texture. It had no flavor at all and literally tasted like nothing. We asked for mayo on our turkey wrap, which we did not get.  We also asked for extra crushed red pepper for our pizza, which we also did not get. We will not order from this restaurant again and recommend that you do not waste your money because the food and service is definitely not worth it.
