You could tell the pizza here was sitting out all day in the terrible taste it had. The customer service was terrible as the guy that served me REEKED of marijuana Â and was rude to his co-workers. The delivery drivers all looked stoned as they came in and out of the restaurant as well. Not a family place if you ask me just based on that alone. I will try a dinner meal instead this time but i figured a pizzeria would have good pizza!!! YUCK!!!
