AMAZING! This is by far one of my favorite restaurants in New York City. Their udon noodles and tempura (shrimp and vegetable) are so good. My friend and I went to New York 2 years ago. And returned last month we booked a hotel ahead of time not at all trying to be in the same area as the hotel we stayed at when we were there two years before and it just so happened are hotel was in the same area. We remembered Udon West from all that time ago because it was sooo good and we tracked it down and finally found out what it was called using yelp. The people are so nice and I can not tell you enough how good the food is!
