Was pleasantly surprised. Kind of passed by while walking on Chestnut with a friend and walked in to fix my sushi crave. Ordered four rolls, the washington roll recommended by the waitress, spicy tuna, and two eel. Pretty fresh and tasty, from places I've explored in Philly. Even came with a salad and miso soup. Will be back again, if I'm around the city. Go if you want quality sushi.
