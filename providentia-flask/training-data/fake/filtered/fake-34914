I love the décor here; country home atmosphere with wooden furniture and animals and paintings on the walls.  The cuisine is American and I recommend the chicken and creamed spinach.  ARTICHOKE DIP.  Its crispy and cheesy on top and it is delicious! But other than that, the food was so-so.  The menu is typical farm to table type food and the prices are pretty reasonable.   The drinks are a great here though.  Red snapper!
