The food was not that bad but definitely it did not come close to meeting my expectations. I'm generally someone who really trusts Yelp and this place got decent reviews on here! So on a lazy Friday when I didn't have to go into work I walked from 40th and Walnut down to 14th and South Street to check it out- and it definitely wasn't worth the walk. I got the Kofta meatball wrap with veggies. The sauce was decent but very generic tomato with a little bit of a spice and a lot bit of oil. The meatballs were lame, tasteless and textured like veggie meatballs. They didn't hold together well (possibly because of the lack of egg, but I expected better!). I also got a slice of carrot cake which was actually pretty good although a bit dry and dense. In total it came out to be almost $17 for a wrap and a piece of cake! Way too expensive for a little place that looks dirty and tastes mediocre. I definitely will not be returning.
