Went Saturday 7:30pm, no reservations. They told us 45 mins wait. We signed-up on the waiting list and went for a walk, not sure whether we'd come back. Nice walk to the pier and they called us taht they had a table ready within 15 mins of signing-up. The place is smallish, cute, resembling an old Argentinean almacén. The ambient is loud, warm. We started off with some empanadas (meat and corn and spinach), which were very good. Then we had entraña (skirt steak), asado de tira (short rib) and milanesa de pollo (chicken milanese). Finished with dulce de leche and banana caramelized pancake and chocolate fondant. All was VERY good and prices are affordable (I guess this is a relative term). Still no wines, but they do allow BYOB contrary to what I had read prior to going, or I would have taken some wine. There is a liquor store 1- 2 blocks, on 6th I believe. Bottom line: highly recommended, won't be disappointed, take your wine and enjoy the food!
