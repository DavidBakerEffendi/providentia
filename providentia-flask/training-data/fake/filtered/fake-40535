Went for the Burger. Had their house speciality, the "Bash Style". Really didn't set the world alight. The patty itself was fairly flavourless. I am an anti salt person, but in this case I think a bit more salt would have brought forward the flavours of the meat. The onion-bacon jam did not taste of any bacon. So much so we pulled the burgers apart to make sure it hadn't been forgotten. The horseradish sauce had almost no horseradish flavour. you had to eat it straight to be able to taste the fine hint of horseradish. Even the mayonnaise we ordered to try to get some flavours going was bland and almost rubbery. Â And not in a great Kewpie kind of way. If this burger has won an award, then the one produced for the competition must have been completely different to the ones they were serving the other night. Not worth the effort.
