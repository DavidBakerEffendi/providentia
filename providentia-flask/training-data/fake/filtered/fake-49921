My wife and I had dinner at City Steam Brewery prior to catching a show at Hartford Stage. This place was amazing! Very historic building with many levels. Terrific micro-brews (favored the Naughty Nurse!). Varied menu and actually reasonable prices for downtown Hartford. Fabulous service (from our server, Dominique, and her manager, Anthony)! My wife had the salmon (life-changing, they say) and I had the mac-and-cheese with chicken and bacon. Two amazing dishes. And leave room, if you can, for dessert!
