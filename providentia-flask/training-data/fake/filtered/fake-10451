This place actually inspired me to start Yelping.  Yes, this is my first official Yelp review.   Best place I've ever been to?  No way.  But awesome?  Definitely.  The couches on the lower floor are great.  I sat in a beat up green 3 seater in front of a little coffee table (felt like my own little apartment, junked up furniture that is super comfortable and makes you feel all warm inside), and got to look through a window to some alley art.  Music was perfect, lighting great, and PBR for 1$.   All around, not what I expected, in a great way.  Quintessential hipster dive bar, good atmosphere, and patrons were very interesting.   Not to mention the food was excellent for the price, even for bar food.  The waiter was a little on the slow end, but to be fair, there was one waiter for 7 tables, and I don't think that's the norm.  Still, sitting in couches with some friends and drinking 1$ beers made it less like waiting and more like hanging out.   Fantastic place to go for some food and conversation.  Bring some friends, get there at a decent time, and pull up a couch.
