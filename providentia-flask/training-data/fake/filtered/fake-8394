This is the best barbeque you will ever have so don't let the mile long line deter you in getting this food.  The brisket and pulled pork are full of flavor and on their own would be perfect... but Mighty Quinn's steps it up another level with some add ons.  The bbq sauce and dash of sea salt is a perfect compliment and I recommend adding the pickled cucumber and coleslaw (and chilies if you'd like some heat).  The one warning I would give everyone is that under NO circumstance should you share this food with your friends... tell them to get their own.
