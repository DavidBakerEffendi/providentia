This used to be one of my favorite places to go - I went with large groups of friends often, and for many years. This year we tried to make a reservation for a table of 12, a good 6 weeks before the night. They refused to take it, not because they were booked, but because they "couldn't guarantee the table". Suggested we come at 6 or at 10, at which time they could apparently take our reservation. I've worked in restaurants and know how table turnover is managed. After speaking to the weekend manager and explaining how we'd been doing this for years and were very loyal customers, he told me he understood and would have the regular (weekday) manager call me and took my name and number. No one ever called. I think it is an incredible to treat loyal customers this way; all of us spent lots of money at the Odeon over many years.
