Temple Grill is one of my go to spots in New Haven.  It's right across from Omni Hotel, where you can park in the garage or valet your car.  It has a great atmosphere and gives you the option to either sit inside or outside.  The place is fairly small so it gets cramped during busy hours, but the staff is always very friendly and prompt.  All the food is very good and reasonably priced, with a wide variety to choose from.
