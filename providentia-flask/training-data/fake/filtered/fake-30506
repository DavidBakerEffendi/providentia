At the opening of the restaurant (two months ago) my first margarita pizza was stellar. However today at about 7 we ordered another and it was a pathetic excuse for a pizza. super super thin over baked crust, barely there over baked cheese and cold sauce. idk if they started outsourcing night orders or something, but I will not be ordering from them again. And I really want my money back. I ate something else, my dog liked the pizza though.
