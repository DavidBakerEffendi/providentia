I was just in Black Forest Acres II (the other store not far from the original) looking for a few products that I like and that I recommend to clients (as a private Nutritionist).  When I asked the owner if she carried any of the products, she said she did not and then continued to ream me and lecture me on the ingredients of the said products for 20 minutes.  She was rude, disrespectful, and not even correct in her claims.  I was trying to give her business and she actually belittled me to the point that I just walked out.  I have never been treated so terribly, let alone by someone in retail!  If this original Black Forest Acres is anything like the sister store, I will never step foot in it or recommend it to anyone.  In fact, I now will be encouraging my clients to avoid both stores at all costs.
