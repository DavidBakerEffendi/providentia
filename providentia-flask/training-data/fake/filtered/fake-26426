My 5 year old got run down by a girl on her bike on the street right in front of this restaurant.  Just a few cuts and scrapes, but the staff at Parc were so nice and helpful.  The bus boy brought him a milkshake and helped us inside.  Carol Anne Serena, the manager, brought out some band-aids for my son's elbow and helped us to a table.  We've been here many times and it's one of the most kid-friendly places in the city.  They're always patient, willing to accomodate strollers, and willing to make something special if the kids are picky.
