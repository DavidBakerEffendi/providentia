Glasserie is definitely worth the trek to north Greenpoint. I came here with a date last weekend and sat at the bar. The tall, blonde female bartender was so friendly and recommended an excellent glass of wine. I had the griddle bread (delicious) and the lamb in a red sauce. The restaurant has a great atmosphere, friendly and attentive staff. Great spot for a date or if you just want to treat yourself to a delicious middle eastern dinner.
