This is my favorite sandwich in Philadelphia! (Roast beef Â with American ch) The interior is a little dated, but I'd like to think the money goes into the food and for that I'm willing to overlook ambience in favor of a quality roast beef sandwich. Any time I'm in Old City, I start the night at Nick's.
