BT receives a full 5star review even thought they have gone "all fancy-smancy" with waiter service. The self-serve worked just fine for me.  Mark was cool and he resembles the character Lt.Dangle from Reno 911, so I guess it will grow on me.  You do what you have to do to enjoy the bona fide best brisket in all of NYC. Two buddies had never been to BT and one had (with me in 2013). They were utterly floored.  On several occasions this crew has canvased LIC and Astoria for BBQ. BristketTown was the ace up my sleeve.  They could not believe the brisket could be so moist and  tender - but still have the right amount of char on the end and smokiness.  They each enjoyed their side dish, as well as the quality of the pickled accompaniments that came with the platter.  I skipped on the sides -   a slice of potato bread and a cold-one are enough for me. We will all be back, though I suspect my buds will tell other people - dang!
