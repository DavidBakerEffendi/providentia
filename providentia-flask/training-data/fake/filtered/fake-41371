A little pricey, but great atmosphere, staff, food and drinks. The menu is somewhat limited, but has most of the basics i.e. pizza, burgers, salads etc. on a more level. We sat outside by the fires on a fall monday night, and it was a great time. Members of our party had cider, beer, and wine, and under the guidance of our server, we were all very happy with our choices. The food was great, nothing crazy, but a quality meal. The outside fire pits are the biggest hit for me, it was a great time and we will definitely go back, not only for relaxed nights, but also a Friday or Saturday.
