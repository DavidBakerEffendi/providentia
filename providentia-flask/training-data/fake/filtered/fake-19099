Good food, courteous staff, good prices (maybe except for dessert) Went on a Monday at around 5 for a really late lunch and of course there was no wait. I had the grilled chicken club (no mayo) with their famous fries. The sandwich was great, although i wish the chicken would have been a whole breast with some nice grill marks instead of sliced up pieces (but dont think i mean they served some deli meat chicken product, it was the real thing) And the fries were simply great. Â I took a vanilla/vanilla cupcake, a 7 layer bar type thing and a rice krispies treat. The 7 layer bar left alot to be desired (should have went for the blondie) the rice krispie treat was ok, but absolutely nothing special, but the CUPCAKE! oh man! now this was absolutely excellent and youd be hard pressed to find a better one in the city. Moist, butter, vanilla-y yellow cake, with a simply superb vanilla buttercream (which was tinted green so i know what youre thinking as far as sugar level) The buttercream was perfect. Not at all too sweet, creamy, stiff texture, and a wonderful vanilla flavor. I could eat a few big slices of this cake, or maybe a half dozen cupcakes, yes it was so worth the extra calories. I will go back here, I really wanna try the spanikopita for some reason, and definitely the grilled cheese, oh and MORE CUPCAKES PLEASE!!! YUM!!! Go get the vanilla on vanilla buttercream cupcakes right now. The tinted frosting may cause apprehension, but i promise this frosting is no sugar bomb like 99% of the colored ones in the city are. What a great cake
