I enjoyed the atmosphere, for it was very relaxing especially when they have musicians come in to perform on Saturday nights. However, it was very crowded so I would recommend coming in on a week day. The choices to personalize your ice cream are excellent. For you will get a taste of every candy you love and your favorite ice cream in their famous blend in. The employees are always smiling and willing to help. Defiantly worth a five star review.
