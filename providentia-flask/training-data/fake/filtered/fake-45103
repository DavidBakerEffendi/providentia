By far my favorite place to eat in Chinatown! The soup dumplings they have are the favorite. If youre ever in Chinatown and wanna grab a bite to eat I would definitely recommend this place. All the food I had there was delicious, the staff is nice, and on top of that it is fairly inexpensive compared to most other places in NY. Aside from the soup dumplings I would suggest getting the fried rice or any of the noodle dishes, they are all great!!!
