Had dinner here tonight. Although the food was good, it was a little over priced. One thing i really didnt like is that after being seated, the waiter came over to my table, and recited about 20-30 specials for 5 minutes. he looked like a school boy being punished and reciting a poen or something. MY BIGGEST DISAPPOINTMENT, AND WHAT I DIDNT LIKE OR APPRECIATE IS THAT AFTER WE FINISHED EATING, THE WAITER CAME OVER AND ASKED US IF WE WANTED DESSERT. I TOLD HIM NO JUST THE CHECK PLEASE. THEN A YOUNG KID (SOMEWHAT GOODLOOKING) COMES OVER TO THE TABLE AND WHISPERS IN THE DIRECTION OF MY DATE, THAT WE SHOULD REALLY TRY SOME DESSERT AND RECITED WHAT HE RECCOMMENDED. THIS MIGHT BE APPEALING TO A DESPERATE HOUSWIFE, BUT TO MY DATE AND I; IT WAS VERY DISRESPECTFUL, AND THAT KID WAS EXTREMELY LUCKY HE DIDN'T RECIEVED A SLAP IN THE HEAD. I KEEP PLAYING THIS IMAGE BACK IN MY HEAD WHENEVER I THINK OF TRATTORIA L'INCONTRO
