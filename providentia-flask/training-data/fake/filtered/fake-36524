I think this could be a good restaurant, but I think it missed the mark.  The atmosphere is wonderful, except that it is very cramped.  I thought the loud people behind us were sitting with us.  We ordered the calamari appetizer which was too salty to eat.  Then I ordered the Grouper Chef style and couldn't eat but one piece and had to literally guzzle a pitcher of water I was so full of salt.  They salt everything to the hilt to try and add flavor all it accomplishes is a thirst behind comprehension.  I would never go back although I love the pineapple on the ridizio at the end of the night.
