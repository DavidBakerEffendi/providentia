If you are going to pontificate for pages and pages about where your food is sourced, you could at least attempt to cook it properly. Â  The wait was crowded and unbearable (not my idea). The service was aloof and hipper-than-thou. The food was overcooked and sloppily presented. The bill for 2 people, no alcohol, was over $100 for brunch! The emperor has no clothes.
