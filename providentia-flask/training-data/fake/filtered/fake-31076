100% vegan coffee shop/cafe is such a beguiling concept and it nearly works. I was a bit concerned about coming here after reading the reviews since nearly all the reviews mentioned hip/punk and here I am, an overweight, nearly middle-aged suburban mom who happens to be vegan. I was pleasantly surprised about how well me, my disabled husband and 2 of our children were treated. The staff made wonderful hot chocolates for my 7-year old twins and my husband enjoyed his coffee. My cappucino was not ready until everyone was already done with their desserts and drinks and when I tasted it, it was nearly undrinkable. The foam was fine but the espresso was so horribly burnt-tasting. The cafe serves Vegan Treats desserts. I might be the only one to feel this way but I really dislike Vegan Treats desserts. They are way too junky and always make me feel sick if I eat one. I wish more places would try to get better quailty vegan desserts like we have in NJ (Cinnamon Snail and Wildflower Vegan).
