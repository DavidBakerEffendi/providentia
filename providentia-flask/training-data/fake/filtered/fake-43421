Went here & the server Robert was nice. All was going well until we got the bill and I was charged $15 for a salad. Thought I could explain to the hostess that I wasn't asked if I wanted a large and furthermore if I was asked I definitely would have not opted for the $15 choice. She then proceeded to tell me that the extra $5 was bc I asked for olives. Totally missed the point that there was two diff prices for the two diff sizes. Once I explained that to her she stated basically that I was beat and there was nothing she could do about it. But she'd let the server know. A lot of good that did me. Good food, horrible customer service. The lady was a witch.
