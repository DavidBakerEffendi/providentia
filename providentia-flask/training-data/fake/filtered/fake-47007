I have had dinner at the Manor many times and have found the food delicious.  However, last evening (12-18-13) I was very disappointed with the food.  The apps were good, but the main course was not up to the standard set by this restaurant.  I ordered Prime Rib, but received what seemed to be a rib steak with bone.  My friend ordered baked cod, and the fish had many bones and all they gave along with the fish was a large portion of raw onions and canned white potatoes.  It was not good. The vegetables they served were undercooked and the rice was not good.  The sauce with the appetizer (fried squid) was obviously out of jar for it tasted like Franchesco Rinaldi sauce. The worst part of the evening was the sangria.  It was lacking in flavor other than wine, and it needed some orange juice and soda.  We asked for this and they gave us a glass with both orange juice and soda.  It appeared on the bill as a charge and that was it for me. I have been a loyal customer for a long time at this establishment, but you could see that they have cut the quality of the food due to the lack of business, and I will never come back again.  Three tables were being used, that is all for the dinner hour, so something is wrong to have so few people for dinner.
