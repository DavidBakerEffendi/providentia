One of my absolute FAVORITE bars in the city! I've tried tons of appetizers & entrees on the menu & have loved each and every one. My favorite entree is the cajun tilapia (mmm!). They have an awesome rotating beer selection on draft & tons of great bottled belgian beers. I tend to go on sundays when Michelle is behind the bar - as she is one of the very best bartenders in the city! The staff always make you feel welcome & at home. Every bartender plays music from their own ipod so there's always great tunes. It's basically the Cheer's of Fairmount Park, but smaller. If you haven't been, you have to get in here. Try & get in early since there's a limited number of seats at the bar. It's totally worth the cab ride!
