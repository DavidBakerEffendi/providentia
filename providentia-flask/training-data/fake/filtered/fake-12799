We ordered food for my wife's baby shower last month form this restaurant and all I can say i that we had a wonderful experience.A party of close to 20 people.The food was delicious and the service was remarkable.As promised by the manager the food was ready for pickup as early as 10 am.All my guests were in praise for the taste and quality of food. I highly recommend this restaurant for taste, quality and cleanliness.
