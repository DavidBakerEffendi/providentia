This restaurant is listed with restaurant.com as participant, but restaurant.com card was not redeemable at Tre Piani. I wouldn't have eaten here except for the belief that I was entitled to receive a hefty discount, as the restaurant is way overpriced for the mediocre quality of the food. Since Tre Piani is a business partner w/restaurant.com, I hold the restaurant partly responsible for the problem I had regarding lack discount with restaurant.com card. Dealing with unscrupulous .com business which brings the restaurant more business under false pretenses, is not a good way to retain customers.
