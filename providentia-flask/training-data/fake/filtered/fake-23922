sports bar? I think not. I went there to watch the NCAA b-ball tournament, and with all of about 6 people in there, none of whom cared about what was on the tv, I got an attitude from the only person working when I asked to change the channel to a different game. she did change it, but made smart-ass comments to me. like it's really hard to press a button when the place is practically empty. if you like mediocre, overpriced (except the wings) pub grub and hip hop music (fri and sat nights) this is your place. sports fans and foodies stay away!
