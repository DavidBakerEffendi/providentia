I give Zento five stars! I went with my sister on a Monday night around 6:30 and just missed the 1/2 off appetizers and cocktails. Though business was slow since it was the beginning of the workweek, the food was still delicious. I had the edamame (standard but tasty), king crab miso soup (out of this world! with large chunks of tofu and king crab), the spicy tuna roll (ground tuna with spicy sauce), and the California roll. The ambience was relaxed with candles burning along the walls and dripped waxed on the bricks. Â A good first date atmosphere... Would definitely recommend if you're in Old City.
