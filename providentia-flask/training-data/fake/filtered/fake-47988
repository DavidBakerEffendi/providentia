Look people, this is Burlington's downtown.  If you want to be eating cheap Subway sandwiches with food trucked in from who knows where, then great.  If you want a locally owned, high quality ingredient, decently sized grinder than STACKS is where it is at.   I go about once a week and really enjoy their vegetarian chickpea sandwich.  Nicely seasoned, creative toppings, and a great size for what I am looking for in a sandwich. For only being open a few weeks, Stacks is shaping up to be a great Burlington hotspot for quick, fresh, and easy to please food. This is especially great for those of us who live in the Old North End and don't want to trek all the way downtown for later dinner eats. Keep it up Stacks!
