Carefully chosen words are the tools of my profession, yet the explosion of taste that envelopes my senses everytime I pass thru the doors of this exquisite Cypriot BYOB deffies explanation.  I have visited Kanella over a dozen times since it opened for both dinner and, more recently brunch. What I admire most about this place is that the chef and his staff constantly challenge themselves.  Look at the menu and you will see an amazing diversity of food.  All of it is divine.  Come back in a month and you will be warmly greeted with your traditional favorites as well as new scumptious additions.  They prod, they poke, and your tastebuds, just like that old Bud commercial, sing and dance the night away.  And, apart from the amazing food, the family atmosphere of the staff is truly a joy.  Simply put they seem to genuinely love working there and their enthusiasm is infectious as they guide you through a gourmet meal befitting a king and queen.   The plates arrive full and leave empty.  No doggy bags needed here.  So go soon, go hungry, bring your favorite bottle of wine, you won't be dissapointed.
