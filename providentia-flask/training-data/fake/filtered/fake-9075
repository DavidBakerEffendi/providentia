Haven does what it sets out to do as well as or better than anyone else. From basic burgers and hoagies to outrageous creations that fill hearty sandwiches with what is essentially an entire meal (and then some), there's no better destination for greasy, satisfying college fare. You could eat here every day and have no trouble ordering something new, but most people settle on a favorite once they get the hang of the place. Downsides are that they only accept cash and can have unpredictable closing times, but if it's before 2am on a weekend there's no better option on Nassau.
