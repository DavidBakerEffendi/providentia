I recently went to Dino's on a lunch break and ordered a simple cheese and mushroom calzone. When I got my food the cheese was barely melted and the mushrooms were still raw. It had to of been cooked for no more than 5 minutes. I went back, showed him the calzone and asked for a refund. The man got short and angry with me. I was baffled and irritated and will never resort to this place for lunch again. I advise everyone else do the same.
