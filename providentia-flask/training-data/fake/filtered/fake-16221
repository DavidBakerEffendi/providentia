Went for a late-night birthday dinner and had a great time.  Our waiter was adorable, and a girl from Next Top Model was a hostess.  The music is loud enough so that you can wiggle in your seat without overpowering your conversation, and my table was close to the bar, so after a second Cafeteria Cosmo I was at the bar mingling.  They people are all attractive but most of the guys were gay (which was expected considering the neighborhood).  Nice spot to grab a few drinks in your freak-um dress right before a party without a drove of blood-thirsty men trying to get your goodies.
