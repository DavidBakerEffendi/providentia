For as long as I can remember, my family and I have been going to Bella Italia for Christmas Eve dinner. The food is always on point and the owner is always so nice. However, the past few years we had a nasty waitress. She's inconsiderate, inattentive and forgetful. While clearing the table, she hit me in my face and said nothing... She didn't even notice. I love Bella Italia, but some of the waitress could use a reality check instead of a paycheck
