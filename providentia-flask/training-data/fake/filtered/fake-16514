Service was bad from the start.  We walked in and stood in the doorway of a half empty restaurant on a friday night for 10 minutes without being acknowledged.  I had to ask the waiter if we could be seated. That was a little annoying. The service was slow getting our drink order.  The food was so ridiculously over priced for the portion and quality of the food. The chicken parm was paper thin and over cooked.  In my opinion chicken parm should not be tough. The thin crust pizza came out with a watery sauce.  The mozzarella cheese had a texture of a rubbery cottage cheese.  To top it off my wife's $12 lemon drop martini was probably the worst we have ever had.  Will not be returning.
