Zinna's Bistro was recommended by a friend last year and it has been our favorite ever since.  The food is fabulous, everything from sandwiches and salads to terrific entrees.  We've been there five times already and we are always happy. So far, I've had their beet wedges which were superb, their Mediterranean Salad, and the eggplant rollatini appetizer.  Yesterday we raced the clock because their sandwiches are to die for but are only served until 4 p.m.  and we got there in time.  I had the Toscano Panini which was to die for and my husband had the Greco burger, a lamb patty with goat cheese and tzatziki sauce among other things.  He described it as outrageous.  We will be back!
