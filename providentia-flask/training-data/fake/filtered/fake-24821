I've tried them twice since they moved to the new location on Race Street. The place def looks A LOT better than what it was at the old location. It has a modern taste in its renovation. As for the food, it's still good food but disappointingly not as good as the old location. They used to serve the best soup dumplings in Philly!!! My guess, new chef? I will still visit them because they are pretty unique in terms of serving Shanghainese food (most Chinese restaurants in Chinatown serve Cantonese food). But I really hope they improve their soup dumplings.
