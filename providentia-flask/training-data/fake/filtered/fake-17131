My lady and I stopped in for drinks at the bar on a Friday evening after being curious about the place for a while. Was turned off immediately by the really saccharine live music duo playing coldplay and U2 cover songs sort of plopped down in the middle of the room, but they weren't so loud we couldn't talk so we figured we could deal. I ordered a gin and tonic and it tasted notably weak. I watched the bartender pour the second one and I figured out why, she barely splashed the tonic with gin. The pour count was maybe 0.5 seconds? It was a thimble of gin for a $6 cocktail (rail). That was it. We were done after seeing that. Won't be back ever.
