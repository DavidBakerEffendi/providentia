Last week was my second time at the Blue Ribbon and because i enjoyed it so much i decided to give it a good review... To make a long story short, the service was pleasant, the food was great, especially because i'm a vegetarian and the sea-food there is so tasty. IT was a little bit crowded when we arrived, but i guess that just means that business are good. Recommended.
