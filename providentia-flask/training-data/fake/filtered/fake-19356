Service was EXTREMELY slow (but very friendly) which on this particular night was more of a problem for the restaurant than for us, We were not in a rush and were enjoying spending time talking during the hour and fifty minutes we were at our table. There were a lot of people waiting for tables and we saw several people leave because the wait was so long. Now onto the food: The soup ($6) was loaded with big chunks of veggies in a tomato base but had little distinguishing character with one sprig of fresh Sage providing the only real burst of interesting flavor. The nachos appetizer ($9) composed of Guacamole filled Won Tons on a bed of Â fresh greens topped with black beans, a cashew nut "cheese" and fresh salsa. Yum! very tasty nicely presented dish and the highlight of our meal. Mushroom Linguini "special" ($17) house made pasta with Portobella and Shiitake mushrooms. I've doctored up Ramen noodles with some mushrooms, veggies and Miso and they tasted better than this dish. The setting: comfortable chairs, rough sawn wood tables (sanded smooth and attractive) good lighting, brick walls and very clean bathrooms. If it were not for the one very good appetizer we would be crossing Revolution Kitchen off our list of BTV restaurants. We may try again on a weekday evening to see if they can do better.
