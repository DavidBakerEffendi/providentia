Food is pretty good and the staff is super friendly and outgoing. Our server was awesome. My only real complaint is that my table was directly across from the front door and every time someone opened it, which was frequent, it felt like an arctic blast. It was generally cold throughout the restaurant and I had to eat with my coat on (and I'm a guy who isn't really bothered by that stuff) They absolutely need a second door to seal off the main entry way from the rest of the place. The hostesses were wearing north faces and the server acknowledged that the cold was a legitimate problem.
