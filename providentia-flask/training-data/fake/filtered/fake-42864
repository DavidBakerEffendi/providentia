Loved my Crepe Ology, my companions were merely satisfied with their build-your-own panini, we all loved the fruity muffin baked on premises. Friendly service could be speedier, but i really liked the vibe there next to the gym, all those fit iinstructors ordering the same healthful crepes and juices as me.  Good luck, 3rd Wave, i'll definitely be back soon !!  Maybe for take-out lunch or dinner en route to work or a summer concert or ballgame where the food is inedible.  Wonderful menu, thank you for being thoughtful and creative, in Lyndhurst !!
