I had my sister's baby shower, with about 60 guests, at Calandra's Mediterranean Grill, a few weeks ago and we were very happy with it.  We had never been to the restaurant before but picked that location because they would give us the whole room to ourselves and the room had tall beautiful windows and a very light feel to it.  I also put some trust in the Calandra name, as I've been to Il Vecchio a few times and love it.  The manager, Tom, was great to work with, and the food was delicious (killer vodka sauce, by the way). Also the servers were very helpful and attentive.  i highly recommend it for those types of functions or family parties, but I would make sure to tell your guests that the restaurant is inside the Hampton Inn, so that they don't think it's a free standing restaurant.  I look forward to going back with a small group for lunch or dinner and trying out the patio in the nicer weather.
