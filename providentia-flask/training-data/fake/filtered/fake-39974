Went to Casa Piquin last night.  Our order took over 45 minutes to get to the table!! Our server was pleasant but not attentive. Very, slow. We had to ask repeatedly for more water & salsa.. It was decent, not great as other reviews had indicated.  Portions were a good size but our 3 dishes were quite salty. The Hostess sat at a table with friends the entire time getting up to seat patrons and a couple of times to go into the kitchen but never assisted the wait staff. Prices were OK. We will definitely not return. There are far better options in the area.
