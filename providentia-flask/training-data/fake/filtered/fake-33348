My fiancee and I dined here on a Tuesday evening; we sat outside as it was warm and sunny when we arrived. Service was good. They were a little slow to acknowledge us as we waited by the door but once they found the reservation, we were offered our seats pretty quickly. The good: lots of choice and this place is a BYOB. The bad: nothing was seasoned. Not a touch of salt in sight - good for the heart but not so good for the tastebuds. Portion sizes were small which in turn makes the pricing seem a little high. We shared a flatbread and a crab terrine to start; the flatbread, at $14, was not good. Undercooked dough and cubes of bland short rib. It's hard to like this when just a couple of blocks away, Tria Taproom do the best flatbreads in the city, mostly at less than $14 to boot. Crab was fresh but unseasoned. I had the chicken Milanese to follow and my fiancee had the potato crusted ahi tuna. Both were okay, nothing bad about the dishes, they just lacked flavor. Â It was a frustrating sort of meal. $90 for two including tax and tip. My vote for best BYOB in the city still goes to Marigold Kitchen.
