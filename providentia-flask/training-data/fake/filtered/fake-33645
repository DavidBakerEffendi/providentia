By going there you are supporting a sweat shop! Employees get no breaks, no matter how many hours they work. They do not care about customers at all! The managers say all the time one customer is not going to effect our business. Also the cockroaches are something bad. Customers have found them in food to their drinks. Wait is super long and food is far from authentic Mexican. Do not even bother, save your time and go somewhere else. Managers are very unprofessional. Like i said before. The staff DOES NOT CARE ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE ONLY YOUR MONEY!
