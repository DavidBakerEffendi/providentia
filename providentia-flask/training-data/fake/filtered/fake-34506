I was going to comment on the meal I had at the Star a few weeks ago,but when reading the recent reviews I decided to comment on the service rather than the meal.I had a similar problem with a credit card at Star and also called to speak to a manager, and yes Bruce was the manager I was directed to.I explained that I was charged twice for a twenty dollar tip I left and wanted an explanation for this problem. He said he would look for my paper work and see if the problem was there, also defending his staff said he was sure it was most likely a mistake. That he felt he had a honest staff, but he would look into it and I should call back. My experience with Bruce was a positive one, He seemed genuine and handled my call professionally.                                                               As it turned out the error was at my bank and not at Star.                           P.S. The pizza was Heaven and Diane an angel on a very busy night
