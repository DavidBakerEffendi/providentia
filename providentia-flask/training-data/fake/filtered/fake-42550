My boyfriend and I came to celebrate our Anniversary on a weeknight. Waiter seemed a bit annoyed at times and it took him awhile to actually come to our table to take our order. The food was average. I was impressed with the Caesar salad. The serious down fall is having to pay $15 just to park in the Moshulu's parking lot right outside of the restaurant. $15 to park PLUS paying for overpriced entrees! Coming back again is highly unlikely.
