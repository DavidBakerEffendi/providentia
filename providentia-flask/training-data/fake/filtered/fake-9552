My husband called ahead and requested a table in front for my birthday. Instead we were seated next to the kitchen etrance AND a family with screaming kids.  When we asked the maitre'd if we could have one of several open tables at the front, he was very rude and said that it was "reserved" for a couple that was having an anniversary! (If they don't have the space then say so!) Then he proceeded to spend the evening eating and drinking at the bar with the rest of the patrons there. The food was so mediocre I can't even remember what I ate as a main course and the flourless chocolate torte I ordered for dessert was so dry it must have been sitting out for a day. We had planned to look in to using the restaurant for a 25th Wedding Anniversary party with at least 30 guests....guess what? NO WAY!  In fact, I will never eat there again!
