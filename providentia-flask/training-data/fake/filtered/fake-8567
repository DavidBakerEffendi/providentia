Perhaps my favorite spot for tonkotsu ramen in NYC, and one of the most crowded.  The atmosphere isn't for everyone, if you're looking for a quiet spot to relax and eat this is not the place for you.  If you're looking for a bustling trendy bar with a younger crowd (hello NYU & Cooper Union students) and good ramen to boot, this is the place.  Service is also excellent every time I've been there. Would recommend the Hakata classic and pork buns for sure.  If you're just into the ramen and want to avoid the lines, I'd suggest going for an early lunch on the weekdays.
