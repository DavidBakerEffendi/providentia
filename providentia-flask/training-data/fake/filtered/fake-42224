We had reservations at 6:30 pm for a party of 8 to celebrate a friend's birthday. 4 people got there on time at 6:30, while the other 4 were stuck in traffic and didn't get there till about 7:10. Our waiter was friendly, funny, and personable and did not make us feel bad about being late. The food came out really fast(we had to do the chef's selection menu because it was a large party), maybe a little too rushed, but that is what you get for being late, so I can't complain about that. The food was delicious. They come in small plates, with 1 piece for each person to try. We had 9 courses. The price was $40 per person for the chef's selection menu and we were so full by the end. I tried food that I wouldn't normally eat, like fried frog legs (tastes like fried chicken wings). The place is pretty small and it gets REALLY loud, so we had to scream at each other across the table. Â  Overall I was very happy and would definitely go back again!
