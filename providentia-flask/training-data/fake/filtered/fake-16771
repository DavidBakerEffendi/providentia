I'm sad to say that Â the food at New Wave has seriously gone downhill. When we first moved to the neighborhood, we loved it! Amazing burgers, sandwiches, and salads. The last few visits, I felt like I had wasted my money. Fish Tacos- Literally a piece of dry tilapia on a tortilla with a lone piece of lettuce and some 'aoli'. The burgers have gone down hill as well- they used to use local, grass-fed beef, quality toppings, and make a mean burger. now? mediocre. Next time, I'll walk a few blocks to Adsum and pay $2 more and get the meal in under 40 minutes. I will say though, the bar is still great. I can't recommend the food, though.
