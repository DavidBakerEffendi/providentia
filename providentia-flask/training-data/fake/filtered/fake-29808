Being from Maine I would NOT dare eat lobster outside of the state-I mean, why bother? So I was hestitant about checking out the Lobster Joint but figured I would try the clam strips. My fiance and I both ordered clam strips ($8.00 for a generous appetizer portion) DELICIOUS!  SPECTACULAR!   The clams were cooked to perfection, not at all chewy or rubbery, not too greasy!  YUM!   I was really blown away.  Some of the best I have ever had.   We ordered 3 sides (for $10-such a great deal), Onion rings, fries and coleslaw--all very generous portions and more than we could finish!   The onion rings were delectable, the coleslaw fantastic and the fries awesome!   The stafff was super friendly, attentive and helpful--even running out to catch me to return the umbrella I had left behind!  (Thank you!)   The decor is simple and tactful, the atmosphere is relaxed and casual  and the place (restrooms, tables, floors)  is exceptionally clean. I like that there is only 1 television in the place, over by the bar, instead of the dozens one usually sees in every other bar and restaurant which are distracting and annoying. I was so impressed with the food quality and preparation that I think next time I WILL try the lobster!   And from a girl from Maine that is huge!
