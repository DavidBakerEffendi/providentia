I lived in Mexico City and Puebla for almost 12 years. Everyone!! This is IT! This is as good as its going to get outside of Mexico. Yet, they combined their spices with some contemporary dishes to a perfect marriage of form and function, or should i say, smell and taste. I guess smell is a function of taste.  The chicken burritos hay carumba at this place are unbelievable, came in on a busy saturday night, there was a 35 minute wait but luckily I had made reservations on opentable. They sat my party of 7 right away! We had a great time, our waitress name was Gaby (cute too), very efficient, knowledgeable, and fast. The sangria were better than most places at the city, my friends got a pitcher of Margaritas and they claim it was really good.(i didnt try it, don't  like to mix flavors!!) Anyway, the appetizer were well timed and very flavorful,  we had tableside guaca(the best), a quesadilla and some poppers(ceviche sounded good but will have to try next time). Just thinking about the table side guaca is watering my mouth....All our entrees we just perfect, large portions, great smells and sounds came from our table and this place all night long. Only problem we had was towards the end, there was some kind of private party getting started and the music began to play really loud, yet, the manager took care of it right away and even came over to the table to apologize and bought us a round of drinks(that's why i gave the 5 stars, if you fix the problem, then there was no problem!!) we left late, really late, around 11 pm and it was getting empty by then.  Great Service, great atmosphere, awesome food! will be back!!
