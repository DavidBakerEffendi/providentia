So my first time experience....went with a large group and 3 kids (all under 3, 1 of which is only 8 months old). We elected to do the "family special" where its $10 per ADULT (14 of us bare in mind). Pizza and salads were good and service was ok. The bill comes and they charged us for the kids! Now if they ate any pizza to start with or if they had told us that the kids are included in the headcount to be charged, I wouldn't complain. The kids had their own meals we ordered off the menu so I asked the waitress to correct the bill. She comes back and removed one of the charges but not the other two charges. With it getting late and the kids getting restless/tired...out group elected to just pay it and move on. Thought I'd share this experience since it wasn't fair to charge us as they did nor to offer a resolution. Poor customer service.
