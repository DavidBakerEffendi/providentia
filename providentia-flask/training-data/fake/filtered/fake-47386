All I have to say is WOW. I didn't expect the food to be as good as it was. A Bunch of my friends and I were bar hopping in williamsburg and it was late and saw that this place was open. I would recommend the chicken kabob over rice and make sure you try the hummus. Â I have been back many times because the food was amazing, never disappointed. Keep up the good work people.
