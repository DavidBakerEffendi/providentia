Paneer tikka butter masala, saag paneer, navratan korma, vegetable biryani, aloo papri chaat .... and the list goes on!! I could never stop falling in love with this place every time I go there! I mean, it is SO perfect!! I had tried a couple of places for authentic Indian food in and around Philly, but nothing beats KARMA! No one could, actually! The food is so sumptuous here; you would definitely get whatever and exactly the way you want it! Their chef is just apt for an Indian restaurant that while eating, you tend to forget you are not in India. The service is 'what any customer wishes for'; their manager is amazing and owner Jiji Thomas is super-friendly. Believe you me, they make the BEST naans (Indian breads) ever! They are so fresh and delicious.... especially the garlic naan is to die for!! I definitely recommend Kandhari Naan (bread stuffed with pistachios, raisins, and some nuts), which could also be ordered as a dessert with mouthwatering mango chutney. My husband just loves the chicken and shrimp biryani they make with amazing spices. He is all praises for The Rack of Lamb, Chicken Tikka Masala, Tootak (Chicken Wings) Â and what not!! We both CAN'T have enough of Karma ever!!
