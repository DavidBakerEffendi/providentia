I recently ate here twice. Once for dinner and once for brunch. Dinner exprience is why this is getting '3' stars.  I had a grilled cheese and tator tots.  It was all 'fine'.  Not the greatest but somewhere to grab something fast. Brunch was not so great.  I had the morning wood sandwich.  Maple bacon is a terrible choice because all you taste is maple syrup and not the cheese.  I wish it was plain bacon which would accomadate this sandwich so much better. The ambience was terrible- WHY WOULD YOU BLARE A RADIO STATION during sunday brunch????  I SPENT 20 MINUTES LISTENING TO ANNOYING COMMERCIALS ON A LOUD SPEAKER!!!!  I was so agitated at listening to this I wanted to leave.   SUGGESTION- Plug in an ipod, a computer, anything with a playlist minus loud and agitating commercials.
