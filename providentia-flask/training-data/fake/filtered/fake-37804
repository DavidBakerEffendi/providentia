I work at a bar a block away and am always looking to support my neighboring businesses.  So last week I went in and ordered the eggplant rotellini appetizer special and the gnocchi entree to go. The total came to $32, which seemed very high, but if it was good, it would be worth it. Well, it was not.  There was only one small rotellini, which was caked with batter and dry ricotta. It was very disappointing. Then the gnocchi.  There was again a very small portion and it was smother in so much grated parmesian cheese that it was salty to the point of being inedible.  The sauce was OK, but salty as well.  There was a big chuck of Italian bread with it, but no butter, so super-dry. The gnocchi was $16, btw, which is a lot for plain gnocchi and sauce with no meat, etc.  I returned it and was offered to have it remade, but I wasn't happy with the first so I refused a second.  Plus I had no time as I had to start my shift.  I was offered no refund or raincheck.  I won't go back.
