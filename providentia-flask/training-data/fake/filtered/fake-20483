I would have appreciated knowing that Zahav is a TAPAS style restaurant.  Nowhere on the menu or website does it say anything about tapas; we first learned that the portions were VERY small after we were already seated, had ordered drinks, and selected a hummus. When we first arrived and sat down, our waiter told us that the restaurant was a (and I quote) "Family Style" restaurant in the traditional Israeli fashion, where large plates of food were brought to the table and everyone shared until full.  This is NOT the case.  There is only one "family style" option on the entire menu and it costs over $40 per person!   The first time I went I brought my parents along and was SO embarrassed when they ordered a grilled meet Al Ha'esh and received three jelly bean-sized pieces of grilled duck on a bread plate - for $10.  The reviews before mine say things like "A regular go-to dinner spot" - this is very off base.  If you go to Zahav and want to be full when you leave expect to pay between $30 and $40 per person not including drinks. Don't tell me the restaurant is Family Style to get me to order, then tell me I have to order at least 3 entrees to be full and charge me an arm and a leg.  Disappointing.
