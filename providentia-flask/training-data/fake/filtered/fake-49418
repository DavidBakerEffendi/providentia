Favorite, favorite, favorite! What's not to like about this place? From the start they welcome you with the tequila bar - with a spinning low rider bike, then you move on to your table which the entire restaurant has this look and feel of awesomeness! They had a large selection of food, but on every visit I keep to the same; corn, chicken fajitas (which the presentation alone is a reason to order) and blood orange margaritas. But your night can't be complete without taking your photo booth pictures!
