i LOVE this place The food is DELICIOUS! I have never tried a felafel before and its safe to say i now LOVE felafel. Try the new Feta Cheese Felafel Sandwich!!!!!!!!!!!! MY NEW FAVORITE THING IN THE WORLD I also have never reviewed anything on yelp and made this account just to post this review!' Only downfall is the fact that its only cash but its ok not worth a whole star!
