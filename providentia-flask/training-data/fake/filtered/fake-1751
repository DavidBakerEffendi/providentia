We have been to the location on Tenth Ave. once before and the service was good but this last visit on October 7th the attention to our party of 14 was very poor. We were continuously ignored by our server. From keeping our water filled all the way to getting our bill. We all had to stand and start to walk out before he brought the bill to us. To put in mildly the server had a very poor attitude. By the way the food was great as usual just the service was seriously lacking.
