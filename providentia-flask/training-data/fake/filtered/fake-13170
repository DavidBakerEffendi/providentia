Okay, just to clarify about this place, which I last visited around 1978... you are not buying some delicious burger that has been crafted for perfect taste.  You are buying a tradition and an attitude.  If you want friendly smiling service please go somewhere else.     It was not just ketchup, at least back in the 70s, and maybe they try more  now, but the whole point was the customer had to obey the rules.  If the Seinfeld Soup Nazi did not exist, then we could still have the Puck Nazi.  I do not see anyone mention that so perhaps there is no Puck anymore.  In the 70s you could not even mention Hamburger.  It was a Puck, or a Puck Works. They had other good ways to make out of town customers suffer but I am not going to try to put them all here.  Find out for yourself.  I hope this makes people stop whining about this place.  Just go and observe.  It's the 'tude, dude.  Okay, that was stupid, but anyway.... Happy eating!
