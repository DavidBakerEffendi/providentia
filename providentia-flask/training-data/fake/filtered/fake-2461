We live in the neighborhood and were looking for breakfast on a rainy Saturday, too hungry to deal with the crush of tourists at Reading Terminal. I knew this was a hotel restaurant but got sucked into all the rave reviews and became convinced it must be Â something more than the usual midrange business class hotel breakfast. It isn't. If you have stayed in a chain hotel on the side of a busy highway anywhere in the country that includes a free breakfast in the lobby, you know exactly what this is. The addition of a live chef to cook omelettes and scrambled eggs is nice, but it is still a melamine bar with stainless steel buckets set in ice and filled with individual pots of yogurt and half pints of milk, some pastries in a clear acrylic case, and a steam bar with troughs of bacon and sausage. The view is lovely, your fellow diners are exactly what you would expect at a $100 a night hotel across from a convention center, and you will pay $15.95 unless this came as part of a room package.
