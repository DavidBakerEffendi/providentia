Came here the other night for dinner. No line at 10pm which was a surprise based on other reviews. This was probably the best burger I ever had. I recommend the truffle burger, although its the only one I had, there is no reason to try anything else on the menu after eating this. The fries are great as well. They also have a full bar which is a plus!
