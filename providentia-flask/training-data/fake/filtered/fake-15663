I love Mexican. It is by far my favorite food. I've been to every Mexican restaurant around and this is BY FAR the worst mexican I have ever had. The service itself was fine, but everything else was disappointing. What Mexican restaurant doesn't provide it's customers with free chips? Well, this one doesn't. Chips with guacamole was $6, and if you wanted salsa (that's right, no salsa bar), it's even more. I ordered 1 refried bean and 1 chicken enchilada, which came to $14 dollars. It had absolutely no flavor whatsoever. I received a plate with soupy refried beans, with one small tortilla filled with nothing but shredded flavorless chicken, and another small tortilla filled with refried beans. I did have a very small bowl of rice/black beans/shredded lettuce, but adding those ingredients made absolutely no difference. Will never go here again. My husband and I received 2 very small entrees, Â chips, and 1 beer, and it was $50 plus tip. So disappointing....
