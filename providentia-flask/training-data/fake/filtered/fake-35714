I have been going to this place for a little over two years and I have to say that the food has always been fresh and tasty.   Will not go anywhere else to get a gyro or any other type of greek food except here.  #1 in my book.  No matter what day of the week you go the food always taste fresh and service is always great.   I have not eatten not one bad thing there yet, plus don't expect to. :-) Service is always fast and most of all friendly.  Plus for the amount of food they give you there food is well priced.
