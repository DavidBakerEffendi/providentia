I'm not sure how to classify this. It's Indian/gastronomic fusion stuff, recognizably Indian but not really traditional. I've only had the saag paneer and the goat cheese naan. The saag paneer was great. More garlic and a different sort of spice and pepper than most Indian places use. Less cumin-forward. The naan was more roti-like, not as buttery or layered as some I've had, with plenty of savory goat cheese filling and enough jalapeno to balance it out. Their food costs more than any other Indian place in Philly, including Palace at the Ben, which is my usual standby. Worth it for a change, but probably won't become another long-time favorite. Edit: I figured it out. They're using fresh jalapeno instead of dried Indian chilies.
