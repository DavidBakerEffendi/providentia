Last Monday night was my first outing after having major surgery....total hysterectomy. My first suggestion was that I wanted to go to here and have this wonderful BBQ that everyone was talking about. It was a Monday night, 9pm...about 5 couples sitting at those tiny chairs that they have for two people. Knowing that it was empty and it was uncomfortable for me to sit on those two hard metal chairs (I would have had to squeeze between other patrons). I asked the waiter if we can have a booth because it was uncomfortable for me to sit on those seats. He said "NO...we are waiting for a possible party of 4". THERE WERE 4 EMPTY BOOTHS AND IT WAS A MONDAY NIGHT APPROXIMATELY 9PM! We said I couldn't sit there and he didn't bother to accommodate me. Now don't get me wrong, I understand their rules but come on it was a Monday night, late and no parties of 4 or 5 or even 2 were going to enter this place at that point. The waiter didn't even try to stop us from leaving. I was furious, I called and explain the situation to the person who picked up the phone after being on hold for almost 10 minutes but I had to give them a piece of my mind. He had nothing to say but say "sorry". Good customer service would have been to tell us to come back and accommodate me just this one time. They lost two good customer and great tippers. My boyfriend and I are in the hospitality business so we know what its like to work for tips so we are always generous. They need to improve on their customer service!
