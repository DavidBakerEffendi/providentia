One, the staff and the owner were really nice. I've yet to find a place in Manhattan like this, and few in Brooklyn too. Two, I don't live in WIndsor Terrace, Park Slope or Williamsburg... and I'm not a yuppie... but I do like really good beer... and this place has a pretty good selection of it. Yeah, there seems to be a few pretentious wankers that hang out here, but why would anyone seriously give a shit??? Plus $6 is standard for a pint of excellent ale here- the fact that they sell 10% & 11% abv for this price is actually pretty good. Other spots in the city have ales the Double Windsor has on tap for at least a dollar more. AND, the kitchen opened a week or two ago... they have a DAMN good grilled cheese & really great fries. I could eat at least 2-3 of them & would be happy to pay the price. Â Will certainly return.
