This is definitely the best restaurant in Greenpoint. The only problem with this place you have to wait to get seated -always. this is why we went there after 11 pm, and anyway 15 minute wait. we tried the homemade ricotta and the scallops, both were awesome. after that we ordered ravioli and Shepherd's pie delicious. i wish i could try the brunch sometime, but when i see the line of people every Sunday it is unbelievable. good job
