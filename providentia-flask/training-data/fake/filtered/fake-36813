Went to this place last night for cocktails.  We've been to a lot of places where the mixologists are talked about as well as the drinks they create but this place stood out from the rest.  We had the Bee's Mead and the Rhubarb Pisco which was really incredible.  Frothy, blush pink and perfect.  I emailed for a reservation on the earlier side (just for drinks at the bar) and luckily they had availability.  The bartender also made me a Swizzle with all kinds of things (clove, nutmeg).  Really different and nice for Fall.  I liked the ambiance and the conversation and of course the beverages!
