I've never eaten in, but this is my go-to-Chinese-take-out-place. I live in Montclair and I feel like this place is as fresh, light, and tasty as TS Ma, but far less expensive. Â It is slightly under seasoned, as is TS Ma, but I prefer to add a touch of salt to a fresh dish than have a heavily sauced dish with a ton of MSG in it.
