Although my stay was very short in New York, I had been coming there for many years as a kid, so it had been over 17 years since I had revisited the 'Big Apple'. Â While walking through Harlem admiring all of the beautiful things and people, I asked about Sylvia's, but was told that Amy Ruth's would be the better choice and boy was it ever!!!! The food was out of sight and as an added delight I even saw the greatest basketball player ever, Kareem Abdul-Jabar. Fantastic it was!! I was estatic to be eating at a great place and the prices were well-worth it. Please have the Smoked Turkey Wings. They are out of sight!! Great place, very clean and very clean bathroom. Such ambience. I would definitely move to Harlem just for that place. In fact my friend and I are coming back in October. See you Amy Ruth!!! I give it five stars*****
