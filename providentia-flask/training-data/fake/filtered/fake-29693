Don't listen to negative reviews on the quality of the food. All burger meat is ground on site.  This is the freshest slider you may ever have.  Guinness Shake is top notch and, if you're feeling adventurous, the Candied Bacon shake kicks butt. Fries are great as well.  Try them with chili and/or cheese. For the most part, service has always been good (and I go there A LOT).  If you have a problem with a waitress or a server, tell a manager or a supervisor.  This is not how MarkBurger typically is. And in response to the "wait time" for these burgers... if you want something fast, go to McDonald's.  Quality takes time.  And 10 minutes is not absurdly long. Good Happy Hour Specials at $3 a beer from 3-7pm.
