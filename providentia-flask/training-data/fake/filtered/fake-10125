I went there last night with my kids. I cant recall ever being so angry about dining out. The whole experience was awful, a complete disaster. The salsa was cold jarred cheap pasta sauce with extra tomato paste, not a vegetable in sight, disgusting.  The fish tacos were made from obviously frozen cut up fried fish, it tasted like it had been done two days ago and sitting in the fridge since then.  Did I mention everything was COLD? I was more than angry, but being with my kids did not want to make a scene or embarrass them by sending anything back.  The beans tasted out of a can with no type of seasoning...The plain converted rice was also dry like it had been cooked days ago and reheated, and only barely.  It was also COLD! Anybody with half a brain could do a better job at putting out food.  Are they TRYING to go out of business?This stuff was inedible.  The entire premises needed to be cleaned, the toilet doesnt flush properly. It was a complete disaster.  We will never step foot in that place again.  And as if this wasnt enough, the prices are astronomical. 17 dollars for the 2 fish tacos!  REALLY ? Do you think you are in New York?  Granted, If they had been good, I wouldnt feel like Id been assaulted, which is how I felt when I left that place! Someone call "Restaurant Impossible!" STAT.
