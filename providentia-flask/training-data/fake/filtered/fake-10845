After hearing and reading rave reviews about the Boil, I had the pleasure of dining there last night and it did NOT disappoint! They seated us promptly although the restaurant was crowded.  They provided us with bibs and plastic gloves, which was a thoughtful gesture on their part because eating the meal can be quite messy. We ordered Catfish basket, Chicken Fingers basket and Southern Fried Chicken Wings appetizers.  They were all good, but the Catfish basket was, "slap yo' mama good!"  They were lightly battered and fried to perfection!  They were light and melted in your mouth!!!  The Catfish basket appetizer was out of this world!  I definitely will order the Catfish basket as an appetizer from now on.  The Southern Fried Chicken Wings were okay.  They were soo hot, they should have come with a caution, "do not handle while hot!"  The fork used to eat the chicken wings with melted, yes you read right melted! I dined on 2 lbs. of the most succulent Snow Crab Legs with an ear of corn and new potatoes served in "the Boil Special" sauce (a combination of garlic butter, Old Bay and Lemon Pepper sauces).  The sauce is thick and quite tasty.  My son dined on the combo of 1 lb. each Crawfish and Shrimp.  He shared some of his meal with me; the Crawfish and Shrimp were excellent! If you are looking for an authentic seafood experience, the Boil is the place to go!  I highly recommend it!
