We went on a Sunday for the brunch buffet. I had seen this place many months ago when passing it by, but then completely forgot about it. Now time to actually go! It wasn't very crowded, considering that this place is HUGE. We got a spot on the second floor, calm and nice just like the rest of the place. The buffet was ok. Lots of different options to eat. It actually looked really fresh and nice for being a buffet. The wait staff was really nice from start to finish. Kept coming up to the second floor, taking orders for drinks and eggs. Overall really nice service. The bathroom was also spotless and beautiful. The food tasted just ok. Pretty whatever, nothing I would talk about a few days from now. Overall the food was what you can expect from a buffet. The vegetable scrambled egg I had though did not look tasty and was so bland I could no finish it. The french fries tasted unfinished. The tea had a weird after taste. Loved the selection of cheese, salmon, jams, olives and bread though! The egg salad was great. Would recommend this place for friends that is looking for a great brunch deal. Going for brunch can easily be a pricey story and here we got drinks / coffee / tea / juice / unlimited buffet for a set price of $24.99. After tax and tip it wasn't bad, considering the options of food offered. Would go back to do some work during the day. Would easily find a spot on the second floor due to the size of this place.
