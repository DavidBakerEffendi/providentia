The food was good, but the service was bad. Nothing came in order, no silverware until requested. This may be because we were sitting outside - but why have outdoor seating if you're not going to pay attention to them? (Particularly when no one is sitting inside.) I will hand it to them that the nachos are amazing, but I'll plan to sit inside and think twice before I come back again.
