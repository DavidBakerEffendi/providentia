This place is seriously fantastic. The only thing I can complain about is the insane wait, which is not there fault. Even after finally making it in from a two hour wait they were so apologetic, gave us a free flight of beer and a dessert beer at the end of the meal. The food, every single item, was incredible. I have to recommend the mussels and clams linguini because I devoured them both. The place was so friendly and the staff seemed to be genuinely happy to work there. On top of it all they give you a free slice of cake that they are constantly baking fresh. I sure will be waiting for two hours again.
