The one star is for the bread. This restaurant missed the mark on so many levels, but I'll highlight what bothered me most. Â I left there feeling "buyer's remorse" and that is an awful feeling to have leaving an eatery. I ordered their seafood rice, because I love seafood, and it looked appetizing. What I got was a salt attack in every bite, unchewable seafood (really?), and service from someone who seemed to be the owner/manager that was rude, and unprofessional. They might have items on the menu that are enjoyable but I'll never know, and I don't want to know because I couldn't get out of there fast enough! I think that a business' goal above everything else, should be to make EVERY first time customer a repeat customer. I was profiled the second I sat down at the table and that is a HUGE problem. They all need to take classes in customer service, and the Chef maybe needs to taste everything before it leaves his kitchen. Maybe even have someone else taste it too. Yuck!!
