I've only been here for the open sangria bar brunches, but I've been enough times I think I've sampled half the menu. First of all, the open sangria bar: it's awesome. They offer around 6-8 different sangrias in pitchers and you go up and help yourself (after being carded at your table, that is). The only problem is the line sometimes gets a little long and sometimes they run out of glasses. So hold on to your glasses and be a little patient - it's unlimited free booze for christssake, calm down and wait three minutes. Secondly, the food: It's good, but not great. I can tell that's the case because, despite going to brunch here about once a month for the last 6 months, I can't really recall a single dish that I loved. But nothing was ever bad, save for the cachapa de salmon (though that could be just a bad ordering decision for me since eggs and salmon are not really my thing). Thirdly, taco dude: There's a guy who comes around dispensing taquitos out of a little cart with all kinds of fixings. I think it costs like $8 or so per order. Trust me on this: one order of taquitos per every 2-3 people is more than enough, unless you want to get so full you feel like the baby alien from Alien is going to burst out of your tummy, and you're ok with that alien being made entirely of taquitos. Also really difficult to get a decent buzz going that way, even with free sangria. Lastly, desserts: If you are not so full you need to be rolled out of the restaurant just yet, the desserts are awesome, especially the bombas (South American donuts). Oh, I almost forgot about the bread. The yummy yummy bread and the delicious strawberry butter they give you with it. So, if you want to eat so much and drink so much you'll be full for days on $20 a person, Calle Ocho is your dream come true.
