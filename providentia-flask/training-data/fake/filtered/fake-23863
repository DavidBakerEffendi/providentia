I absolutely love Sazon.  The owners always stop by for a chat and treat you like a friend.  The arroz con pollo is one of my favorites, but sometimes I get something different.  I recently had a nice steak with cabbage salad and yucca with plenty of garlic.  Who knew a root veggie could taste this great?  The arepa with tofu and avocado sauce is my favorite appetizer.  I have always loved everything I have eaten here.  I am often too full for chocolate, but if you can save room.  Whether you try some truffles or the amazing hot chocolate, this is some of the best food in Philly!!!
