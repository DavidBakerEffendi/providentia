If I could have hot monkey sex on this pizza I would.  Its that good. The cheese melts heavenly into that thick, yet somehow crispy crust and then ladled with vine ripened goodness.   I'm one paragraph in and I'm drooling.   Of course, that which I described up there only happens 90% of the time.  I don't know what happens in that oven the other 10% but I leave there feeling cheated and depressed.  Its random too.  Never a specific day or time. I hope you too have the same odds, because its really good when its good.  So, so when its not.
