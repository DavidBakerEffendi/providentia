My wife and I frequently dine at Angelo's and have always received friendly and efficient service. The food has always been good. The only bad experience we had was NOT the fault of the staff but of an inconsiderate group who thought they could monopolize tables and staff in the tavern area. Many of the group sat at tables in the tavern area with only a drink. They gave no thought or care that they were keeping other diners from getting a table for a meal. Although I prefer the tavern atmosphere, the waitress sat us in the main dinning room, which was a blessing to get away from an obnoxious crowd, and we had a great dinner anyway. Â Keep up the good work.
