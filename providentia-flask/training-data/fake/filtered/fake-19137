Had dinner there last night.  As usual it was perfect! Bread and dipping sauce was fantastic to start the meal.  Veal parmigiana with penne and a house garden salad was perfect. Pasta primavera with chicken was also perfect.  The deserts and coffee finished off a great meal.  PS:  its a greast BYOB
