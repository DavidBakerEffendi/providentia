Very good New York Style Pizza.  Due to the history and the fact that every tourist knows about this place, expect to wait for a while and pay handsomely for your pizza, but it's definitely worth the wait.  Even with all the people in the restaurant, the layout is great as it doesn't have that busy touristy feel, and our service the other night was very good. IMHO, it's better than Grimaldi's in Brooklyn, but still not the best pizza in the city.
