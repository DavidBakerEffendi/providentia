One of my favorite pizza joints in South Philadelphia, if not one of my all time favorite pizza joints hands down.  This place has delicious, unique pizza toppings, and THE perfect crispy crust. The gaaahlic pizza is one of my favorites, not too overpowering and a delicious balance of mozzarella cheese and garlic pesto.  The heirloom caprese salad is fresh and just like they make it in Roma. A great menu, wonderful, intimate atmosphere, and a selection of Italian beers make this place a perfect, casual place to hang out with friends, coworkers, or even a date!
