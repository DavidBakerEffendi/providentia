Before coming to this place, I had been of the opinion that all servers in Philadelphia are rude, inattentive, and incapable.  Months ago, two friends and myself decided to give this place a try after having a few drinks elsewhere and being completely fed up with the service.  The decor was nothing special (as in typical pub/tavern) and I remember feeling a little out of place (many mid-30 men completely glued to some sports game).  Our waitress was amazing!  She was so friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and beers.  Out of the food we ordered, the avocado fries (avocado slices, breaded, then deep fried) were the best, absolutely to die for and have returned for them multiple times.  I find myself at Misconduct when no where else is sounding appealing, and have yet to regret the decision.
