Went there on a Friday night. Food was below average as was the service. Salad bar in pathetic. Servers seem confused about whose job was whose, and what table ordered what food. The place was only about one third full, but service was slow and unprofessional. Several people came in and saw the "Please Wait to be Seated" sign. No one even came to seat them. At one point, a waiter walked right past one couple and didn't even acknowledge their presence. Guess it wasn't his job. I had the pork sirloin which was dry and bland, son and daughter ordered Chicken Alfredo. The server finally presented the food and was confused that there were two Chicken Alfredo entrees at our table. Then it took another 15 min. just to get the second order. When it arrived, my 16 year old and 30 year old were disappointed in the dish. It was smothered in milk.The owner was there but seemed spaced in a world of her own. Live here but will not go back again. I don't think they'll be around much longer. Tourist season is not year round, and winters here are tough.
