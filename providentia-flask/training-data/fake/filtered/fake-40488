Tips for owners who write their own reviews..... 1) Don't write 3 five star reviews within a week of one another. 2) If you're going to create a "secret account" you need to pick a picture and write more than one review. 3) Don't mention everthing that you're attempting to push in 2 reviews, eg, great for groups, kids, handicapped access, church groups, mummers, etc. 4) Never mention " had the opportunity to try their newest items" flatbreads are so yesterday! 5) Take care of the critters in your basement. 6) Take your medicine, if you get bad reviews....accept them and improve. The worst lie is a lie to yourself. 7) If you"re going to do it, do it right! Have all of your employees write 10 reviews a day until you have almost 5 stars and so many great reviews that the poor ones are almost irrelevant.
