An experience of a lifetime, my favorite dining experience in New York City. Produce grown on a New York rooftop, wow! The beets with yogurt, kale salad and organic lemonade with vodka were all to die for. Fish of the day was excellent, all around an exceptional time! Will definitely be back on all of my New York visits!
