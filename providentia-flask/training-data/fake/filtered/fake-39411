Disappointment. The staff was at best unwelcoming and at worst incompetent. The wait, despite a reservation, was ridiculous, especially considering we had a wheelchair- bound person in our party. But that was perhaps the problem, as Opa clearly had no experience nor interest in accomodating the disabled. When we finally were seated, we heard the hostess apologize to the next table she sat that she was sorry for the wait which was due to issues with a handicapped customer. Passable food does not overcome such shoddy service or unfriendly atmosphere.
