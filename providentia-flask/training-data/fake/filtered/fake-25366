I've come to Cafe Habana for over 7 years, and was really disappointed today. Sadly another Â NY favorite is biting the dust: prices have gone up, quality down. I ordered the vegetable quesadilla today at lunch, and it looked like someone has warmed up a bag of frozen peas and corn and sprinkled a bit of cheese in. And a side of a few slices of avocado for 3.50, what a joke. Super slow uninterested service. Not the place I used to love.
