The coffee is great, the sandwiches are amazing, the treats are wonderful, the staff is friendly and on top of things, they're dog friendly and it's dripping personality from every corner.  I LOVE this place.  I am not vegan, I was never in the punk or metal scene and I've only ever been to an anarchist bookstore once in my life, but this place somehow manages to make me feel welcome.  I think a big part of that has to do with how much I get the sense that the staff cares about the place and its ideals.  It's like they're more than just a coffee shop.
