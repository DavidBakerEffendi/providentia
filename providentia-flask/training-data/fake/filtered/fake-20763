Arrived really early on a Friday night so we were able to get in without a reservation. So what if they are no longer BYOB - it's all about the food here, which is great. Our waiter was attentive even after the crowd spilled into the street. I love French food and have been to some of the "best" in NYC - now when I think of best I have to include this place.
