I'm on a very limited diet with a ton of food sensitivities and therefore, can rarely eat out. Hu Kitchen makes is easy for me to have flavorful food and so many options(!) Â Plus, the customer service is great. Delivery is always prompt. Can't sing their praises enough. Veggie breakfast burrito, rotisserie chicken, and butternut squash are a couple of personal faves. Their chocolate, quinoa, almond butter bar is AMAZING.
