It was pouring rain, and not many patrons at the restaurant... But the service was great, very attentive. One of the servers even made a special fruit drink for my husband since they ran out of lemonade. (BTW, their juices are great!). And last but not least, their food was great. Maybe a little over exaggerating because I never had Venezuelan food, but their special that night ( I forgot the name of it) was GOOOOOOOOOOD!
