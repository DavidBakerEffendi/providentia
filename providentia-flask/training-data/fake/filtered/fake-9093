I'd heard about this place from a friend, so I went for dinner w/my bf last night (Sun).  I'm sorry, but there are so many good places in the city and this is just NOT one of them.  The service was bad..not terrible, but more like skittish with a side of Harvard-grad wanna be.  The wings were ok.  His burger was ok.  It's hard to really put the vibe here into words, but I'll try.  It's both everywhere and nowhere at the same time.
