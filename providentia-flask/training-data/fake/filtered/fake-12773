Post Office Bar = the real deal. a serious whiskey list put together by what seem to be serious whiskey connoisseurs -- drinks ranging from the totally affordable up to "i'm gonna impress this girl i'm taking out by ordering a $15 glass of whiskey." my personal recommend: an Old Fashioned with the MIchter's bourbon -- $6 and so, so, so good. also, the food is outta control.  NEVER have i enjoyed deviled eggs and the deviled eggs with bacon were honestly one-a the best things i've ever tasted.  Oh and the borscht with pulled pork (i think that's what was in it?) was similarly mindblowing.  friends were fighting for spoonfuls of it.   and ALSO: they earn 10-gajillion points for pitch-perfect soundtracking.... Buddy Holly, The Everly Brothers, tracks I recognized from the Stand By Me soundtrack...just such a great/timeless vibe and so refreshing. waitress came by numerous times to check up and was totally friendly. anyhow, likeminded places nearby seem to be quite at ease charging $12 for cocktails -- but this place may just be the perfect antidote: classy atmosphere, high-end drinks and obscenely good food that doesn't fire death rays at your wallet. look for me every night of the summer, sitting by the open windows here, eating oysters, sipping Michter's and hi-fiving myself (ideally, friends will join me too.)
