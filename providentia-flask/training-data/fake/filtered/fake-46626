I work near Church St., and I usually end up eating lunch at Boloco at least a couple of times each week. It's my absolute favorite. I'm from So Cal, and I'm pretty picky about my burritos, but the ones at Boloco are fantastic. The ingredients are fresh and flavorful, the habanero salsa packs a very nice punch, and they have plenty of options if you're not into spicy food, too. The staff are great, very friendly, and always fun to chat with while my food is being made. Highly recommended.
