I was brought up in Europe in places like this. When it opened, it was great. Then they decided to let the Japanese tourists take over all the tables, two order one piece of cake and share and they drink tap water. Trying to look very 'gemutlich', they will sit reading an intelligent looking book and stay for a few hours while the line gathers round Central Park and the Austrian/Deutsch Maitre D doesn't want to appear rude and tell them to piss off. Went last week for dinner, after staying away for 6 months. The dinner menu has gone, the food was mediocre, they have half the service as previous and they ran out of Â Sacher Torte at 6p.m. !! Half a bottle of sour white wine was $29 but the water was free and we got to see a lot of Japanese sharing a piece of cake, drinking tap water , taking photos of their plates and looking very Austrian and serious. Bye Bye Sabarsky and I know Lauder is cheap but I would have thought he would draw the line at Strudel Kaput Cafe.
