I've eaten at Several Restaurants in the area and the Eat Rice, is by far the worst I have encountred.  Food was delivered cold and uncooked, creasy and tasteless.  Called about the problem and all they said they would deliver what was undercook in approx and hour.  I declined the offer, was unsure of the condition the re-order would arrive in.  Up visiting family from Florida, but the next time I'll be sure to make it Italian
