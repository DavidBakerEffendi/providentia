So many things went wrong that I'll just begin in chronological order. 1. Hot water for my chamomile tea was lukewarm. The tagless tea bag was brought to me with someone's bare hands. 2. The tables were sticky, there weren't enough place settings and I had to ask for food menus (keep in mind, I made a reservation and even arrived early...there was no reason for our table to not be set up properly). 3. In the group of 7, only 2 people enjoyed their meals (potato croquettes & chicken n waffles). My order of two eggs (over-easy) with bacon & homefries were terrible. The eggs were cooked over-hard, the bacon was simultaneously raw and charred and the homefries were the color of cardboard. 4. The fritatta of the day was so tiny and came with the same weird potatoes. 5. We had to ask for butter when 5 people had toast with their meals. They brought us one spindle of butter to share. 6. My father-in-law's chair slipped from beneath him and he fell on the floor (b/c the chairs were wobbly and the floor was dirty). The staff didn't try to do anything to compensate for this. 7. The staff didn't refill our water glasses. This was just the worst place.
