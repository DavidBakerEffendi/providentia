After a long absence and a mediocre  experience, tried Grant's again. Well, nothing has changed. They should spend   time training the waitstaff. Even Chili's staff know to take the drink order first. Bread without butter? Staff passing the table  without clearing away empty dishes? The food was good to v.good but little imagination in presentation.  Feel free to waste your money on bland service, dish rags for napkins, and placing your flatware on a sticky table top. My last visit for sure.
