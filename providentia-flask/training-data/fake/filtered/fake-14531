I ate at Osteria Procaccini last week and let me tell you, SIMPLY THE BEST PIZZA along with the rest of the menu!  I love the concept and location.  I have been following Tino since his days in the Kingston Mall.  I am so happy to see him out on his own and not in the shadows of his family.  He left his latest venture, Sotto and they had to convert to a sports bar.  All the best, Delorenzo's who??
