sketch a restaurant the size of a small bathroom with seating or perhaps "stooling" for six or seven people and there you have Prosperity Dumpling. So my advice is not to plan on eating there (although we did). It's all about takeout and sit down on a bench. The dumpling are very traditional and tasty just like my mom used to make in my youth. The price is what will have you going crazy. You'll be hard pressed to find something over 5 bucks and mostly everything is under 2 bucks. Basically you can stuff yourself and a friend and have leftovers for under ten dollars. The key is that the fried ones you get less of but they taste better on the spot, the boiled ones aren't as tasty (but still amazing) on the spot but taste progressively better as they cool off and you get at least double the amount. Have fun and enjoy this traditional meal in Chinatown!
