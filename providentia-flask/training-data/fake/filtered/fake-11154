Unbelievable attitude from the manager! Â Our friend showed up a little late to our table and the manager made a special point of coming over to her and saying it was not their policy to have addons and would not serve her. The fact that he singled her out was so classless. I expected more from this place. I was really excited to come too. Don't bother bringing big groups here as they are not the least bit accommodating.
