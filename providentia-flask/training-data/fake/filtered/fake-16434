I've been to four different Jackson hole locations, but this one is our home base. Recently we found out they delivered (through Grubhub) and the delivery was speedy (under 20 minutes... IN THE SNOW??? ON A BIKE???) and the food was the same quality it always is. Jackson Hole has a huge menu with a lot of choices, and all of it will probably be delicious and leave your stomach happy. This is the home of the super burger though, 100% pure I dont think I can finish this beef, always cooked to perfection. The chicken fingers parm was pretty good, and enough for two sittings. Best thing about getting it delivered though, is passing out on your own couch right after filling your stomach to full satisfaction.
