Went there specifically for the pizza as it was supposed to be half-price pizza night. Â When we arrived I said to my friend I don't see any signs for half-price pizza night. So we ordered our food sat outside (best part of the restaurant). She ordered the Margerity and I ordered the broccoli rabi. Ordered that arugula salad first (the greens were really tough) the salad itself was tasty. Neither one of us thought the pizza was so great it was nice and brown on the top and should have been crispy delicious on the bottom. It was really soggy. Mine not as bad as hers. We ordered three different kinds of ice cream that we could share. They used a melon baller for the dips. Then the check came and we noticed we were being charged full price for the pizza. The reason I knew about the half-price because I was on their emails. I thought that was for everyone. It said on the web-side which I did not pay attention to that there were three pizzas that night at half price. That was my fault but you had to give them the password on the web page to get them at half-price. What a childish game. Because my friend had ordered one of the three I said I thought she should give it to us half-price. She put on her attitude face and changed the bill. I don't know what they are gaining by playing this little game but I think it is totally unfair to the rest of their customers. It should be for everyone. From what I just read on their site I see Wednesday is 1/2 price on certain bottles of wine (didn't see any password for that). Don' t think I will be going back there soon unless they change their unfair policies. Their half-price nights should be for everyone not for just a select few. rose
