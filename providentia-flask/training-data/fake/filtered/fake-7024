Amazingly over-priced and not that great pizza.  If one is to pay that much for a personal pizza, it had better stand out.  Fails my test.  My wife's pie came with a hole charred in it; my friend's gluten free was like cardboard.  The bill for 2 pies, a salad, and a couple beers was $70!  You are way better off up the street at American Flatbread Hearth.
