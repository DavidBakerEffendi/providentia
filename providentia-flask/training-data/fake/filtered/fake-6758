Why would anyone serve frozen Burgers?  I feel in and environment were everything is getting more upscale and more gourmet why frozen?  I was eating there the other day and I got my burger and it was very rare on the inside and a little cold.  When I asked the server why he told me the burgers are frozen and it seems that the grill man didnt cook enough.  Thank you for your honesty however now I would never go back there.  The one star is for the fries.
