Sukhadia has the best Indian Gujarati sweets I've had in America. Their kajhukaathri and paandas were delicious! My aunt (from Boston) even ordered the paandas in bulk for a family event and she said the process was very easy. She also got a good discount. Sukhadia's Punjabi samosas are VERY tasty. They are a decent size too so you're getting your money's worth. If you are on Oak Tree Road, I definitely recommend Sukhadia.
