Tried so hard to like the place given the many positive reviews. My wife and I took our young son after just landing in the city from Toronto, and were hoping for a quick and nice meal. First major issue, our noodles took more than half an hour to come AFTER our appetizers of spicy cucumber and fried chicken were finished. We were greeted by a half mumbled apology. Second mistake was the waitress made a mistake on my order and gave me the warm soba without pork. Rather than offer to take the bowl away and add the pork, they offered to add the pork in a side dish. This took 10 minutes, by which time my noodles were cold and my 6 month old was screaming. Overpriced and underwhelming. Better places to go... Ignore the hype, especially if you're used to better service.
