We left without even getting our food, the service was that bad! We had mentioned to several employees (owner, hostess?, server) that we were on a tight timeline, and we waited 45 minutes for food that never came out. I know it's tough to control when food comes out, but 45 minutes is a really long time to not get your food and almost miss your show. The server was either overworked or just didn't care, and when the owner came over to apologize, he didn't offer to try to expedite our order; he just kept repeating that he was sorry it was taking so long. Listen, I get it: too few servers, small kitchen, huge outdoor area with drinkers and eaters to tend to. But you know what? if you don't have the capacity to serve all those people in a timely fashion, don't open up so much space for business!
