Don't eat here! They serve warm bread customary with a blend of oil and herbs, sounds good except for the ants crawling around on my plate. The serving counter was infested with them. I Had a chance to see inside the back kitchen it was filthy!! The service was okay, except for the owner who to me was a bit crass. When told about the ants she offered a replacement and to comp the meal but didn't seem like she really cared about the cleanliness of the place. They merely wiped down the counter and continued to serve the ant infested oil blend to other customers. I didn't stay to finish a meal and wouldn't eat here. Definitely Â wouldn't recommend it.
