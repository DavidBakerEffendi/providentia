BEST Chinese food I've ever had.  Was visiting the east coast, a college friend recommended this place, and I couldn't be happier. GREAT place for spicy or non-spice eaters.  My family only likes a little hint of spice.  Our server at the bar was very helpful in guiding us which dish to get and what spice level (1-10) to select.  We had the famous Dan Dan Noodles at 3-level spice. It was a tad-bit too much spice, but manageable.  Very delicious noodles nonetheless.  We also had the Kung Pau Chicken and a beef dish, both at 3-level spice and they turned out PERFECT.   Fantastic taste, fast service, courteous education of their menu and cooking-style.  It's worth the wait and worth the noise level.  If you're in Philly, DO NOT forget to eat at Han Dynasty!  Living on the west coast, I was happy to hear from their lady supervisor that the business is planning to expand to San Francisco and Los Angeles!
