Stumbled on this gem when I saw a long line and a "cash only" sign. I'm so glad I did. I ordered the peppercorn catfish b/c I'm a Southern boy and decided to see what Num Pang would do. WOW! I could've eaten three of these. I also tried the skirt steak that my friend ordered and was equally impressed. Every part of the sandwich...fresh bread, cucumber, pickled carrots, chili mayo....was delicious and I washed it down with the tart blood orange lemonade. My only regret is that I didn't know how good this place was or I would've also ordered the pulled pork and the ginger barbecue brisket and the hoisin meatballs.
