I went in for an early lunch, so I missed the rush but I could definitely see a big wait here. I ordered the eggplant and enoki steamed buns not sure if I would like them, but they are one of the most heavenly things I have every tasked, the vegetables are lightly fried and covered in a sticky, spicy, sweet sauce. It has a piece of iceberg lettuce which adds a nice textural component to the softest lightest buns in the shape of a taco you've ever had. Also the ramen was amazing, I topped it with a soft boiled egg. You need to have the ipudo nigori sake, it's an absolute must. This place is fun atmosphere with everyone shouting japanese phrases whenever food is ready or a customer arrives. Will be going back as soon as possible.
