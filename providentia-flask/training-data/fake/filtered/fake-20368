I seriously hesitate to share how awesome this place is, it's the type of secret place you might just want to keep to yourself. Delicious food, amazing atmosphere, the perfect place to have a cozy group dinner in a special atmosphere (I am speaking of course of the Grandma's Living Room loft mentioned in an earlier review). I've been there twice now and am amazed at the good hearted staff/family who run it. What great people!! Perfect for late evenings eating baklava, drinking coffee, and sharing hookah.
