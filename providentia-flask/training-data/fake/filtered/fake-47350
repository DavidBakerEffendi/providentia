I had driven past this place a number of times on my way home from work and I thought it looked like a nice place to take my girl.  So, a couple of weeks ago I brought my girlfriend out on a Saturday and we really enjoyed the ambiance with the jazz music.  Everything was great and I had really high expectations as we placed our order.  I should say,  our waitress was was great; she was attentive and very nice.  The problem was the food.  It was absolute garbage.  The bread was stale, the food was luke warm, and the prices were way to high for the slop they served.  I have a grandmother from England that made a better sauce than what this chef tried to pass off as "Homemade bolognese."  I know you don't know my grandmother, but she isn't known for her culinary prowess... she is very English.  I took a few bites, and moved the mush around on my plate.  When I realized my girlfriend was just picking at her salmon I asked if she liked it, her response was "do you want to order a pie and we'll just take it home."  I really wish I read these reviews before I went.  Don't go here... there are so many better places just around the corner.
