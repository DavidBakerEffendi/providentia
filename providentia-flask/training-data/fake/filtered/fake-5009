I was at BCD on tuesday and it was my second time there. I don't know why my post is not shown on the website but I'm gonna post it again anyway. I wasn't satisfied with food this time compare to my last visit. I ordered "very hot" on my Soodubu but it was not spicy at all and yellow croaker was not fresh. It literally smelled fishy. I think soodubu smelled fishy this time as well. I understand it was super hectic and crowded last night but i was little bit disappointed with their food since i really enjoyed it last time. Service was pretty great. It was a guy and a same girl from last time. Both of them were very nice although she did not remember me. I was with my Japanese friends this time again and while i was gone to the bathroom (though her Japanese was not super fluent) she helped my friends choosing menu in Japanese and was being very friendly. The other guy was also very friendly and nice. We did not make any gesture but he came to us whenever we needed something. I really appreciate that he took care of us although the house was full of people and packed. Also, food came out bit late but the girl explained the fair reason and apologized. I really appreciated that too. Overall, i really like BCD Tofu House. I was just little bit disappointed with their food this time but hopefully it will be better next time i visit them. Other than that great service, wish the music was something different; one that is not too noisy. It would be better if they weren't fully packed. You guys should totally visit them on "unpacked" day.
