This place seems to have worked out most of the kinks that plagued their opening, such as closing in the middle of lunch prime time because they ran out of meat.  Now, months later, I finally made another visit due to an extreme burger craving.  The burger definitely hit the spot, but the experience was almost ruined by the fries.  Not sure why I'm reading so many rave reviews for the truffle fries because mine were so greasy and salty that I needed my milkshake constantly.  I still ate the fries, mind you, but I feel I may regret it later.  I was trying to give them their due because of the rave about them and I'd never had truffle fries before, but the salt and oil made it too hard to distinguish any significant difference from regular fries.  I think the shake could've used a bit more strawberry also, because it often tasted plain with just hints of strawberry, although that may have been the result of the salty-ass fries.  Oh, and $12.50 plus tax for a cheddar cheeseburger, truffle fries and a shake?  I dunno... it's really just a step above typical fast food, maybe two steps actually, so the price is about right for the location.   While I'm not an aficionado, I do get the occasional craving and have had my share of good burgers.  I didn't expect it to be as pink as it was inside when I ordered medium but it was juicy and tasty.  I may go back to give them another chance to get the fries right, but the burger was on point.  The portions were just right too.  Just the right amount of fries, over a quarter pound of meat and a good size shake (maybe 16oz?).  If you don't get the combo, the burger alone might be a bit underwhelming at glance but I think American portions are too big anyways generally.  I'm 6 feet tall, 190lbs and I was full after the combo, without getting the "itis." Bottom line:  a decent burger joint.
