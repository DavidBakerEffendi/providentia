I had an amazing meal here, on Valentine's day no less--even though they don't take reservations and they were totally slammed, our server never rushed us and gave us the perfect amount of attention--and his wine recommendation was spot on. I loved every single bite I tried, from the oyster with mignonette to the pate with a perfect little root salad on the side, to the sustainable monk fish cheeks with plump golden raisins...this is a meal worth the price tag and perfect for a special occasion.
