Nice place if you go during the day or on Sat/Sun afternoon, nights are mobbed and claustrophobic.  Afternoon are nice and relaxing, the salads, and steak are all very good. Here's my one real problem with the place- they can't pour a proper Guinness.  This has been going on for years- straight down the middle of the glass.  It's embarrassing for an "Irish" bar and ruins the pint.  Having said that, Tierney's is even worse.
