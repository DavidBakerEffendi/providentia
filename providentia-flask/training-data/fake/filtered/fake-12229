Very bland and over-priced.  Won-ton soup had less flavor than most, and when i asked if they had any hot mustard to liven up the flavor, I was told they don't have any.  Mu shi pork was flavorless with spongy pancakes.  Chicken with garlic sauce consisted of chicken and celery strips with a few carrot strips.  Where were the other vegetables?  Overall, very disapointing.  Totally over rated
