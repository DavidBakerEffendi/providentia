As an employee of Peaches I have to stand up for my place of employment (and not just because they pay me lol). I honestly believe that we are one of the best Southern restaurants around. Especially in a neighborhood where decent food is hard to find. Those chefs work unrealistically hard day in and day out to ensure that the food is on point! They are there way before anybody else is and they leave waaaaaay after everybody else, preparing, cooking, cleaning. As far as service is concerned we do the best we can and I must say we do a pretty good job. We have come a long way from the wet-behind the ears kids who walked in with resumes in hand and applications attached. We are now well equipped to handle almost any situation thrown in our direction and have proved so time and time again. Under the watchful eyes of Craig, Ben and Kristen we are held responsible for all of our actions and if you have a bad time we hear about it and do everything in our power to ensure that it never happens again. So for those of you that have continued to show us love and support and have watched us grow...THANK YOU AND COME AGAIN!!! For those of you who tried us once and haven't been back since...YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE MISSING!! YOU DEFINITELY WANT TO COME BACK AND TRY AGAIN. I want to thank Craig and Ben for giving me the opportunity to be apart of a growing greatness right in my own neighborhood. And Kristen for all her hard work as the amazing manager that she is (especially when we try her patience). I love working at Peaches and when I'm not working I love eating at Peaches (ask anybody I'm there so much they never know if I'm working or not lol). I love my regulars who know me by name, the new customers who will soon become regulars and the customers who read this and stop on by. Thank You (I just thought something needed to be said) P.S. - We have our liquor license now!!
