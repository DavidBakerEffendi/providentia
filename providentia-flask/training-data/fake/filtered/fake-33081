I have been to Hinge on many occasions and have always enjoyed their food, although the wait is sometimes long I figured it was worth the wait. I will never go back again after today however, as they turned us away for Mother's Day at 9 am. Apparently 'forgetting' that they told us over a week ago that it would not be a problem to accommodate us even though they would not take a reservation for a party of our size. To add insult to injury they were not even concerned and barely apologetic.
