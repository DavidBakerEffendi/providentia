Heard great things about Pepe's; ordered a specialty pizza for take out. The pizza was good nothing that spectacular. Im rating it a two because my initial impression was they were stuck up and rude. There is a sign on the door that says "wait to be seated" but there is no hostess there. Your expected to know to wait outside on the benches. They are very strict about take out orders as well. I ordered and then I could wait outside for 15 mins, but I just sat in my car. When I got home the pizza crust was burned all the way around, I mean blackened!!! I love crust, but not totally burned crust. They cook it in a wood burning stove so I expected the edges to be crispy. When I called the man who answered the phone was very polite and said he could make another pizza or me "lightly cooked" or put me on the list for another time. Then the manager got on and told me that was their signature and didn't want to give me another pizza because I didn't like their pizza. He was pretty rude and I will not be going back there especially with the 100 million other pizza joints in New Haven. There were five on the same street.
