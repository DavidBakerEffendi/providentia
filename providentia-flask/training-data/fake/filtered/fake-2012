food was AMAZING - literally we all couldn't get enough.  The service was HORRENDOUS.  We watched our very rude waitress (Bernadette) take forever with our meals and check - and never offered us refills.  When we asked if we could change a drink order she rudely replied that it was already put in and walked away - didn't even offer to change it. We watched her act the same way with another outdoor table the day we were there.  She ruined our experience - but again the food was so great we are willing to come back.
