Went there dinner for two.  The wait was about an hour around 8pm.  They had lots of empty seats and seemed to be bringing ppl over from the bar next door?  The food was a low point.  Ordered tagli... Seafood pasta it didn't have all that seafood in it as I've read on yelp.  The noodles were strange tasting. Even upon ordering they ran out of clams and said they will be replaced with mussels.  A cheap shot move IMO.  The other dish was the gnocchi.  For me it was horrible.  The potato noodles were green balls and a bland white cream sauce.  Biting into one revealed threads of dust??  Are they hand making these with cotton gloves?  I just manned up.  The glass of water had a bug on the bottom which I wasn't man enough to do.  The portions are small as hhell and I'm about 180lbs.  Service was horrid.  The place is loud and crowded which is good for certain occasions but not all.  I was so unimpressed by my experience I don't understand the hype and why this restaurant keeps popping up first on the long lists at yelp.  Go here for a loud crowded place that seats about 30.
