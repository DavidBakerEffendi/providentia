Did not have a good experience.Service was pathetic .The guy taking the order was not friendly and had an attitude.It took more than 40 mins to serve the food.Food was notthing great...not worth the price.We were charged for an order that was cancelled earlier...we realised it only after we left the restaurant.Overall was not satisfied. Doubt we will ever go there again.
