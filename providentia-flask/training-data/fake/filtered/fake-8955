Always go for the classic, #9 Monster, lemongrass chicken, or the pork. Can't go wrong with any of them. Super flavorful, nice pickled carrots and daikon, great sandwich sauce, and crisp fresh cucumbers. Try it with a sunny side egg cooked to your liking (runny, medium, well done). The sandwiches are so good that they are even better the day after absorbing all the sauce and flavors.
