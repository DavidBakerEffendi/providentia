After a long day of work and grad school, I often crave for food that can help relieve some of the stress I go through. Dim sum is one of those food. Sakura may not have a huge dim sum selection, but their Xiao Long Bao (shanghai soup dumplings) meets my demands. Their staff are extremely friendly and attentive. The bright green restaurant is really clean -- it's almost as if I have forgotten that I was still in Chinatown. Co-owner, Jay, still served me even past their 10pm closing time on a Monday. I grew up in Philly and have seen many restaurants fade away at this location. I hope to see Sakura stay much longer! Sakura serves authentic Chinese and Japanese cuisine. Aside from the Chinese dishes, don't forget to try out their sushi. A must visit if you're in Chinatown for some grub. When I'm really hungry, I would order two Xiao Long Bao dishes, and a Pork Shoulder dish. Affordable pricing, good food, and friendly staff -- it's a no-brainer.
