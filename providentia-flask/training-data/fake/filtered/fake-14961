I love this place. Their Cuban sandwiches are great. When i use to go out this was definitely the grub spot. It is 24 hours. Their banana milk shake is to die for lol. The employees are nice. My other favorite thing here is their salchi papa ans off course their pink sauce. I make my own at home but it doesn't beat the one from banana king!!!! Looking for a quick grub after some drinks this is rhe place.
