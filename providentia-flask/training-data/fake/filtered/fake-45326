My wife and I were visiting from out of town and our son suggested Rizzuto's as a dinner destination. We showed up on Saturday night without reservations and were told to expect a 60 - 75 minute wait for a table. That's not unusual, I suppose. What happened next is. The maitre d' noticed our disappointment. Within minutes he came over to us and offered some alternatives: a table in the bar area, perhaps a no-show on an existing reservation that he would hold for us. Well, we decided to wait. And we are so glad we did. We were seated within 35 minutes of our arrival. The courtesy and professionalism of the maitre d' continued with the hostess and the server staff. Our meals were simply but beautifully presented and all were delicious, from the appetizers through dessert. There was a delay in the dessert arrival but the server recognized and handled it, quite professionally and to our satisfaction, before we registered any complaint. In all, it was a wonderful evening that we were talking about for days afterward. We can't wait for a return visit.
