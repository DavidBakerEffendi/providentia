Enjoyed a fun evening at the Anchored Inn last week.  They are now serving food, which I had for the first time and was impressed.  I highly recommend their Torta as their all-around best item, and if you have a favorite hot-dog joint out there, you have to try this one, because it might just be your new #1.  The jalapenos make this hotdog truly unique.   Add the new delicious food to the upbeat atmosphere and you have yourself a winner.
