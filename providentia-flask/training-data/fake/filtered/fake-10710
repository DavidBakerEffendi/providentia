I had dinner with my friends and we ordered Papaya Salad with salty fish ( Pla Ra), regular Papaya Salad, grilled pork, Pork ribs Tom Sabb, Crispy prok pad ped and all food tasted better than any from those Thai restaurants in NYC. Â The waiters are very friendly and the decors remind me Eastern of Thailand. Highly recommended.
