The search is over... we finally found the best pizzaria ever. The Black Oven Pizza in Little Falls! It was Love on the first bite. Here is my story. I have a cousin who visit 3-4 times from Virginia. The routine is she drives seven hour, once she reaches me she beeps the horn on her car then I take her to a pizza place.   I've  searched  and searched  for many year's, AND finally got it right. If I could rate this place 10 stars I would. It's clean, cozy, staff are pleasant. Checking to see if we need water or anything else. The presentation was as good as there service. We felt like family. EXELLENT
