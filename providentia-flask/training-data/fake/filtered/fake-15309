It's so hard to chose one restaurant when coming to the city from SJ. We went on a recommendation from a friend and are so happy we did. Everything from start to finish was amazing. Greeting from friendly staff great explanation from the server being that we've never been to the restaurant before. And the food was unbelievable. I am a total foodie and was blown away by this menu. As I said it's hard to choose and I don't get to the city frequently but I would make a trip to go back and try more things on this menu.
