Totally agree with Alan t. This place has really no sense, it was messy and not organized The only good thing is beer over there but its very expensive, the food was really awful, over salted, the atmosphere was so so, but it was busy, very loud. Service was inattentive and the manager didn't help and was rude to us. I won't go back to this place.
