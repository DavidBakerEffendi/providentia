I generally go here for their jalebis.But this time wanted to try their restaurant food.We ordered for chole bhature ,sev khamani Â and lassi. Chole bhature the poori was so thick and it had a strong smell of something not sure wat it was.I think it should be something they add to make the poori puff up and fluffy.the sev khamani was the worst fully oily was not able to eat at all .Lassi was not served at all even untill we finished our food.when we asked twice or thrice for it they still din bring it.Then we decided to cancel it.when told the person who took our order she was not ready to listen at all and she ran to the kitchen to bring but dint turn back for a long time.at last v got it and had it and came.Very worst experience.No professionalism for the staff in the restaurant.
