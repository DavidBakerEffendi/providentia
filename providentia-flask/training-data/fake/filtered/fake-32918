Used to like their pizza.  They delivered the wrong thing knowingly making substitutions I didn't want or to pay for.  Bad customer service to make up for their wrong doing and mistake.  Sent another pizza in ever worse condition, I'm positive with vindictiveness for complaining about their mistake for the first.  I refused both, shoved them back at the delivery person and told them not to charge my card.  When I came to my front door later I found that the delivery person smashed the sloppy pizza all over my doorstep and welcome mat, ruining them both.  People who operate in life like this have no BUSINESS owning and running a BUSINESS.  Filing with BBB and Consumer Affairs and taking them to small claims to get money back for pizza I didn't receive and the property they damaged.
