I am extremely happy to have visited such an amazing restaurant. Not only was the service great but everything we ordered from appetizers to dessert was exquisite. It was my first time there as well as my first date with my significant other and it was the best place we had ever visited hands down. The enviornment was beautiful, classy, romantic and if your into jazz then you will enjoy it themore, that was the cherry on top! We had spinach dip for appetizer, first entree was spicy tuna roll sushi and another tuna sushi with a japanese name. Second entree was Filet mignon with mashed potatoes and brocolli and crab cakes with cole slaw and french fries. Dessert was the apple pecan pie, which was so delicious! Anywho, I loved the waiter, the food, the food presentation and the enviornment. We will definately go back.
