Arrived excited to have our first Venezuelan meal ever. After 10 minutes, we could not wait to leave. Horrible service! Arrogant. Obnoxious. Uncaring. That's got to be going into the food. And yes, it is: scorching 'hot pockets', dry rice and overcooked Â tasteless plantain sandwich that was a cardiac arrest in a paper wrapping. ugh And have you noticed the review here by Desiree? It has to be written by someone who works there! Read the tone and the nastiness of the reviewer? The stuff about customers having a fat ass, needing to hit the gym, or waiters not being your slaves? That energy in the writing is exactly the energy that you feel when you eat there.
