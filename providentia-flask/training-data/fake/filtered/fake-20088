I live in West Hartford and it boasts to have many restaurants from casual to more formal from which to choose from.  One of my favorite spots to eat is Effie's Place on Park Rd. and I have to say I have never been disappointed with the food.  I love it that you can get breakfast anytime of the day. I do go there frequently with friends for lunch and love the friendly staff and find the service to be prompt and attentive. I have  had delicious dinners there with my family also, and you can feel quite comfortable if you have little ones too. One of my favorite things about Effie's is their homemade desserts, try the coconut cream pie! Give it a try, you won't be disappointed.
