I'm very very disappointed in Sanford right now.. I have been there plenty of times.. Even b4 they became high class. When they were just a 24 hour diner. I know the owner gus for many year and I have to say this was the one time I have had a complaint and I WILL never go back.. I waited 25 min for a table and that's fine but them when I sat down to order the waitress had a nasty attitude.. I asked for the stir fried chicken teriyaki dish but instead of chicken make it calamari.. She said they were no changing what's on the menu they r just too busy..when I asked for the manager he refused to come over so now u lost me as a customer. People let's be real we wait just like everyone else to sit in there and calamari is easier to make over chicken.. I would know my family is in the food business in manhattan. U give the clients what they want or u don't get business. I had this dish there plenty of times and it was more packed then tonight ..
