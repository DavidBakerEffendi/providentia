A friend took me the 2nd night they were open for business after he'd eaten lunch there that same day and was eager to return. The decor is sort of a "hip meets elegant," the service enthusiastic, but the really big deal is Chef Edwin's food. We ordered the "4 course chef's tasting menu," and it was sublime, probably one of the 10 best meals I've had in my 30 years in Manhattan, Do yourself a favor and go now while tables are easy to get; in a month or two after it gets discovered I suspect it will become more difficult to get a reservation.
