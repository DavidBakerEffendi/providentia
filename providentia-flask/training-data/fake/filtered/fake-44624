My friends and I wanted to check this place out in tribeca, it had been years since I'd been in this area.  My favorite dishes were the sheep's milk ricotta, the lamb sliders, the grandmother's ravioli, and the rice custard gelato for dessert.  The two dishes that weren't great, the arugula-prosciutto salad (though it came out stacked high, the arugula was wilted and lifeless on the plate, the few slices of prosciutto and figs were on the weak side, bland and tasteless?) and the chicken for two (slightly undercooked), I've had better chicken elsewhere.  Be prepared to spend more than you expected to.  I don't have a strong desire to return to this restaurant, however, I would if my friends wanted to go.
