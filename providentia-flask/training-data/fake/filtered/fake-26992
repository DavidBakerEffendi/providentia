Words can't describe how we love Roman's Special Pizza. Granted, we have been living in Asia for the past four years, Â sampling some of the world's best food but never a decent pizza, but I thnk this is my favorite pizza anywhere anytime. On our last nght in Princeton we bought a Jumbo to freeze and take with us. Oh, and my husband loves their wings, though that's not my thng.
