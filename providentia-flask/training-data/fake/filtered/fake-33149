Ming Choo...makes a most delicious Hot and Sour Soup.  Try it, you will love it.  They always deliver, in a very short time.  I love all their shrimp dishes, and their Beef and Broccoli is also, very good.  They are very friendly and courteous..  I still have to try all their Szechuan entrees, but as I said, do try their Hot and Sour Soup!  IT IS SOoooo Good.           Carol H.
