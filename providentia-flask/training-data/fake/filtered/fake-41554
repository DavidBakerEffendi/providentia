My sister introduced me to this place.  She loves raw clams, and I wasn't so sure if I would like the place since I don't eat raw clams.  Although, I'd have to say, $6 for 6 oysters or clams + beer is a pretty sweet deal.  My sister ordered two of those specials, and I just skipped straight to the lobster entree.  It was 24 bucks for a 1 1/4 lb lobster with corn on the cob, steamers and french fries.  The food was good and the atmosphere was great. However, The service is not so great. The wait for the table can be insanely long. This place is always busy.
