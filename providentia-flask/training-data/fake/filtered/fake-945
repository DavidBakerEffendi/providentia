Soul de Cuba is the perfect venue for a variety of occasions.  I've taken every friend or acquaintance here who's visiting from out of town, and they've always been impressed.  The setting is intimate and friendly; the background music is fun/zesty; the servers are extremely personable and are of various ethnicities--they've all got interesting life stories and they're the best part about the restaurant.  I think what's really special about this place is that you can develop a relationship over time to the restaurant.  I love sitting at the bar to chat--it's very cozy and protected from the street view.  They've had many celebrities coming through there in the recent years and are especially discrete on that regard.   The food is delicious.  The lunch sandwiches (tilapia, cubano, steak/onions, eggplant) are amazing, appropriately priced, and in generous portions.  They usually have special brunches on weekends.  Dinners are fantastic (LOVE the oxtail, the soul de cuba, the appetizers).  They make a really mean mojito as well as sangria.  Is it authentic?  The recipes descend from the owner's family in cuba--they vastly improved the original recipes and are always experimenting with new dishes.  They make their own sauces and receive requests from CUBA for shipments.   Love this place.
