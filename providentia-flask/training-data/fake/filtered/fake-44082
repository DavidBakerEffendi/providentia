This is hands down one of my favorite places in Hartford to eat. It has a real authentic vibe and transports you to another place. I love that service is a little slow, its a little too warm in the summer and you eat with your hands. To start they have a variety of Ethiopian beers to try. Meta is my favorite. All the dishes are served on injera, a flat bread with a tangy flavor and spongy texture. It does a fabulous job of soaking up the lentils and sauces that come with your meal and is downright delicious. Rip off a piece and use it as your utensil. Each dish has a wonderful spicy, acidic, salty and sweet quality to it. There never seems to be more than 2 or 3 employees in the whole joint at a given time and they always seem eager to chat and share their food. Although this is probably what leads to slower service. As others have mentioned, this is probably not an ideal spot for a large group. Parking can also be a bit of an issue depending on when you go. No lot. You will be on the street somewhere.
