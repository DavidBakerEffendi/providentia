My husband and I use to go to John Henrys when it was in Trenton. It was my Father in laws birthday and I raved about the food wanted to bring him when I called for a reservation I was crushed to find out they were no longer there. One day I googled John Henry's trenton to see if they had moved and to my suprise I found The Stone Terrace in Hamilton (By John Henry's). When we pulled up it looked amazing. When my husband made the reservation for my birthday he inquired about the dress code and it was casual.The resturant entrance was a little hard to find it is located on the Side by the Anthony banquet room. The service was great our food was fantastic. The place was packed as well as a wedding going on in one of there banquet rooms. We will be going back for sure and I would also consider them if I was ever in need of a banquet room.
