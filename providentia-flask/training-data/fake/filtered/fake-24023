This place is my favorite after-work bar.  They have a vast selection of beers on tap (including some great seasonal choices), the food is delicious, and the downstairs lounge has an extensive whiskey selection.  However, it's the staff that really make this place top-notch.  Erin, the owner, is very personable and always ensures patrons are enjoying their visit. While Paula, Richie and Erica, are all very professional, and by far the most attentive, knowledgeable and charming bar staff in the neighborhood.  If you're in TriBeCa you won't regret stopping in for a pint.
