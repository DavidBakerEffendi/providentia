We popped in at 715pm on a Friday night-Elixir was packed but we were very lucky to get seated - wonderful table with a couch and arm chair!!! SO comfortable. The host, Skip, was very accommodating and friendly-he recognized my daughter's boarding school from her sweatshirt! The food was SO good-everything was just done to perfection! Wonderful wine menu and desserts! Great atmosphere-great food! I will definitely go again on my way to Burlington!
