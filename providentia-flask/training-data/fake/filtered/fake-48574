Remember learning about clouds in elementary school? And there were the incredibly fluffy ones? The pita bread at Bedouin Tent is basically a Cumulus humilis cloud. Unbelievably fresh, the food at Bedouin Tent is undeniably the best middle eastern food I've had outside of Israel. And if it were socially acceptable to stand up in the middle of a restaurant and applaud, I would totally do it. Price wise, it's very reasonable and even bordering on cheap (New York cheap not legit cheap.) Also, a great place for vegetarians. So many options, there is no need to be that guy who orders the chicken salad without the chicken.
