This place has great bread. Â A little pricey but worth every cent. Very friendly staff will stuff you up with generous samples the second you walk in! I think the staff here really takes pride in their product and makes some amazing items! ask whoever is working what they like the best . . for me the Santa Fe Cornbread please :)
