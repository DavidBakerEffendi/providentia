on way back home from New England, we had to go to Philly, and we stopped in here to check it out. Very cool place, very Philly. If you are not familiar with Philly, it is fast paced, the people are on the go, and you have to keep up. This place is no different! We snacked on food from a bunch of places, can't remember the names, but I do remember a pork sandwich with kolerabi (spelling?) that was really good. I think is was Dinic's? I would stop there and get one definitely. The people were nice, not like what you hear about (of course we were not at a football game so I am sure they are different there). We did not get any produce or meats or anything like that. It seems like the groceries were pretty fresh, with that many people in and out, they must move food fast. If we lived there, I would know more, but as a tourist had no need. Stuck with the meals. Cool place, a must stop if you are in Philly
