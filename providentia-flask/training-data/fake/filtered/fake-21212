Very excited to try a new place in the neighborhood, the d√©cor and vibe was perfect for a Friday night dinner with friends. The food was phenomenal! One could complain about the portion size but mainly because it tasted so good and you wanted more, but on the bright side that left room for dessert. The funnel cake was amazing and even though I am generally not a cheesecake fan, I would highly recommend it and go back for it again
