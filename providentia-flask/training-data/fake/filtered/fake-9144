In summary, this place is rad. The food was great, the service was pleasant, the drink selection was fun, and the bad reviewers seem to have forgotten that this is a restaurant. Restaurants sometimes get things wrong, due to the humans that work there and run them. We had the P.E.I mussels in a beautiful light tomato-and-spinach enhanced garlic broth with perfect grilled bread for dipping. The bread was light, the mussels were lightly flavored and delicious, and it was a perfect appetizer to have before cheesy mac. Our server recommended a local organic beer that was awesome. I had a Vinho Verde with the mussels. Bonus points for having a Vinho Verde on the list in addition to the regular Sauv Blanc and Pinot Grigio. This is a gourmet macaroni and cheese restaurant. We go here for a certain type of food - satisfying, quality ingredients.  Anyone who comes in expecting a gruyere-veneered  homemade conchiglie with pork belly has a problem reading the "comfort food with a twist" tagline for the restaurant. You will get an awesome, cheesy pasta meal with some good quality accoutrements for a reasonable price at Our House. If you want fake service and pretentious, overpriced food, go to Church Street. This is a fun, delicious restaurant with a good atmosphere. They have Caprese Mac and Cheese and Lobster Mac. Go here for dinner!
