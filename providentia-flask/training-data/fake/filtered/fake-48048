I used to go there regularly for brunch.  But quality of food lately has been quite bad.  After waiting 45 minutes for a table when we were told the wait time would only be 20 minutes, we gave up and seated ourselves at the bar.   Potato waffles were cooked in dirty oil that was way overdue for a change and the eggs were dry and not seasoned.
