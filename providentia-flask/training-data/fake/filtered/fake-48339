After hearing about this place for years, I wanted to check it out.  I've got to say that this was one of the more disappointing experiences I've ever had.  The sandwich was cold, bread was stale and worst of all, the meat had no flavor.  I'm from Chicago, and I'll take an Italian Beef any  day of the week over this mess at Pat's.
