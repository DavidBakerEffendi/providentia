I just bumped in this little place, very nice and familiar. I had lunch with fresh pasta which was amazing italian and "homemade", and a special salad. Greens were really fresh and tasty and the combination with chicken and balsamic was perfect. I didn't tried the panini and other dishes, but everything seemed to be really good food. The atmosphere was relaxing and people very nice, Â just what I wanted for my lunch in between the metropolitan traffic. On my opinion: 5 STARS!!!
