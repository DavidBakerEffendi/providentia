We had dinner there on Â February2nd. The food was fair and the service was terrible!! Our waiter took our order, never followed up to see how the food was or if we needed anything else. When we asked for another drink or lemon and ketchup, we were told we needed to see our waiter...he was in another room and when he finally came out he was annoyed when we asked for lemon for our seafood. There were many additional staff, standing around doing nothing, and they did not offer to help. I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone, and I will not return!!
