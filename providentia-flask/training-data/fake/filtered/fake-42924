I am an Indian living in US for 3 years now. Benares is definitely the best Indian restaurant I have been to in US !! The Banarsi kachori was great. We also had Baingan Mirch Ka Salan, Nawabi Subji, Paneer Bhurji and Soy Tikka Masala, which were all distinctive in flavor (unlike a lot of Indian restaurants where all the dishes with red gravies taste the same) and delicious. The ambience was great too ! The music was very good and different, unlike other Indian places which have the same 90's Hindi film music. The portion sizes were good and the service was attentive. I will definitely be going back here !!
