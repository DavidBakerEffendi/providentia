A diner has to search far and wide to find an equal in terms of quality, freshness, kind wait staff, and entertainment.   The Imperial Buffet (the "imp" to the locals) provides well over 50 different choices, "all you can eat" buffet-style at a very reasonable price (approximately $7 lunch and $12 dinner).  Even for their low prices, their food options are VERY high quality, and VERY fresh throughout the entire food service.   Unlike most Chinese buffet-style restaurants, the Imperial Buffet also offers a wide selection of sushi rolls and shashimi.  This is due to the fact that the owners also run a Japanese Hibachi and Sushi Bar down the street called Kouzokus (which I also highly recommend to the more refined pallet). During the evenings, the attached bar section (with games and pool tables) is alive with live-music, karaoke, and very experienced and friendly bartenders.  Again the price of drinks are by far reasonable and one of the lowest in town.   If you are looking for outstanding food, great owners (that are more than happy to sit and talk with their patrons), at a VERY reasonable price.... look no further than the Imperial Buffet.
