We had such a wonderful Saturday lunch at Giorgio on Pine. Before a show at the Kimmel Center, we walked over to Giorgio's-bringing 7 children with us. We received a warm welcome and delicious food, served thoughtfully and efficiently. The restaurant was very attentive to our concerns about food allergies. They specially prepared two items for my son, who is allergic to tree nuts. He loved the delicious food, and we all appreciated how the staff responded to our requests. Also, our server was masterful about communicating with the children. Thank you for a relaxing Saturday afternoon in the neighborhood. We're coming back for the pasta primavera, the gnocchi and the kale salad!
