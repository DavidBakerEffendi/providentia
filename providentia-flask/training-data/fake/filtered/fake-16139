I actually went there for the first time this past Friday and was very disappointed in so many levels. We were able to get a table at the very last minute. We heard so many great things through our friend so we decided to give it a try. The decor is nice but a little too noisy. We should known better since its in the Meat Packing District. If you are looking for a romantic place I would not recommend this place because you can not hear your self talking. It's more of an after work place. We ordered the following: The bottle of red wine was good. Can't remember the name but it was excellent. Appetizers We started off with the Yellow Tail and it was great but it was a very small portion. Two scoops and we were done. Â  Seared Diver Scallops were good but again very small portion. I think over all I had maybe just 2 scallops in my plate. Entree Dish I ordered the Lardo Wrapped Halibut. It was a little over cooked and dry. Not to much flavor. My husband ordered the Branzino. I do have to say it was good. For dessert we ordered Amedei Chocolate Cake. This was heavenly. Our waiter was rushing us through out dinner. Every 10-15 minutes he kept stopping by our table. We felt we were not able to enjoy our food. Considering we spent $225 with out tip for dinner he could of been a little more nicer to us. Overall I would say this place is not on my top of my list to go back to. Over priced, small portion, and horrible service.
