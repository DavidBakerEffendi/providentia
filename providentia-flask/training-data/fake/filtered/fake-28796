I lived in this neighborhood over 20 years ago and returned w/ my husband for a vacation. The Hourglass Tavern is still here and the ambience and food are still cozy and delicious. This is a gem of Restaurant Row and they will flip the hourglass if you need to make an 8 pm curtain, so you can get to the show on time. Great meal, great atmosphere- you cant go wrong with this place!
