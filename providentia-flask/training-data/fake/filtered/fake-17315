We have eaten here before and found the food pleasant enough although never stellar.  Last night, however, was a disaster beyond  belief!  Eight of us with reservatiions to celebrate a birthday had calamity after calamity!  Our server was personable and kind but completely inept.  Missing salads, wrong entrees, special requests never communicated BUT the worst and most  unconscienable act was the lamb special!  Four of us ordered the rack of lamb ($33 for 3 tiny lamb  chops).  I ordered mine medium rare and my dish was served medium rare but ice and I mean ice cold...not room temperature but refrigerator cold.  My fellow lamb diners all had the same experience...no problem...tell the waitress; she tells manager and they whisk away our dishes...5 minutes later, they are returned...microwaved or heated in a skillet...not  sure but the plate I received was well done now and here is the unconscienable part...a piece of lamb was missing from one of my chops!  Lo and behold!  They had mixed up the dishes and returned them randomly..i received my fellow diner's dish!  Yuck!  I refused to eat and spoke  to the manager who sent over his manager and they did remove the lamb from our check!  Big deal! Very disgusting practices...not to be trusted!  We will never eat here again!  Who knows whose leftover food you may  be getting!  Our lamb should have been discarded and new ones cooked for us....that is what any reputable restaurant would have done!  Very suspect food hygiene practices to say the least..I went home hungry!  Better safe than sorry! Addendum:  just found out that two members of our group became ill last night!
