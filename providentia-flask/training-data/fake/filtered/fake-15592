Took me two tries to fall in love with this place, but I am so glad I was talked into going the second time! Three words - Cote de Boeuf - a gorgeous medium rare porterhouse for two, with generous slabs of roasted bone marrow. Paired with a few fresh, bright salads and some good cocktails, and it was a perfect meal for three. We topped it all off with their Grand Marnier souffle, just delectable. I've never been much of a souffle lover, but this one came out steamy, sweet, and as soft as a puff of cloud. Definitely one of the more memorable meals that I've had in NYC; and frankly Minetta's steak beats some of the bigger names in NY. Will be going back!
