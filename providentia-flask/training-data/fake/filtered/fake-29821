Tonite was my first time visiting this place.  I did all the research and thought i was going to have a night of culinary delight... To my amazement, it was not the best.  We arrived at the location around around 5:15p and waited a few minutes to be seated.  No issue there.  We ordered both the appetizer and entree at the same time thinking this would speed the process of having to place another order.  We ordered a Calamari appetizer that arrived to the table in nice time.  Unfortunately there was so much breading on the chewy squid rings that it was impossible to taste the the actual calamari...  then we sat... and sat... and sat.. and sat.. for over an hour waiting on the entree... We asked the waiting Paulo what was the hold on for the food and he politely began to explain that we didnt notify him that we were ready for the entree and done with the appetizer..... IN WHAT COUNTRY DOES THAT PATRON HAVE TO INFORM THE WAIT STAFF THAT THEY ARE DONE AND READY FOR THE ENTREE?  Is that not part of the customer service?  Well, after realizing that we ere going to have to wait another 30-45mins while the order was finally sent to the kitchen, we politely asked for a check and proceeded to leave.  We were once again approached by Paulo, who then informed us that we could not leave because we hadnt paid the bill (since he refused to bring us a bill we politely left $20 on the table to cover the $10 appetizer and one soda that was consumed).  Paulo then followed us towards the door yelling that he was calling the police and reporting us.   Its safe to say that the experience was not the best.  The service sucked and the food (the appetizer we tasted) was not good.  Will I try this restaurant again? Maybe... but only if McDonalds and the nearest gas station vending machine is closed.
