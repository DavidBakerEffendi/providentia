I've tried a lot of different ramen restaurants in the city but this is the one that I always come back to. (I think close to 20 times in 6 months) Initially I felt like the noodle and broth is alright, not amazing, but I can always manage to finish both the noodle and broth--which I couldn't in other restaurants as it tastes too salty or too strong at the end. I love how the noodle and broth is just cooked perfect, and the pork meat is my absolute favorite. A bonus for the value if you add extra pork, for $3 you can get double amount of meat!! Also the service was great, the servers are always friendly and helpful. Although one time I got there at 11 and they were closing already so I got very confused about their opening time... One thing I hope they improve is the fact that it's cash only. Also they always play the same song in the restaurant every time I go and I kinda feel bad for the people working there.
