Never had a meal I didn't like here. I've been for brunch, lunch, and dinner and it's all great. It can get noisy but not too bad. Back patio is really nice, especially for brunch. I also like hanging at the bar. They have a tv and play the games, which is nice. When the World Cup was playing this summer we wanted to watch the US game there but when we asked the guy if they would play sound, he gave us a totally unnecessarily snooty answer. Other than that, the ppl are really friendly. Â Definitely recommend.
