WAY over-hyped.  The line isn't long because the pizza is so good, but it's long because people THINK the pizza is good.  Everybody stands in line in the hopes that they will experience the best pizza they ever had, but I have to say that my husband makes better pizza than this (granted, he is a very good cook). Firstly, the place feels like a chain.  Oh, wait...it is a chain!  There's 3 of them!  Secondly,  the pizza wasn't bad but it was mediocre.  It's better than Domino's but it's not the best NY style pizza.  We ordered the margherita pizza.  The crust was the only really good thing, but the rest of the pizza tasted so bland.  Again, my husband's margherita pizza tastes WAY better. The service was very good once you actually got in the place - the waiters were like super waiters.  Really fast and attentive! I'd rather go to a very small pizza place in NY with an old Italian man making the dough as if he has done it all his life.....went to a place like that but just stumbled upon it and don't remember what it was called!
