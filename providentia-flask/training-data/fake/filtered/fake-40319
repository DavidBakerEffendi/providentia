We had visited CK's Steakhouse month's ago before they redid the dinner menu & they have a new chef. The name should change as it is not really a "steakhouse" with the changed menu. The service at the bar was superb, Kayla & Said are the best! But the food was just okay. My Margherita Pizza was refreshing & tasty. My burger for $10 was okay too with a choice of fries or a house salad.  My wife's entree of Spicy Shrimp for $28 & six rather small shrimp was a bit unsatisfactory. The House Salad was delicious.  $6 for a draft beer was a bit much & $16 for a so-so pour of Conn Creek Cab was overpriced. For $16 it should be a better pour.  The cheesecake----take a pass on that.
