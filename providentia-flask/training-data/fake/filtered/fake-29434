I have been to this restaurant a few times.  I love that they have a fireplace in the winter; makes it a very cozy atmosphere and the fajitas are good! Drinks are reasonably priced.  Only gripe was that it took me a while to get my server's attention when I needed something. It seemed like they were always on a break.  Overall good experience.
