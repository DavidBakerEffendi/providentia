I went to the Cranbury  Inn on 13 May 2012 for Mothers Day brunch we took our mother, grandmother and grandchildren. We made reservation the week before mothers day. I asked would they have an omelet station and was told yes , I felt this would be grate because my mother and grandmother could only eat egg white somelet. When we got to our table we were told sorry we have to many  people we are not making omelets today. So our mother said we  would eat something else. We all end up getting the scramble eggs from the buffet table and they were cold . I told management about it and his response was that when they put them out  they get cold. This was a very poor comment for management to make. Every time we asked to bring us coffee was also cold, then we got the check, we paid the check and the waitres asked how was everything my reply was service was good everything else was dreadful.So we paid and left the inn and were talking and taking pictures with the mothers outside,.then the owner  came outside and said to me we put you in and you should be glag we served you today.  At this point my response was, sir we did not ask for anything from you or your restaurant but a proper meal with quality of over quantity .We feel the owner and management working that day were very rude and obnoxious and unproffesional.  The good folks of Cranbury NJ should not let this restaurant operate with this type of management. I do not recommended you eating or hosting anything kind of event until the owner and their management is remover.
