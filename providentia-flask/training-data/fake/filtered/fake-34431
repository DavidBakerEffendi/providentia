Having lived in Southern California for six years and completely enjoying the fish tacos from Rubio's, my husband and I were on a quest to find something similar (or better) on the East Coast.  Well, we found it!  The fish tacos are great at Baja's.  My husband and I were by ourselves last night, but this is easily a place that our children would enjoy eating at too.
