Believe the Hype! I'll admit that I didn't know much about Difara's before going other than the glowing reviews my wife told me about.  Some old guy making pizzas by himself with slices to die for and super long waits.  'Yah yah... I thought, another good NY pizza place. '  Well, let me tell you, after walking out of Difaras that night I felt like I just had an out of body type experience.  The pizza, process, and Dom's artistry was really something to behold.  I  was also drenched through with sweat and 2 and a half hours older than when I first walked in.  There was parmigiana cheese sticking to my elbow from the leftovers on our table of a customer long gone, and I had met one super regular at the counter all who told me I should have gotten the 'square'.  I nearly crashed my car on the way home daydreaming about those last two square slices I saw him take home.  If the triangle was that good I kept thinking, 'Imagine those squares'.  Next time I have 3 hours to kill I'm all over that!
