I hate how people critique the prices and grease level. It's a burger joint. Just like five guys or jakes. I personally prefer mooyah just because the nice atmosphere and there's more options! I came on Saturday for the first time. The fries were a little soggy at first but then one of the female coworkers came out and said she had these fresh fries cooking for me and the other worker didn't see and gave me the slightly older fries on accident. Definitely thankful because the fries were so gooood the second round. Will definitely be returning.
