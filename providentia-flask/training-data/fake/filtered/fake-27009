Mr. Lee is as friendly as can be.  I started ordering his food because it's convenient (he's right off the trolley line and on my way home), but I kept going back because of his charming and endearing personality and his delicious and wonderfully priced food.  If you're a carnivore, vegetarian, or a vegan, there's something on the menu for you.  I'm a meat-eater, but I'm hooked on the veggie cheesesteak, made with plenty of seitan, carrots, green peppers, and topped with a choice of several sauces (sweet chili, spicy dijon, or sriracha). Over time, he and his staff have gotten to know me, and they're always friendly, making sure to say hi and wave at me, even as I wait for the trolley in the morning.  On one occasion, I had ordered something to pick up, but I was running late and they stayed open late several minutes waiting for me - that's incredible service that can't be expected everywhere!
