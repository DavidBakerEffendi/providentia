First, the "Best in Philadelphia" rating was "Pay to Play" at its best. This restaurant isn't even close to the best in Philadelphia. I wouldn't put it in the top 30. Lots of hype. Nice atmosphere. The host didn't appear to have hosted a Friendlies let alone a fine restaurant. Clumsy, awkward and unprofessional. Food was at times interesting, but when the best item is grilled haloumi cheese, you get the idea. Middle-eastern food is fundamentally cheap and peasant inspired which is why the prices here are truly insane for what you get. They've attempted to create a Medi-style Jose Garces tapas restaurant and while the dishes are sometimes very good, the portions are insulting and a bit pretentious. Â There will undoubtedly be many of Mediterranean heritage who will rave about Zahav. Don't believe it. And don't trust Philadelphia Magazine for any critical reviews. After reading the many positive reviews here, I predict some (perhaps many) are part of the restaurant's masterful local public relations campaign. Plenty of Yelpers are on the dole if you weren't aware.
