If you know Hell's Kitchen well, you know there are ~5 thai places on each block. Room Service stands out. Among the other options, Room Service is a well-conceived, relatively upscale choice for HK Thai. Great choice for a date or a girls' dinner. The decor is arguably the most spectacular part of the Room Service experience - the primary differentiating factor. The ornate navy black and creme interior, complete with mirrors and crystal chandeliers, gives the place a classy feel. Aside front he great service you'll receive from them, the waitresses complement their surroundings with their playful attire and truly contribute to the restaurant's environment. The food is very reasonably priced (as Thai generally is) with high quality, nicely sized portions. Though the food is very good, I wouldn't rate it higher than that of a typical Thai place. If you're into sweet, fruity drinks, try a flavored mojito or mimosa.
