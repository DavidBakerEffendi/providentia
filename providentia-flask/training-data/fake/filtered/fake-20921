I waited 15 min for just one sandwich... and on top of that the owner was just rude and nasty with me when i asked for extra peppers.  the sandwich was ok not the greatest  but the owner (some fat vietnamese lady seemed very cocky).  I don't see why. I admit for 3.75 it was a bargain but the sandwich hurt my gums, after my lunch my mouth was aching and sore, Meat was way too hard. Tasty but hard.  from my experience there I have no reason to go back. especially with the experice of waiting and attitude from that bitch
