I've never been to the one in New Haven, not sure how they compare. My first observation was our very immature server, she couldn't have been much older than 18. She took our drink order and then came back a whole minute later to ask what we wanted to eat before bringing our drinks. She then looked appalled that I ordered more than 2 tapas. Isn't the point of a server to UPSELL you anyway? She should be working at Mcdonalds, not a spanish tapas place that is attempting to be classy. Service aside my lime caiparhana (sp) was delicious. The best thing I ate was the squid in ink, so good. The anchovies and sardine dishes were good, but almost indentical, both came drenched in olive oil over toast. The ceviche with saffron/coconut was well flavored, also had a side of spinach with pine nuts and raisins that was quite salty. I would go back for the drinks and maybe try more of the menu. But our server really needs to get a clue.
