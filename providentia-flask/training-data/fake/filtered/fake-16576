I was here recently for a friend's meet and greet. I just couldn't resist sampling all the food provided! VERY tasty!! I brought my wife back across town this weekend just to have some more and to try some of the desserts. Wonderful use of the space with real cool decor - I look forward to patronizing Manakeesh again and again!
