had a great experience here last week. really enjoyed the food. they had the most authentic gumbo we've tasted in a long time and a great variety/selection on their menu. i ordered fish tacos and they were amazing, definitely hit the spot. they place is also very kid friendly, there was a party of some sort (birthday?) and the staff was great with our baby, taking the time to play with her and making her smile. overall a great experience, i will definitely be back!
