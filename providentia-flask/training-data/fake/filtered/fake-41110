I stumbled upon this place last week with my wife.   It was a great experience.   We felt like we were back in Italy at a Vineria.   It is nice to finally have a place that you can go for great service  in a beautiful ambiance with fresh food(amazing pizza) and incredibe wine all at the right price. It is not one of these typical stuffy cooperate hang out  wine bars that are popping up all over the city, Sofia is truly a place that you can go and call OUR place.... 10 steps above Make sure to order a homemade Pizza and the eggplant  when you go...  EXCELLENT!!!!
