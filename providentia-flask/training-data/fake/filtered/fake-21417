Mmmm Malai Koftha.  Had it here first, and it is the standard by which I have judged all others.  None have come close.   The food is amazing. The lamb vindaloo was also excellently.It had very nice flavors . I've tried the chicken tikka masala (pretty good),some vegetable dish (pretty good), naan (really good, Recommend the Chana Masala and Chicken Tikka Masala, though I'll definitely try other things on the menu next time I go. Goat curry is also very good. Mango lassi was also excellent.i definitely go back
