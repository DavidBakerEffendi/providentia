This is a truly wonderful restaurant.  It receieved a wonderful review from the local paper - and our experiences lived up to expectations.  The food is fresh, tasty, and creative.  The black magic cake is pretty much the only holdover from Timothy's.  The portions are generous, the setting cozy and unpretentious.  We have been there twice and have lingered both times - never feeling rushed.  It is a BYOB place - so cart out your favorite wine...
