i used to order chicken fingers and fries every Saturday then they put a lot less fries than usual but that was fine, then they started using a different oil for the fries and they were soggy and tasted like crap, then recently they changed the chicken and the breading recipe for the chicken so now everything tastes like crap so now theyve lost a once loyal customer... o well that's what happens when you go cheap
