My family of 5 ate at this restaurant last night.  The atmosphere was cool.  Sports bar all the way.  Beer menu was good.  Make sure you get the 16oz of beer for $1 more.  The food...well....three of us ordered the corned beef dinner with cabbage and potato.  We were all VERY disappointed!  The corned beef was shredded (not sliced) and not moist.  It was basically a small shredded pile along with a few very wilted pieces of cabbage and 1 small potato (hard) cut up set in a bowl of hot water.  The price was $9.99 which was reasonable but I would have rather they charge a bit more and give you a better meal!  My husband ordered the Reuben with slaw and loved it. My daughter ordered a pulled pork sandwich which was just okay.  Overall the place was just okay but a disappointment.  Stick to the beer/bar thought process and forget the restaurant for the supposed Irish dinner.  Shame!
