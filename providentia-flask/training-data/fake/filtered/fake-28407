This is without a doubt the best, freshest, most reasonably priced seafood experience in NY.   Whoever disagrees, hasn't had a good piece of fish in their lives and probably doesn't know any better.  But, for those who know what good fish tastes like, then you would thoroughly enjoy taverna kyclades. I had the tsipoures and bronzino, both wonderful.  Also the grilled kalamari was spectacular, so tender and flavorful.  All the side dishes are great, lemon potatoes are particularly amazing. I really like the atmosphere, it transports me to summertime in greece.  Overall, wonderful culinary experience.
