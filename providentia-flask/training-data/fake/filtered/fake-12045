Ahhhhh Rosario's. Surprisingly, I was hard pressed to find good pizza in S. Philly. Then Rosarios popped up on grub hub. Yess! Now when i feel like eating my weight in food, i have a delicoious, Pizza/Mexican joint to call up. Haven't had a so-so meal, yet. I have ordered from hear at least three times within the last month.
