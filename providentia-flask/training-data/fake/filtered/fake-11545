I went to this place only because of a friends recommendation of how great it was and after looking at the yelp reviews.. The wait on a friday night at 7:30pm was for an hour, but i didn't get seated until 9:20 and even that was because the friend i was with is pregnant and i had to keep asking them to seat us, as they had quoted the time of an Hour.. The hosts are quite rude and standoff-ish, the attitude you would experince in a 5star nyc resturant, not in iselin jersey. The food is quite good BUT not worth 2 hour wait, or even an hour wait! Â do check it out if you are looking for good but avoid going during rush hour.
