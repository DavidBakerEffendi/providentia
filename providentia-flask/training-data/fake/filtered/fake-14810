Absolutely awful!!!  Frozen tuna.  Medium rare apparently still crunchy from ice...Caesar salad barely edible..worst service ever.....while tables next to us received drinks & bread...still waiting. "......... BigFish is down the road...much better option Drinks at bar were great ....although bartender mentioned his recipe for lemon drop martini not bonefish's. ..nevertheless delicious
