I went here for dinner with my girlfriend and it was definitely a great choice! The service was phenomenal, and the food even better! The ambiance was very relaxing, and it felt just like a cafe that you would find in a European city. The wine list is very well balanced and coordinated to the type of food served. One thing is that it is a small location, so if going with a group of people keep this detail in mind! Oh, and I almost forgot...the homemade bread...awesome! This place is a must!
