Let me start by saying I was blown away by the freshness of every ingredient... It was truly an amazing experience... I came here specifically for the grilled octopus, I had no idea it would be this good, so the hubby and I got that as a starter, then we ordered grilled whiting fish and grilled quail... They were both delicious but by far the octopus was the star of the night!!! And of course they had to blow us away by finishing the nice meal with a complimentary dessert which was the best greek yogourt and sweet cherries I have ever had!!! This place has become my number one stop in NYC...
