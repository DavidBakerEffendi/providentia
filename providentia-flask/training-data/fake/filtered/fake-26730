Staff seemed friendly enough. I even inquired about having them cater for larger gatherings, as it was one of the options I had been considering for a coming meeting. But when I received my 2 Mama Gyros (which cost $10 and change), the bag was astonishingly light. Like, the ad team behind the Macbook Air having a field day light. I even opened the styrofoam package to quickly check that there was actually food inside - indeed two gyros were sitting cozy, so I figured I was just expecting too much from an expensive area. When I got on the subway to really chow down and head home, I was astonished further. I had ordered a beef/lamb and chicken Mama Gyro, which includes the meat with tomatoes, red onions, and french fries, along with sauce of your choice, in pita. What I found was a lump of chicken, in pita; and a lump of beef/lamb, in pita. Nothing else, not even sauce. If only I hadn't been in a hurry, maybe I would have noticed when I opened to check in the store. I was starving and already on the subway, so I had no choice but to accept it and wolf it down, fighting negative feelings the whole way. The flavor as well as texture could be summed up perfectly as coarse. Considering it was nothing but dry meat and bread, lamb actually wasn't super terrible. But try eating roasted chicken gyro meat with nothing but whole wheat pita, no sauce. It's like eating sand. Fairly depressing way to finish a busy night. But the silver lining is thankfully I experienced this before I asked them to cater.
