Ever since I enjoyed the amazing gourmet cheesecake at Anthony's, I couldn't wait for the day I could return for their Thursday night dinner.  I was NOT disappointed.  The variety of menu choices suited our tastes like a dream.  It wasn't difficult to see that every dish was freshly prepared, and the flavors were remarkably imaginative and well-balanced.  The service was superb; a welcoming and comfortable atmosphere, surrounded by stylish décor.  We were particularly pleased by the glasses made from Mason jars.  The friendly and sociable staff answered all our questions professionally and got our orders to the table without error.  As stuffed as we were, we couldn't pass up the sumptuous dessert menu.  Along with his signature cheesecakes, there was an assortment of cakes and pies.  We were told that his menu is different each week, so we're looking forward to our next visit.
