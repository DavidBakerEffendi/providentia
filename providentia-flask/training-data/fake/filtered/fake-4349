I wish I was blown away. I always wanted to go eat there. It's good if you grew up eating hot dogs and your idea of salad is iceberg lettuce with kraft french dressing. Then again Bushwick is littered with a  bunch of hyped up restaurants with jacked up prices. The menu listed a can of modelo for $9. Someone next to us ordered a plate of corn kernnels for $12 Pizza wasn't bad but it wasn't the best I was hoping for. Some of the waitstaff seemed aloof, others were very helpful mixed service experience. Food was delayed twenty minutes but wait staff kept us informed. Would I come here  again...probably. I liked the Tikki bar area, nice and open and relaxed compared to the cafeteria style dining room. Maybe I went on a off day.  Monday 3pm.
