Stopped in on Sunday for brunch. The place had 3 tables filled  and no one at the bar. Pretty much empty. The food once it arrived  is still good. But the service has gone down to no stars. It was 2 pm and the bartender was closing out all the tabs from the day, not paying any attention to us, siting at the bar or how long it took for our foo to arrive as we sat the verbally complaining. Not going back.
