I go to Joe's at least once a week.  The food is great and the service is friendly.  They have totally ruined me from getting cheesesteaks, pasta and bruchetta from any other place.  The latter will make you want to speak in tongues!  The subs are made on wonderful bread and Boars Head cold cuts; definitely better tasting than Tastee up the street that uses really cheap cold cuts.  The sit-down restaurant is a great treat as well.  I know one reviewer suggested DuSal's or Omega instead, but if you love flavor, herbs and garlic in your food, go to Joe's.
