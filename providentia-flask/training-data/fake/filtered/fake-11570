I'm a Japanese living in the city for almost 10 years including in West Village for recent 3 years.  Only my comlain in the neighborhood was there're only few traditional Japanese restaurants, however, finally I found this place very recently as one of my favorite places. Fukurou is like a modern izakaya in Tokyo.  Quality of the food was beyong my original expectation and in addition the cost was quite reasonable comparing with other quality Japanese restaurants in the city.  Despite the kitchen was relatively small, chefs work very efficiently and service guys are extremely friendly. Only my worry is it will be hard to book a table soon once people are aware of this hidden place...  I will definitely come to Fukurou with my family on regular basis.
