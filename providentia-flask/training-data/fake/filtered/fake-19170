going by all the great reviews here--we went to august last night. will not return. here's why: a woman, not our waitress, we think the owner!, hovered over our table, clearing plates before we were done. she took away 2 dessert plates while 2 were still eating. cleared dinner/main/appetizer plates quickly too. asked us 4 times how dinner was. we ate at 7, left at 8:30. obviously, she had a second seating coming at 9..... it's a byob--so they put our white wine, in a cooler across the room and forgot about it. we had to ask for refills, which the waitress helpfully poured small portions of...hence when it was time to be whisked out, 1/3 our bottle remained in the restaurant. we ordered from the $10 small plates/trading menu--that was the majority of the menu. the food was very good, but the more we thought about what you got for $10-- the less we liked it. small, appetizer size spinach salad-- very good, but if it had been labeled "appetizer" it would have cost $8. 3 ravioli =$10. 4 shrimp=$10 and finally we know it was a hot weekend , but their AC could not keep up. it was sweltering hot --and they knew it b/c they had ceiling fans going! and annoyingly --it's all cash onlt, too tell the owner to back off and lower her prices... before we return
