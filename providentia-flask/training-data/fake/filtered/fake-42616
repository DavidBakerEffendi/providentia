Sitar is terrific!   We go frequently for the lunch buffet, especially on weekends.  The food is delicious and the staff is wonderful, especially Ashwin.   At weekend brunches there are exceptionally good South Indian specialties.  There is always a good assortment of vegetarian options.   The combination of tasty, healthy food along with a friendly, comfortable ambience has kept us coming regularly for years.
