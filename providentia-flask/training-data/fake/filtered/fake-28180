I gave into the hype and tried this place for the first time today. I will not go back. I ordered the lobster mac and there was barely any lobster, and it lacked flavor. My son got the kids grilled cheese and the cheese was not melted, just warm. The kids meals were supposed to come with apple slices, and they were never served. Way overpriced for what I got.
