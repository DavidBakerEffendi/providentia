I travel 2.5 hours almost every month to have lunch here with a friend. Have been doing it for over 2 years. Monument Lane is my 'local' restaurant. The food is superb and the ambience at lunch is quiet. Went on 12/15 for lunch and had the Lamb Schnitzel (memories of Sydney Australia). My friend had the brisket (yum!). Lunch is never complete without their divine cookies at the end and the coffee. Comes in it's own French press. Our server, Justin, was fabulous. Great sense of humour and understated, like all the staff. Food is sourced locally and the chef does wonderful things with it. Want to try brunch and dinner too, but it's my 'go-to' place for lunch in NYC. If you are an 'all-day breakfast' person, you can get that too. Menu is not large, and is available online to view. Makes for better quality, I say. PS - They will accommodate food allergies. Mine is garlic/alium (don't laugh). I ask what I can have or not and they work with me, no probs.
