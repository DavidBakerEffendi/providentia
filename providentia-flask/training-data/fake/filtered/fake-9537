My husband and I ate here with a few friends and had an amazing meal!!! The gnocchi was like nothing I've ever had before. It actually melted in your mouth and we had the salad with dandelion greens and loved it. Like every other great restaurant in the neighborhood, there's a wait but unlike some other places, they don't act like they're doing you a favor by putting your name on the list. This place has just the right vibe, too. Gorgeous inside and out.
