Food is great, get the lunch special (amazing deal) 1/4 Chicken, rice and beans and an avocado salad for about $10 bucks. The portions are generous the green sauce is to die for. However the service is very slow and they don't check back on you that often. I suggest picking it up or ordering the special as take-out.
