I live in the area and eat out  often, so when I heard folks from out of town say they were planning to eat at Logan's and neither my girlfriend nor I knew anything about it, I thought it must be a mistake. Perhaps someone had just opened and had all their friends write rave reviews.  So, we went... And it was great.  The service was exceptional, everyone was friendly, and the food was delicious.  I went back the next day, and had the best bean burger I have ever tasted...it set the standard by which all bean burgers will be judged moving forward.  Oh, and they have been open for a couple of years, I had just not known.   And the desserts are remarkable. I will be a regular.
