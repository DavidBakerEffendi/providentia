If you read the reviews, Frankie's real problem becomes pretty clear. I arranged a birthday for my wife, reserving the Farm table, or whatever they call it, for 10 people; when another person signed on they balked, saying over and over again "it's against our policy," and wouldn't allow the increase. They also said we had 2 1/2 hours to eat, then would get the boot. I called Locanda, another Brooklyn Italian place, and got a reservation for 13 for the next night, cancelling Frankie's. The woman at Frankie's was very nice and apologetic, and said I could speak to the manager, but I don't have any intention of begging favors from a place I'm giving my business. Ditto the 2-2 1/2 hour wait for regular seating on the weekend. People in NYC work 50 or 60 hours week pretty regularly, and I don't want to wait for 2 hours for a table at any restaurant. Start taking reservations like a grown up restaurant, guys, treat your customers like guests, not intrusions and problems. For the record, the food was fair to good the last time I at there.
