I love the atmosphere of Lilie's, it's very London and very cute.  It's perfect for lunch or dinner with the girls.  Our food was great, drinks were solid and service was okay.  We had to wait a long time to be seated because we couldn't find a hostess!  But after that everyone was super apologetic.
