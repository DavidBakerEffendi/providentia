Went to the Newark Airport, got hungry and stopped by here.  Its only like a 15 minute ride from the airport.  The Chicken and rice soup is out of this world along with their peanut butter cheesecake.  Prices are a little high compared to where I am from (South Jersey), but the size of the portions make up for it. Only thing is, with it being so busy, I felt like my server could not pay 100% attention to us.  Still the service was good overall.
