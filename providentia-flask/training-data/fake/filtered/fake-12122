I have horrible experiences at Old Tapatio, 10 Main St, West Orange, New Jersey. The restaurant rejects gift certificates. I bought a $15 gift certificate of Old Tapatio Restaurant, 10 Main St, West Orange, NJ, from restaurant.com. However the lady, worked as waitress and casher, insisted that both boss and she didn't know restaurant.com. They had no idea where the gift certificates come from. She rejected to redeem the gift certificate, although I explained her how restaurant can validate it. She told me she always rejected the certificates whenever people used them. If this instance is not enough to show how Old Tapatio doesn't take their business brand seriously, the following two things made me sick. The lady didn't calculate the bill correctly! Â I ordered two lunches, $11.95 and $14.95. For the drinks, I only wanted water. She gave me two bottles and charged me $1.5 each. The correct amount should be $32.00, including 7% tax. However, she added them up as $38.95. I had to ask her do the math again! I hope she didn't do it intently. Finally, the restaurant won't give me a receipt. The lady said the machine was not working. She can't print a receipt! Regardless the food, I won't go this place any more.
