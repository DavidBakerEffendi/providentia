Meh, I've had better....I don't really understand all the rave reviews on here? I had to try this place after reading all of them, but I'll have to say the sushi itself was just ok. The people working there were really nice and friendly, but the food itself wasn't really good and was borderline bootleg (ie: wegmans takeout style)... I did get takout as seating there during lunch is virtually impossible,1 small table and a bar which seats about 8 people. I did get the 3 role special which would've been a great deal had the sushi actually tasted good. I could name a ton of better sushi places in philly to go to instead of here. Too each their own, but I probably won't be going back.
