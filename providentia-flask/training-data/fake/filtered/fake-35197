Don't go to this restaurant. The owner is ruled. When we got there, waiting for a table for 5 for like 20 mins, finally we got a table. There were another party after us, they got to sit in a smaller table, and owner came out and they asked the owner if they can switch table with us. Owner said ok to switch. The waitress told the owner we had five, my friend thought they have more people so she agreed to switch. After we sat in a smaller table, we saw they were also five people, so we asked the waitress why we had to switch with them if we both have party of five and we got to sit in that table first. We told you we have five people. We switch cause we thought you have more people. We felt a little bit discriminated against us. Would you tell your owner to explain. Few second later, owner came out yell at us and without explanation and told us to get out. We try to Explain everything to her, but she woundnt listen and tell us to get out. She said her restaurant discriminate no one and we have to leave the building now. We left this restaurant very unhappily. Worst experience ever:(
