Went here for a special occasion, The waiter we got we really nice. We ordered Soup of the Day (Cream of Potato) and Backed Goat Cheese Marinara, the Soup was not that good, it wasn't hot or no flavor. Â Backed Goat Cheese Marinara was really Good. We also ordered some nice wine went very well with it. For Entree we ordered Grilled Salmon (Spl of the Day) and Ricotta Ravioli. The Salmon was perfect, nice juicy and tender. Ricotta Ravioli on the other hand was OK, It didn't spoil our Special occasion. Friends said their stuffed Blue Burger is really nice, I will have to visit again just for that.
