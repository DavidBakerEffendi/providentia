Finally -- an amazing cafe catering to crisp, fresh, healthy options!  I was walking through the village on a beautiful Friday and happened on Ellary's Greens -- how lucky was I.    I dined on the fresh Tuscan Salad with spicy BBQ Shrimp.  It was out of this world.   Ellary's also has a terrific wine list -- at reasonable prices!   Great service -- hip crowd.   I'm so glad it's in the neighborhood!     My advice -- go early, it was getting busy... Gold Stars!!!!
