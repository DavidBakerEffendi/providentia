For a place that got famous for hosting the local employees after their shifts and having a "laid-back" atmosphere with a no-fringes attitude at the door, I must say, "Isn't it ironic?!!!" I waited 45 minutes outside the, yes, velvet rope, waited like 25 additional minutes for the bartender to notice me, paid an average of $20 per drink.....and this is without mentioning the attitude. Or no toilet paper in the bathroom. .........AS IF !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
