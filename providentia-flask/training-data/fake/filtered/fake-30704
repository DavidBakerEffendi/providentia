If I could rate ten stars for this classy joint, I would have no problem doing so! The yellow tail is buttery perfect, along with all the other crisp clean flavors available here. This joint is matchless from what I have tasted within the N.J sushi scene. Classy N.J-F.P people N.J Â F.P. From Paul the owners fresh sleek style throughout his rolls, to the two others that work there making you feel as if you have been there since day one. The music, the people you sit next to at the sushi bar, and the thumbs up prices are more than smile putting. Take it from myself Americans, go to this joint. It is a byob as well, aka... saki shots and fresh cast baby! Fresh cast, food porn people, check-it-out!!!!
