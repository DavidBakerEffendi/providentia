Hi, All at Peaches Hot House,  I had the opportunity to dine at your establishment this weekend.  I was pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere, the staff and the pricing.  I ordered the Trout stuffed with crab.  The food tasted good but unfortunately, my fish was riddled with Bones!!! This definitely changed my dining experience.  Instead of interacting with the rest of my party, I had to pick through the crab meat and fish to make sure I didn't get a bone stuck in my throat.  I prepare fish at home all of the time and I am aware of how tedious it is to remove all of the bones.  You should consider changing the type of fish you use to stuff.  Salmon or Monk could work.  I did tell the waiter but I'm not sure he passed on the info.  At any rate, I wanted to make you aware because swallowing a bone can be dangerous!  I would hate to hear that you were slammed with a lawsuit.  The rest of my group was quite happy with their food.  And we would definitely dine here again.  My 4 star review was reduced to 3 because of those darn bones.
