The Best Brick Oven Pizza in Brooklyn is all I have to say about this place. I was a little skeptical of trying this pizza because most brick oven pizza have a nasty burnt after taste. But at this place there is no after taste and very tasty. I must say beware of going here on a weekend because there will be a 45 min wait....but it's worth the wait. I had a margarita pizza and it was very delicious. Â The pizza is very crispy not soggy. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I never get to taste the famous gelato. My friend and her girls live for the dulce de leche gelato. On my days if going their always out of gelato. Overall I will always come back for a pizza, I'm soooo glad I live nearby. Once you taste this pizza you will never eat pizza anywhere else Guanrnteed.
