OMG, if I had only one meal to consume before I die, I would probably chose this place.  In my last meal, I would choose Crab/Pork Dumplings to start, then I would move into their Pork Shoulders which just melts in your mouth, next would be Razor Clams with Blackbeans and Spicy Sauce and finish it off with Tofu with Shrimp.  I traveled many cities in China and had wonderful meals (not so wonderful as well), but this place is at the top of my All-time Favorite List.
