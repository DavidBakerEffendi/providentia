I have been here several times and I am bit disappointed. Food is mediocre at best, however the drinks are decent. It is a hipster hangout, so it goes without saying that the service is awful. Decor is not as unique as the young artsy clientele here would have you believe. In fact Loco Pez reminds me alot of El Rey in Rittenhouse. My suggestion--if you are content with cheap/mediocre food come here. Otherwise go down the road to one of several establishments that have better food.
