My wife and son and I recently visited Valentina's in Rahway on a Thursday night and we were the only ones there (from 6 to about 7:15). I don't understand why it's not more crowded. Interesting atmosphere; friendly, attentive service; outstanding menu selections; not overly expensive: and most importantly, we all thought the food was great - good portions and delicious. Also, the fact that it's BYOB kept the bill total down. It was the first time we were there in close to a year; but, I'm sure we'll be going back a lot sooner than that.
