Like most new places, it seems this place took a little time to find its stride, but the experience my wife and I had when visiting was first-rate. I'm a craft beer aficionado and could visit Woodbines several times a week. I had a SingleCut beer and a Founders Centennial. Both were perfectly served. My wife enjoyed the house wine, and she can be picky. I had a burger and my wife had the lamb meatloaf and we were both very happy with our choices. The service was excellent.
