As a Trenton native, I want to support Trenton businesses.  However, Amici's left a LOT to be desired.  One thing great that Amici's has going for them is a great wait staff. Unfortunately,  their great service does not make up for bad food.  I ordered the calamari as an appetizer and it was not fresh. The breading was really oily, and the squid was tough, rubbery, and brown on the edges. I believe that we received old, re-fried calamari.  The entrees just were not that good either.  My salmon was overcooked, the linguine was really mushy, and the potatoes tasted like they were old and re-cooked, too.  Maybe on a more busy day (as opposed to Sunday afternoon) they bother to serve fresh food, but I just did not like the food at all.
