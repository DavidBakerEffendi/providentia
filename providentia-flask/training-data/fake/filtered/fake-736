I live up the street from this new location and at first I was delighted to find we have a new Italian specialty sandwich spot in the neighborhood. I've given the place 3 tries and have pretty much been let down each time by both the food and the service. I gave it another shot today and ordered the Godfather. My Godfather hero consisted of regular ham, regular salami, and regular pepperoni. Really?? That can't be right.... I could have gotten this basic meat at Subway. No prosciutto, capicola, mortadella, or sopressata. I don't even think they had these meats on hand which is crazy. The staff/customer service also needs some help if they intend to survive. This location continues to give the John's Deli franchise a bad name and it's sad.
