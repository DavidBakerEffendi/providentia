I've been coming here since it first opened & have tried literally everything on the menu & it's all fabulous. I wept the day I moved out of the neighborhood, only because I wouldn't have access to my weekly pork chop sandwich anymore, but I still use any excuse to go back & relive the glory days. The baguettes & veggies are fresh & they don't skimp on the spice if you ask for it-- heaven for a spice girl like me! Definitely the best bahn mi in NYC (& I've had lots). Extra tip: the coffee is sweet & strong! Drool.
