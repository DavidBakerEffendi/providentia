Went here for a late breakfast on a Tues. The place is very nice on the inside, and the food was very good. I had the banana and chocolate pancakes which were very sweet but tasty. My friend had the Irish breakfast which was also very tasty. Waitress and host were friendly enough and the service was good. The prices were very reasonable for the quality of food that was served. Overall a pleasant late breakfast and I will definitely go back to try their weekend brunch.
