I went to the restaurant on 6/16 with my family. We were greeted and escorted to our table with no wait time.  My problem began when we had to wait for the waitress for over ten minutes, she just walked past our table each time not acknowledging our presence. We didn't realize she was our waiter until we flagged down another waiter(James) to ask who our waiter was.  She finally decided to show her face at our table. She did not introduce herself, didn't apologize for the wait and wasn't curteous. She answered a quick question about the BBQ grill and Walked away. She didn't ask if we had any further questions or if we were ready to at least place an order for drinks.  We waited for over 5 minutes while she ignored us again. We saw James passing by so again we flagged him down he apologized and decided to help her by at least taking our orders for drinks. I guess she was tired of us so she informed him to take over our table and let's just say our evening turned around to be very delightful. James was entertaining, attentive and very accommodating.  I know a lot of people have issues with the service, all I can recommend is to just request for James as a waiter  your service will be tremendously different guarantee.
