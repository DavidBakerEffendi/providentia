Small, quaint, well attended...BYOB ; that's OK! I had reservations and was seated right away Service was very good, but I wasn't impressed with food. Soup was mediocre some kinda squash with avocado.. My companion said hers was good ...not outstanding (Shrimp , pasta dish ). I had Veal/mushroom dish) OK . Veal was too thin for me and the sauce didn't have the flavor I expected..Prices were good.I'd eat there again; try different dish
