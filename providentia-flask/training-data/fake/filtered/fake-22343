Caponata with raisins, sweet, spicy, opposite pleasures brought together. Joe Brancaccio may hate the world but he loves good food and takes pride in bringing you pleasure. I asked him to create a picnic lunch for two for twenty bucks-there was enough left over from our meal to feed a pal half a flank steak sandwich and some roasted cauliflower, it cured his depression. I always wondered, Italian make great lunches and dinners- what about breakfast? Fontina,  scrambled eggs . marinara sauce, enough pleasure to recover from a hangover and nightmares or enough oral pleasure to remind you of your tastiest dreams. Brancaccio's could be in a yuppy neighborhood making a mint but instead it is in a real Brooklyn neighborhood so you can buy food without  pretension spoiling the experience.
