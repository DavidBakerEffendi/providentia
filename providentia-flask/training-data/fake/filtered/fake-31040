Went there last night and the burgers were awesome...I recommend the cowboy because its awesome. Its a great atmosphere...I don't know why people make a fuss about the new haven one compared to this one...its a different scene. Stop being biased!! Anyway, angela and kari were super helpful and its a great place to relax and get away from the horror of the boston Post Road. One of the few bars I actually like on that boring Sttreet. And the chocolate cr√®me brulee.. changed my life a little bit..every bite I had a single tear drop... thanks Kari and thank you Angela
