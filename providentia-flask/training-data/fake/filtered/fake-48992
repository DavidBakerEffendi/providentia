Although the last time I ordered from Calabrese, the pizza was slim on sauce and cheese, I am still going to give it 4 stars because they have a good track record with me. Usually, the pizza is fresh with a perfect crust that is crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. The sauce is not overpowering, but definitely flavorful. Unlike the other pizzerias in the area, it is also reasonably priced with a short wait time. And lastly, the staff are all incredibly friendly. After trying different places in Bloomfield and Montclair only to feel disappointed, I finally found Calabrese and it is now the only pizza I eat in this town.
