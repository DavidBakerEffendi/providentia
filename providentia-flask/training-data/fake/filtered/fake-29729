This was the third time we got to enjoy Bibou. I discovered it by chance as a reservation became available when in fact you need to plan at least four weeks in advance if you even want to get a chance to eat there. It is a small restaurant with lots of great parking next door. Cash only! Bibou serves traditional French Cuisine, escargots, duo de foie gras, duck, stripped bass which you can compliment to your liking with wine from your own cellar as this is one of the great BYOB restaurants of Philadelphia. The amazing food of Chef Pierre is served to perfection by the well trained and friendly staff led by Charlotte his wife. If you want a great food experience and a fun evening, Bibou will deliver without fail. Bon Appetit!
