LOVE this place...don't get me wrong with the 4 stars cause I'd really like to give it 5.. First time my boyfriend & I went was blown away...the food is truly incredible. Ordered some classic meatballs for starters and then the veggie meatballs with pesto on the sandwich. We went on a Monday night and it was still busy but no major wait. We sat at the bar and had to wait just a little longer than we would have to get our meal but the drinks kept us occupied and the bar tender was very attentive. Second time was very excited to eat the veggie with pesto again. We ordered the same exact menu as the first time...meatballs in sauce first but everything came at once. The meatballs in the sauce were warm and the pesto veggie sandwich was unfortunately not warm at all. We came late on a Sundry afternoon so maybe they were just wiped out from brunch. However, will def go back because the food is very good-stff terrific and its easy and the price is right!
