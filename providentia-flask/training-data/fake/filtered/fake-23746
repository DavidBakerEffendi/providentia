The wait and the price is worth it. If you are willing to spend the money I would highly recommend the Grilled skirt steak with roasted beets and horseradish cream. Seriously the best entree I had ever ordered at a restaurant.  Steak cooked to perfection, amazingly seasoned beets and the horseradish cream topped it all off. I was tempted to lick the plate clean. My boyfriend ordered the chargrilled burger with roquefort and shoestrings. It was just okay. The cheese was a bit too strong and I felt that it overpowered  the entire burger. I would absolutely go back and order the steak.
