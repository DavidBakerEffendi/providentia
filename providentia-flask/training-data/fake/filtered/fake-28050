I was finally able to book a table at Amada, and I wasent disappointed.  The ambiance of the place is excellent with its clean traditional Spanish feel. They have a well rounded beer and wine menu, offering some unique brews that are often hard to find.   All the meats were delectable, the olives were sensational, and I still dream about the mushrooms.  The flatbreads are amazing, I would suggest the short rib.  The portions are well sized for tapas, and definitely worth the money. The only two complaints that I can make are 1) the service was very quick (which can be a good thing but not in this instance), would have liked more time to enjoy the wonderful food.  And 2) the coffee was unsatisfactory.  I may have had high expectations for the coffee but it lacked any flavor at all.  Not something you expect from such a high quality restaurant.  I will definitely return however.
