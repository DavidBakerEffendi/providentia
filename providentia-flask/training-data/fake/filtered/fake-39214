Loved the service.  Main course was tremendous.   Appetizer promised much, but delivered 'unusual' mix of crab meat, carpaccio, and arugula.    Fussy presentation for what seemed to be good quality food. Thought drinks were overpriced, given locale.  This is not Manhattan, but they are charging Manhattan prices.
