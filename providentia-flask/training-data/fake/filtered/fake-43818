My boyfriend and I went here on a whim around 9:30pm on a Friday night because he lives right around the corner. It had been recommended to us several times and we thought why not?! I called ahead to see if there was a wait and they told me to come right in which was really nice. I thought maybe they weren't that crowded but when we got there most tables were full. Maybe we just got lucky?? Our waitress was very sweet and helpful especially with their extensive wine list. We ordered the calamari as an app and it was better than most I've had in NYC. Being from the south I have standards for anything fried and NYC rarely gets it right. For dinner, I ordered the veal paillaird which the waitress got really excited about because apparently its the chef's fav and it is rarely ordered. Well, I loved it! His spin on the french dish was absolutely perfect. I'm not one for eating my entire plate but I devoured this! My boyfriend ordered the burger medium and it actually came pretty well-done. He said that it tasted good but just charred which he does not like. I happened to steal a few of his fries and they were pretty yummy! One bad thing: lighting. I couldn't see anything in there and I am a 27 yr old with perfect vision!
