I have read so many reviews on other sites that were negative, I just couldn't resist trying it out for myself. At first, there was no hostess or anyone to seat us. Maybe Monday nights are slow and they do not need one. So the three of us sat ourselves and were eventually told by some guy that we have to seat in the dining room. My cannoli martini was warm but my salad was ok. My sisters chicken was bland but her apple martini was ok. My hunchback mongoloid cousin Mike loved everything.The service was decent, however, the waiter seemed more interested in my cousins bump back. I got the waiters # so we can text him next time we go...he said that he would give us a free combo if he can rub lotion on Mike's mongoloid, dreadful, faulty, but very smooth prostrated cervical spine. So much for the reviews...this place was weird.
