Service was poor and downright unprofessional on a busy night.   Some of the food was great, some ok.   We arrived a bit early for a 7:45 reservation on Valentine's day .   The restaurant had clearly overbooked, as we and other couples waited about an hour after our reservation time to be seated.   But rather then communicate empathy for the patrons, the staff seemed exasperated by any question from the waiting patrons.  Although the staff added "sorry," to explanations, when people queried about the wait, they seem to do so grudgingly.   We finally sat down at our table at 8:50.   When the waiter asked whether we were ready to order, my husband said "I have a question about the menu."  Without waiting for his question, however, the waiter launched into an explanation that we would get four courses.  My husband said "Thank you but what I wanted to ask about was the veal."   The waiter gave a sigh of frustration.   The veal proved to be of poor quality, although the duck was outstanding. A couple seated two tables away from us left after waiting for more than an hour and half to be served their main courses.  They had a 7:30 reservation and left Blu after 10 pm and still had not received their dinner.  Again the staff, which should have been falling over themselves with apologies, came over to our table and complained about how it wasn't their fault! "Just a series of miscommunications."     We will not be going back and would encourage others to avoid this poorly staffed restaurant.
