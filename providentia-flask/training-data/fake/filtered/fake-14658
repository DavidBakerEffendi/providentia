I'd give this place a 3.5 to a 4. It was alright. I came here with a friend a few days ago and like I said, it was alright. The food was pretty good but it did take a little while to come out. I understand it is new but I think the kitchen needs to speed itself up a bit. Both me and my buddy got expert built burgers, I got a beer and he got an adult milkshake. The drink selections are very different so we both enjoyed that. We'll probably do the beer samplers next. However, management seemed a bit on the shaky side and didn't have too much to say when they came to our tables. Our waitress was probably the best part of the experience. To sum it up, she was a very cute brunette who seemed to know how to please a customer. She made us laugh and gave some great suggestions. I'm unable to remember her name but I do remember her bright lipstick so that made it a lot easier for her to stand out from the other servers. She was very apologetic when it came to the food taking a little while and kept us entertained with a joke and a smile every time she came around. Management could use a little work but I assume they're just getting to know this place as well, or perhaps this is their first management position. Hopefully as this place settles in everything will pick up. Our server told us the days she works so I'll most likely be back to request her as my waitress and I'll definitely be trying the beer sampler.
