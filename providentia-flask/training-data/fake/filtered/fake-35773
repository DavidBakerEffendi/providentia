My friend said the lobster roll here rivals the famous Hamptons lobster rolls.  I have not been impressed with NYC lobster rolls in general.  This place rocks!  I have been back three times and can't bring myself to have anything but the lobster roll.  WHAT is the sauce??  I also asked for extra lobster the first time and there was an extra charge but I appreciate them giving me what I want.  However, I no longer order extra because there are whole pieces of lobster and plenty. I also order the butter lettuce salad every time, this is a simple but flavorful salad and they consistently have used the best part of the lettuce, which is unheard of for NY. Please don't take this off the menu!
