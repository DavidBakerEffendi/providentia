Came here for brunch.  After all the hype about the Black Label burger, I had to try it.  I won't say it was the best burger I ever had, as some people do, but it definitely delivered and I left satisfied.  I actually appreciated that it wasn't too big and didn't make me feel like I wanted to be rolled out of the place after devouring the burger and plate of fries (which were also delicious).  Easily in the top tier for burgers, but $26 is just too much.  If it were clearly the best one I'd ever had I'd say fine, but there are a lot of great burgers for much less.  And the service also wasn't the best.  So 5 stars for taste, and minus 1 for value and service.
