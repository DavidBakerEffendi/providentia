This place is terrible.  If you enjoy an incredibly rude waitstaff then this is the place for you.  If you prefer a pleasant dining experience then stay away.  I would never go here again.  The waitstaff are too busy socializing amongst themselves to pay any attention to your order.  If you ask them a question about why they forgot to bring something to you expect a major attitude. Also, everything was incredibly over-salted. The burger was almost inedible.  The Black Label Burger at Minetta Tavern is better by leaps and bounds.
