3 stars for the nice food we got which was a bucket of chicken and 3 sides and minus 2 stars for the poor service we got. We rung to place an order and was told 30 minutes and it will be ready. We get there and are told to it wont be too long....... an hour later we go in and ask what is up and our food is magical just sitting there?? Anyway the food was nice but come on, how hard is it to go that little extra for the person paying ? I don't know if ill go back anymore after that...
