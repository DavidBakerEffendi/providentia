The couple across from us was absolutely gushing over their meal when we were seated; I optimistically ordered the duck which was so chewy and flavorless that I sent it back.  They did not bring me another and charged us the full $29.  Taking a hint from the happy couple we ordered the same dessert they were eating - it was average but at least edible creme brulee.  They got up and hugged their waiter telling him it was the best meal they've ever had - we grouchily poked at out sandpaper-esque shortbread cookies and frowned as nearly every member of the wait staff and the chef walked by our table probably to glare at the women who sent the duck back!  I never thought I'd pay $80+ for a meal and leave hungry.  This was an utter disappointment.  At least the ship was pretty.
