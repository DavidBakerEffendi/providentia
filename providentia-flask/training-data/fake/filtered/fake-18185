We took my husband's dad here for father's day and it was absolutely delightful.  The interior is adorable and the crepes are divine! I got one with scallops and tomato sauce, my husband stuck with something non adventurous (egg/cheese/ham) and my father in law got the steak au poivre.  We all left satisfied and ready to return!
