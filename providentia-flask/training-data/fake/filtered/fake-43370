The only things I can recommend here are the truffle cheddar pretzel and siracha peas. The service is so slow and the food so bland, you would be better off cooking your dinner at home. Or getting pizza. I've been here previously to get drinks, but was interested in trying out the menu. We were seated quickly with a bottle of water and no glasses with which to drink. 20 minutes later, after ordering at the bar and not receiving our drinks, the waitress finally comes over. No siracha peas, jerky, or rose. We place our order and wait another 20 minutes for our drinks, 30 minutes for our food. The food was mediocre. The Shroom Burger was tasteless and my Kale Salad could've been tossed together by a 10 year old. Â When my my boyfriend joined us later and wanted to order, we waited so long to be served, he left to get pizza. By the way, still no glasses for our water. By the lowest New York City service standards, this was a terrible experience. Go somewhere else.
