Best Bloody Mary's in NYC, the place is gorgeous and the entrees all tasted good and presented simply and elegantly.  Can't beat this spot on a Sunday afternoon.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I just think the pickle selection was as good as it should have been, especially with "pickle" being in the name of the restaurant.  I've had better pickled stuff at farmers market stands.  Overall though really hip place.
