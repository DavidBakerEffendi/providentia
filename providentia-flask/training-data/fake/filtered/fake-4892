If visiting Philadelphia and you want to get the Philadelphia local vibe, Pat's (and Italian Market) is really a great place. As it is not categorized as a yelp tourist point of interest, but a restaurant, I will base the balance of my review on Pat's as a place to eat. It's popularity and fame are based on the past. There are many places to get really great cheese steaks in Philadelphia. Different businesses will often have a specific reason theirs is best (the meat, the bread, the cheeses, etc).  Pat's reason to visit is the history. Once upon a time this was indeed the definitive place for a great steak sandwich. The competition is pretty tough in Philly and Pat's has not really kept pace. Nothing wrong with sticking with the original or classic, but the sub you will actually eat from Pat's will not live up to the great sub you hope you will get and could get elsewhere. They try to pawn off their abrupt and rude service as Philly charming.  No, it is just out of touch customer service. The serving size is lower end of average compared to what you get throughout the city. Meat is pretty good, not phenomenal. The cheese is towards the bottom of the list. The roll is decent. Overall, that adds up to a 2 star "Meh, I've experienced better" review. They make decent steak hoagies / subs here. They just do not belong on a foodie's Best of Philadelphia lists. It is an old recipe that has not kept pace with changes in the market. Depending on what you think most important in a steak sandwich, you will find better. If you have no single item that is most important and just want an overall great steak sandwich, you can do better in that way, too. Pat's best is really the entry level steak sandwich standard nowadays. Most every decent place serving steak sandwiches offer a quality comparable to, or better than, Pat's.
