Just had lunch for the first and last time.  Ordered a half sandwich and salad (same price as a full sandwich and fries).  I've gotten more salad as lettuce and tomato for a burger.  Told the waiter and he said yeah that's how it is.  Spoke to a manager on the way out and all he wanted to do was blame the waiter.  When a new restaurant is as empty as this place was it should have been a sign. Charlie Brown's was better and looked what happen to it!  Nancy R.
