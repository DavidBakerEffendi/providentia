I went to this Restaurant a few days ago for the first time. Â I was really unsatisfied with the food and especially with its services; the waitress who served me was rude and disorganized and she smelt like she was smoking back there all the time. It was really expensive considering the quality of food, I put 10% tip for her that night and today when I was checking my bank account I saw that I have been charged for 20% tip! It is really crazy! I will never go back to that restaurant and I won't recommend it at all.
