I live in Astoria and my roommate has RAVED about this place ever since I moved.  He even mentioned it when I was looking at the apartment.  I finally went last week (5 months later) and was not disappointed.  The celery root soup was the best soup I have ever tasted.  I have actually been thinking about it often since then and have even been searching recipes to see if I would be able to make it at home! The rest of the meal was ok... I was dining vegetarian with my friend and we had the rigatoni for our meal.  Not too impressive.  Could have used some cheese or maybe a bit more garlic or more flavorful tomatoes?   However, as we typically dine, wine is important.  The wine service was great and the waiter was very busy but still took the time to make sure we tasted a good variety so that we were happy.  Very cozy atmosphere, could see myself coming back even by myself to sit at the bar with a glass of wine and some soup :)
