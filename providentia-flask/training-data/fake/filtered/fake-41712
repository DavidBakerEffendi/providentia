It seems that there are very few restaurant/cafes left in NJ that give you that warm, family-friendly atmosphere plus  great food and reasonable prices you are always searching for.  Well, after the closing of my favorite café a few years ago, I thought I was finished.  I searched  around Nutley  at one eatery or another for several years. Then, voila, the Chestnut Café and Eatery thankfully opened its doors. What a find!  You can eat alone or bring your friends or family and kids and grand-kids, as I have done several times.  It is a pleasure to enjoy the great food and quick attention that you receive as soon as you arrive.  The coffee selection alone is worth the return visit. When I found out that the chef was from my old favorite café, I realized that there was nothing on the menu that you would not be very favorably impressed with.  Always great taste, great novelty in all aspects of your dining and eating experience. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to anyone looking for a memorable breakfast, brunch or dinner in a delightful atmosphere, truly homey and family-warm and friendly!
