One of the best restaurants ever! You must eat here. My wife has spent time in Istanbul and we have Turkish friends, so we can say that the food is authentic and incredibly delicious. Great service, nice atmosphere. There were a couple things on the menu that weren't available when we visited, but we found great alternatives. The almond pudding was so good, we came back the next day just to have it with coffee/tea.
