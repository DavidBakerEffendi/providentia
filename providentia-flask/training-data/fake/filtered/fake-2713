This place has some serious attitude.  Of course you expect a little bit of that ...we are in Philly after all, but I rather of not heard the head chef bitching cause I placed a food order.  The bar tender had serious attitude and was happy to serve watered down drinks containing little to no actual alcohol.  This is the oldest trick in the book if you have a rowdy bar crowd, but for a well behaved good paying customer ...no excuse is good enough. Oh yeah and don't go upstairs,  dark, dirty, and depressing.
