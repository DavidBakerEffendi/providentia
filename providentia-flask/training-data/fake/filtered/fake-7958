Ive been to Hot tomatos several times and I must say I havent had a bad experience yet. The Food is delicious..especially the CHEESY garlic bread. The crab cake is amazing there as well. They have a great wine and beer selection. If your looking for a great time, with friends or family I would definately suggest giving HOT TOMOATOS a try!!! GREAT location right next to bushnell park and the patio is well placed if you want that city feel as you eat. The owner and workers are very nice and always asking patrons if there is anything else needed or wanted. Â GO GO GO for great Italian food and good times!!
