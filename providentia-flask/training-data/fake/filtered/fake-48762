An unpretentious, charming little spot. Showed up on a week night for dinner with a few friends and was completely smitten. From the beautiful ornate cup and saucer the Lily of the Valley cocktail came in, to the creative menu offerings, this place is the complete package. Staff was attentive & knew the menu. Service was seamless and un-intrusive. My friends and I ordered almost everything off the menu to share and every plate left our table completely spotless.  They had me at the Bacon Tater Tots & Smoked Char Rillette. The Gnocchi was so delicate and creamy at the same time.  I'm not big on desserts but both the Cardamum Panna Cotta & Malted ice cream was a sensory exercise. So elegant, refined and balanced. Absolutely going back to the Eddy on my next visit to NYC.
