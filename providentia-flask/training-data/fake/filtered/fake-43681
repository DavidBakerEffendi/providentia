First off, I'm really beautiful.  Like a model.  So I go here and I drink cappuccinos so I can do everyone in Greenpoint a favor.  Fuck that, Greenpoint AND Williamsburg.  I think Manhattan people even come here.  They definitely do.  What suckers.  There are literally a thousand places like this in Soho.  Anyway, people look at me and smile and wonder 'Wow who is that beautiful person drinking that cappuccino?'.  Well it's me, Greenpoint.  Gibby Fucking Haynes.  You're welcome.  Try the pancakes.
