Silk City has a great atmosphere, good food and drink.  It's colorful tile mosaics and dramatic lighting make it a treat for your eyes.  The crowd is generally in their early to mid-20's, a bit young for my taste.  Also, DJ DeeJay (Saturday Night fixture) is more than disappointing.  He doesn't mix much, and he doesn't seem to put a lot of creative energy into his craft.  I know many iPods that could have produced a better, or at least similar product.  So, the music and mixing was disappointing (no surprises played either), but it is a fun place to frequent as they also tend to draw a neighborhood crowd.
