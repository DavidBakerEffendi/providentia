This place is worth driving out of your way to, no matter where you are coming from.  Make reservations or bust!  I used to date someone who brought me here all the time, and I loved dressing up to make it a special evening. My favorite is their "Mezza Luna Ravioli", which is home made raviolis stuffed with mascarpone cheese, freshly made pesto, and served with an authentic walnut sauce that I haven't had anywhere else, which is made with asparagus, brandy and walnuts, I just can't figure out what else they put in it. I've also had their grilled octopus (which was smoky in flavor, I'm not sure how they got it to be so smoky) and seared blue marlin (which was impeccable in flavor, I'm just not sure how they make it so good).  I have only had blue marlin one other time in my life, which was a five star restaurant as well, and couldn't resist the opportunity. Their Mediterranean sea bass is another favorite of mine, which is highly recommended.
