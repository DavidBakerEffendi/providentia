Horrible experience!  Let me first say that the food was good, not great.  My main complaint is with the staff, most notably the person who appeared to be the manager or owner, and also our waiter.  The real problem seemed to arise when the 4 of us shared 2 salads and 2 entrees.  It was clear that he was not happy with this.  We had to remind the waiter and the hostess 3 times to just bring out an iced tea.. The service we received was rude and we all felt that they did not appreciate our being there, I'm guessing because we each did not order our own entree.  We decided to just pay the bill and get out and have dessert elsewhere.  And yes, we chose not to leave a tip, NEVER did that before.  We left the cash for the bill on the table and walked out.  We were half a block away when the waiter came yelling that we short changed him $5.  That certainly did NOT happen.  He showed us the pile of money which did not have the $5 bill that I personally added to the pile.  He was yelling like a madman calling us Cheap B#$%*es^ and F@#$%   B#$%^es and then Lesbians. What???  He was screaming that he was going to call the police if we didn't give him the $5.   He was carrying on like a crazed angry maniac over $5?.  Clearly, he was angry that there was no tip but his verbal attacks were certainly uncalled for, overblown, unprofessional, ridiculous and disrespectful.  Get this man to anger management training pronto!!!
