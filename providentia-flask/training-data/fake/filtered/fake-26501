The owner was EXTREMELY rude to us.  Basically he waited until we paid our bill and then kicked us out so he could seat more people.  We were a fairly large party, spent lots of money and were not overstaying our welcome and were about to leave anyway.  The wait staff was extremely slow, and if they wanted us to leave they didn't need to sell us desserts and then have them come out 20-30 min later!!!  The owner was extremely rude.  He waited until we paid -- so we would give a good tip-- and pounced on us and treated us like dirt.  We frequented this place often and we will never go back because of the terrible owner and how he INSULTED us.   He really showed his true colors as a greedy person that doesn't care about the patrons, only the money.  What goes around comes around. (it was the old indian man)
