good bar scene but the food was bad. i think the appetizers were frozen and microwaved. entree not much better   lots of garlic and butter on the salmon to hide the flavor (or lack of).  service not great either.  should have known better when they had immediate seating available in the middle of the pre-theater sitting. avoid if possibel.
