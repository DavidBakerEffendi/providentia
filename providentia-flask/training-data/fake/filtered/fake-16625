10.95 all day, everyday for the three roll special? I am sold. When I went I got the california, spicy tuna, and philly roll. All delicious. They were also making some of the specialty rolls when I was there which not only look delicious but also were visually awesome. Quick service and great prices. Only reason not 5 stars is because seating is limited on the inside so not good for big groups.
