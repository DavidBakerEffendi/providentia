Cuban Pete's used to be a resturant that I would recommend to friends, but after last night's disrespectful/ discriminatory act by either the owner or manager (some guy with a mustache) I would never eat there again. Cuban Pete's is ignorant in recognizing the fact that someone can be disabled without appearing to be. DO NOT EAT AT A PLACE WHERE THE MANGAGEMENT CAN BE SOO DISRESPECTFUL TO THE CUSTOMERS.....THE CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT!
