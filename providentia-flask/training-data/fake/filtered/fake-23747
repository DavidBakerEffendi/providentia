We heard great things about this place, and since we were in town (NYC) we decided to check it out.  We discovered that it was located in the village, so we jumped in a cab and headed down from times square on a Saturday night.  We arrived around 7pm, and there was a 2.5 hour wait.  Our first reaction was to leave, but then we decided to stick it out and drink at the bar in hopes that the food was worth a 2.5hr wait.   The bartender was really busy, but when he got to us he made some great recommendations from their beer list.  They definitely have some unique beers, many of which I tried and liked.   About 2 hours in we were sat and ordered the sea bass special and the burger / fries.  The food was great across the board.  The atmosphere in the place is also great, although very loud and bustling.   It's definitely a fun place for a casual dinner.  A tad pricey though.
