New to the area and extremely happy i found this place.  I was recommended by friends and was not disappointed one bit.  The homemade bread basket is a perfect way to start any meal.  I have heard great things about the fresh figs so I started my dinner with those. Stuffed with marscapone cheese and pine nuts and wrapped in thinly sliced prosciutto, be sure to try these as well!  For dinner I had the shrimp amalfi.  Jumbo shrimp with portabello mushrooms, broccoli and sundried tomatoes over pasta.  Amazing to say the least!  The jumbo shrimp will keep me coming back again and again.  I finished my meal with one of the best espressos I have had since my vacation to Italy.  Go check this place out!
