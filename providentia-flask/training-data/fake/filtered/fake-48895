POOR SERVICE! After we were told the wait would be 15 minutes, we waited an hour and a half without being told anything-they forgot about us. We ended up ordering at the bar and finally being moved over to a table where our waiter deserted us for a staff meeting. Mac and cheese was decent but would NOT go back.
