The real deal. Turn off Flatbush across from the Barclays Center and you're not in Brooklyn anymore, Dorothy! Save yourself the airfare to italia and pop in here for an authentic Italian experience. The pasta is made a mano - try the squid ink pastas. The fried calamari is light and not that greasy over-battered you've had elsewhere. Â Burrata - ethereal. Even a plate of chicken and roasted potatoes was something other than just chicken and roasted potatoes. Desserts to die for. If they're not made there, someone knows where to get your idea of the best pana cotta, ricotta cheese cake, tiramisu. The wine was a little too warm, but so was the night and we didn't want anything to break the spell, so transported were we. Can't wait to try more of the menu offerings.
