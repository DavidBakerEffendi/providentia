I've had some excellent dishes here, a special hamburger with goat cheese, bacon and raspberry sauce, and some really meh dishes, a baked brie that was cold and overly sweet. That said husband and I go here occasionally, and generally enjoy the experience.  The service is friendly and attentive every time and the space is nice. Overall it can be a bit hit or miss....one item I can highly recommend is the potato chips topped with a blue cheese sauce and some other items, very good.  Also lots of beer and bourbon offerings if that's your thing.
