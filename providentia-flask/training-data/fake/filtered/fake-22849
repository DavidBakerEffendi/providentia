I wanted to stretch my legs after being snowed in and left home in search of food and beer.  Instead of going to my usual Vietnamese place, I tried Pho Saigon since I was at the distributor next door.  I ordered the chicken vermicelli with a spring roll.  The only good thing I can is that the vermicelli is very good.  The spring roll was burnt and greasy.  I took one bite and threw it out.  The chicken came with the skin on, which I don't prefer.  I would have been willing to overlook it, but like the spring roll, it was also very greasy.  I might give this place another shot to try out the pho, but otherwise I won't be back.
