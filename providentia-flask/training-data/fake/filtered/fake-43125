Pleasant little place. Not an extensive menu but what we got was very good (chicken jerk, which is not at all what it sounds like) and cabbage salad, which I am going to try to get the recipe for from them, on a non-compete basis. They actually warned us against ordering too much - always nice in a restaurant. People pleasant and helpful.
