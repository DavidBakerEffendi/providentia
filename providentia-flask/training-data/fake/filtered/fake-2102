Lovely experience. Came highly recommended by friends in the neighborhood. Wonderful summer menu with great cocktails. Our handsome waiter (with the thickest beard) recommendations were spot on and answered all of our million questions. The bass dish was fantastic as well as the strawberry salad. Tiny spot well worth the wait! Definitely will return. Kudos to the chief! Thanks!!
