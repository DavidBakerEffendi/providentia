Black n Brew is awesome!  Is anyone else tired of pessimistic people having more to say than optimists?  I had to voice my opinion in response to the negative comments on here re: black n brew.  They're probably just those angry people who are never satisfied or only happy with services in the short term.  I go to black n brew about once a week, and would go more often if it was closer to me.  The food is delicious and creative, the staff (baristas and management) is always efficient and pleasant, and the atmosphere is delightful.  Keep up the good reviews so businesses like black n brew can expand, and pessimists are drown out!
