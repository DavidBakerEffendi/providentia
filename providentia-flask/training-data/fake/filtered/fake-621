This is a good new Thai place in the site of the old Warsaw Cafe. My wife and I have been three times since it opened about a week ago, and each of the six dishes we've tried has been great. My favorite so far is the Pad Khimao, which was nice and spicy. If you're not into spicy food, most of the other dishes are mild (the menu alerts you to the spicier ones, and you can also specify your preferred spiciness on a 1-5 scale). The service has been good, both for take-out and dining in. And the space has been decorated very tastefully. Since it's on a residential part of 16th St., just south of Spruce, there's a very nice neighborhood-treasure-to-be feeling to the restaurant. The slightly out-of-the-way location seems to have limited their business so far, but hopefully the crowds will start coming once the word of mouth advertising spreads about their good food. Jasmine Rice is worth a try. Good food, friendly service, and a nicely decorated space.
