Delicious! My husband and I are a bit obsessed with Stix! As vegans, we have many delicious options and have never been disappointed. Their kale, jalape√±o hummus, fries, couscous, lentil salad and vegetable skewers are not to be missed! We are always surrounded by people eating non-vegan items and they are always raving about how good it tastes. Always friendly and always delicious!
