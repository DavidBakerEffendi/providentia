Went to this place for dinner with high expectations because of the high rating on Yelp and the line of people I always see during the weekend, but I should have read through the reviews before! Seems like their brunch is a hit. Dinner was alright, but it's not like something exceptional I expected. The place was pretty big inside - it's actually amazed me because I've seen this place gets super packed over the weekend. I'll probably go give another shot on their brunch.
