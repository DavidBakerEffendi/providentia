I have to agree with most people on here when they say bad/horrible experience. I would NOT suggest this place to anyone. Server made many excuses why it took so long to get a mixed drink.....mind you it was a Sunday afternoon approx. 3:30pm so they weren't really busy at all. $11 for the smallest cheese steak sandwich I ever had. Plainly just not a place I would recommend or go to again.
