So good!  The service at Three Letters is amazing and the food is too.  I had the fried pickles and fried tofu sandwich which have amazing sauces.  The drink selection was good as well.  I am a beer man myself, and they do not disappoint with the variety.  Though I am an avid beer drinker, I am a pickle shot fan so I had to try what they offered.  The tequila and beet pickle juice was a great combination that I had never had or even thought of. I will be returning soon to enjoy more of Three Letters menu.
