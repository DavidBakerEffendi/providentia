Had a reservation at 9pm and showed up 8:50pm. Manager told us to take care of us in 10mins. Manager said customers paid already and should leave shortly. 9:30pm we still didn't get seated nor did anybody offer us sth to drink. At least we got sth to drink after we complained to the Manager a 2nd time. 9:40pm talking to the Manager again. He feels sorry for the guests as they are over 60 and he doesn't want to rush them out although they paid over 30mins ago. 9:50pm: want to leave, but get seated now. Only 3 entrees available out of about 10...out of words. People like this shouldn't run a restaurant...
