Cornerstone cafe is on of my favorite places to eat in or grab food to go in Alphabet City. A varied menu with everything from cheap, delicious breakfast ($4 for 2 eggs, potatoes, salad, and toast) to yummy paninis to a solid dinner. Their coffee drinks are perfect as well. The owner is super friendly, and the rest of the staff is lovely as well.
