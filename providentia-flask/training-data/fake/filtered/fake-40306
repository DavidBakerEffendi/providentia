I just visited for the first time. We arrived at 4 pm where they don't serve for an hour. They sat us and served us cocktails and bread.  Once 5 pm hit we were able to order. Two of us had the pork chop, Mac and cheese with green beans......Amazzzzzzingggg!!!!!!!!  One had jerk wings the other fried wings..... Everyone stated their food was well seasoned.  Cheryl was nice and attentive to all patrons......,, I'm going back for brunch....,,
