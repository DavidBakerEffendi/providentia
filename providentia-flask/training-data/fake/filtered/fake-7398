I've had dinner at Barbuto on three occasions and would say the experiences have varied greatly.  Most recently however, I took a friend for a quiet Sunday evening meal al fresco.  The food was good, but not great, the overriding criticism we both had was the service--outright negligent.  We had to ask for bread, our request for information on a wine on the wine list took twenty minutes (the waitress with an attitude came back with a printout!), and after ordering a cold bottle of something white finally had to ask another waiter to bring a bucket of ice.  For the price and reputation, I would not recommend this to anyone.  Head to Barbone in the East Village instead--hands down a far better establishment and the wait staff are friendly, warm, and accommodating.  Besides, the food is a whole lot better too!
