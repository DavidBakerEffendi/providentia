I too really want to like the Pilgrim, but the service is just horrible.  They have a few good servers but the management is terrible.  I have witnessed numerous fights between the staff.  God forbid if you ask for a booth, the hosts roll their eyes at you.  The food is ok but not worth the bs.  We used to go all the time but we just can't deal with this place anymore.  Last time I was there the poor guy next to me ordered a burger without cheese.  They sent it out with cheese and then when he nicely sent it back they scraped the cheese, flipped the burger and tried to redeliver the same one.  In short you should stay away!!
