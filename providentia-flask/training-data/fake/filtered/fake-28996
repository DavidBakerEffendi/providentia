A true gem in Soho! Travelled from Montreal to New York and fell on this amazing place. Can definitely feel the French and homemade touches from the decor to the food. I was there the weekend and went there twice while I stayed in NYC. Absolutely loved their famous cookie and food on the menu ... Ie quiche red peppers and eggplant and tartinette prosciutto and goat cheese. Delish! Service is personable and friendly felt like I was home. Definitely coming back when I'm in town, our new stop in NYC!
