Have been here before  with a group while staying at the Desmond Tutu Center...and it was pretty good.  Stopped in this time by myself and had a less than great experience.  Food was good, cosmo I ordered good too.  The service was the issue.  Was seated at the bar and was invisible!  I thought about walking out just to see if I would get some attention.  As a former bartender, don't ignore that single person, it will cost you!
