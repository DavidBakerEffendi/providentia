This restaurant is lucky it has amazing food. The service here is horrendous.  They don't take reservations on Friday or Saturday nights, and are beyond busy.  Not only that, but they make you wait in this tiny little area for your table while waiters are pushing through you.  If you have a big party, forget about it.  They make every person wait inside until you are seated, which will definitely be over an hour wait. Last night I went with a party of 8 people, and was able to make a reservation so there was no wait which was nice.  However, the service is HORRENDOUS.  I was the last person to arrive in my party, and rather than walking me to my table, the hostess pointed and said "oh they're in the front on the left".  Really?  How lazy can you POSSIBLY be?  Every single person that works here has a nasty attitude, management included.  Even when they called to confirm my reservation, I picked up the phone and listened to a woman talking to someone else in the background until she realized I had answered.  Totally unprofessional.  I understand that this is a very busy restaurant, and the staff is probably frustrated, but you know what - quit then.  You work for tips, act like it.   From nasty hostesses, to waiters who push you aside to get out of their way when you're walking through the restaurant, to inattentive waiters - this place has the worst service I have ever, ever seen. But my god, the paella is amazing.
