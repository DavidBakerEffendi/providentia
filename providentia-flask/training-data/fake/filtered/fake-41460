The food and service were absolutely incredible... My wife and I had the cod fish fritters, chicharron de pollo, plantains, ropa vieja and arroz con pollo. Everything was flavorful and delicious! The entree portions were very large. The prices were reasonable. I'd highly recommend this place to anyone who loves Cuban food. In fact, I'll be returning with a larger group on Friday! The only drawback is that they don't have a full bar (beer and wine only). Fortunately, the sangria was delicious as well.
