Ever since Kim's Fresh Fish & Sushi House in Lincoln Park left town, I've been looking for a place that has the same quality and taste i've come to love and I think Kim's Sushi 2 in West Orange might be what I've been searching for..  I took the plunge and tried their Spicy Yellow Tail roll and Spicy White Tuna roll + Miso Soup to go.  The price was reasonable, people were friendly and location's convenient.  I had good vibes about the place the entire time I was there.  It's about a half hour drive but I'm definitely going back!  There is also Man Hing in Rutherford worth mentioning, I'll probably alternate between the two from now on.  I registered just so I can write this review; I was pretty impressed with Kim's Sushi 2...  Give it a try, I bet you'll love it.
