I'm fairly easy to please, but this place could probably win over the toughest of critics. The ambiance was perfect; blending New York chic designs with comfortable country nuances is tricky to balance, but ABC Kitchen pulls it off. Loved the food. Fabulous attention to details. Leigha (my server) was awesome and knew her stuff. Prices fall between moderate/spendy, but worth every shiny penny. Will definitely be back. Can't say enough good things about this place!
