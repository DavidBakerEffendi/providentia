I walked in to this place yesterday to have a nice glass of wine with a group of my girlfriends and the first thing I see is a mouse scurrying across the floor.  I ran outside, horrified.  Needless to say, we didn't get our drink there, but my girlfriend convinced me to go back in and mention it to the waitress so she wasn't surprised when if she saw it or didn't have to deal with an angry customer.  I snuck back in, ready to dash out at any sign of movement, and told her what I had seen.  She said they have had repeated problems and have tried to exterminate many times to no avail!    I signed up on yelp just for this purpose because I just thought people should know that the waitress admitted to me that they have a severe vermin infestation problem. Gross!
