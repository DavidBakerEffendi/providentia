LOVE Rooftop 120! It is gorgeous inside and out and the perfect place to have a nice meal and fun drinks any night of the week. I love to go for their happy hour. The food is delicious, the service is great and the staff is very professional. Love the open air during the summer and they have heat lamps for the colder nights in the fall/winter. Highly recommend for a date night or a night out with your friends.
