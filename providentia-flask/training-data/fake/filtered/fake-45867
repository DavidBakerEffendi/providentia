My husband and I live a few minutes away from here and we love it! Â Great food, friendly staff, fantastic prices and a great place to watch the games! They do reverse happy hours so if you work late you can still make it. When the weather gets nicer they have a few tables outside and their entire bar wall opens up so a few of the tables in the bar area have an "outdoor" feel too. Definitely a great addition to the neighborhood!
