If you asked me last week to rate this restaurant, I would have given it 4-5 stars. This week I had a horrible experience at this place. I discovered the place in the spring and went there 4 times for lunch during a professional training. This week I had another class Monday- Friday. As I was taking a class with some friends I decided to share the cafe with them. They loved the food and the price. We decided to return the next day and asked one more person to join us. That makes five of us. Gaia called out to me, "You are back again?" I responded, "Yes, and I brought some friends." To this she responded, "Next time you can come back alone." I thought she was joking. Yesterday we tried another eatery. Today we returned (Just 4 of us). When I went to the counter to order she said to me, "You're killing me. Stop bringing all these people in here! We like to do things our way. Not like this." I was so embarrassed I turned and walked out of the restaurant. While the food is good it is not worth being treated poorly by the owner. I worked many years as a cook and I know it is a difficult job. I can only liken this to the Seinfeld episode, "Soup Nazi" only worse because at least with him you knew the rules. Gaia changes her rules and prices everyday. Also, it would be nice if the tables were cleaned so that they aren't sticky. If you cannot handle 4 people during lunch perhaps you should not be in the restaurant business. And they call Americans rude.
