My brother and I have been going here since we were kids. We are originally from Bensonhurst. We moved to upstate NY in 1979, but we still get sandwiches from DeFonte's whenever we get the chance. It is one of the best sandwich shops I have ever had the pleasure of eating at. Nothing even comes close to thier sandwiches. And if you like hot stuffed (with breadcrumbs) peppers, they can't be beat!!! All of my friends I have ever taken there, will tell you the same thing!!!
