Worst place EVER.  Staff is rude and just act as though you are bothering them...  I went with a gift card and was told I was unable to use it on take out.  What thats crazy why would I not have the option to eat there or take it home.  The man at the front counter was rude and tried to make me look foolish.  I will never go there again and am telling everyone I know to do the same.  There is a great place in Montclair, or just about anywhere is better then this place.  Dont waste your time.
