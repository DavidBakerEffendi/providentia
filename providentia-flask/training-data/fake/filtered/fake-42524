I can't believe the positive comments that I'm reading related to this resturant. This had to be the most disgusting resturant that I had ever stepped foot in. As I'm waiting for my order from a friends recommendation. I witness a man behind the counter pick up two filthy mats off the floor, and take out the garbage. After he finished his chores he went straight to the preparing food. Come on people stop allowing Restaurant owners in the city of Newark to keep feeding us Sh@t, please up your standards. I wouldn't recommend this place to my neighbors dog.
