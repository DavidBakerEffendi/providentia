I just ate there today for brunch, so I can't review the wine bar element. Overall, the food was interesting and really quite tasty.  Although it's simple, the ingredients were fresh and of noticeably high quality.  The prices wee also great. Unfortunately, the service was unconscionably slow.  we waited about 15 minutes at our table before they even took our order, and didn't get out food until about 25 minutes later.  Once we got our food, we had to point out they had forgotten part of our drink order. There were empty tables, so it wasn't like they were getting slammed. I'm willing to give them another go since they were just profiled in TONY and might have had an insane morning before we got there.
