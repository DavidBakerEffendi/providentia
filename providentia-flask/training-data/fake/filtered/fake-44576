This is my first posting on Yelp.  My friend and I got FOOD POISONING after eating at Locanda Verde this past weekend.  The snapper was undercooked, which we noticed after we each ate some of it.  We also had the steak tartare.  When we both started feeling ill later that evening, I called to inform them.  Both my friend and I were sick all night and had to see a doctor the next morning.  I called and spoke to the GM Andrew on Monday.  I told him I don't think we should be responsible for a meal that made us ill.  He said he would call me back by the end of the day or latest by Tuesday morning.  To date, I have not heard anything. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND EATING HERE.  FOOD IS NOT THAT GOOD AND YOU WILL GET FOOD POISONING.
