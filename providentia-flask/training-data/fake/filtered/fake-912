better gourmet is awesome.  during these hard times and conservative spending habits, I found a place that I can get a great healthy well balanced meal for under 10 bucks!  the ambiance is trendy, cool lounge music plays in the background, good looking crowd, friendly staff and comfortable decor!!  i loveeee the Buffalo chicken salad with low fat blue cheese dressing..I highly recommend this spot - great for chillen with your girls...It is across from my gym and so close to a few other gyms.  i like sitting outside in the summer also - great spot!
