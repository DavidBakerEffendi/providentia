Eat here about twice a week.  The service rocks.  Very friendly and knowledgable staff.  The fish quality is amazing.  I was told that the fish comes in fresh daily.  The sauces on the optimistic roll are house recipes and really provide a one of a kind experience.  Overall, the atmosphere always allows for a fun evening.  Whether having drinks at happy hour or having an intimate date on a Saturday night.  The sushi lounge always is my go to place.
