Horrible Service that I never had! My friend and I went there on Friday 01/02/15 We were waiting for the host (who has eyeglasses,red shirt and short hair) about 30 mins.The staffs walked pass about 3 times.No one greeting us or say anything!After we arrived.They got 2 other group coming in, one with 5 people she was greeting and told them about 15 mins wait and another group with 3 people she did the same .. told them about 45 mins. While we were waiting and nothing happened to us. Then we asked her"How long for table for 2?" She said "Did you put the name on the clipboard?" How can we tell? It doesn't make any sense.She not even asked! Then she told us 1 hour waiting time. What the F*ck #*€ it so ridiculous.It suppose to be first come first serve. How can she run the business like that?That's ok if the restaurant were busy on that time but it was one table left!!! That was there marketing plan to serve  the customer. If you have less people. Do Not Think about this place! It not worth it and waste your time. By the way we did take out instead. We spent the money trade for the worst service. I want to say sorry to my friend who suggested this place but we won't go there again!!!
