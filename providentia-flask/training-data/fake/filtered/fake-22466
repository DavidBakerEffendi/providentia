Chicken Jalfarazi Biryani is the best. along with Tandoori chicken Platter, and chargha. Nihari is also good. Portions are large and reasonable prices. Good food overall. We always carry out so can't really say about the service, but owner is a very nice person and would go beyond to fulfill needs.
