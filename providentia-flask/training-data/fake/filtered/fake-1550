This is a lovely gem of a place and I am so glad I discovered it! The food is just as good or better than the indian places I usually frequent in the Village, and it is close enough I can get takeout to my house. And 30.00 filled my boyfriend and I so full of food we could barely walk out the door. Everything was super delicious, nothing too oily, no weird textures, and the vegetable garnishes were fresh and delightful. It's the small things in life.
