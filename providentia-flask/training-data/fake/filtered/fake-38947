I was there with two very good friends of mine last Friday. Both of my friends had eaten there before, their recommendation and the idea of BYOB's sounded very promising. We waited on a table outside for one of my friends to arrive, then requested a table inside since it was very hot and got a "you are outside you stay outside" as a response  from the waiter. We were ready to order after 20 minutes of being neglected at our corner table and it was at that very moment, when the same waiter asked  -a little annoyed- if we had seen the specials. He came back and dropped the menus on our table with the nastiest attitude I've ever seen. Food finally came out, it was... alright. We hadn't even finished the appetizers when the waiter came to our table with the main course and put it on the table without even asking if we were finished. By the end of the meal we asked them to open a bottle of port my friend had brought from his personal cellar -I don't think the restaurant staff had any idea of the kind wine we had at our table-. This time the waitress came to us apologizing -sort of- because they had screwed with the cork. We asked for a strainer and clean glasses, all we got were wax zippy cups and a coffee filter. She said the guy who washes the glasses was busy! ... the story goes on and on, but ends with the waiter embarrassing himself in front of all the people waiting outside for a table, I did feel sorry for him. For the first time in my life I left a restaurant without tipping. This place could be a nice one if they didn't have the attitude. Being overwhelmed when working at a restaurant on a busy Friday night gives them no reason for being nasty. Think twice before eating here!
