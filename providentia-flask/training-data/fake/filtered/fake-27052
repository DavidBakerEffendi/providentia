Dining at the Crescent Grill in Long Island City made for an extraordinary experience. The reviews made it all sound quite good, but not until we walked in did we discover the owners are from our town in SW PA.  We would like to think this is how they acquired their work ethic. The welcome was warm; but so it was for everyone who came in.   The tasteful decor and a Gallery full of the works of regional artists (for sale at affordable prices) lures you right into a formal but unpretentious dining area.  What the efficient staff brings to the table are examples of amazingly  beautiful and delicious cuisine.   Crescent Grill is a destination restaurant.  Prepare yourself for a special meal, prepared and served with you in mind.
