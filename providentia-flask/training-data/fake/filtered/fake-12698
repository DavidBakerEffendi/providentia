I have frequented this restaurant a few times. The wine selection is amazing and reasonably priced. The community table in the front gives it a very unique and relaxed ambiance. The gnoochi was OK, and the Duck Confit was very dry and not to their usually Lupa standard. This is a great place for a glass of wine and good appetizers - definitely try the dried meats.
