Slow and incompetent. I asked for aeropress, which I've gotten many times in good San Fran cafes that operate like an actual business. Waited for over 15 minutes, had to go back to work and was about to just leave the place when I saw the barista reading the manual line by line. You've gotta train new people, that I get. But you also have to run a business! And then their coworker says "this is just how long manual takes." Get over yourself! Coffee was lukewarm and bland. What a waste of time!
