I really loved this place! The MEATBALLS were amazing of course. I got "Everything but the kitchen sink" which was filling bc it comes with a salad and veggies. My  boyfriend got the a la cart which I don't think is the best deal, but if your just wanting to try the different sauces and meats then it's ok.  The sides I will do without next time. We got the sauteed broccoli and it was not great at all, and it was like $8 bucks or something- stick with the meat. The only other note would be that we did have to wait from 7:15pm to..wait for it...9:35pm. If the host hadn't told us it would be only 45min to an hour that would be great, but we just hung around the area till a table opened up for 2 (which brings me to our next sad note). There were actually 2, 2 tops open for over an hour outside, that he didn't let us sit at bc he was waiting to combine for a larger party. My argument to him was that in the hour the table was empty, we could have eaten and left by then. Whatever, the balls were good.
