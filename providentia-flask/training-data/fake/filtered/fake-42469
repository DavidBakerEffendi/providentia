This is probably the best Greek food I have had in New York. The flavors are great, the quality is high, it isn't greasy, and there is a good selection beyond the "regulars" you would find in any Greek restaurant. The place is pretty with an open feel, even though it is packed. The big down side is the acoustics. Don't go here if you want to have a nice catch-up session with someone or are trying to get to know someone new. We were yelling to the people we came with, even though they were inches away. Everyone left there hoarse.
