Unfortunately, my experience at this establishment was far less than "fair". The service was slow, the food was cold when it FINALLY arrived an hour after being ordered, and their soup of the day (supposed to be a vegetable soup) tasted like salt water with a few sparse vegetables that were difficult to find! It was completely inedible and had to be sent back after only tasting a spoonful. We have been to the London Grill in past visits to the art museum but I can assure you that this was our final visit there. Friends from Jersey who joined us agreed that the service was terribly slow and the food was, at best, fair. We ordered salads, burgers, Challah French toast and the fritatta of the day - all were simply just fair. That the burgers were on hard, stale rolls was not even of major concern.....this entire experience was one we would soon like to forget! If this restaurant was giving the food away for free, I would STILL not return......
