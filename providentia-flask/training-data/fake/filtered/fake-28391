Is it possible that a place this amazing exists?  It DOES.  Everything is amazing.  The portions are great for the price, so I often go with friends and we share stuff.  Plus, getting a carafe or half carafe of the house wine makes for a perfect evening.  The service is impeccable and the owner will often times stop by the table to say hello.
