This is awesome pizza!  It's right next door to the oft-praised Grimaldi's but the day we were there Grimaldi's had a line 20 deep out the door, and Juliana's was immediate seating.  It's a cozy restaurant with great wait staff.  Crusty on the outside and chewy on the inside of the crust,  perfect sauce and toppings. We had the margherita pizza and soft drinks.  Fantastic.  Can I get one by UPS?
