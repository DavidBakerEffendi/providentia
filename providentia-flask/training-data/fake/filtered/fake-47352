Ate there last Saturday night - we've eaten there before and it's certainly decent Italian food.  We ordered the fried calamari as an appetizer.  it was awful, rubbery, like it had just come out of the freezer.  We sent it back less than half eaten and we expected it to be taken off the bill.  It wasn't.  We didn't make a fuss, it wasn't worth it but we won't be back.
