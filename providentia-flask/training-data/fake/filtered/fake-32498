This was my second time to Garces Trading Company and I got the tasting menu.  I thought the charcuterie/cheese course was phenomenal.  I always love that.  The next course was also good, although the artichoke was not the great.  I thought it was bland.  Although the cauliflower in the fermented garlic and pesto sauce was great.  The main course was also mixed.  My boyfriend really liked the cannelloni but i thought it was blend again.  however we both hated the pork chops.  It was so dry that I had problems cutting it.  I tried an end piece hoping it would be juicier but the fat was just rubbery.  I just had higher expectation for Garces.  This is not an isolated instance because we went there last time and got the pork chops in the tasting menu, it was pretty dry too.  The desert was good and standard. The environment and the service was really nice.  Although some of the tasting menu wasn't great, I would still go back and order a la carte.
