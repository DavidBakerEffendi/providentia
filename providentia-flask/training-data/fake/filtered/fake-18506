I loved so many menu items at this place It was hard to decide what to get. Two crabcakes on perfectly toasted bread with a delicious sauce. Im not a fan of cilantro but it just worked. I enjoyed this sandwich so much. The atmosphere here was pretty cool. Theres a separate bar area, too. This place is one of my faves for sure.
