So after waiting months for a reservation for 4, my experience was not only disappointing but most embarassing. I invited special friends to join us on our very first visit....we arrive at 8:20 for the 8:30 reservation. Promptly greeted and advised we were a bit early, and that it would be a few minutes as the guests occupying the table were near finished. Hostess checked my contact cell no and asked to take our wine bottles. Advised her we would wait on the sidewalk. By 8:55, four sets of 2 and a party of 4 had been seated. At that point I was embarrassed and approached the hostess for a 2nd time, I was informed that our anticipated table was still occupied; only now she was pointing to a table in the corner not the one that she signaled earlier where 4 guests had dined and left (the tables were separated to accommodate two separate single couples). Bottom line is that upon arrival we should have been informed that there was a 40 min wait. Needless to say we requested our wine and chose not to dine at this very high rated establishment.
