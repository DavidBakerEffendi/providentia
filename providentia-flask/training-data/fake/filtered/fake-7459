Excellent! I had the octopus as an appetizer which was delicious and the spiced duck breast. I thought it was quite good but I tried a piece of my father's capretto- that was three times better! Instead of dessert I had grappa.... if you like sweet grappa I would highly recommend their cherry and almond grappa- delicious!
