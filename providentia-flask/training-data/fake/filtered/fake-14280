I went by to check this place out the bartenders are cool. I do wish they had given at least two rounds considering the amount of drinks we had though. Any we had some sample tapas kinda small for the price. I think yuca bar does a better job but they are in the city. I do think that the fried cheese was a nice touch and the scallops in a ham wrap was quite tasty but the crab cake fell short as i really felt like I nuked it from a frozen pack. Over all not bad place in the island Just some fine tuning and this place could be just right. (needs a little bit of NYC attitude) Good job on the decor the bar needs a tad bit of work but it works ok for now.  If the portions were a tad bit better and if they spiked the drinks" FOR GOD SAKE" we have a winner.....So pass by, believe me it's worth a visit. Just FYI I lived in NYC for over 40 years and I dine in the city 4 times a week  (Yuca Bar, Union Square Cafe,Blue Water Grill,Cuba,and so forth. I am comparing them to these places)
