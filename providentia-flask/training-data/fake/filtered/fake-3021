Well first off, as soon as I walked in the building, I felt like I was in Havana. The music, the pathway entrance and the smells of the prep room to the right all hit me and it was just a sensory overload. I walked in and thought, man this is gonna be good. The place was relatively empty given the time that I went. Anyway, Â now I'm in the actual building. We were promptly seated by our (very cute) hostess and sat all the way in the back in the room by ourselves. I sorta felt like my company and I were on a reality TV show. The scenery/lighting indoors was also very nice. The music was great. I kept using my Shazam app to figure out what I was listening to. Our server came out very quickly. We had all ordered an appetizer. We had received an extra appetizer that we didn't ask for but we didn't make a big deal about it. We ate it and it was good anyway. That was my only minor problem with this dining experience. When the appetizers were finished our server came back promptly for our orders. The food came out at a blazing-fast speed. It was like I ordered by entree, yawned, looked down and there it was. My favorite part about the experience was the GARGANTUAN portions... TONS of food for what you're paying. I'm a pretty heavy eater and made it a point to intentionally go hungry, and STILL couldn't finish. BYOB is also a nice perk too.
