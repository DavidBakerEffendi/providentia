I came here with two of my Spanish friends to celebrate a birthday and experienced the worst service in my life. We were one of the first ones seated, and after we were seated multiple parties came in and the restaurant was full. Granted, there was only one waitress, which is understandable, given how long it took to take our order. That was fine, I did not mind waiting for food that had such great reviews. But, when an hour passed by with no update on our order, it seemed a bit odd when all the other tables received their food which had multiple parties ranging from 2 to 6 people. Hearing the waitress interact with other people, she apologized to them for the wait, made chit chat about the menu and seemed like she was empathizing with them for the longer than normal delay. She had the nerve to bring my friends order to the table, put it down and say the rest of the food will be out shortly. Waited another 20 minutes with no update, had to flag Â her down and ask how long it was going to be and she said 10 minutes with no apology. We noticed a table behind us that came in after us had gotten the same dish that we were still waiting on. When you go to dine in a restaurant (if you can call it that) you expect to be served together, a couple of minutes apart fine but not half an hour. We paid for the food my friend was eating and the appetizer and walked out. She did not try to stop us or even apologize. I am just disappointed that my friends birthday was such a horrible experience. If you go to this place and are not "Italian" expect to get the most horrible service. There was another party of 6 (Caucasian's) who were cursing up a storm who were still treated with wonderful service from the same waitress. I am not sure if this was racism because we were not Italian, (we were Spanish and Middle Eastern) but never have I felt such humiliation.
