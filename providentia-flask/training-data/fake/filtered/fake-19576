I had a really horrible experience last week.  I ordered a burrito to go, picked it up.  As I was eating it, I felt something that was not normally in a burrito and I pulled out a wire, much like a paper clip.  I immediately took it back.  While they refunded my money, I asked to speak with the owner and he refused to come out and hear my complaint personally.  Be very careful, there are so many wonderful Mexican places in the Italian market are, there is no need to endanger yourself and go to Tres Jalapenos!
