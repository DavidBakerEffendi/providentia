Definately 5 stars for Cabanas Midtown... I was organizing a dinner party for some old school friends. Our groups was not big enough to buy out the night but it wasn't a small group where we could just show uo and ask for a table. I had contacted several restaurants in the area and could not work out a resevervation for 15 people until I called Harold @ Cabanas. Harold not only help me out in providing a solution to our particular situation but also treated me like family.  Further more he set us uo with, whom I think, is the best server I ever had, Carolina.   She was awesome. She learned all our names, made awesome suggestions for dinner, was extremely knowledgable of the menu and was quick witt and uber friendly. She also treated every single one of us like family. The service was awesome, the food was great and the little personal "family" touch Harold & Carolin gave us made Cabanas midtown one of my top places in the city, ... so much so that I have another meeting in NYC in Septemeber and I already suggested we dine here.
