Had 35 minutes to be in and out for lunch. Sat at the counter, told the waitress I needed good food and quick. She suggested the burger will onion rings and I went with it. 5-7 minutes later the meal is in front of me, and it was a damn good burger and the BEST onion "donuts" ever. Yeah, onion donuts is the best as I can explain it. Will go back with family and friends to have a good meal for a reasonable price in the future.
