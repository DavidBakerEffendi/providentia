I and a bunch of friends visited Philly this past weekend, and due to reviews we decided to try the this place.  I guess we should have ordered the pizza because the food ( burgers - turkey and beef ) were terrible.  I definitely have had better.  The fries... uhhh... fresh, I don't know what they were.  Also, the service was not up to par.  The waitress had an attitude... she did not want to repeat herself after running down their happy hour to 8 people.  We waited for about 1/2 hour ( maybe longer )for our food after ordering.The waitress did not keep us informed on the whereabouts of our food.   I definitely will not be returning.
