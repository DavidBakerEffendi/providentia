Mezetto offers innovative and modern twists on classic Mediterranean and Middle Eastern fare that can only be described as absolutely delicious. It has an ambiance that is suitable for different occasions and party sizes, whether it's an intimate date or group gathering. Not to be missed are the falafel steamed buns (you'll never want to eat falafel any other way again), truffle mushroom gnocchi, mezze trio (eggplant, hummus, and labne), scallops with cauliflower and raisins, and skirt steak. Â They also have very interesting cocktails and desserts: must try is the Limonana which uses Arak, lemonade, and mint - quite tasty! All in all, the food is excellent, service attentive, and overall experience refreshing.
