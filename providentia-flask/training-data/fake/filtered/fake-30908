Awful , don t waste your time on this place . I went for lunch today with a friend and we ordered fried shrimp and scallops, well the seafood was not fresh .... the scallops were dry and tough and the shrimp tasted like it was bad. I didn't Â even eat mine. Our waitress, although pleasant brought our bill to us while my friend was still eating her lunch , nothing like saying hurry up and get out. I have been going to Jimmies for over 40 years and after today , I will never step foot or ever recommend them to anyone.
