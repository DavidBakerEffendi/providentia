I took my boyfriend here for his birthday on a weeknight. we were seated right away between the cigar roller and the live band. we had amazing mojito23 cocktails its like a mojito with champagne. i had 2 and well i guess im a lightweight because it got me kind of drunk lol!!! We had amazing apetizers (although very small) and as soon as we were done with that we got our entree all within 20 minutes of us being there, the staff were really friendly and efficient. it was definately romantic and intimate. ive been downstaires before and definately not as intimate as the top floor. i made a reservation a week ahead and the room was pretty empty mabe 3 other tables were full so it was nice. we were out of there within an hour very satisfied. we tipped thhe cigar roller and he gave us 4 cigars! he was really nice. overall a great experience, a little pricey but well worth it. ill definately go back.
