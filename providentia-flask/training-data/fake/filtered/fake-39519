Alright, Alright...Alright (meaning Damn Good!) Came here today for lunch based on an e-mail from none-other than Yelp and, while I expected it to be good based on reviews, it exceeded my expectations. Nice, clean place with positive atmosphere and friendly staff. Got the Lamb Gyro Platter to go and other than a tad oily--which was expected--it was Great.  Huge portions of tender lamb/mix, seasoned rice, free side sauces...and all for under $10 bucks.  Eager to try more of this eclectic menu!
