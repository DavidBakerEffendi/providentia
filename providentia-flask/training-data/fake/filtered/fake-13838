Their fries are the best!  The food is always good: simple, ample, and better than what you'd expect from a diner.  The waitstaff is without exception professional and prompt.  If you want fancier "atmosphere" and higher prices, go elsewhere....but for the money, the "Elm" gives you more than you could ask!
