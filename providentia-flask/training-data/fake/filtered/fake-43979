I was here last night about 5pm. There were a about 20 people in the bar, and three bartenders. I ordered wings which were very good, a little different from the norm , they weren't swimming in hot sauce, but cooked in a homemade sauce that left them moist inside with a dry texture out. Also had the sweet potato fries that were thick and covered in a great brown sugar and icing mix. The problem was that after my wife and I finished our first drinks, a wine and draft beer, we sat with our glasses clearly pushed forward on the bar, for 20 minutes. All three bar tenders passed us, several times, actually making eye contact with the empty glasses, but no refills. When I flagged one down and did get a refill, I asked if we could have our check, he acknowledged me and said ok, then we proceeded to wait for another 25 minutes, empty glasses in front again for the first 15, without any service or any check. We took the train into the city and had to go, so I ended up throwing $40 down and just leaving. The place was not that busy; I don't understand what the service problem was, and this is why we will not return. No knock on the quality! Just poor service.
