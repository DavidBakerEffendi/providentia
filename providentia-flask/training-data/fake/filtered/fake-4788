I went into Lovers and Madmen the other day to sit down and get some coffee, and had not a single positive aspect to the experience. I sat down at a table before ordering to take off my jacket and text a friend. Less than a minute after sitting down, the barista came over with a foul and rude attitude, and told me that I had to buy something to sit at a table. It was apparently unacceptable to sit down for a second without giving them my money. I then ordered a very overpriced tea, and the barista again gave me attitude. Look out for him: he is a rubenesque (fat) guy with a slight lisp. I had to wait 20 minutes for the tea even though there couldn't have been more than 5 people there. The jerk barista didn't really seem to be in a hurry; I heard him talking on his phone in the back while I waited. When it came, the tea was luke-warm. When I asked if I could have it hotter, the guy sighed dramatically and rolled his eyes. I will not be going back again, mostly because of how rude the barista was.
