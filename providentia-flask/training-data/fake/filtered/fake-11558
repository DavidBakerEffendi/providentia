My husband and i cannot say enough good things about the Bethwood. We recently had our wedding there and we are more than convinced that we made the right decision when we signed that contract. Even though we walked into the Bethwood without an appointment, the one lady at the office was able to get us to talk to a very kind man named Steve Goodman. Steve was extremely nice, he showed us the facilities, he gave us different options and explained pricing in detail (not to mention that he was very funny) . Other people worth mentioning due to their kindness and professionalism are Jason and Carlos who were there to make our ceremony and reception truly unforgettable. I also like to mention that the pricing was very reasonable considering everything that it included (cake, food, beverages, ice sculpture, chair bows, free night at a local hotel and much more). In conclusion, we fell in love with the Bethwood not only because of the extremely kind staff, beautiful facilities and the reasonable pricing but also because they truly made us feel like king and queen for a night. My husband and i absolutely made the best decision by booking our wedding at the Bethwood.
