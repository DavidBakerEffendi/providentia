Boy, I wouldn't mind eating from this place a few times a week.  Tried the various falafel sandwiches, the hummus, salads, and eggplant sandwich ("not sa-beach, it's sah-biqh, " the happy counter guys instruct me) - everything's been great.  The falafel trio platter is a feast!  Gotta try the Shakshuka next. I'm used to getting my falafel fix from the carts in Liberty Plaza but I'm closer to this place and given all the extras from here, from tasty menu to super friendly service, it's definitely worth the extra couple of bucks.  pretty busy @ lunch - good to see.
