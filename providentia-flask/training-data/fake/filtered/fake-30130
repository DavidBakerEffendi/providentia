The French Goat Cheese had a variety of ingredients that you never would think would go together but they do! A great sandwich shop The bread was fresh and the salads and veggies were as good as the less than healthy offerings.  This place is very small so most people order online to pick up or order there to take it to go.Their ingredients are fresh and good quality.  I will certainly be back to try other things on the menu!
