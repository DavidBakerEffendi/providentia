I've ordered the spicy ramen here a few times, and I always enjoy it, especially the bamboo shoots and the noodles. The decor itself is very pleasant and service is fast. I would probably eat here more often if it were not cash only and accepted level up or credit cards, because I don't always remember to carry cash on me, so I usually have to plan to go here ahead of time rather than to just walk in on a cold day when I decide I want soup.
