A real find! Very nicely done steaks with a variety of sauces to choose from. Excellent and unusual appetizers. Great wine list. Surprisingly affordable, too. Although it's not the best place to bring a child, if yours is well-behaved and used to restaurants, they actually have a child's menu, crayons and the like. Totally enjoyable experience.
