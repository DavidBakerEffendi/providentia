We have eaten all over the world and food is our passion and after this meal we agreed it was one of the top 10 restaurants of our lives.  It was THAT GOOD.  Perfect Service, beautiful ambiance, private protected parking, and incredible food.  I had the  Lobster Special $22.95 for two broiled 1-Lb lobsters. We also had the Hanger Steak $27 and the mixed seafood with green sauce $26.  Had their fabulous sangria and a nice 'spanish coffee'(alcoholic but delicious).  The free soup they gave us came in a big bowl and was very tasty.  Everything was perfect.  The wait staff  was top-level professional and the ambiance inside, was wonderful  (woods, linens, lots of amenities).  BRAVO!
