Went to Burger Baby for lunch today, after giving it a week or so to get it's act together as a new restaurant.  I work downtown and regularly frequent the downtown restaurants around the XL center. I got the 5 oz Classic burger, which was good.  However, the 2 inedible garnishes were a total joke.  One was a sorry looking condiment container of cole slaw (not good), and the other was a frizzy mess which resembled something which the waitress couldn't even identify (even worse). I will say that unlike the far superior Plan B, everything was ala carte, and that the fries (ok) were an additional $2.50 or so.  Service was slow, wait staff was friendly, but after spending $16 for just the burger and fries and tip (I got water to drink), I've decided that it is way too expensive for lunch. If this place wants to survive in downtown, they've gotta capture the lunch crowd, which means good value for under $10 out the door, including tip.  And as my friend Fraxico says... "they're Fredo to me now."
