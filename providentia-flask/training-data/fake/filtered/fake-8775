We saw the B rating on the door...we should have followed our first instincts. I ordered the hanger steak..basically 3 meatballs on a pile of mushrooms with French fries under to make ot look big...for $30..my lady ordered the grilled sea bass..it had the grill marks but was cool inside..hmmm for $30. The waiters were nice though.
