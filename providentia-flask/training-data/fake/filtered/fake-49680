DON'T plan to hold an event here!  The atmosphere is terrific, and they promise you everything, but when they have have your $, they quickly move on to other prospective clients....The waiters who served hors deurves didn't speak English (to describe what they were passing), there was no one overseeing the dining room.  We had a family-style plan that we had paid for (meaning if a table ran out of an item, they would replace it).  Not only did they not do that, but when we complained, they moved a half-eaten platter from another table and gave it to us!!  Gross!!!  It was too bad, because we all had high hopes for this occasion at this particular place.  No one who attended was impressed.
