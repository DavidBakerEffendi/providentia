Wow!  I heard about Ahh La Cart on News 12 on July 5 and was determined to try it the next week.  I found the truck on July 12 and boy, was it worth the search!  I am a California Girl and know my way around Mexican food.  i had a chicken quesedilla that was the best one I've had since leaving CA 16 years ago!  Believe me, I'll be back!!
