Tight squeeze to get in but well worth it, a very social little bar with friendly staff and some very interesting interior design. I thought the wine list was a joke because it was on a small chalk tablet and said "Rose" and nothing else. I was a little let down by this but I get it, it is to make you communicate with the bar tender and not simply order blindly. Great little tapas and a very relaxed italian 'no rush' feel inside, it is a tight squeeze and I was beside a couple in the middle of a very passive aggressive argument and so this was distracting... but a well kept secret!
