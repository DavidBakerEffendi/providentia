I ate here a while back, but the staff didn't converse with me much; however, recently I stopped by again and there was a few new staff and the guy conversed with me and we shared a few laughs. It made my experience much better and his word choices to see how my dining in experience where terrific. He said " Was your meal delightful" and "was everything lovely?" That guy provided excellent customer service and knows how to treat customer and make them feel satisfied. Not to mention, I left a $15 tip for him. =) Keep it up Jasmine Rice will be back soon and I told a friend of mine from New York, and he also stopped by and also enjoyed his stay there.
