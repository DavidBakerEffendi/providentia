Sandwich Theory has very good service and down to earth individuals who give EXCELLENT personal service. Whenever I find myself going to Sandwich Theory if I find myself getting a new sandwich (as they have a great selection of sandwiches, and when creativity strikes its still a slamming sandwich) I am never displeased. Their drink and chip selection is also good quality, and their sides are always fresh and appetizing! Do yourself a favor if you get the chance and stop by for whatever your standard sandwich is. You will not be disappointed!
