Do not go here, the way this place treats their patrons is a disgrace!  I was there for a total of 5 minutes - I wasn't there long enough to order a single thing - before I was physically assaulted by a bouncer.  He grabbed me at the top of a large stairwell, and roughed me up for a few minutes without my doing anything aggressive against him, and I was lucky to get out of there before being shoved down the entire stairwell and being seriously injured (I've heard a story in an unrelated bar, where a patron's neck was broken in a similar incident).  I was appalled and embarrassed by the way I was treated, and I will never step foot in this place again.  I'm reporting this place to the Better Business Bureau, exploring my legal options, and reaching out to a Philadelphian Councilman who is speaking out against untrained bouncers in Philadelphia bars.  Again, enter at your own risk - you may wind up in a hospital bed if you so much as look at a bouncer wrong in this place!
