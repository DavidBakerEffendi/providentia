I was super excited to hear an Indian restaurant was coming to the south Philly area since, after a while, Italian food gets a bit old. My bf and I have been here 3 times and loved each visit. The goat cheese naan is to die for. I'm craving it just thinking abut it. The food, although a bit pricy, is always yummy and it's nice to get a variety of things you wouldn't usually get for dinner (like venison). The Flaming Chai is fun too! It's a whole production where they light some liquor on fire and then serve it with tea. Yummy and entertaining :) One thing I wish they would do away with is the drink menu being on a tablet. It's a bit of a pain to have only one person at a time scroll through the drinks. I wish there was just a regular menu that I can leisurely look at instead of being watched closely by the staff. Other than that, top notch stuff!
