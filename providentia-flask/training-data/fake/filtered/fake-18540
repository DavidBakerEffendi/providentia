Only came for dessert and drinks. Service is noteworthy--extremely friendly (not just for New York), offered to give us tasting of beers we were deciding between. The bartender also split a double shot in half for my friend and I so that we didn't have to order two. Got the bread pudding with ice cream; Â very large servings, don't feel like they're skimping you on anything. Large space, don't feel like you're on top of other patrons, love the decor and vibe.
