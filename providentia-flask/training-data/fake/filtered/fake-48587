If you likewise aged women's specialty boutique stores, this mall is for you. It has two anchoring "chain" stores in LL Bean, and EMS. These two store are why we shop at the powerhouse mall. But the other stores are a little too "specialty boutique" with the boutique pricing to boot, Â for me to shop in any of them.
