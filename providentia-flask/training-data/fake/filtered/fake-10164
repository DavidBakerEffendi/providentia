Overrated. for an italian place their cannolis are subpar. But they do put in the filling only when you ask for it, so the casing doesn't get soggy. Cannoli's were decorated with nuts, but they were colored and slightly bitter. Ricotta lemon squares delicious Rum cake slice- delicious, but tasted slightly a day too old. Overall, the place does not live up to the hype.
