COCKROACH ON THE TABLE. Saw a huge cockroach walk onto the table and the manager was very unapologetic. His exact words were: "There's been a construction going on right next door and all the roaches are out to find a new home. BUT OUR RESTAURANT IS NOT DIRTY. I'M TELLING YOU, OUR RESTAURANT IS NOT DIRTY." The decent thing he could've done was apologize and make compensations but he did not do either and kept arguing there was no way they can refund our payment. In conclusion, ask at the reception if there's still a construction going on and if they say yes, try another time when it might be a little more hygenic like they blindly argue that they are.
