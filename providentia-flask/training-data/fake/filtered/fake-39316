Oh my gosh you have got to try their new french bread. I am not a bread person by any means but this one is the best. The bread has a buttery Â taste to it and it just melts in your mouth. They gave me a free sample of it to try. It's one of their newest product and I can't stop eating this bread. I ended up coming back in and buying another one and ate it along with a Vietnamese iced coffee. I ended up eating the whole french bread and now it's an addiction. You have to try it when you are in the neighborhood. 5 stars!!!!!!!
