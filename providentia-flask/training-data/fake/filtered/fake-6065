Wow. Thats all I have to say. This place use to be a disaster. The place use to smell. The place use to be unclean and the seats were sticky from all the syrup. I swore that I would never go there again. Recently I was in town and my friend wanted to go to ihop. I refused to go but she promised me that things had changed. Once I got there, I was surprised. The service was great. I was greeted upon arrival. The tables were spotless and the whole place was renovated. On top of this, I was surprised the quality of the food. Highly recommended. Also I found out from our server, Judy, the place had changed management. That may explain why so much change had occurred!!
