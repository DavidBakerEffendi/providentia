I was in Rizzuto's twice this past week. I had a lovely first date on Tuesday night for the three course lobster dinner! The food was delicious. What a deal! $29.00 I decided to add a second lobster for another $10!! Anyone who is a fan of seafood has to come try this special before the summer is over.  I think its every Tuesday. I also just had dinner this past Monday evening!  To my surprise it was 1/2 off bottle wine night! Way to go Rizzuto's!!!!  My buddy and I shared a great bottle of Barolo which was suggested to us by our awesome server who's name I forget. We went pretty light with a few salads and an antipasti meat and cheese combo.  Way to support some of CT's local dairy farms! I have to say every time I come to Rizzuto's it expect noting less then exceptional and exceptional is what I experience. Every time!
