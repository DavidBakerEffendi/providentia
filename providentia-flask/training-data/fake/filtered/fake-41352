worst restaurant in town. not worth the wait. apparently the cooking staff (probably NOT culinary graduates) thinks that pouring black pepper over everything is the way to go. after i sent the fish tacos back, i ordered a medium burger. it came so well done as to be classified as burned. fries limp. service Â poor. NOT GOING BACK.
