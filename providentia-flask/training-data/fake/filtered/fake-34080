This was, hands down, the worst place I have ever eaten.  My colleagues and I were in town for several days and thought the place looked good based on outside appearance.  Wrong.  I had the teriyaki tuna (so overcooked and brown/grey I only took one bite).  Others had the pork chop and the pulled pork BBQ sandwich - each with horrible results.  The servers were spectacularly lax.  I usually only write good reviews, but this could not be ignored!  DO NOT EAT HERE!!!
