My fiance and I are fans of It's Always Sunny so we decided to stop in to Mac's while we were spending the weekend in Philly. And we are glad we did. It wasn't that busy when we went so we were able to sit immediately. We ordered our drinks (just soda), the glasses are a little smaller than I thought. My fiance had the Red and White chicken cutlet and I had the Fried Cheesesteak rolls. We were both very pleased with our food. The bathrooms are a little small, it's kind of awkward if you're standing at the sink and someone is trying to come out of the stall. That and the size of the drinks were out only complaints. Otherwise everything was great and we'll definitely be back!
