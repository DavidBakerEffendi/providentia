I am always completely satisfied with my experience at pizzeria veritas. So delicious and fresh. I don't bother with any other pizza if I can help it! Exciting cocktails, and a very welcoming atmosphere. Every time I go, both owners always check in with my table, and seem to truly be thankful and appreciative for my business, even though they do not personally know me. If I had one complaint, it would be that the restaurant is very loud. Not good for quiet conversations. Definitely more of a high energy atmosphere. Just depends on your mood. Still worth 5 stars!
