I tried a classic sandwich with a taro bubble tea, as well as a sardine sandwich with coffee bubble tea. It was a tad bit expensive at a cost of upwards of $20. Suffice it to say that my taro bubble tea tasted as water does. I asked MULTIPLE times for it to be sweetened. That was the worst part. But after about 3 or 4 times it was mildly decent. The classic sandwich, however, was to die for. The coffee bubble tea and sardine sandwich tasted as it should have, as I sampled them with the intention in mind of writing this review later on (haha). If this review were centered around food alone, it would receive a proper 4 stars. However, the place is extremely small for the vast amount of people that actually enter the place to eat. I had to stay on constant look out for seats; actually, if you are with a friend, let your friend get out of the line and go on guard to find a place to sit - after 10 minutes you might be lucky. The place was really noisy as it was packed full of people. I guess this is a good thing for the booming business out here, but as pretty as the place may be, it is just not a comfortable fit. I actually struggled to get some Sriracha for myself. Bottles were hogged on tables by those not considerate enough to put them back where they were found. BUT all in the all, the classic sandwich makes it 100% worth revisiting, at least for me. I will be back but I think next time I will take my order to go!
