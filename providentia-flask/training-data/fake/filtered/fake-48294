I wish I could give this place zero stars . This establishment is an atrocity . Wow. Â By far the rudest staff ever. How are you going to run a business yet treat your customers like dirt. First they got my cheesesteak order wrong. Then they coped a major attitude when I tried to order my fries at the same window as my cheesesteak. My cheese fries were on the verge of being cold. I had better frozen , make it yourself cheesesteak that you get at the frozen section in the grocery store . This place is way over priced . It's disgusting.
