We were at Pantry recently for breakfast as my daughter wanted to eat pancakes. We didn't know its timing, and went there 10 minutes before the schedule time. Since it was very cold outside, I asked the manager if we could sit inside for my 3 year old. He simply screamed at us for being there before time, shooed us out and banged the door on our face. I am never going there for the rest of my life!
