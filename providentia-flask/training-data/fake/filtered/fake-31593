Can not think of a better over,all restaurant experience.  Thirteen of us dined there for a celebratory dinner...the food was excellent..our waitress Alexis might just have been the greatest waitress ever...she was sweet, patient, knowledgeable, fun.friendly, personable and most importantly, completely on top of the service... The ambiance was superb...great views of the city across the water..very chic design.  Everybody in our party raved on and on long after we left...looking forward to going back again...will ask to be seated in Alexis's area.
