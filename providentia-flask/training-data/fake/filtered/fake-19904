Take it from a brown person - this is pretty much the best falafel that you'll find in all of NYC.  When coupled with the ridiculously affordable $3 price, it's a virtually unbeatable combination and perhaps the best deal in the city. I've been coming back to Oasis since I first serendipitously 'discovered' it during the summer of 2008.  In addition to the falafel, the carrots, babaganouj, beets, and pastries are all standouts.  Great drink selection as well. I hope that this place stays in business forever.
