As a bartender I'm used to people getting out of hand and occasionally getting violent. The night after I was F'd with at Double Windsor, a patron at MY bar punched another guy randomly in the face. No one saw it coming. I realize its not fair to throw a place under the bus based on the actions of a few bad apples. HOWEVER... My recommendation for bars without a bouncer, is to set the tone! Don't play song requests for drunk jerks. Don't give free shots to drunk jerks. Don't encourage drunk jerks to be drunker and jerkier. And please... stay reasonably sober behind the bar!
