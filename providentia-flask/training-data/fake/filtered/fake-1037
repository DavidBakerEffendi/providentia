First,  the location is next to the 7-11 at the traffic light with the Dunkin Donuts.  Bear Tavern Road where it becomes Grand. The food is excellent Italian.  The deserts are exceptional.  The Velvet cake was complimented by a baker who make them.  The staff and service is exceptional.  The specials are special, the chef has succeeded in bringing subtle flavors from the combination of food.   The rule is buy the best and do the least to prepare.  Cafe 72 has mastered that rule. We understand they will have a joint venture with a local winery in 2010.
