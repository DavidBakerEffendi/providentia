Rude staff, incredibly bad food (they washed the oysters in running water until they were tasteless - what kind of fish restaurant ruins raw oysters?) Overcooked tuna with spinach from the freezer and oven fries with 2 glasses of Chardonnay for 80$ - just avoid the place, it's the worst. We left to the owner shouting at us because we complained about the worst experience in a long time, and it wasn't even cheap. No AC, loud and rude staff.
