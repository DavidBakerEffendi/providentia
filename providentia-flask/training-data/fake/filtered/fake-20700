Needed a place to eat and it was the only place that wasn't a deli on the block. It was nice inside and the staff was pleasant. The food however was really overpriced and just not good. I got a hamburger with a salad. Salad was just bland. Hamburger had no taste and was really small for the price. You'd think for $13 (plus another $2 for cheese, seriously?) you'd at least get a really good pub burger. I wasn't disgusted or anything, I just felt really ripped off. It was really similar to Burger King in taste and texture but with a slightly better bun. And I like Burger King, I just wouldn't spend $15 on it. Also, charging $5 for a Narrangansett?
