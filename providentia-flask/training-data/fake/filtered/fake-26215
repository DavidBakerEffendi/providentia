This place is a little hard to find, for those who were stumped like me, it's the camo coloured door to the right of their sign board outside. but I really like the atmosphere of it. Dark settings with long benches/tables for dinning. The guy who served was very pleasant. Â I only had their rolls but it was delicious! I enjoyed their roasted green tea as well.
