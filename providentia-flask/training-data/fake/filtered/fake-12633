This place has a nice vibe and I'll certainly be heading back for more, but there were a few detractors.  I might more accurately have given the place three and a half stars, but that's not an option.   The grilled meats are excellent.  We had the beef back ribs and the shoulder blade lamb chop, which are the cheaper meat options and good enough that I'll have no qualms about going for the more expensive cuts next time I'm there.  We started out with grilled sardines and the grilled haloumi salad, both of which were ok. I don't drink and I'm really not a fan of establishments which eschew the offerings of the major beverage companies in favor of niche local players.  Don't get me wrong, I'm all for variety, but sometimes I just feel like a Coke and I'll always settle for a Pepsi; but there's never been an occasion when I've been satisfied by the flavor of one of the alternative colas.
