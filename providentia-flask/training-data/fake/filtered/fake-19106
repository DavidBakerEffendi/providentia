I have been living in the clinton hill/fort greene area for about a year and am soooo happy I stumbled upon this place! It is kind of out of the way but well well worth it! Other reviews rave about the pizza and dont get me wrong - it is awesome! This area was long due for a great pizza joint.  Graziella's margherita pie is nonsense compared to Il Porto's.        Aside from the great pizza, I feel people should give the dinning room a try. The menu is quite extensive and having eaten here way more than a few times I can honestly say that everything is super delicious! Besides the main menu, they always seem to have a very updated selection of specials- which have never disappointed me! Their steak for 2 is superb! (Peter Luger's doesnt stand a chance! Its half the price and much more friendly and attentive service) The salads are always super fresh, the pasta is to die for, and the main entrees are done with great care and presentation. In my opinion you get way more quality and quantity than what you pay for (which I suppose is because of the area they are in) Although they have no hard liquor, they have an extensive beer and wonderful wine list.     I am not a big dessert person at all but, the last time I dined at this place I had a little craving for something sweet. Most of their desserts are home made by the chef and I decided to take a chance on the cheesecake and my friend chose the tiramisu. Holy Crap!!!!!! It was unbelievably AMAZING!  Both desserts were decadent, sweet and didn't make me feel as if i were about to explode. The other great thing about the dessert is that they come with a scoop of delicious gelato and it really adds a surprisingly nice touch!   So for all looking to try a new place- don't be hesitant about the up and coming brooklyn navy yard area- the pizza, entrees, and desserts are well worth it!!!!!!!
