My husband and I finally made it over to devils pocket and it started bad but ended great let me explain.  Being business owners ourselves we rarely get out, hence the reason it took awhile to write this review.  We came in a few Sunday's back and originally sat at the bar this is where it started bad.  The bartender I believe her name was Janay? Had an issue with a gentleman who was unhappy with HER service and his wait time.  We walked into this and were ignored as Janay? walked outside to vent about him and then when she returned to the bar continued to complain about the owner and how he left instead of addressing this, never runs the place correctly, ect. (very unprofessional.)  We then got up after being ignored for all of that time to instead grab a table.  We were greeted by Andrea right away and this is when our experience turned right around.  She sat us at a comfortable table where my husband could still see the TV and was on top of our table even though she was busy until the very end.  The food was outstanding, we finished every bite.  If we didn't meet Andrea and move to a table we would not have returned.  She said something when we asked about the business and ownership (curiosity from the bartenders terrible thoughts of him) that had my husband and myself remember why we started our own business in the first place. "That she genuinely cared about the establishment and both owners who were great guys with talent for this, so she works even harder to make sure it does well because it's important to her that you both succeed." We wish we had 10 more just like her at our place.  Keep up the good work! Not many places have great food, great vibe, and staff (minus one) that care more then just about the dollar.  Wishing you all the best!!
