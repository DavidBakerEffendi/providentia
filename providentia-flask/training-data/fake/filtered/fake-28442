I was there on Monday night, Everything was going smoothly, the food was good, the wine was good, the environment seemed very relax until we found ourselves caught in to an argument among the staff members. More than an argument it was the manager yelling at the staff, i don't speak French so I couldn't understand why was all the yelling for but in my years of restaurant experience I've never seen such lack of respect from the manager to his employees.. Shame on you Petite Abeille for hiring such an unprofessional manager!
