Portions are very good and the chicken is moist - not overlooked. The rice is fluffy with small amt of brown rice mixed in. Served as Gyro but no pita bread which is a negative. Svc is brisk and pleasant and the staff are attentive. There are only 6 tables but with quick svc they turn over easily. While it is a bit of a hole in the wall, it's definitely the good kind. Really worth a visit
