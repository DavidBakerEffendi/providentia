The Rabbithole induces lovely warm fuzzies, which I felt  as soon as I stepped foot into this cozy, little spot on Bedford Avenue. Though I ventured here with friends, I couldn't help but muse about this restaurant's romanticism - the dim-lighting, the candles, the nooks and crannies and the quaint decor. I absolutely fell in love with the spirit of this place, along with the good quality grub. (I ordered a simple hamburger, but it was so nicely done, I made sure to take note of the eating experience.)   Their alcoholic beverages were a bit too strong for my taste, which is why I settled with four gold stars. Nonetheless, this find gives me an excuse to trek back to Williamsburg, gladly.
