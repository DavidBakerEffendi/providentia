New York's far West Village has been rapidly changing for the past decade - famous architects are bringing luxury residential buildings to this neighbourhood along the Hudson River. Culinary guru Jean-Georges Vongerichten chose the right moment in 2005 to open up a sleek restaurant in one of the modern glass buildings overlooking the river. Perry St draws both its upscale "neighbours" from the surrounding buildings and food lovers willing to take the cab ride down to this westernmost fringe of the West Village. Perry St has a serene and elegant atmosphere and it's one of the few restaurants in NYC where you can acually have a quiet conversation. It's classy and upscale, but not stuffy. The interior is cool, with soft whites and modern, simplistic furniture. The New American food is absolutely delicious (as we expected...) but prices are reasonable (surprise!). Check out the website for any special deals they might have, such as the current Autumn promotion: a prix fixe dinner menu for $38. Perry St is the ultimate place to impress your date, out-of-towners, or anyone else you wish to share the Hudson views with while enjoying quality food. someonetoldus.com
