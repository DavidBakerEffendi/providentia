We were told about this place from my husband's friend. This was such an amazing place to eat at. Siting outside was so nice as well. The food was AMAZING! My husband and I had the Pepperoni for an appetizer. Then we split our meal. I had the Rigatoni with the smoked salmon and he had the Lobster filled Ravioli. Both plates were great. Defiantly going back for lunch one day.
