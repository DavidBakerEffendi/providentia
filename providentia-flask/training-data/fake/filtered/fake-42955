Wish I could give a negative rating to this place, horrible service n food. We ordered indo Chinese and my son ordered a cheese dosa. After Â about 45min the server comes and says the grill is not working so they cannot make the dose. We replaced the order with paneer and one roti. No food came till next 40 min after checking with the server food comes..the noodles were overcooked no spices,and in the rice came hair not one strand but multiple. When I complained the sever offered to remake it but keeping the timing in mind we refused but later on charged us for it in the bill. We didn't even eat a spoon of it,intact we had requested for plate change because we had found hair. Stay away..I peeped into the kitchen on my way out it was disgusting they will definitely fail inspection if any ever happens.
