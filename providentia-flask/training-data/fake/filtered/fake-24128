Went for the first time this past Monday. I have spent 3 of the past 5 years living in northern Japan, and have eaten a lot of ramen. This also makes me totally biased towards the type of ramen I am used to (namely, ramen from Sapporo and Asahikawa) Broth: 3 I ordered the "Minca" ramen, which was a shoyu base. It was fairly hefty, cloudy, and very garlicky. It tasted good, but just wasn't my style. Noodles: 2 I had a momentary lapse of reason and ordered the futomen as opposed to the chijire-men (wavy noodles on their menu). Once again, not my style, and since I really don't know what *good* futomen should taste like, I can't really judge them. I ordered an extra serving of the wavy noodles, which were too chewy/doughy for me. I tend to like them very eggy, with an almost transparent quality to them; I also really like my noodles to have a lot of "spring" to them. These noodles were not what I was looking for. Toppings:3 There was nothing out of the ordinary. The charshu was pretty good, but it was COLD at first! Big pet-peeve of mine. Gyoza: 3 The gyoza were good, but I was bummed that I couldn't make my own sauce. The dish of sauce I was given was so deep and so full that whenever I dipped a dumpling into it, it ended up overflowing. All in everything was average; not bad, but not really matching my tastes. I will try the lighter broths the next time I go.
