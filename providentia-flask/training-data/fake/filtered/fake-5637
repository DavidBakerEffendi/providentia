I'm in love. Yes, my addiction to all things chocolate may be a major contributing factor, but Max Brenner has a lot more to offer besides. First, our waiter--David--was phenomenal, presenting an excellent level of service that I've realized is just honestly hard to find in Philly. (It's sad when you start to hold restaurants to the standard of simply "not being rude"). My fianc√© ordered one of their waffle sandwiches which he really enjoyed. I had the Mac 'n Cheese entree which was yummy, although I wish the tomato-ey sauce it comes with had been a little spicy, as it would have kicked it up a notch. We then split a bottle of Cabernet and the Dark Chocolate Fondue for two, which decadently complimented eachother in the best possible way. My fiance compared it to the Melting Pot, and I've always been a fan of theirs as well, but after this experience I would have to say Max Brenner wins out.
