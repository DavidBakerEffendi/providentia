I have eaten pad thai in many cities, many states.  I have not found pad thai as good as Thai Taste ANYWHERE.   I have been in search of its equal for five years now, and haven't found it.  I went back to New Haven this past summer and ate there twice in two days, and nearly cried both times because you just can't get pad thai like this anywhere else I've lived! As an undergrad at Yale, it was my treat to get pad thai takeout when I was having a stressful week.  I had no idea that I would never find anything that good anywhere else, or I would have eaten there weekly.  Heck, daily. I have had other things there I enjoyed - panang curry, massaman curry, crab rangoon, etc - it's all very good.  I ate there in groups, alone, takeout - all great experiences.  I understand what people say when they say it's a little dark in there, but the food is so good that I don't really care.
