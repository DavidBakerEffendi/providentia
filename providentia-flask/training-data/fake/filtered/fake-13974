I love it. The food is as good as advertised and reviewed. With so many amazing options, it would seem less adventurous to order pizza, but not here. The pizza is well worth it, especially for the price. Go for the tomato and burrata salad to start. And the caramel budino is a no-brainer for dessert. The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is for the service. It's good. But not as good as it should be for food of this quality. There's a sort of indifference in their serving style... at least the two times I've been. But honestly, I'd still eat here even if Hannibal Lecter was my server. I love it.
