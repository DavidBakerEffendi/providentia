Very good pizza, I mean Trenton Tomato Pie.  Visited a couple of weeks ago.  We just had to try this pizza, the parking lot is always full, had an hour wait, but was OK with that.  The hour wait was due to our big group... we had 11.  Small, dining area, be aware of that.  Not NY style pizza, but was told Trenton style pizza.  Enjoyed will return.
