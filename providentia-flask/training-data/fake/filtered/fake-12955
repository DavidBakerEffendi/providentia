This place is a joke!!! Every time I go there, I encounter some snotty teenagers acting as if they were doing me a favor that i can buy something there. Today it was just too much! They are open till 9pm. I was there at 8:55, waited a few minutes just to have some nasty lady come and tell me that they close at 9pm and that the registers are closed. Two feet away another lady was checking out some pastries! On an OPEN register!!! Really?! Is it to much to ask for a one loaf of bread?! As I got back to the car it was 9:01... Thanks a lot! Never again.
