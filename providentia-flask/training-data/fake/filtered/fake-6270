I LOVE Race Street Cafe!  I was in awe of their epic beer selection.  The food is really delicious, too!  On my first visit there, I was greeted by the bartenders.  I felt at home, immediately.  I was not sure what to order, so, I told the Bartender my preferences.  He immediately picked out an IPA to my liking.  (that is a very important quality in a bartender).  On my second visit, they remembered me, which made me extremely happy.  I placed my food order, and before I could finish my water, my food was brought out to me with a smile.  If you want great beer, food, and excellent service, give Race Street Cafe a try.  You will not be disappointed.  Did I mention the music?  Best music selection in the city, in my humble opinion.
