Bad experience...the service spoiled the evening. After we ordered, we waited 1 hour and 5 minutes to get our food, and the dining room was only half-filled that evening.   Then, food arrived and when we cut in to fried chicken the first piece was Raw.  I don't mean "not totally cooked to the bone, I mean raw".  Of course, we sent it back and got a replacement.  The replacement should have been cooked a bit longer, but it did not need to be sent back. Otherwise the food was good and tasty. But the real problem was the service and the wait time.  Waiting much more than 30-minutes is unacceptable.  An hour of waiting is a sign that the restaurant is not investing in staffing.
