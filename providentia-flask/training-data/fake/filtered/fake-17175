where do i start..!! food was so so shitty and tasteless...!! its a very small space with lots of table and chairs which makes very hard even to move your chair or even walk through...service is awfull and very skimpy..i had ordered chinese food and they wont even serve any kinds of sauces with that and on asking they would just give one packet of hot sauce..!! and here comes worst part, they serve food in small foam plates with plastic cutlery..never seen that in any restaurant..Food is also not that reasonable priced ..all an all just pathetic..I am never coming back to this place..
