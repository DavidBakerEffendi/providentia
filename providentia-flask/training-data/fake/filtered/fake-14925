Awful experience - TWICE!   I've now had two experiences with Mama Palma's that were so terrible that not only will I never return, but will actively discourage anyone I know from going.   On the first, I had a mediocre meal of so-so pizza with my girlfriend, capped off by a rude waiter who loudly told our neighbors that we were taking too long and costing him tips (our total time in the restaurant was under 30 mins). The second, and far more disgusting, occasion occurred on the phone.  I had called to place an order for pickup and innocuously asked the gentleman (who I now realize, after reading other reviews, was the owner Renato) how long it would take for an order to be ready for pickup.  He refused to answer, saying "when you order, I'll tell you."  I tried to clarify, explaining that I was trying to decide whether I would be able to order in the first place, but he repeated his earlier answer, screaming it into the receiver.  In frustration I said, "never mind," and hung up.  I thought it would end there, but minutes later I received a phonecall from the Mama's phone number.  When I answered, a voice screamed "F**K YOU!!" loudly.  I hung up immediately.  Minutes later, my phone rang yet again, and this time I let it go to voicemail.  And the same man left me a VOICEMAIL verbally cursing at me.   Unbelievable.  No food, even truly amazing pizza (although Mama's is mediocre at best) can justify this kind of behavior from my perspective.
