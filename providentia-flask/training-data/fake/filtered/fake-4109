As it always goes, heard great things, came here and it was not great. Upon being seated, we were presented with a massive menu. My boyfriend and I looked at each other and just knew what was in store. With so many items on the menu, you knew hardly anything was made from scratch. It was extremely overwhelming to read through all the pages, so when the server returned, I asked what the most popular entrees were... Shepard's Pie, Fish and Chips, Salmon, and another english pub-type dish, which was strange to me because the restaurant did not have that kind of a feel. In fact, it had no feel - no theme, no colors, nothing. Anyway, we ordered beer and figured out what we wanted. Our beer came back - bottles were cold, beer inside was warm. Lovely. Our appetizers were OK - Â fried calamari and ahi tuna wontons. Our entrees were terrible. I ordered the Seafood Casserole with a baked potato with butter and sour cream. I swear when I was presented with the potato, it had at least 1/3 of a cup of sour cream on top. While I like sour cream, that is A LOT. The actual dish was the only thing about this meal that could be associated with "casserole." It was literally seafood chowder poured into a dish with maybe two tablespoons of breadcrumbs. I should have sent it back, but I did not want to wait for another meal to be heated up. My boyfriend had the sausage cavatelli. It was bland, the sausage was tough, and it was a very small portion served in a gigantic bowl with a huge lip. We won't be coming back here.
