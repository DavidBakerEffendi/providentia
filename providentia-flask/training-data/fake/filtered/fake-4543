My wife, daughter and I ate here on Sunday, May 2nd. I can honestly say this was the WORST experience I have ever had any sort of restaurant. After being told the wait was an hour (okay, I get that on Sunday), we waited about an hour and 15 minutes. After being seated, we waited another 10 minutes for a server to actually acknowledge us. No, they were not understaffed. There were 7 servers and 2 hostess chatting away at the server station. When our server did show up, she took our order and that was the last I ever saw of her. She never came back to see if we need more coffee or water. Nor did any other server. We then waited another 35 minutes for our omlettes and then they got my wife's order wrong. When she told them, they took it back to the kitchen and then brought it back saying, sorry it was a mistake but "oh well". Are you kidding me!? Really. Then when it was another 15 minutes to get the check. Having waited on tables for three years in school, Â I am usually understanding of any problems that arise. But this place was ridiculous. We left no tip and will never be back. The food is mediocre at best and certainly not worth the poor experience. This city has far too many better places like Hawthorne's at 11th and Fitzwater to eat at than put up with some poorly run and operated poser of a cafe.
