The food was delicious, the service was dreadful.  We had the tuna tapa, the paella and seafood diablo, all of which was very tasty and satisfying. But the dining experience was diminished by the indifference of the wait staff.  The place was practically empty, so that wasn't the excuse for the inattentiveness and lack of graciousness. I would not go back.
