Going to The Russell was the most horrid dining experience I've ever had. The service is deplorable. I was immediately turned off when I  entered the restaurant from the Trumbull street door. Apparently, reception is on Pratt street. However, the Trumbull street door was open. We didn't know this. We stood there while a bartender/waiter ignored us. We then realized we had to walk around after five minutes of waiting. It took us fifteen minutes to be seated when there were two available spaces. Furthermore, the waitress took our orders, without a notepad and eventually brought me cranberry juice when I asked for pink lemonade. People who came AFTER us got their food before us, when our orders were quite simple. After being in the establishment for two hours without food, we decided to leave, from the upstairs dining area. It then took us another five minutes to pay for our drinks because our waitress was in the abyss of the basement where the cooks are doing God knows what. While waiting, the bartender proceeded to get into an argument with us. We left unsatisfied and thoroughly disgusted.   Do not go here!
