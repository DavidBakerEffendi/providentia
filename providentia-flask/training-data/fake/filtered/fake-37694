After having horrible experiences while living in DC metro area, I stopped eating pizza. When I moved to Clifton, a friend of mine introduced me to Taste of Tuscany and it became my favorite place in the area. They have not only best pizza, but also excellent and reasonable priced meals. I am addicted to their buffalo chicken, ricotta cheese pizzas and bruschettas. Very clean and great staff. Definitely recommended. A+ for Taste of Tuscany!!!
