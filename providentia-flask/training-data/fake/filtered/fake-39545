I hardly ever complain or write reviews, but this was so bad. I ordered a cheese pizza and a burger with fries. The pizza came with everything on it witch I'm allergic to mushrooms and the burger was absolutely descusting looked over cooked and just didn't look right took one bite out of it and threw it out. When I called to see if they could do anything for me because I was dissatisfied , they asked me what I wanted to do, instead of offering to fix it or offering to comp it the man who answered the phone was extremely rude and was yelling at me telling me I should of called earlier. I will never order from there again so gross
