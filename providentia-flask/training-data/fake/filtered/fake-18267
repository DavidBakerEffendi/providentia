I ate at the Orient this past weekend while visiting a college friend in Vermont. The atmosphere is fine and the food was good, not great, not horrible, plainly good. However, I wasn't particularly fond of the service. We were with a group of 7 people and were polite. Upon other requests made, such as another drink or more water, he seemed quite aggitated and was not very friendly or accomodating. It's interesting and I must note that I did not see a female worker in the entire establishment. I'll give it 2 stars for mediocre service.
