The Cheesesteak empanada and the breakfast empanadas were amazing. However, the spicy chicken empanada was terrible; there was barely any chicken with a bunch of some weird filler that looked to be chili. Aside from the terrible spicy chicken empanada--and I normally love spice--I would absolutely go back to this place. Fair NYC prices, decent atmosphere and good customer service alongside delicious food makes for a great experience.
