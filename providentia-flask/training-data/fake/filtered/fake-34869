The soup Nazi moved to Brooklyn! The food is good, but the rest is the same. The most magical choreography (however sterile it is) I have ever seen in a restaurant. The dishes are expertly executed, but they are not spectacular in design or taste. For $180 + Tax + Cash tip + Drinks one would expect in a Micheline 2 restaurant to be served coffee at the end of the meal. A luxury feeding machine, a unique experience! PS: Be aware! Lateness is punished by denial part of your prepaid menu and complete indifference .
