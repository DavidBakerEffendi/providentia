Today myself and 2 of my friends went to Matt & Marie's for lunch.  The 3 sandwiches we ordered to share around was the Pastrami,  Capri, and Italian Stallion.  I cant say i favored one over the other because they were all equally excellent.  If you ordered any of these 3 you would be extremely happy.  A mere one bite into each sandwich allows you to taste the highest quality of ingredients along with a super fresh taste.  Its nice when a sandwich reflects all the love and care put it into it!
