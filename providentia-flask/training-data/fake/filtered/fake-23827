It never gets old. I live around the corner and have meatballs maybe three times a week. A lot of great restaurants I find I feel very enthusiastically about at first, but continually visiting takes away the value, however the meatball shop is consistently amazing. Maybe its because the concept is so simple, and yet there is so much variety. Whatever it is, it certainly works for me (i wait like a hawk at the bar ready to swoop down and grab seats so as not to wait for an hour!).
