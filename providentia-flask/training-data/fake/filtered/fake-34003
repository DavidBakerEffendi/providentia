I'm going with other sentiment here that if the service bothers you that much you just don't get it. Do you think Sally's doesn't know people complain about the service constantly? Yet natives of New Haven keep going back weekly, and people come from across the country to eat here, and even if they hate the service they'll still come back one day and still eat the pizza(though this time it'll probably be take out). That not caring atmosphere of Sally's is what it's customers like. If you want a waitstaff that will kiss up to you, go further down the street. And as someone else said, Sally was just not built to deal with the amount of customers they get now. But anyways, back to the pizza, what can I say that hasn't been said, it's the most beautiful thing you will experience taste wise. It beats Pepe's and Abate's.(personally I think Abate's beats Pepe's too, if you don't want to wait in line for Sally's, go to Abate's, not Pepe's)
