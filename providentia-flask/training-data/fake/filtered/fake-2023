Love, love, love. This place is my favorite. Spicy margaritas are amazin' , yummy complimentary traditonal salsa and salsa verde with homemade tortilla chips. Great for vegans, lots of options listed right on the menu and flagged with 2 stars so you don't need to bother your server with menu questions. LOVE that.. The service is fantastic, especially Devon the bartender. The mushroom, seitan and tofu fajitas are rediculous they are so good. I crave the mixta salad on a regular basis. Very casual, comfortable atmosphere. The sangrita shot they give you with tequila shots is so, so good.
