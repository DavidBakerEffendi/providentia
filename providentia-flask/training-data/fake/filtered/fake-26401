So, the first time I came here I left with the impression that I liked the place. Ever since I completely despise the management and find it disgusting. My last two experiences with Ekta have been awful. First, after my friend and I ate there, they told us they would deliver to around temple campus if we told them we are temple students. My friend lives two blocks away from campus, 16th and montgomery. We called in and they wouldn't deliver because we were outside of their delivery zone, even though they told us they would. Finally after arguing with the guy for five minutes they eventually said they would. Then they said our order wasn't big enough for them to deliver even though it was about $60 worth. So the guy hung up on us. I don't know what sort of restaurant would want to lose business over something like this. The prices are not close to even being reasonable. What poor service. My second complaint comes from my experience in the restaurant. I thought ok, I guess they have the right to not deliver to us, but this experience was disgusting. I FOUND A COCKROACH IN MY FOOD. Not only did they not comp me for my dish, but they told me they wouldn't bring out a new order. WHAT?! Though this didn't surprise me considering the 8 flies that were hoovering around my table. There is no way this place actually has as many costumers as they say. Every time I've been there, there has been basically no one there. I don't normally go out giving reviews on Yelp, but I thought everyone should know the true experiences that people have with this place. I WILL NEVER GO TO THIS PLACE EVER AGAIN. This place tries to act as if they are one of those small businesses that cares for their customers. Do not be fooled. I have no clue why people say this place is cheap. $20 for naan and a chicken tikka masala is no where near what I would consider "cheap."
