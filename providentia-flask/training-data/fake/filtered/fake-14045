Had dinner here on December 21st. Creative farm-fresh menu, friendly service, pleasant atmosphere. The place is quite a bit smaller than the photographs on their website make it seem, but I look forward to seeing the garden when the weather gets better. I image it would be great as an after-work meet-up spot, though it is a hike for me to get there, so I will have to save it for a future date night instead.
