Wow, people seem to either really love or really hate this place! I thought maybe it depended on who the chef was night to night, but our group ordered a bunch of stuff and it was erratic. The walnut trio (especially the green bean pate) and the mushrooms were quite tasty; the khachapuri  and the kidney beans quite disappointing--both bordered on flavorless.  The hot yogurt soup was interesting, with a strong dill flavor but too much overcooked white rice at the bottom. I didn't pay attention to what wine we ordered but I was not at all impressed with it, especially at $35 for the bottle. But my wife, who's more into wine than I am, thought it was quite good. I had a couple of sips of my friend's tarragon soda, which was quite delightful in spite of the garish food coloring (bright bluish-green).  But the drink itself was not oversweetened and the tarragon taste shone through. Of course, for both drinks, the restaurant's role consisted only of curating and opening the bottle. Overall, it was enjoyable but not extraordinary. I'm a first-timer with Georgian food, but I've eaten a lot of Eastern European and some Turkish, Uzbeki, and Persian in my time.
