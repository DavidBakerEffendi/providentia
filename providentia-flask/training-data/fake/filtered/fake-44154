I'm from Washington State and came over to watch the Hawks whoop up on the Broncos.  My brother in law and I were wondering around Newark trying to find a place to eat some lunch and stumbled upon this establishment! Lucky us!! SUPER FRIENDLY and efficient service.  I own a business here in Washington, and can only hope that my customers feel as welcomed and cared for as this team made my brother and I feel.  On top of all of this - EXCELLENT FOOD! We loved the meal, portions, price, all of it! Top shelf fellas, keep up the good work! (sorry it took me so long to get this review on here, but I certainly haven't forgotten about you guys!)
