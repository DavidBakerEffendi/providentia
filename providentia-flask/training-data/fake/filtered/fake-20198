Great food at good prices.   We started with the liverwurst plate and a beet and goat cheese salad.  The only liverwurst I know was the Oscar Mayer variety my mother made sandwiches with when I was a kid.  We took a chance because the server said it was delicious and it was.  Goat cheese was super creamy and beets were great.  For a main, more wurst and it too was delicious.   Great selection of unusual, to me anyway, wines from the former Austro-Hungarian Empire.   Same for the beer with 5 or 6 on draft and a dozen bottles. Desert was a Linzer Torte, how could we resist?  And they have a best selection of after dinner drinks, grappa, schnapps, etc. from my favorite distillery Clear Creek in Oregon but we went with two Austrian ones I wasn't familiar with--Zirbenz, a pine liquor, and a walnut liquor whose name I can't remember.   Server gave a taste to make sure we liked them.  Zirbenz--think benzine only better.  Walnut liquor was perfect with the torte. Service was friendly and very helpful giving the small room a happy, warm feeling
