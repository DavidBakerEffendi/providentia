Since I posted my August 1st review I have had several e-conversations with the management of Hat City Kitchen. The manner in which they addressed and corrected the issues I had with my dining experience was truly commendable. As a customer all one can ask of management is to listen and respond. The management of Hat City Kitchen did just that. Good food, fine service, and a management team that puts a premium on customer satisfaction: it Â all adds up to a restaurant worth recommending to anyone and everyone.
