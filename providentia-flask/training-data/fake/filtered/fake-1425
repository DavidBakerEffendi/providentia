I visited the Yankee doodle tap room today for lunch with my mother.. it was an experience she will not forget. the waitress was awesome to her and so was the staff. the food knocked her shoes off. we started out with the cheese plate and ended up with the pecan pie tart for dessert I would like to personally thank the food and beverage director Mr. Jim Byrnes for personally coming to our table and chatting it up with mom..it made her feel special. the other servers, bartender john Ryan fry, Julie Heise, Gary the oldtimer and Anastasia HR director for making this a day my Mom will not forget.. PS the Princetonian burger is the best burger I have ever eaten.Thanks to Alex the chef and Â Manual for the quiche.. A place to remember. Thanks All!!
