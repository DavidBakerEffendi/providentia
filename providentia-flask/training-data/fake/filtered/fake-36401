This was one of the best meals of my life! We were never rushed! I felt as if we were celebrities. We were catered to! As far as the quality of the food.. dont know where to start. It was all fantastic! My suggestion is tell the wait staff what you like and have them surprise you! They also educated us on a lot of the different foods on the menu.(We had some misconceptions on Sweet breads) Later into the meal we were surprised to have the Chef come out and introduce himself to us. Wow!! Scott Conant is a wonderful chef!  Sounds like he has a lot on his plate with new restaurants opening up and down the east coast! Good for him! As far as the deserts... Double WOW!! awesome! This is a great place to impress a date or just have very casual meal with some friends. I would recommend getting reservation 2 weeks in advance for your selected time. It gets very busy. Not sure how the wait staff does it! But our meal and service was flawless. This coming from one of the most critical people around. FYI: Bathrooms were very clean!   (My biggest pet peeve is dirty restrooms)  Yelp should have a side site... DirtyBathrooms.com, track clean restrooms...
