The best and most friendly restaurant I have been to. Its nice to frequent an establishment where people acknowledge you and give you such a warm welcome.  The food and staff are wonderful. Jimmy was just voted the restaurateur of the year . Congratulations Jimmy. Looking forward  to our next visit. Sandie and Buddy
