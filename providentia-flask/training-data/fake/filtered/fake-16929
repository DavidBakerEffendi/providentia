I went to Munchies on my lunch (30 min lunch break) and all I ordered was won ton soup, after 15 min went by I said to the girl who waited on me "I've been here 15 min and all I ordered was soup", she asked behind the counter and the one guy said "she's making it now". Finally after another 5 min went by the girl decided to tell me that they ran out of the broth for it and had to make more (Couldn't have told me that 20 min ago so I could have ordered something different that WAS ready to go!) At this point I told her my lunch was just about over and my soup came out as I was about to ask for my money back,they were very apologetic about what happened but, that didn't change the fact that I wasted my entire lunch break waiting for SOUP! By the way, the soup was bland and I don't know what the noodles were because they certainly weren't won ton. Done With Munchies! Denise McC
