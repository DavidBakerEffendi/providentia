As of now, I've only been to Zahav during their happy hour and have not gotten the full dining experience yet, but my two experiences thus far have been nothing short of excellent. The drink menu is very classy and tasteful--they keep it simple, but delicious, and nothing is overly sweet. For a quick bite, you can't go wrong with the classic hummus which is paired with a tasty, warm pita. My friend and I each got a dessert--I got the pistachio cookie on top of vanilla ice cream with fruit on the side..very yummy. They seem to keep all the ingredients to a minimum so no dish is overwhelming, and they also then are able to perfect what is put out on the plate. The staff is very helpful, knowledgeable, and attentive (dare I say..attractive too?) They answer all your questions with ease and one can quickly tell they know their stuff. Since they are so friendly your overall experience is made that much better. You also never feel cramped inside Zahav because the space is very open with high ceilings and large windows. Obviously, only positive things to say! I cannot wait to return for a full dinner soon! :)
