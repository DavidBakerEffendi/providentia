I'm a college student who loves sushi and is determined to try every sushi restaurant within walking distance of my home, but I keep coming back to Chattime "Angry dragon" roll especially lives up to its name. Every other choice I've tried has lived up to expectations, including sushi, rice rolls. The location is next to kiwi frozen yogurt.the inside is clean and what you'd expect from any decent sushi restaurant. The servers are exceptionally polite and service itself is quick. If you want good sushi from good people at a good price, go to Chattime.
