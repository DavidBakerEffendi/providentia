Great burgers -- nice and juicy with some interesting topping.  282 has a bar feel (well, I guess it is a bar), but the burgers aren't your typical pub-tasting burger, which is a nice change. I like the 282 burger, with chilies and some kind of special creamy sauce.  Fries and onion rings are fantastic as well.  The sweat potato fries have a ton of flavor and are usually perfectly cooked. I haven't tried anything else on the menu as I'm a simple burger kind of guy. There mixed drinks are really well made too.  The spicy bloody Mary is great, although watch out if you down one on an empty stomach as the spiceness isn't forgiving.
