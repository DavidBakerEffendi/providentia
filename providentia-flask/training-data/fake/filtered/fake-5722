Bar none the best well-known cheesesteak place in the city. I'm sure there's a few neighborhood joints that might be better, but when I show people around town and take them to a cheesesteak place, I always go to Dalessandro's. It's probably not the best place if you're planning to eat in while it's busy, but if you just want a takeout steak it's unbeatable. The only real downside is that if it doesn't come on a long roll, they don't have it. So if you've got a hankering for fries to go with your steak, go across the street to Chubby's.
