The Sanchez is the only one I've tasted, its awesome ! But unfortunately my review is not about the hoagies, I've been there about 3 times an thought until last night would continue being a loyal customer. But to have good reviews there is more to it than the food. I bought a whole Sanchez which was $11 i gave the cashier $20 and while he was attempting to flirt I didn't notice til i got in the car what had happened. Because I was feeling uncomfortable and just wanted to leave i rushed out, it didn't hit me what he had just done. The cashier took out 4 dollar bills and than a $5 bill but while talking he had put it back. I walked out and realized that he only gave me $4 instead of 9. I didn't want to go back in an make a scene so I left very disappointed. He saw an opportunity and took it to steal. Fool me once,  there are plenty of places out there that wouldn't steal from there customers.  Hoagie Haven does not accept cards only cash and no receipts. The only thing I suggest for the continued customers is that you count your change well and ask how much before handing the money, I suggest this more to women. I hope my bad experience will prevent others from having this happen to them as well. To that employee, $5 is nothing at the end of the day, it wasn't about the money its about the lack of  respect for another human being . sincerely, Disappointed Customer
