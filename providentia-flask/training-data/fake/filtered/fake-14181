It's a nice enough place, but I had a beer at the bar which was $8.71 with tax.  I don't like bars that add tax to a beer, but especially don't like that the bartender doesn't give back the change.  This one "rounded up" and gave me back $1 from a ten. A server should always return the proper change, no matter how small it is.  If they are going to round, round DOWN.
