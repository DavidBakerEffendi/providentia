I'm sorry, but for the prices you definitely should be seated at a... seat!!!  My wife, daughter and I reserved a table, (OK, a Sunday evening), and were seated at the only room open at this time.  It was pretty noisy with a live band, (really nice, traditional Irish music), and the food was pretty good.  I had the porterhouse, my wife the fish and my daughter had (Washington's favorite????) Chicken pot pie.  The fish was OK; the signature porterhouse was excellent, and the pot pie would not have passed the Father Of Our Country's muster.  In addition to that, we were seated at the back, in the quietest part of the room, where the aisle is a bit narrow, so the aisle seat was really a half of a seat!  My poor daughter insisted she sit there! That was nice but nice would have been, at these prices, a little better accommodation, don't you think?  I think TFOOC would agree.  In addition, my potatoes au graten I think, were a bit salty.  The waitstaff was superb.
