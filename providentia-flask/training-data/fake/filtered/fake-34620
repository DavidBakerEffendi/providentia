Great value and great flavor.  Any fish or pasta dish will be sure to please.  Great specials as well.  Have been with my wife and other couples as well as with my kids.  Everyone enjoyed their meals.  Notable dishes were the filet mignon meatballs, orecchiette with sausage and cauliflower, fried calamari, halibut special with artichoke, olive and sundried tomato ragout.  Anthony has worked hard to create a restaurant that can work as both a destination for a special occasion as well as a place for locals to come a couple times a week for a solid, value-minded meal.
