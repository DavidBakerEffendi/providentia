I'm not veg, but I do like alot of veg food. And I love Govindas. I've been here more times than I can count and each time I leave with a smile on my face. If I order take-out, I find myself almost running to get home and dig-in. Obviously the chicken cheesteak reins supreme but I haven't had one thing yet that I don't like. The chicken quesadilla and chicken nuggets are runners-up. Not to mention the delcious vegan sweet treats they have for desert. You go Govindas!
