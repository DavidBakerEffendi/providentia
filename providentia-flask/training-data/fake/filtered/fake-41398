i only give it 3 starts as it is an institution for so many years and still has the mystic with the reservation policy.  the atmosphere though dated is cool as you know you are stilling where many great people have dined before.  The food is old school Italian nothing too special.  not worth the hype or trouble it took to get there.  your not missing anything.
