One of my favorite restaurants in Philly. Here's what we had: arugula salad with serrano ham and fried goat cheese balls- pleasant but not out of this world. wagyu carpaccio with pickled shallots - very tasty but could have used more shallots as a condiment. truffled chestnut soup with duck confit and quail egg - there should be a note on the menu that says YOU MUST ORDER THIS. It's heaven in Â a bowl and alone makes it worth a trip to Tinto. It's rich enough to share a bowl if you can part with it. It's slightly sweet from the chestnut, creamy and the truffle just adds an amazing flavor Organic chicken with sauteed greens, mushrooms, pine nuts and currants - the tiniest cutest little chicken. delicious and the accompanying veggies were delicious green beans with dates (I forget if it was dates or figs) and some nuts and paprika - least favorite dish of the night. I love vegetables but this concept needed a bit more work. baby artichokes with homemade pappardelle - another home run. fresh, and light but rich at the same time, hint of truffles. highly recommend potatoes with some tomato sauce and La Peral blue cheese sauce. think maybe the taters were poached in olive oil. nice to round out the meal. we also tried a nice Rosado wine, a crisp Verdejo and a spicy Garnacha, all were available by the glass and complemented the food well. the price does add up, but I think that food prepared this well justifies the price. I'd go back just to sit at the bar, have a glass of wine and some chestnut soup.
