We made reservations at this new Princeton hot spot weeks in advance requesting an upstairs dining room.   We didn't complain about being seating in the aptly named root cellar...a room with low ceilings, no windows and minimal decorations in the basement.  Our first course arrived within a reasonable time, but when the salads failed to arrive after nearly an hour we asked, politely, if there was a problem with our order.   The manager, Mr. McAtee, arrived to ask if there was a problem and we stated that other who had arrived long after we had were already enjoying their entrees while we didn't have salads.   After 15 minutes the lackluster salads arrived.  Then, we waited.  We again asked our waiter if there was a problem and again, Mr. McActee showed up.  He apparently believed we were being rude and said that we were welcome to leave, which we did.   We were literally escorted to the door and asked not to return, as if we would ever consider such a thing. We are mature, retired people who know how to behave and what to expect of a restaurant.   Two hours and no entree?   Really?
