My new favorite place to grab a bite & have some drinks with friends!   The food and drinks are delicious & the staff is beyond friendly! Make sure to try The Pulled Pork sandwich and you can't go wrong with the Fried Pickles or Home Made Chips .... actually, everything I've had from there so far has been amazing, so you can't go wrong with anything on the menu!  The drink menu is fantastic, from the mixed drinks to the tap selections - you have to try the Pomegranate Margarita! So happy this place exists!
