Saturday brunch was great until recently. Eggs were overcooked, homefries were lukewarm and soggy, bacon was cold and undercooked, and the food took longer than usual to get to our table. There was no soap or towels in the men's room, and service was poor. There were 2 servers, and they seemed more interested in hanging out at the bar than making sure we were happy. I'll still come in for the cobblestones and rover, but no way I'm going back for breakfast.
