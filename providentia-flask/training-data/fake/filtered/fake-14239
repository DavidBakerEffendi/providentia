New to the area i had to go to the renowned spotted pig for the burger and shoe string fries. I arrived and was sat right away, however my waitress seemed more busy chatting up the bartender than serving me. I waited patiently with great anticipation. I was disappointed to find out that there was no other cheese substitute for blue in house. I hate blue cheese,but decided to trust the restaurant. The Fries where amazing and crispy, but the burger was borderline inedible being smothered in a pound of blue. I scraped as much off as i could however the residue remained. I definitely won't order the burger again and service could have been more attentive, but around me I saw tons of other dishes that will bring me back.
