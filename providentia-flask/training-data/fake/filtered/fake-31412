i recently ate at strip house with my boyfriend, and we consider ourselve to be some what of  restaurant critic, because we love great restaurants, and i must say, after a month of steak houses  such as ruths(very good) chart house, roots, mortons, i must say after dining at strip house restaurant the other night i havent been able to stop telling my friends about our night, from the appetizers to the filet, to the service, and great vwine, this is by far my first pick as the best steak house in new jersy, and its some what of a hidden gem, being that its in a hotel (westminister). this is my first review on a restaurant ever, but i must say i look forward to trying out there brunch, better yet the waiter told me that they do breakfast every day. if it wasnt for the price tag on the food in which is well worth it, i would probly go twice a week at least. thumbs up for me.
