On January 31, 2014 after attending a wake, we called and asked if they could accommodate 30 people.  We were served two appetizers (if you do no like pesto, don't order the eggplant rollatini), choice of three entrees (fish portion was very small) cheesecake, coffee, tea, soda.  To our shock they charged $58 a person.  SHAME ON YOU!!!  Unless the manager was not there and the person who charged us that unrealistic amount for what we were served pocketed a portion of it, the price was truly excessive.  I would not recommend this restaurant due to their lack of compassion and mediocre food and will never go there again
