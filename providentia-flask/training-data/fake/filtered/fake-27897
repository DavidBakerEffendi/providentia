Mark makes the best pizza this side of the Atlantic. And his calzoni have no comparison. I've eaten pizze throughout Manhattan and Brooklyn and, quite frankly, wonder why I even bothered. Lucali's is superior in every way - as is the ambiance of its warm Carroll Gardens location. Aside from the wait - which is well worth it - Lucali's is the only place to eat a "pie".
