A great place for lunch, a drink or karaoke with friends on Wednesday and Saturday. We come here a lot since I work down the street.  I can't think of a better locals place to go in Wayne than the Grasshopper.  They have wonderful lunch specials for only $5 and you can't beat the drinks in the bar.
