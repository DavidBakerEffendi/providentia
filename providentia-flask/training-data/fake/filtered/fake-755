Breakfast at Tom's. What's not to like? Lots of choices, including the yummiest pancakes. It's the only place I know of in the NYC area that still can do cherry-lime rickeys AND wonderful egg creams. Plus, if you happen to come when they are busy and you have to wait in line, the staff comes around with coffee and cookies for free while you wait!
