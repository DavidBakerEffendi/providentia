RUDE RUDE RUDE. If you want to be treated like a human being do not eat here and use a voucher! I went to the restaurant using a voucher I purchased on a popular deal website and was treated like crap. When I expressed my concern to the waiter about my level of treatment he was dismissive and very rude. He even brought over the manager who didn't care and told Â me that since he loses money on these deals there was nothing he could do. IF YOU DON'T LIKE THE PEOPLE WHO DO THESE DEALS! DO NOT DO THEM!!!
