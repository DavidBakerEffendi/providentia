I would love to give Jadis more stars.  A great selection of wine including the best $20 bottle I have ever had.  The atmosphere is cozy but the food would have tasted much better if it hadn't been forced upon us.   I understand that tables are reserved for dining guests and when the first two members of our party of four arrived and told the host we planned to order food they didn't know that the other two of us had already eaten.  When our server realized that only two dinner orders would be placed, the logical response would have been to politely inform us that each member of the party must order. Instead, the tongue lashing we received was unwarranted, unprofessional and completely put a damper on the rest of the evening.  He actually yelled at us and stuck his pointed finger in the face of my friend and accused her of lying to him about us eating dinner.  If he had just told us kindly we would have had no problem ordering more food.  It was so outrageous that I was actually chuckling for awhile because I thought he was joking. My friends and I were appalled and agreed we had never been treated so rudely.  I am unsure of this man was a server or manager but he is definitely without any training in customer service and it wouldn't hurt if he enrolled in an anger management course.  It's sad to say that I cannot recommend this otherwise quaint wine bar and will not be returning.
