WARNING!!!!! Do not be fooled by the trendy-ness of this place. I do not typically write reviews but this place is GARBAGE! I am home sick from work today because of the absolutely awful food. How can you people actually say the food is even edible? I have a healthy appetite and love Mexican food, but barrio chino sucks! The guacamole was not fresh and quite possibly the worst guacamole I have ever eaten and the "cheese" in the quesadilla was more like play dough. Disgusting. I stopped eating mid-meal altogether and had severe stomach pains all night long, I actually vomited pieces of mushroom from the quesadilla this morning and had to call in sick. Thanks a lot! This place is number one on my list of worst restaurants, I've had deli food that was better. I was with 4 other Italians and we were all disgusted and in shock at how many "ignorant" (sorry people) customers were in there. First time and last time. Also, the waitress is a total moron. Seriously the worst attitude- "hello! Are you awake in there?" And she had the nerve to add gratuity to our table and we weren't even six. She literally was the worst waitress I've ever had who also forgot things and brought a soup that we didn't even order! You're not cute honey! Can this place get any worse? I know I'm tearing them apart but my day was ruined bc of the overpriced crappy food. One star bc of the cool factor that you think you're in an Asian restaurant and the decor is really raw. I thought "wow that's cool. They don't care about decor they must really put their care into the food". Yeah right, they must really put roaches into the food bc the taste was that gross and my and all if my friend's sicknesses today is evidence. They deserve to be out of business but there are too many trendy wannabes keeping this junk hole in business.
