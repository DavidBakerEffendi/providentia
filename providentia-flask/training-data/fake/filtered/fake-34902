Lame brunch.  The lady and I had heard wonderful things about this place and finally found a Sunday where there wasn't a huge line...and were wildly disappointed. This is ghost gourmet, where the greatness disappeared when we walked through the door. Don't get tricked into the fun hidden-NY-vibe by walking down the alley. There are too many great brunch places in NYC to waste time or money here. The dishes are uninventive and bland. The same can be said for our robot waitress. There is nothing on the menu that truly jumps out at you for brunch and when settling on the Skillet Eggs, I was astounded at how ordinary and tasteless it was. I could have made it from leftovers in my fridge, despite the fancy-style ingredients, such as gruyere and thick-cut bacon. And the lady's pork sandwich was phoned-in and slapped onto thick-cut sourdough to make it seem more than it was. And if you like a good Bloody-Mary, no booze before noon.  If I had that lame a menu, I'd try to get everyone as drunk as possible before eating. So, get there early, get a seat and get disappointed.
