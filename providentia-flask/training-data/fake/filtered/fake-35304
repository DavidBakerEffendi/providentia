Took a date here based on the reviews and was immediately regretting taking her here. We came in and the bartender, who looked like a menacing chubby thug Van Gogh, was so rude that someone nearby even whispered a joke along the lines of "No Mr. Torrence, not busy at all." a nice little Shining reference. Not sure if he overheard but seem to resent the hell out of pouring two beers. This was followed by us ordering food that was not only Â bad, as in poorly prepared with substandard ingredients, but very small portions that we waited a long time for. FTR, it was an order of peppers, a burger, and the shrimp tacos. The kitchen should not have served those shellfish, they should have told us they were out and suggested something else, they were clearly past their sell-by date. The much-ballyhooed outdoor space was unkempt and choked with smoke so we ate inside. When we got our bill they threw in cocktails that we had not ordered or drunk, we each tried three different beers. When I pointed out the mistake, Surlyman was unapologetic. This mistake is especially bothersome to me because upon closer reading, I see that other reviewers have had the same problem. Buyer beware. "Not too busy are ya' Lloyd? A ha ha ha ha." Head to Bar Reis instead.
