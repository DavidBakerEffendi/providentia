Found this place while wandering looking for food before a show. Very nice atmosphere and clean. Love that they sell alcohol! I had the Wiki Wiki burger which was amazing. The duck bacon and the pineapple relish with Gouda was fantastic. Hubby had the Goat Burger which was also delicious! We did have a side of fries with the curry ginger ketchup. YUMMY! The Chardonnay was nice and crisp, not too sweet. Hubby had Â the Blueberry soda and it was very refreshing. Organic, GMO free...go green is always good. And I didn't feel overly full after. Go try this place. One more thing..Ron, a staff member and our server was wonderful.
