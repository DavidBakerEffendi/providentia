Recently went for dinner with a friend.    Started out the with fried calmari/zucchini appetizer which was really crispy and was property seasoned.  The tomato sauce dip was a trifle spicy for my taste but my friend loved it and used it on the bread. My dinner was a chicken dish  with mushrooms (nonna or Grandma style)  served with a side of fabulous mashed potatoes.   It tasted liked marsala only the chicken was in chunks instead of flat pieces.   My only fault with this is that there wasn't enough sauce on the chicken to completely cover the potatoes, but next time I know to ask for extra. I tried a bite of my friedns veal saltimobocca, it was excellent. For dessert, I tried their homemade almond cake, which is where I felt a bit let down. I wanted lots of almond flavor, and this was more of a rustic pound cake with subtle undertones of almond and citrus.  It was good, just not what I was in the mood for.   The decaf cappucino was good and was really decaf, no waking up on in middle of the night because of caffiene consumed too late. Over all, the was a very pleasant and tasty dinner, I would definitly go back.  The prices are very reasonable for the quality of the food.   The portions are reasonable not huge.   Vee
