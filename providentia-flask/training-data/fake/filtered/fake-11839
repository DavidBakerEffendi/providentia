Expecting super food and lots of it. What we received was 3 small pieces of veal under a huge mound of CANNED mushrooms.!! It had absolutely no taste; even after loading it with salt and parmesan cheese. The other dish- pasta w/ meat sauce- was also tasteless and the sauce was canned also. Not even good canned sauce! Our waiter was very efficient but never commented on the fact that when we were finished..the service plates were still full. Will never go there again and will not recommend it to anyone!!!!!!!!!!
