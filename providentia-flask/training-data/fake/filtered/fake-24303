Hmm... while I think the food here is good, I think the problem is that expectations are set so high when it comes to anything related to the chef. I had 5 star expectations and if it wasnt for the fact that the service was excellent, i would really say this place is more of a 3.5 when it comes to the food. yes, the pork buns are awesome.. but the fried chicken was really a let down, especially given the hype. Dessert was ok, but the ice cream it came with was half melted by the time it reached us (but it was tasty) Since Its probably not fair to give this place just 3 stars, I'll let them pass and give them another shot. It prolly warrants it.
