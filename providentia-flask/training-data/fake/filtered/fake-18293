D'Angelo Italian Market is an absolutely beautiful store. The food is so amazing and the atmosphere is a mix between New York City and Italy. They have everything there from a brick oven pizzeria, panini's, hero's, cold cuts, prepared foods, salads, and the pastries (they are to die for)! The people working there are extremely helpful and friendly. I will definitely be going back there soon for some more pizza!! (and much much more)
