I am a HUGE fan of Michael Solomonov and Zahav so this is a REALLY difficult review for me to write. But here goes.... Most of the food here is good. The Jalapeno Cheddar corn bread, YUM. Good collards are no easy feat, but these were pretty impressive. The brisket was tender and delicious. The pulled pork was a little too smoky for my taste; hubby liked the ribs. Unfortunately, this food is not a good value for the cost. $5 for a tiny skillet of cornbread? $18 for 2 ribs and a 1/4 pound of pulled pork? Â Really? Folks that like good BBQ will expect to pay half of what is being charged here. With all of the research that Solomonov and his team did, they neglected to notice the price points of most BBQ joints. Although the food is good, the prices here make "comfort food" pretty uncomfortable.
