My coconut club was okay but there was one hard thing in it that I thought chipped my tooth and my husbands pork shank was TERRIBLE. It seemed like the kitchen wanted to cut corners which was a shame because they weren't busy. For $19 it should be tasty because of all the braising etc but they tried to save time by leaving it in the fryer too long to finish cooking and that's all you could taste. Old fryer oil. Also there was hardly any broccoli rob or potato (literally one little square) on the plate. Probably won't go back. It was our first and last visit. Not memorable.
