We went to Chambers Walk with a Groupon Deal.  First time, Last Time.  Bread was just cold, standard italian bread without even offering butter or olive oil.  Just bread.  Service was slow, salad was a salad...steak with OK.  Ordered a Sirloin and would have loved a Baked potato, ended up with diced breakfast potatoes, the kind you would get with your morning omlette. What can be said, not a very memorable experience.
