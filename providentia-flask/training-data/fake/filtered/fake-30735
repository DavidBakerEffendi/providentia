Leone's just started having brunch and let me tell you something right now...the brunch is AMAZING. As in, probably the best brunch in our area going. They do their eggs benedict with polenta and it's so much better than an English muffin...easier on their pallet and more flavorful. Their french toast and pancake choices looked divine, but I'm worried I may never get to try them because I'm so enamored with the Molto Benny (eggs benedict with lime, avocado, and more). Plus, the owner Michael Leone is a really stand-up wonderful guy, and he personally checks on you and makes sure you're having an amazing meal. If you want a real quality brunch with a nice atmosphere that isn't packed to the hilt, this is your place.
