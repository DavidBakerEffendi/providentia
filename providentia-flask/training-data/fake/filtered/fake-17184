Came here for the first time on 7/13/13 after having many friends recommend the place.  Walked in to a busy restaurant on Saturday around 4pm. Was sat in one of the few empty tables right away. Waiter came and gave menus, ordered within 5 minutes. We ordered Khasta Khachori (3 plates) and chaat masala french fries. The food came within 10 minutes and the portions were very large.  The taste was great, so great, in fact, that we ordered 4 more servings to go.  They didn't skimp on fillings at all like most other places do. The Khasta Kachori chaat had sev, mug, chana, onions, potatoes, dahi, 3 different kind of chutneys plus tasty chaat masala! My family and I were very pleased and also liked the service.  The To Go order was so neatly packed for our 4 hour drive home that nothing spilled and everything stayed good.  When we made it at home the next day, it was as if we were sitting in the restaurant eating fresh food again.  We would definitely go back here again and in fact we can;t wait!
