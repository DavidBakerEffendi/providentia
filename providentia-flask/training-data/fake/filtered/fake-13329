This place is great if you want something inexpensive, yummy, and fast. i typically order the fish tacos with guacamole, and kimchi fried chicken wings. the fish tacos are light and moist, and the mango salsa gives it a nice hit of acid and sweetness. The kimchi fried chicken wings are crispy and saucy (they're not too spicy, in case your wondering). only disappointing thing on this menu is the korean rice gnocchi. the texture was dry and the taste was bland. i've had korean gnocchi before and it was one of my favorite dishes, but kimchi grill's gnocchi is not so good. still, i eat here all the time - food is super consistent and the staff and delivery guys are nice, laid back, and professional.
