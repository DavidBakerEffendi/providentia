Absolutely love the place so unique from every other bar in NYC , the ambiance makes you feel like you have walked into a time warp! And how pleased I was with my welcome by a lovely host by the name of Bella I believe what a warm welcome she had gave me and my friends who were really excited to be here so a great way to start our experience here ! We sat  down  at a comfty both , and had a lovely waitress who was had so much knowledge about the place and also the food I believe our waitress had blonde streaks ! Our drinks were absolutely delightful and so was our food I was really pleased by the service  just whole place al together. I. Would recommend this place to friends and family.  Thank you Lillie's for a wonderful expirience I will be back !!!
