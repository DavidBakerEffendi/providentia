Went during the first week so understand that they are getting the kinks out. Staff was super friendly, which counts for a lot.  Drinks/beer good.  Food was not great.  For a menu with Greek overtones, the octopus really thew me that night: strangley mushy and no char at all - could not eat it. And my pulled pork sandwich was cubed meat, only OK.  NOt sure that I will go back.
