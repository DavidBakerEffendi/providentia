Awful service.  Pizza was good but waited the duration of my meal for a drink refill, then an entire hour and fifteen minutes just to pay.. then no comp they still charged the full amount.  They need to either get their stuff together, or just close.  I will not be back for a long time. Update: Matt C.'s review is a must-read.  Well put.
