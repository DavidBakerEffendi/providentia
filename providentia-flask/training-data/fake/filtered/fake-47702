best pizza I ever had.   (and for what they charge, it better be) I lived in Dumbo years ago,  back then Grimaldi's was called Patsi's.   they were always busy, but no line. then they got a plug from a soldier in Iraq (the first war,  started by papa Bush) who had to walk eight days out of enemy territory,  eating bugs n other survival stuff,  only moving at night.  he said on the news,  the thought of a Pasti-Grimaldi pizza helped him keep going,   Since then the lines went crazy,  and a bunch of patsi pizzas opened up in manhattan. Grimaldi's in owned by the same family that owned (and sold) the original patsi's in east Harlem.  (yes the one Frank Sinatra used to frequent,  Rumor has it,  they were allowed to deliver (the had a no delivery policy) to Sinatra when he was staying at the Plaza (the hotel didn't allow deliveries).  but he was Sinatra. I haven't been there in 20 years,  but as the line suggest,  the pizza is still great,  the best sausage, best crust,  best cheese,  spiciest red pepper flakes.   etc etc
