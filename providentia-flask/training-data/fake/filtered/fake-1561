great restaurant! very delicious indian food! i've been there several times trying different dishes and they all were very good. The ingredients are fresh and of high quality. The indian spices are are very well selected for each meal and you can choose from super-hot to very mild. The people there take great care of you and are always very friendly! you usually get some bread and dips as well as a small dessert for FREE! check it out - you won't be dissapointed!
