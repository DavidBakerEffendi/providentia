While visiting Philadelphia we felt that we must find some authentic cheesesteaks, and to our disappointment we found Pat's. We had found various places recommending them, so we decided to try there's. We will not go again. I am sure there are far better places as the meat was on the dry side, the cheese very minimal, bread stale, and both the cheesesteaks and drinks cost a premium that they failed to warrant. The employers seemed distant and and disinterested. All in all it wasn't terrible, but it was certainly subpar.
