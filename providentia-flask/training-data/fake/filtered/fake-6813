Best Hungarian food in the area, and has my vote for best ethnic food overall.  Affordable, delicious, and a great family place.   It's a simple place, but the service is FAST and the food is hot.  We started with a bread basket and the cucumber salad - a nice mix of sweet with a garlicky bite on the back end.   The Chicken Paprika is the best I have ever had.  2 good sized chicken thighs on a huge plate of nokedli.  I ate it with a spoon to avoid leaving any of the amazing juices behind.  The chicken was so tender it was falling off the bone.  There was so much nokedli that I needed help finishing it.   My husband had the Hungarian Goulash.  Very tasty, in a big bowl with a large amount of super-tender beef.  Nice and hot as well.   We took 2 strudels home - one apple, one cherry.  Both were big enough to need 2 days to eat.  Strudels were flaky without being dry, and both the filling were good.  All that for about $45 before tip.  Left feeling full, and excited for our next trip back.
