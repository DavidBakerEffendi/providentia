Pizza was amazing, we had the Funghi(mushrooms).  It was great.  for the appetizer we had the Mozzarella Pizzaiola, which is the mozzarella di bufala, it's amazing as well, highly recommend.  The beer was good, had Birra Moreti(i think that's how you spell it), very good, and nice & cold! :)  One down side my fiance couldn't have her favorite which is a Riesling, the wine was somewhat limited.  But great time, went there for Valentine's Day.
