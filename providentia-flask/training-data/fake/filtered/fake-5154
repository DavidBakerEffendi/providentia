After reading other positive reviews, I was quite excited to go here.  Unfortunately, it has gone down hill.  The lobster bisque was bland and tasted oddly like carrot.  The fried calamari was like something you would find at a TGI Fridays for 2x the cost.  The steak frite was palatable, but mostly because it was covered in butter and nothing special.  The fries were okay as well, but again as with everything...just bland.  Bland, expensive, and overrated.  The service was friendly.
