I really cannot understand the hype about this place. The food is mediocre at best but I guess prices are what really matter to the regular patrons here.  Food took forever.  Service was subpar and unapologetic.  Manager was a bit strange and kept hovering over the tables.  Overall, not a pleasant experience!  I'd rather spend more money and go home feeling like I actually had a good night.
