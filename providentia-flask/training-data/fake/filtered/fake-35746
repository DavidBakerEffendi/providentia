I'll start this review by saying that I am French - been in Astoria for over 4 years now - and been to Café Triskell a good half a dozen times already. My father's side of the family comes from Brittany - Where crepes are originated - so I was fed with the real stuff from an early age. The crepes at Café Triskell are simply the best ones I've had since I came to the US. And god knows that wherever I go I always try crepes if they're on the menu. The chef just knows how to cook them to perfection, any of them on the menu are good. I haven't tried the sandwiches but my friends, whom I bring there regularly - they all become huge fans like me - have and were never disappointed. In terms of drinks I recommend especially the house cocktail "Kir Breton" which is cider + crème de cassis. A very, very well-deserved five stars!
