After a long wait the Peacock in is finally open once again after  massive renovations. I stopped in for dinner only 6 days after they reopened on 5-23-2010 not knowing what to expect. They have done a beautiful renovation of the building both inside and outside. Parking is a bit tough (we had to park on the street on 27 and make the walk as the lot was full) and the location a little far outside of downtown, but worth the trouble to give it a try. I had the tortellini and my dinner guest the lobster special. My tortellini was excellent. Portion size was on the small side though so don't come too hungry. I tried a bite of the lobster which was very fresh and nicely prepared. For dessert definitely have the peanut butter mousse if it's still available - it was amazing! Portion size on dessert is much larger, just what my diet needed!  The service was good, better than I would have expected for only 6 days open and bound to improve. Wine list is a bit limited though, which hopefully will improve as well. Overall a good meal and a place I will be visiting again. Also toured the hotel while there, rooms are on the small side but very luxurious, wish I had a reason to stay there to try the hotel out as well!
