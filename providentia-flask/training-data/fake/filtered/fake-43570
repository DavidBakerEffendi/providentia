You must RUN to Han Dynasty NOW! Last night, my gentleman and I finally had the chance to experience the famous Monday night tasting party (1st and 3rd Monday of each month).  We made our reservation three months in advance and had been counting the days since.  Already a fan of the Royersford Han Dynasty location, we couldn't wait to try the Olde City branch. The experience was everything we hoped it would be.  Han himself was in prime form.  It was his birthday, and we were honored to sing Happy Birthday to him.  Reviewers who have commented that Han is rude or abrasive or condecending just don't get it.  They don't get him or his genius or his vision.  He LOVES what he does and LOVES sharing his insight and his creations with his patrons. The tasting menu is a veritable food orgy, a cornucopia of different flavors and textures.  At least 80% of it was very spicy, but he gave us a break now and then with less spicy offerings. This menu is not for the timid or squeamish or bland.  Step outside the box of "normal" Chinese food and live a little.  It's so worth it.
