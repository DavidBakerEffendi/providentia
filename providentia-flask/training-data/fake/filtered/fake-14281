Small, intimate place but they make the most of the room they have. Decorated to look like some random Cajun bar they do a great job. The atmosphere is awesome and the wait/bar staff are always on point. I've been there too many times to count and they've not once messed up an order nor have I had to return one. I recommend ANYTHING on the menu. They have live music Sunday, Tues and Wed with dinner specials Sunday through Wednesday. I love it.
