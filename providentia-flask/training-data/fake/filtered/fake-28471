If you like SALT, then you will LOVE ACACIA!  We sat for 30 minutes with not even bread, we finally found the waitress and asked for bread and about 10 minutes later it came.  It was no doubt frozen and thawed out and heated, not good at all!  We started with the Clams and mussles appetizer.  Sounded great on the menu, but when it came it was just steamed clams and the broth tasted like a cup of salt water from the ocean with a couple of tomato pieces mixed in, Horrible and extremely salty!  My wife ordered the halibut special with prawns  and tomato risotto.  Fish was cooked well, prawns were overdone and tough, a blah dish overall, especially for a $42.00 price tag.  I  ordered the veal osso bucco special.  The veal itself was a good piece of meat, however the sauce was extremely salty!  Other than the salt it was flavorless.  And it took an hour and a half to get our meal!  We ordered the chocolate torte for dessert with banana ice cream, it was decent but nothing to write home about.  I don't know how Acacia gets any good reviews.  Our bill totaled $109 for an appetizer, two dinners, one dessert and a cup of coffee, and we brought our own wine!  I have had better dinners at chain restaurants and at least I leave satisfied.  At Acacia eat at your own risk, especially if you have high blood pressure!
