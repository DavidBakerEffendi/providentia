Had an awful experience with one of the employees, didn't catch her name but she worked in the pizza area, short blonde hair....SOO RUDE! I don't know what her problem was but we went to get some pizza and because we were 5 people, there was an hour and half wait. Understandable. But then we asked if we could order it to go because we were in a rush to get to the airport. She said, "oh we don't do to go, this is a restaurant so you have to be seated to order." (With a smart ass attitude). Â REALLY BLONDIE? I thought it was a grocery store!!! Then thanks to the girl working next to her...she informed us that we could order to go and that it wasn't a problem. This place should really screen their employees for decency before hiring.
