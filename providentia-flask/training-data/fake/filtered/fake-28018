We went to Talula's for my husband's birthday and had a wonderful dining experience. The food was terrific as was the service. Our waitress brought us a special appetizer and dessert to celebrate the birthday, which was unexpected and great. One of the best meal's we have had in the city. It was raining, so unfortunately we didn't get to sit outside.
