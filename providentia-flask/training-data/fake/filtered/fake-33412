I came here a few weeks ago with a friend, and we had a great experience. We both had steak with blue cheese on top and it was delicious. My steak was cooked perfectly, however my friend had to send hers back because it was a little more rare than she had ordered. I had the brussell sprouts with crumbled bacon on the side, which were also very tasty. I was displeased that the sides were a la carte, but I guess that should have been expected with a fancy restaurant. I had a sort of iced cream cake for dessert and it was the perfect ending to our meal. I think what really set our experience over the top was our waiter. I believe his name was Chris. He was super attentive to our needs, courteous, friendly, and even made a point to have my dessert dish decorated with "happy half birthday,' because I had told him that's what I was celebrating. My one disappointment were the drink specials. I usually love Max's for their cocktails, as that the tavern has some of the best in my opinion, but theirs were sub par. I would definitely come back here, but I might have to win the lottery first with the NYC prices they have.
