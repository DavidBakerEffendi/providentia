We went down to grimaldi's in Coney Island and it was okay.  The ambience was a bit like any other chain restaurant.  I assume the original joint is little more interesting.  The pizza was solid.  But not earth-shattering.   As we were leaving I noticed a white-pizza that looked and smelled amazing.  If we go again, we'll check out the original location and try something other than an original pepperoni pie.
