The cilantro, the spice! Ahhh!! I love it. I always tell myself I'll just eat half the sandwich and save the other half for later. NOPE, never happens .....but, that might also be because my Mom raised me as a fat kid and wouldn't let me leave the table until I was done with my food. But, seriously, ignore my bottomless pit of a stomach and pay attention to the tastiness. Cheap, too (I know some people say they've gotten it for cheaper, but all the places I have gone in Manhattan are yuck and higher priced). The decor is most DEFINITELY bare bones-- don't expect an 85 degree restaurant with a fire lit in the back, but, hey, it's Sunset Park and we take what we can get here. My only desire is that this Ba Xuyen was open later than 6:30 PM (closes at that time everyday) that way I can get the yum yums after work for dinner! When I found this place right around the corner from my apartment AND tasted how good it was- yep, I was ready to re-sign my lease and never let my proximity to such deliciousness go.
