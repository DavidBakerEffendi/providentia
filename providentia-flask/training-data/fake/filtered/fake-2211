Went for breakfast at Clinton St. Baking Company when the restaurant opened and ended up back at home for lunch. My boyfriend stood outside Â for 1:45 minutes waiting for a table. When we finally got a table I ordered the blueberry pancakes and a hot apple cider whilst my boyfriend opted for the eggs Benedict. The meal was a complete disappointment! My boyfriend described his eggs Benedict as "poached eggs on a Popeye's biscuit with a creme sauce". My pancakes were so sweet that I couldn't even eat half of it and both of us were nursing stomach aches by the time we caught a cab home. The only reason I am giving Clinton St. Baking Company one star is for the hot apple cider and the lovely staff.
