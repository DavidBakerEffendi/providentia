My friend told me this was the best ramen around.  There's a spot in So Cal that I held allegiance to.  ...Then I ate Ippudo.  WOW. First off, the pork buns:  Why would I pay $8 for 2 pork buns?  Could it actually be thattt good?  Can't Chinatown do them better for like 1/10 the price?  Well let me tell you...one bite, and you'll want to get lost in the perfectly soft, pillowy tasty, sweet, savoriness of these pork buns. Ramen:  Yes, the soup base is heavy.  Yes, it's expensive.  But WOW it's good.  'nough said.
