Unfortunately, my family and I were not able to eat at Gennaro's. We had a reservation at 6pm, and it was not until 6:40 that the owner told us that he would not be able to honor our reservation. He was extremely unprofessional with us, and we would not go back there, just based on their organization and staff. Do not go here on a weekend night.
