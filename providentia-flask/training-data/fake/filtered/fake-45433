Lots of places try to be healthy or pretend to offer good wholesome food that ends up tasting like flavorless cardboard. Well PF succeeds at everything they do.   Coming from NJ, my wife and I like to try new places in Philly and this one is now at the top of our "revisit" list. Let me just say that we are not vegetarians, we just like good fresh food and PF has meat anyway, after reading the other reviews, I wish I had tried the turkey - next time! We had a delicious pair of salads - fresh brussels sprouts with carrot and orange, and the other was fresh kale with wheat berries and squash puree - they were both DELICIOUS and full of flavor and texture.  We tried a hot soup of cauliflower, cilantro and kale which was also great Lastly was a 50% off sandwich (from the day before-thanks for not wasting food) which was awesome - lentil spread and roast veggies on Neff (whatever the heck that is) bread - YUMM - after it sat a day all the flavors melded even more probably. We ate everything.  The quiche looked good - so did the shakes; I guess we'll try them next time. The decor is this kind of rustic and cool interior a la Le Pain Quotidien and works well - we sat at the bright window counters. And lastly, I really love that all the throwaway stuff can be recycled and the owners actually have cans for this! This policy matters to the two of us and we try not to waste - so thanks! The guys behind the counter were pleasant and professional. So happy to find a new eatery in Philly and hope they stay a good long time.
