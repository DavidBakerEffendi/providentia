I love their pizza greatly but their customer service and management is greatly lacking. I came to bar with friends after calling the restaurant and being told i "wouldn't need a reservation". When we got there, we were told it was a 45 minute wait. So we spent some time at the bar and a group of people offered us their table after about 45 minutes. A waitress informed us we needed to immediately leave the table because it was reserved for a group even though the group was already there and eating? Confusing. I went to the hostess to see how much longer the wait would be and she told us an HOUR. I tried to explain to her that we had been waiting for almost an hour and she apathetically apologized when I told her because of this experience I wouldn't be returning to the restaurant. It's too bad because the live music and the pizza is awesome. :(
