What a creative menu! And so much for vegetairans to choose from! So happy to have such creative and tasty options to choose from! We had to be elsewhere, so picked up 2 rolls and miso soup. The soup was mushroomy -- lovely for me, tho a surprise for my son who is not a big mushroom fan. The soup was tasty tho. We got the spicy broccoli tempura roll and the sweet potato roll. Lovely to have brown rice, tho it was a bit on the mushy side. Since I was ordering mostly for my son's lunch, I couldn't explore the menu as much as I would have liked -- want to try the happy piggie roll and others! Definitely looking forward to going back and eating in!
