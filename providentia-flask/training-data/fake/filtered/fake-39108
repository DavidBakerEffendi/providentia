This is my first review on Yelp and Basso 56 truly deserves it. My wife and I are originally from DC.  Last time we were here in NYC, my wife tried the seafood risotto and fell in love.  Literally.  I've never seen her mention a dish for 6 straight months, wanting to come back to NY just to have it again. When we came back, I surprised her with dinner at Basso 56.  The maitre'd, who overhead our conversation that this was my wife's favorite, really took pride that we had made a point to visit his restaurant.  He introduced several wines, gave us some tastings, and chatted about the restaurant and the chef.  My wife was loving it - good wine and even better food. Just as the bill came, the maitre'd also presented us with two GENEROUS pours of limoncello.  Gratis.  And man, was it good.  Dessert liquors are a bit strong for her, but I love the stuff. Key takeaways - the food is great and  is reasonably priced even for Manhattan standards.  But what makes it deserving of 5 stars is the service.  Aleksander really showed us that he valued our patronage and went out of his way to make this a great night for us.  And it's not just us - he chatted and shook hands with every guest that night. Basso 56 makes it a point to give a warm welcome, good value and great tasting food, and service that makes you wonder why other restaurants can't be like them.
