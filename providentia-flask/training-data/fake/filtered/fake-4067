I'm new to yelp. I'm a yelp baby, if you will. I want to write a positive review, but Caseus, I have to tell you, I've got some beef with you - and it isn't grass fed. My boyfriend and I were here as they were boasting a southern special - fried chicken and "southern style" braised bacon.....Please, Chef at Caseus - Don't insult southerners like this! I lived there for 15 years, this didn't come close. Just because you slap southern in the title, it doesn't mean it is! Take a trip there at least!.. Two stars for attentive service. Other than that, you're lack of respect for the southern cuisine was a little upsetting. It just goes to show, Northerners don't know what fried chicken is all about.
