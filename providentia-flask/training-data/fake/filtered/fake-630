Poor service!   One day I placed my order which was Oxtail and rice-n-pies, they were out of rice-n-pies so ask if i could buy an order of oxtail instead, the owner rolled her eyes and said it would cost you $12 for three pieces (thats the same price for the meal, which include rice and vegetable).  I've been served cold food on two separate occasion, the prices on there food items went up within months of the restaurant opening.  It seems like as business got better they raised the prices, in my opinion the food items are over priced.
