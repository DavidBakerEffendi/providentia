Put this place on top of your "great Â eats" list. I've been to this restaurant a bunch of times and each time I go it gets better and better (and it was pretty awesome the first time). It's located at the witherspoon st. If you're out shopping or going to the bars, stop by this casual place and get a lot of food for a great price!! Last night's dinner: vegetable samosa chicken Tikka Masala saag Paneer garlic naan Lamb kabab basmati rice Previously, I've had the chicken makhani, lamb vindaloo and aloo gobi. The food is always fresh and incredibly flavorful. Also, the prices are totally reasonable for the portion & quality. The place is super clean and staff are very friendly.
