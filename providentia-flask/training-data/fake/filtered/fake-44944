I am a big fan of Fuel, it's one of my favorite places to eat lunch in Center City.  I've been there at least 6 times and still have items that I can't wait to try.  The atmosphere is bright and airy but it kinda has a Jersey Shore feel (I don't mean Seaside and Wildwood, I mean fist pumping and electronica).  The seating area is quite narrow and the place can be a bit loud so it's not the best place to read unless you're hella-focused but I think the food makes up for it. I've never had a salad or wrap but I've had many of the appetizers, paninis and smoothies and have not been disappointed.  Oh, and Fuel also has dessert.  Fuel is famous, apparently, for their banana whips, but I don't recommend it.  However, the key lime pie is pretty tasty as is the pumpkin cheesecake. Items of note for my fellow consumers: 1)  They take Discover Card, yay!!! 2)  I highly recommend the Spicy Spanish Skewered Shrimp, it's so good, I am trying to duplicate the recipe at home. 3)  FUEL DELIVERS!!! Note: Since I prefer a sit down experience at a restaurant, I take my lunch from 1:30-2:30pm to beat the rush, so I cannot comment on the quality of service during the busier times.  Generally, I recommend looking up a menu and knowing what you are going to get (drinks and dessert included) before you go to a restaurant, especially if you are on your lunch hour.
