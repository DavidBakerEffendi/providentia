Best buffet in the area...unfortunately that doesn't mean that it's THE best buffet, but it keeps me coming back again and again. Yeah it gets crowded, yeah the service is sorta slow, but free refills and consistently good, not great, food and a pretty decent variety of food, from frog legs to crab legs, you'll find something to eat and if you're like me, seconds and probably thirds. Just sayin.
