This is definitely the best authentic Mexican food on Staten Island.  This is a family owned and run business.  The burritos are sizeable and delicious.  The carne enchilada is nicely seasoned with a little kick, it's a savory choice in tacos and burritos.  The quesadillas come in 3's and use traditonal chees in fried tortillas.  The chorizo chunks in a quesadilla are perfect for anyone who likes a little spice.  If you've been searching for good Mexican food in NYC, this is it! As a former Californian, I strongly recommend La Roqueta.
