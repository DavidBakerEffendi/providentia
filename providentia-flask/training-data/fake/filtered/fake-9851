What a great find in Williamsburg. I made a reservation for a table in the "garden room" (which i highly recommend as the main dining room can be somewhat tight and loud) and were seated promptly at the requested time. We started with Mojitos and were then going to order wine but the Mojitos were so good that we ordered more with our meal
