We've been there several times just for coffee, which is a bit expensive but they brew it individually so it's always fresh. Coffee can range from $2.50 to $3.25 (just coffee, no espresso drinks) but are worth it once in a while. So given the vibe of the place and yes, the music selection is good we decided to give the food a try. Great idea gone bad... My husband ordered the gouda, we both liked it but it is NOT enough food for the price ($10), it comes with a side of salad, a very small one. And I ordered the open face focaccia with ajvar and feta cheese and it was just two pieces of bread with a spread of ajvar (so faint that I could hardly taste it) and sprinkled with feta cheese ($10), so basically I paid 10 dollars for just bread.... we spent $30 at the place, left still hungry and went somewhere else to have the rest of our dinner. I get the idea of making something simple fancy but it HAS to taste great. We felt ripped off, it was way overpriced. Not going back.
