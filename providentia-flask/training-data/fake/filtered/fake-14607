I will definitely seek elsewhere next. This one of the most disgusting restaurants I have ever been in this city . I have enjoyed pizza from most ever known pizza place here,NYC,Rome,Florence, Chicago,Boston, Providence. I had very low expectations, but this was unreal. The crust was doughy,pasty white, even after fully cooking the color was beige at best.All te topping were tasteless and useless, the cheese was that industrial ultra white cheese that one hopes never to encounter. I have no idea how this place stays in business, but be the later hours. The kitchen was filthy, there was a B on the card out front and under no circumstances will I have be hungry enough to go back there.
