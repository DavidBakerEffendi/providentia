Kabab Paradise in Lake Hiawatha, NJ has a diverse blend of quality food at a very reasonable price. They offer traditional Afghanistan cuisine as well as traditional American food. Their gyro's and burgers are to die for. You won't find any food like it, as there are no comparable restaurants out there. The food is cooked to order and is always fresh & delicious. They use high-quality, fresh ingredients and even do delivery. The staff is very friendly and the atmosphere in the restaurant is wonderful. I would highly recommend Kabab Paradise to anyone.
