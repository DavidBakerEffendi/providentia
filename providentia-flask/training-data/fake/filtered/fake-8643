I'd definitely recommend this place. A warm atmosphere releases from the good mood of the hosts and from the arrangements of the space. The new environment the new owners have created appeals the client the stay for the time of an enjoyable dinner and a few drinks. The food is delicious: I tried the duck rillettes and the stuffed cabage (I highly recommend both). It's also well accompanied by a range of wines that are very good. I'm going to go back there for sure. I want to try everything on the menu. Starting with the seared foie gras. Thanks for the good time I spent there!
