I came here for dinner back in November 2012.  Customer service was exceptional (5 stars), but food was a bit disappointing (3 stars). I ordered the grilled Berkshire pork chop and hanger steak.  The presentation of the pork chop looked great, but was tough and dry.  I tried my best to eat it.  I gave up 1/3 way.  Some of the beans were cooked through and some underdone.  I was hesitant about telling the waiter, but ended up informing him.  The steak was tasty, but chewy. A gentleman, the manager or the host, approached my table and kindly apologized for the pork chop.  He asked if I would like something else and that I would not be charged for the item.  Instead of replacing the entree, I ordered dessert.  I ordered vanilla ice cream sandwich and another item.  Both items were decent.   When I received my bill, the waiter informed me that the desserts were on the house too.  I felt bad about telling them about the pork chop :(  However, I was pleasantly surprised and grateful for the genuine kindness.  The manager/ host and waiter surpassed my customer service expectations and I would go back for drinks and perhaps food.
