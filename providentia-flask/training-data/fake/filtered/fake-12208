Every meal I've had has been fabulous as creativity accompanies flavor, and a mission of sustainable food cycles. You won't see some standard rolls such as Yellowtail, but these omissions are intentional and reflect a vision of a place that truly walks the walk. A lot of restaurants latch onto marketable words like "organic" and "local," but Miya's gives max effort to sustainable food. Adventurous people with an appreciation for stewardship of the environment who know the hidden costs of cheap food will walk away with a satisfied belly and mind. A must do in New Haven!
