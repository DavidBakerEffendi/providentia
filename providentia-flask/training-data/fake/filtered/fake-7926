So you know when you find something incredibly good on a menu at a certain place and you keep getting that one thing without trying anything else? Well, I've been doing that here. The vegan chicken cheese steak (with everything) -so so good. Last time I was in I did add the yellow split pea soup to my order last time since it was so chilly out and it was also deliciously yummy. Staff is always friendly and work quickly to get orders out. I always seem to rolling out of this place, especially when I get desert! So incredibly good. I could eat here everyday.
