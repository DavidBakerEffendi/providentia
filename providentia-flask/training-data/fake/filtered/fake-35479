The waitress was friendly and helpful, and moved us from a table in a corridor into a more comfortable spot with a smile. The beer selection was awesome, and she was knowledgeable about it. We shared a huge plate of steamed mussels that came in an unusual and delicious broth, which included capers. We both had the build your own burger as a main, and I had the truffle mac n cheese, while my partner had truffled fries. My only complaint was that I couldn't finish my food, and had nowhere to store the leftovers in our hotel, so I couldn't take it home for later! The tab for an excellent meal and a couple of drinks each was around $90, which seemed reasonable for the quality of the food and the atmosphere, particularly with the sticker shock I've been suffering at even humble eateries around here.
