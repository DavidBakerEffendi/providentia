This is really a four and a half star review, but for some reason yelp won't let me give them their half star.   I came in with my girlfriend last weekend after we had walked out of the Mercer Kitchen in Soho because of non existent service and man am I glad we found Locanda Verde.   First of all, everyone was very nice and the service was extremely attentive.  I felt like every time I needed something, bam, a server or back waiter magically appeared and fulfilled my need without me evening needing to ask.  It was clear their staff was really well trained and always watching our table and to me, that type of service is extremely important.   We had a grilled octopus appetizer, a pork and a ravioli entree, and a flour less chocolate cake desert.  All were really excellent.  The wine list was extensive and our bottle was very good for the price.  Overall we had a great time here.  I would have given a flat out 5 star rating, but my girlfriends ravioli portion was just a bit too small.  Other than that, we had a truly wonderful experience.
