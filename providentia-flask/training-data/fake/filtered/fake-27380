So tonight ( 6/20/13) my Family & I went here for my Son's Graduation Dinner. We waited close to 1 .5 hrs for a table. We were there with my wife's parents who are not as young as they used to be. When they finally seated us, the table was right at the entrance to the bathrooms & the Kitchen doors. The Kitchen doors slamming back & forth & the Flushing of the toilets made for a less than appetizing location & the food when it came did nothing to help matters. Going to a restaurant & eating food that looked & tasted like it was made with canned sauce was appalling. The Cost of a Chicken Parm. with Pasta dish is way over priced for this kind of so called cooking!!! My Chicken Marsala was what looking like Brown Gravy with a touch of Marsala, Pancheta & Mushrooms tossed in. The Pizza was good as it has been for yrs & my kids enjoyed it. But we will never again eat in the restaurant here again!!! Â I know how to & can cook every dish that we ate from the kitchen @ L&B and can say without a doubt that that my food is 100 times better than what the so called cooks turned out tonight. I am sorry that we ate there tonight. We should have just gone there picked up a couple of Square Pies & that would have been better.
