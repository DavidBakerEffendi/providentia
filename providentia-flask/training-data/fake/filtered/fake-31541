Blend On The Water is my favorite restaurant to visit. Nothing tops delicious food served on the most beautiful views NYC can have. There juicy, tasteful arepas are to die for. The service is spectacular from the moment you walk in to moment you leave. Best of all the drinks, the sangria gets 10 thumbs up. Price range is low for the awesome service and food. Very humble staff to complete your evening! Will recommend and will keep going for every special occasion or even just to have a drink with good company!
