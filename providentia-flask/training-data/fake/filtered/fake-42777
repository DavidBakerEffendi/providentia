The food is excellent. The chef isn't timid about experimenting with different ideas, and I love it. The buffalo calamari is light and fluffy, not heavy, chewy or greasy. And the sauce is spicy but sweet. I ordered the Bacon, Ranch, Chicken pizza, it was phenomenal. And we ordered lobster mashed potatoes to split because it sounded awesome... and it was. High recommended.
