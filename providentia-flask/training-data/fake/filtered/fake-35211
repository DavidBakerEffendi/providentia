Gaia Italian Café is a nice place for me, Good for food and dessert although slow in serving food but i admitted that I love waiting when ordering those screamly delicious lasagna and salad. Everytime we eat together with my girl we cant help our self to like it. And obviously with the people here, talking the good with this Café. The place Luring people because of there food and ofcourse with the cool owner and services. They Asking that how are we. Worthy enough for a person like me to have this kind of place where i can relax anytime specially summer is heading now. I cant wait to go there again.
