In a city/state/borough seemingly populated by as many pizzerias as people, Grimaldi's serves fresh pizza ingredients...and fresh hosts.   I waited on line with the significant other for over an hour.  I didn't care at the time, since Grimaldi's popularity (and hype) precedes itself. When I finally got in front of the line, the host -- an elderly man sporting a black shirt and pants, black fedora, and white suspenders a la Billie Jean -- began flashing numbers with his hands like he was some crazed stock broker at the NYSE...except at the line of waiting people.  At first, I couldn't  tell who he was pointing out, as people quickly scrambled inside like they were panic-stricken cattle.  I saw him give me (or maybe the people in front or behind me) a peace sign.  When I hesitated, he screamed, "What does this look like?!!? Am I holding up 2 fingers or what?!!!?   When I grabbed my s.o. to run inside, he yelled after us, "You're killing me here!!!!"   Maybe he was angry that it was no longer the 1980s.   The servers were alright.  Pizza came out fairly quickly, although I don't usually enjoy eating burnt, black crust on my pizza.  Like I said, the ingredients were fresh, but it was nothing special.   In summation: mediocre/decent pizza, but sh*t service.  If you want to eat good pizza, skip Grimaldi's.  There are literally hundreds of other (better) substitutes.
