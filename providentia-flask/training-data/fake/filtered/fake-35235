We were a party of 8 at 7pm on Saturday night. Far too busy talking to look at the menu so as a previous reviewer had done I just asked the owner to feed us and the result was fantastic. A tasty salad to start, huge antipasto dishes and several of the pasta dishes to follow. The mushroom dish and the spinach gnocchi were excellent. We had two vegetarians with us who did well and two teenagers for whom a completely superfluous but delicious extra pizza was thrown in. A few panninis appeared as well, most of which we had to take home with us. We ran out of wine (it is BYO) but were given a number for a local shop who delivered to our table within minutes. Just a great experience.
