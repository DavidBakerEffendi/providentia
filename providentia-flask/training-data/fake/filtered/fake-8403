I went into Jones Restaurant recently to enjoy a couple drinks.  The bartender with the red hair was really nice & sweet, but almost a little too much.  She kept giving me these cringing, fake-smiles mixed with empty stares.  I kept trying to figure out why I was feeling so uncomfortable & why she was acting so strange.  I realized that she was definitely acting like she was high on drugs, probably marijuana or maybe some kind of pills.  I don't know myself, but I imagine it would be hard to tend a bar while being messed up on drugs.  Either way, this girl was OUT OF IT & she was creeping me out, she definitely didn't realize how uncomfortable I felt.  I left after the first drink & went to La Scala across the corner.  From what I know, Steven Star Restaurants are the best of the best, I would think they drug test the employees.  But this girl looked like she had inhaled a whole doobie right before she came in.  I wouldn't sit at that bar again while she is working.
