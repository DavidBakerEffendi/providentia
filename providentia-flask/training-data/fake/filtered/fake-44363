Hostess rating is 1 out of 10 Service manager is 1 out of 10 Waiting Staff is 9 out of 10 Food and Presentation is 9 out of 10. Priced reasonably. Food and waiting staff are truly an enjoyable experience.  Do not be late for your reservation made during their happy hour.  The hostess and service manager will not hold the table for you. They will be rude and simply ignore you while you are waiting for another table.  At least, that what we had to experience being 10 minutes late.
