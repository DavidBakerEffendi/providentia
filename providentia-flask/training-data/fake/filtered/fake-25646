Finally, a Greek restaurant that's modern, fun and absolutely mouth watering. From the Mediterranean inspired cocktails to the flavorful traditional spreads, savory main courses ( our group ordered the Salmon, Halibut and Rib eye) and last but not least desserts that cannot be missed. We can't wait to go back!
