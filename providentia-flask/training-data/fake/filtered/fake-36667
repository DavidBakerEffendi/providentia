I have been here a couple of times..mostly for lunch or happy hour and haven't had an experience quite like this... The other night my boyfriend and I took a friend from out of town for dinner. The weather was great and the night was off to a good start. We were seated outside and started chatting and catching up. 30 minutes goes by and a waiter has not even come by to ask us for drinks or anything. Finally, a person shows up and acts  friendly and doesn't even apologize for making us wait for that long. He takes our orders and we wait another 45 minutes for the food to finally arrive.  We do not have any  napkins or silverware. The waiter does not even ask "if we need anything else"... My friend ordered a mojito that tasted like crap. I ordered a golden monkey and so did my boyfriend...after eating our food and consuming our drinks...we wait for the check. When it doesn't arrive I go up to waiter to ask for it....and then I see an automatic 18% added on....which is shocking because the service was awful!  I do not plan on going here ever again.
