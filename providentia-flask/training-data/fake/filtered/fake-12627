Rye is a solid restaurant with an imaginative chef and very good food as well as ambience. It is my go to place to have dinner after a long day working near by. The food is interesting as well. Scotch eggs anyone? Their selection of wine are very good. I prefer a soft easy drinking red and often their offering by the glass is very satisfying. The social scene that develops later on in the evening gives the place a pleasant din. Rye is a good place to have dinner or a lite snack and drinks. Their small plates are interesting and very good. Not your usual boring fare but well thought out creative dishes served well.
