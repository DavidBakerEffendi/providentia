The four times I have been there in the last week (for a girl on a budget- that is saying a lot!) have been consistently amazing. The service was very attentive and friendly and the food delicious! Momos are a family favorite. The chow mein is made with handmade noodles and really yummy. The food is milder than Indian food but can be spicy if requested. I cannot say enough good things about this restaurant.
