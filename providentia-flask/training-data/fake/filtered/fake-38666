Where to begin with this Gem of a restaurant.  First issue is scoring a reso, once you've done that sit back and enjoy.  Yes its pricey and Yes it will be crowded at bar and yes you may wait 10 mins to sit, but its all worth it as your escorted into what feels like a townhouse.  We were seated upstairs which was beautifully decorated. For apps we had a few of the crudo which were so well seasoned and fresh it litteraly melted in your mouth...flavors popped left and right. we then had three pastas - garganelli, bucatini, and the capalacei.  They were all 10 out of 10!  Spectacular!  We wanted more!(back to that in a minute) for entrée we had Octopus, Branzino, and a pork chop all fantastic but PASTA! So we did what any four Italians would do, skip desert and we ordered Another Pasta!!  This time the spaghetti and agai  PERFECTO!! Running back to L'Artusi the first chance I get Best Meal in a VERY Long time
