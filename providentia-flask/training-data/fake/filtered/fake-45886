My family dined at the Brothers Moon and had a pleasant experience. Four of us ordered the salmon dish with risotto, and it was delicious! My brother ordered the filet mignon and also enjoyed his meal. Yes, the prices are high, but not out of this world. The service is good. I don't like being overwhelmed by waiters/waitresses who come by every few minutes. I will dine there again, probably for a special occasion since I can't afford to eat out often at such establishments!
