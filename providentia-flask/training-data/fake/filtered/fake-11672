I recently checked out the Italian Trattoria Stella 34  inside the Macy's store. With the exception of nearby Koreatown, this area of Manhattan usually offers a lot of fast food choices (bleh), so I was quite ecstatic to find out about this place. A sixth-floor elevator to be found at the 35th street entrance takes you directly to this modern trattoria, which opened in March 2013.  It boasts a nice bar and for those who are not interested in being seated at a table, there is a take-out area (the tiramisu and homemade biscotti looked delicious).   Stella 34  has great service (I always appreciate it when the wait staff asks patrons if the chef should consider any food allergies or food restrictions), delicious food (authentic Italian), AND stunning views of the Empire State Building. I would make a reservation in advance, even though I got seated on a Saturday evening around 6pm in 5 minutes. My expectation was that this would be a museum cafeteria kind of restaurant, but instead I found a contemporary restaurant with a European vibe: a true hidden food gem in Midtown Manhattan.
