This company made a decision a long time ago.   "No matter how busy we get, we're not going to raise our prices."  The result is constantly packed restaurant that is almost recession proof. For customers, its great Thai food at an insanely cheap price.   I usually eat delivery because I don't feel like waiting to sit.  The quality is still there in a to-go box.
