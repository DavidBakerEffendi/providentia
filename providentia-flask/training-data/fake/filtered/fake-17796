Thank goodness for the Double Windsor.  I was so happy just to have a bar other than Farrell's and Rhythm and Booze in the neighborhood.  It seemed like we were waiting forever for it to open ... but it was worth it. The food is great, especially the fries, and the burgers come from pastured cows upstate.  They have a nice variety of beers from up and coming breweries, and it's nice to see the alcohol content listed so you know what you're getting into.   They have special tasting nights, and now a trivia night on the last Monday of each month where you can win free beer. I'm there once a week.
