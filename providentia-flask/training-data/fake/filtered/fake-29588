had the fried chicken ($13), it contained 2 pieces of dark meat and a small wing, i assume the breast was saved to be sold as a sandwich.  the chicken was flavored good, well cooked but insufficient for the price. beans were good, collards  lacked flavor.  donuts look great but i didn't try one. 2.5 hipsters per square foot. keep looking for better bbq, it's available elsewhere.
