So even though this place has so many good reviews my experience unfortunately was not good. For brunch I ordered scrambled eggs and bacon with home fries. I asked if it come with any sort of salad and was told no. So I ordered a side salad. The waiter was like a robot reading from some sort of script! It was actually freaking me out a bit. Anyway food came so quickly I was surprised. The scrambled eggs were raw and looked like eggs thrown in a pan with no sort of scrambled egg technique (milk).There was literally 6 tiny halves of potatoes and 3 pieces of bacon all for $15. I had to send the eggs back to be cooked through. There was no toast so with the tiny potato portion I felt like I was eating egg egg and more egg. Not good will not go back.
