I don't get what all the hype is about-- maybe we ordered the wrong thing... Had the Provençale plate to start. I was most looking forward to the socca, which was greasy and limp... nothing like how it is in the mother country. The rest of the items on the plate were just OK-- nothing special. The salmon fetuccini was the low-light of the meal, it being gloppy, flavorless, and clearly not made with fresh salmon... the salmon was bone-dry and tasted metallic, like it was poured straight out of the can. The Sultan crêpe was good, but the chicken was overcooked and the crêpe was soggy-- maybe my expectations were too high! I really, really wanted to love this place, but will certainly not be going back for some time.
