I was so excited to come here since I'd heard such great things from friends.  We made a reservation and arrived on time, but the wait staff was very rude from the minute we sat down.  I don't mind having to remind waiters and waitresses about a drink order, but 4 times is a bit much...not that we got water on the 4th try.  The food was nothing to brag about, the risotto was undercooked and under seasoned.  Needless to say I was disappointed and a bit embarrassed because I'd insisted my friends and I go here for dinner.
