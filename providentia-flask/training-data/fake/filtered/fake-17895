Just got back from dining there.  Arrived at 4:45 doors were open we were asked to sit in parking lot while they set up.   Should have left.  We entered at 5, staff rudely accommodated us without a reservation despite it remaining very empty until 6:15ish.  It did get busier but still had open tables when we left.  Two male wait staff very abrupt made us feel like they were doing us a favor.   I had Asked if salad large enough to share.  Waiter said no was a small salad meant for one person.  Not true.  Halfway through my salad there was a large straight black hair and a very long lighter hair mixed in my forkful of a delicious salad.  I called waiter over.  He rudely told me that there was not two hairs in the salad but one large one wrapped around fork like it was okay and what was I complaining about.  Barely apologized but said he'd take it off the bill.  The  2 nd course I had Zuppa de peche.  Fish cooked perfectly.  Was quite moist but the sauce was only ok nothing special.   Side of spinach, very bland.  My friend had pasta special lobster, crab shrimp in cherry tomatoes sauce.  Very little lobster meat, sauce bland as well.  Up to this point this restaurant reminded me of tourist traps in Rome.  Finished dinner with much better service from a female waiter who took over.  She went out of her way to make fresh coffee which was spectacular.  Her desert recommendation for me was lemon mascarpone mouse which was delightful.  I have had better meals and service from unknown hole in the walls.  My friend had ricotta Cheese tort which was on the dry side.  All in all for all the grand reviews and high recommendations were not worth a dime. this evening was very much lacking.  Patty
