Love coming here for a quick lunch outing. Service is quick and the lunch specials are under $10, comes with a bowl of soup, and the portions are normal entree sized. I dont know how authentic the food is since Malaysian food is a bit fusion to begin with but it does taste good to a person who eats in Chinatown on a regular basis. The atmosphere is nice - wooden setting, hand painted artwork by a local Asian American artist, and low lighting (you can read your menu clearly and see your food but it can have a romantic feel to it). The bathroom is also clean which is always a plus in Chinatown. I recommend the roti and mango chicken over rice.
