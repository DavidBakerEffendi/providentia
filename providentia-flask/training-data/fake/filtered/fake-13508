Husband and I went for lunch on a Tuesday right when the door opened.  We were the only customers the whole time.  We had a really great experience which included our luncheon filet mignon, garlic mashed potatoes and a few onion rings.  The filets were cooked perfectly for us and the meat was very tender.  The lunch portion was the correct amount for lunch.
