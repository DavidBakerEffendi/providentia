I really love The Monk Room. The Caesar salad is heavenly with the whole anchovies and the maple dessert is super tasty. I've sampled a few of their other dishes with nothing but happiness and indulged in a few yummy Snowbird cocktails.  It's probably the closest place I've found in Newark that's hipster (IPA's on tap!) - which I sort of like :-) My only suggestion/concern: the prices are a bit high. If this was in Hoboken or on Grove Street the prices would be fine. And the place is inexpensive compared to NYC. But for downtown Newark, where there's a lot of gov't and non-profit workers, it's a bit much. The price definitely limits how often I go - especially with other places in the immediate area offering $2 drink specials and much cheaper salads. Maybe have a half price lunch or dinner? Or offer happy hour specials that include  food?
