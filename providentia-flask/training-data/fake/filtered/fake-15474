Our entire team at the office has been sick and tired of the food available for pick up or delivery in the Midtown Village area (where our office is located).  We all ordered burgers and veggie burgers this week and we're delighted to have this new restaurant in the neighborhood. Each and every person went on and on about how good their food was. I couldnt agree more.  I had the betty burger and its was amazing. Glad to have you guys in the hood...hope everyone else appreciates it as much as we do. THE ONLY THING I WISH THEY ADDED...DELIVERY!!!
