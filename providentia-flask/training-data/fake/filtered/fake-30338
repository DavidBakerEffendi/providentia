Had dinner there a few nights ago. Food and service were very ordinary. Then to top it off, I looked at my bank statement and the restaurant had over-charged my card. I left the tip in cash, and they added it onto my card and charged me for it again. After I'd signed the check. NEVER going here again. They a terrible.
