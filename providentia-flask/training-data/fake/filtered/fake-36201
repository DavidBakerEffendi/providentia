Shalimar bbq house, What a pleasant surprise that was, a place in North brunswick NJ with great character. The interior for this place was charming and created the perfect surrounds to enjoy your meal. The food was what you expect to compliment the effort done in the design of the place. The food was all the favorites that you expect with a bbq. The service was great. Whenever you are craving for fresh kebabs, or tasty pakistani/indian food. This was a great experience Recommend it for sure! Pure cuisine!
