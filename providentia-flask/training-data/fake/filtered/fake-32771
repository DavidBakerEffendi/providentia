A disgusting bunch of college boys run this place after 11pm. The good is gross, they cough in their hands and touch your food. Delivery last week took well over an hour and when we called they said the delivery driver left over a half hour ago. I'll leave the fat shack for the stoned college kids. After waiting so long my fianc√© and I decided to drive to the location to get our food. We had just got back from our vacation and they were the only place open. It does not excuse the gross behavior of the young "frat boys" running this location.. NEVER AGAIN. RJ's bagel should be ashamed of themselves running such a location after hours. Absolutely gross. We turned our food down needless to say and walked out.
