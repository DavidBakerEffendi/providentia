This new Upper East Side Bar/restaurant boasts a fabulous vibe. Beautiful elongated bar, cool music, great beer and whiskey selection for after work drinks or late night. And delicious cocktails too...Also includes a TV for sports fans. Pleasantly surprised by the quality of food. Refreshing salads, selection of bar snacks, a very tasty salmon tartar and yummy desserts. Nothing like this in the area, definitely a MUST.
