So, even though I said I would never go back, and even though I pressed all of you not to go there either, I believe I am a changed woman. After posting the below review I was quickly contacted by Jason, the owner.  We exchanged a few notes, built a dialouge and he convinced me to come back. So I did. One day after some Christmas shopping around town- first the Christmas Village outside of City hall and then Macys (they need to STOP doing that light show, it's impossible to shop.)- the fiance and I decided that we needed to rejuvinate ourselves and what better way than with wine and a snack. As is our usual MO we sat at the bar.  The bartender was right on us as soon as we sat, menus, wine list and a glass of water.   I ordered a wine flight, which I think is the best deal going!   I think it was $15 for 3 wines, and the pours were more than what I would consider decent.  It was an added bonus that all three of the wines were yummy! We proceeded to order food- charcuterie plate, escargot and the burger. All in all, the food was great.  It came out in a decent amount of time.  The burger was cooked to a good medium rare, the escargot were the right amount of garlicky and the charcuterie plate was well balanced, and we got a nice description of every last thing on the board. This most recent visit was far better than any of the previous three.  I was certainly pleased with the service- just not having to ask for a glass of water was worth the return trip.   I take back what I said.  Go and try it for yourself.  Order a wine flight.  Try the escargot.  Enjoy the periodic table of elements, I mean grapes, poster in the rest room.  Bring someone with you.  Have a good conversation.  Enjoy.
