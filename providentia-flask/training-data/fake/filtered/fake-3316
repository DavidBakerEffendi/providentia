nice happy hour with great craft beer selection at good prices.  Also with happy hour, they have good app. offerings.  I also likes the bartender and thought she did a great job in serving and recomending brews.  Great local neighborhood bar/restaurant and I'll be back.  Also, like the Tuesday $3.50 all day craft beer specials.
