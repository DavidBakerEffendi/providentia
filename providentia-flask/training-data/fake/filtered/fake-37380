went for the lunch buffet a couple of months back. the staff was nice. even though we came toward the end of the buffet without two of our guests, who were running late, they let us stay and make up plates for four. HOWEVER, as we finished eating and the waiters started clearing up the buffet stations, my husband noticed a mouse crawling down the curtain right near the buffet table. completely unacceptable! it totally ruined our dining experience. (one of the waiters was hiding behind furniture because he was so scared.) will never go back. management needs to keep the place clean. no matter how good the food or how friendly the staff, customers won't pay to keep company with rodents.
