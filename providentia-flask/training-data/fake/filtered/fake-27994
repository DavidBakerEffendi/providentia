A few of us ate at Terrazzas a few nights ago and found the restuarant to be professional in every way.  The staff was friendly and efficient and the food was very good to wonderful.   I had pasta with sausage and broccolii rape and it was delicious in the restaurant and at home the next day.  My husband had red snapper over broccoli rape and he said it was fresh, cooked just right and also delicious.  The others at our table had either a pasta dish or ribs and both said they enjoyed their meals very much.  We will definitely be going back soon.
