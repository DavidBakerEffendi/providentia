Was there for Easter Sunday and was disappointed. By 1:30pm they had run out of the chef's tasting menu items and part of the dessert menu. The kale and bean soup was very good but the entrees left a lot to be desired. The "gourmet" hamburger was bad with burnt bacon and pepper. Not worth the hype!
