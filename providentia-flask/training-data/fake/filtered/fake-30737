FABULOUS place. We had to cancel my daughter's original venue for her rehearsal dinner 11/1/12 after the hurricane due to flooding and loss of power. My daughter and her fiance found Leone's Kitchen on 10/30/12 and they were able to pull off the best rehearsal dinner I have ever attended within roughly 24 hours. It was an event for around 55 people. Â All of our guests commented on how much they loved the food and on what an extensive menu was available. There was a special menu for the event. The staff and owner really went above and beyond. I cannot praise Leone's Kitchen or it's owner enough. Leone's Kitchen will be forever in my heart. My husband and I will definitely revisit whenever we travel back to the Jersey area. Thank you, thank you, thank you to the staff and owner! Margarita D.
