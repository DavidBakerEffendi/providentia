What a terrible experience we had at el Vez!  Our reservation was at 830 for a party of 6.  We got there and checked in at 7 for a table outside and they said they would let us know as soon as our table was ready.  We waited and waited until finally at 9pm they sat the 6 of us at an extremely small table and told us the table next to us was about to leave and when they did would push the 2 tables together to gives us adequate space.  To make it even worse, just before we sat down at the table they were removing a dead mouse from just a few inches from our chairs! Disgusting!  The table next to us didn't leave for another 45 mins so we had to have our appetizers and drinks in the most uncomfortable physical setting I have ever encountered at a restaurant.  Finally they left and we were able to move the two tables together so we could eat comfortably.  Or so we thought.  In the middle of our entrees they asked us to stop eating and get up from the tables so they could again move them to avoid getting fined by the city.  Our server had zero personality and neither her nor the manager were willing to do anything to try to make our miserable experience better.  Our bill was close to $500 and they did not offer us anything to rectify the situation.  Needless to say I will not be going back.  Over crowded, horrible wait time (even with a reservation), dead mice, over priced, and abysmal customer service!
