My husband and I in NJ for a wedding stumbled on this place.  He had all you cna eat sushi for $20 and said it was delicious.  I ordered off the menu and said it was delicious!  Had a little bit of a wait but was worth it.  Missing one start for the meal I ordered had only rice and one choice, so I had a plate of orange chicken and white rice (would've enjoyed a 3 option plate -rice, chicken and....a teriyaki stick or peking raviolis) and place was small.
