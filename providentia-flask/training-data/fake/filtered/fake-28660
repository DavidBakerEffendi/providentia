It was gud. The mixed dip platter was exceptional. It wasn't too garlicky and it was so flavorful! The bread was so moist and warm and it came wrapped up in a cute little cloth. The dessert though was the best part. There's this awesome pudding with almonds and nuts, and I think there was some cinnamon in it too. They make fresh mint tea when you order, and fresh Turkish coffee. They tell you the history of the coffee, and try make it right I front of your eyes! I'm defiantly go ing back there, and In bringing all my friends and family too. They have plenty of room, and They even host parties.
