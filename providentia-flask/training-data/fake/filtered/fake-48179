No, I am not drinking the haterade.  I came here all the way from West Vlaanderen to tell you all the TRUTH: deze zijn NIET Belgische fritjes.  To repeat, these are NOT Belgian fries!  My 1 star rating comes from these facts about the fries: 1) They are not prepared in traditional style of flash frying twice in ox fat 2) They do not *look* like Belgian fries 3) They do not *smell* like Belgian fries 4) They do not *taste* like Belgian fries I even tried ordering in Dutch there: "Voor mij, frietjes met mayonnaise." and my words fell upon deaf ears.  I cannot tell you how many times those words were followed by exchanging 3 euros for delicious, crispy but not too crispy, Belgian fries, filled to the point of not being able to balance in a small paper container, topped with a ton of mayonnaise, at 4am. People need to realize that in Belgium, fries are a national tradition, and they are eaten almost daily.  They have a consistent flavor and smell that you can find anywhere in Flanders.  That this business claims to have "Authentic Belgian Fries" is one of the most terrible lies in this city.
