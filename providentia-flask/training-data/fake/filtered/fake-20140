We were walking by and discovered this quaint little spot last Sunday.  The atmosphere was very nice, and we really liked the food and the cucumber lemonade was amazing.  The waitress suggested we order a few dishes, since the restaurant serves "small plates".  We sampled several of their dishes, including a charcuterie plate, sliders, and a tuna tartare that was excellent.  Our favorite was a beet and goat cheese.  Everything was really creative, and the service was amazing.  The deserts were pumpkin themed, and delicious!  We were really happy to find this little gem!
