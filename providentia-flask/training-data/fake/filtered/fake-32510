Sitting down in a hotel restaurant I wasn't expecting a ton but boy did this restaurant deliver! The ambiance is wonderful with huge vaulted ceiling and light adorning trees and other items and a cute little fish and turtle pond off to the side. The food was not good, it was fantastic! You can tell all the food was prepared by an excellent chef with none of the food having anything wrong with it. I tried to find fault but just couldn't! If ever in the West Lebanon area this is a must try!
