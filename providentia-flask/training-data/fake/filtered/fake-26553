This is my favorite restaurant in Montclair!  I go here often with family and friends, just because or to celebrate, because they all love this place, too! The service is always warm and welcoming.  How attentive the wait staff is depends on who you get, as it is a family run restaurant, and some are more attentive than others.  But everyone is polite and friendly. The food is pretty amazing!  I have never had a bad experience.  The stewed lamb(lega tibs) and beef kitfo dishes are the best, in my opinion.  they have a vegetarian menu that is filling and delicious as well.  I wouldn't go for the seafood dishes.  They can be a little on the dry side. If you go, it is totally worth the wait to end your meal with a pot of traditional Ethiopian coffee.  They roast the beans when you order, and bring them out for you to smell (apparently a tradition).  So delicious and fun, and a great ending to the meal! The prices are moderate - about what you would expect to spend in Montclair without being overpriced.  The atmosphere is so pretty!  Ethiopian paintings and fabric art.  It is a really fun place for dinner, and I always look forward to going!  I am a regular customer!
