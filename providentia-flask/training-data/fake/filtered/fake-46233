I actually love the food here BUT, I only gave this place 3 stars because they downgraded their pork buns. When Ippudo first opened, they had the best pork buns ever!!! They beat out Momofuku's hands down. It was filled with 2 large pieces of juicy pork belly and was extremely tasty. When you order the pork buns today, they only have 1 piece of pork and all you taste is the bread. Very disappointing!
