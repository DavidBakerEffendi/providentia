The burgers at Village Whiskey are amazing. I've tried the (lentil-based) veggie burger and a plain hamburger. The Kentucky Hot Brown is also a delicious turkey option. I would give 5 stars, except they have a no reservation policy. You need to be at the restaurant to put your name down for a table, and the dinner time wait can be upwards of two hours. The food will not disappoint you though!
