I just got back from here and I'm in love! The service was excellent and the food was delicious. The waiters were so friendly and really make you feel welcomed. I enjoyed every part of the meal, especially the aguas fresca. The atmosphere is very calm and romantic. They even have an outside patio and if it gets breezy you can just go back inside. We will definitely come back! :)
