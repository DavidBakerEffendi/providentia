I had lunch there and the food was amazing. I had a filet mignon and since I love meat I found it one of the best I ve tried in NY. The prices are very reasonable and you are not paying crazy amounts like in other restaurants in les. Probably because of the location. Also they have very good sandwiches for a takeout. The only thing I did not like much was the burger. I live nearby so this is my first choice every time I am hungry. Â  Ohh one advice when you go there should definitely try the cheesecake.
