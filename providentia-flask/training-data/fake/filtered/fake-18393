I completely love this place! The food is quite good, although portions are not huge. The main draw for me is the great ambiance and fabulous drinks. This is a bar where the staff remembers you and your preferred libation, and makes you feel welcome. Pricing is great with some domestic drafts as little as $3, $5 for craft beer selections, and $6 for creative mixed drinks like the ginger Thai basil mojito (amazing). For those unsure about the neighborhood, the restaurant has adjacent off street parking and the area is generally safe at night as long as you have some common sense, like any city. Stop in and say hi to TC and Craig, and have a mojito for me.
