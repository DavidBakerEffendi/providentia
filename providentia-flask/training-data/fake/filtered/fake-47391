This place is a hidden gem!! I was visiting family in New York and my cousin and I were eager to take part in their boozy brunch. Bottomless Mimosas? Yes, Please! The decor and ambiance was wonderful. We sat at the bar and were served by Jonathan. HE WAS FANTASTIC!! The drinks were amazing and he recommended "the forager" - absolutely divine! My cousin isn't too fond of mushrooms and even she was raving about it!!  We also ordered the french toast, the scotch egg, and rosemary potatoes. Dishes are tapas style, which is a fantastic way to try a variety of delicious menu items.   I do have to say that the hostess, Raquel, was very unpleasant (thus, 4 out of 5 stars). For her to be the first impression of the restaurant is horrible. We almost left. Maybe it's the Souther Hospitality in me that has the expectation of a hostess is supposed to be courteous and inviting, because Raquel was not! We were already in the area but decided to call ahead, she stated there was not a need to reserve a table and to come on in. Once we got there, she stated the next available reservation would be at 3pm. I am just glad we didn't allow her to ruin our experience because the rest of our brunch was extremely enjoyable. All in all, I loved our brunch thanks to Jonathan the amazing bartender and I highly recommend this restaurant to New Yorkers and tourists alike. Just don't pay Raquel any mind. :)
