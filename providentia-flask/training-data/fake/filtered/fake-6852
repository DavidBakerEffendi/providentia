The reviewers below me need to stop referring to "stoner food" as if it's a bad thing. Bottom line is, people just like to hate on "hip" places like this that are trying something different (the fact that the owner was on a Food Network reality show probably doesn't help), but the food here is absolutely out of this world. Given, this is not the place for someone who is unadventurous with their cuisine, considering nearly everything on the menu is kind of bizarre (i.e. dr. pepper glazed frog legs), but these guys can seriously back up their daring menu with incredible flavor. If you have the cash to spend and feel like doing something different, this is your spot.
