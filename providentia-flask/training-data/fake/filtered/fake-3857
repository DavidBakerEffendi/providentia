I love this place - went for my birthday and then again for Christmas celebration with my girlfriend. it's not THE best food that I've ever had but it's pretty damn good.  It's *consistently* excellent in  preparation, imagination, presentation and flavour.  The branzino is phenomenal and I will be trying the beef plate next time.  My recommendation is to order several appetizers and then share the main if there are two of you, because they are huge.   the yuzu gin cocktail (forget the name) is fantastic - clean but bright.  impeccable service. it's not cheap but for what you're getting I think it's very good value.
