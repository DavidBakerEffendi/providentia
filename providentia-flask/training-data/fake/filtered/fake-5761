We has lunch at Benito One and every aspect of our meal was perfect.  Our table was ready for us when we arrived ( and we were a little early).  Our waiter Freddie was very attentive and friendly.  The owner came to our table several times during the meal to make sure we had everything we needed. We all chose the lunch special for $12.95.  It included salad or a choice of 2 soups, crusty bread, a pasta dish and an entrée dish.  The food was served hot and delicious. The restaurant is very small so I recommend reservations.
