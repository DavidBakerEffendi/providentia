I started off with the Mushroom Cigars, and it comes with 2 cigars and some greens on top. It was good, though it had an interesting taste that I'm not familiar with. My appetizer was the Tuscan Chicken (chicken stuffed with spinach&ricotta with a sauce on top), which came with chive mashed potatoes and mixed greens. It was very good, and I would definitely recommend it if you're in the mood for chicken. My boyfriend got the Steak Frites, which come with Rosemary Fries and mixed greens. Steak came out as it should have been cooked. What I must absolutely recommend is the Rosemary Fries, and it is definitely something everyone should get when eating there. They're cooked to a delicious crisp, and you do get the hint of rosemary. The mixed greens are good as well because they come with this house balsamic vinaigrette that I loved (if only I knew the recipe to it!). Some warnings: This restaurant is very small, so don't go with a party of more than 6... Even 6 sounds like too much. It is cozy, but it's not a place to eat with a large group of people. Also, they only accept cash.
