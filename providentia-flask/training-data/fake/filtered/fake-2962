If ambience were all an eatery needed, Cuban Pete's would earn 4 stars. Unfortunately, good food and fast service count for something, and both of these were below par.  Rice and beans were, contrary to what another reviewer stated, quite bland the evening I was there. Plantains and meat dishes were good (not great), but the biggest disappointment was being served a non-alcoholic mojito without being made aware, either in the menu or by the waiter, that the establishment had no liquor license.  Would I go back? Yes....with friends and a flask.
