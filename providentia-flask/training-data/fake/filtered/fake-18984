Artichoke is definitely the best pizza I've had in NYC. People complain about the $4 slices but it's a really good deal for the amount and quality. the only bad things i can say is that if you take the slices to go and you eat it even about 10 minutes afterwards, it doesn't taste the same, it's still delicious but i recommend eating it right when you get it. the only other thing is the lines, especially at night. they can go halfway down the block, but it's still worth it. i recommend getting a slice in the afternoon hours if you're around the area, the lines are generally short or non-existent.
