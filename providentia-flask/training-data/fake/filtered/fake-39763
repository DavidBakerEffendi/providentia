Was there about a month ago for the first time.  Although I think I was at their original location on Union Blvd many years ago. A bit pricey, but worth it especially for a special occasion.  Tried something new for an appetizer off their specials menu.  Stuffed warm figs.  Delicious.  The veal dish that I ordered was as tender as possible.  Service was attentive and friendly.  There is valet parking, but we parked on street.  I am a fan and will be back this week .
