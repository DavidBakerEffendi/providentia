Burlington's got some great restaurants and coffee shops. If you ask me, August First isn't one of them. I've been in a few times, once right when they opened, once for Flatbread Friday, and once (recently) for coffee and lunch. My experience at Flatbread Friday was that I had to wait a really long time to get a seat, and then get into a scrum with a bunch of other hungry people to try and snag a piece of flatbread. The quality was a roll of the dice. Some were decently good, some almost inedible. You never know what's going to come out of the kitchen. Here's my bone to pick with August First - right in the name of this place is the word CAFE. To me that's a place where you go, have a conversation with a friend, maybe do a little bit of work and surf the web. Unfortunately, since my first visit, a determination was made to get rid of the wifi. I understand some people sit and nurse a cup of coffee for an hour. Welcome to 2012. Â Forget about needing to go to Starbucks. Check around town. Uncommon Grounds, New Moon, Radio Bean. All are local cafes that let their customers surf the web, do a little work, and hang out. If you want to get a cup of coffee and stare at the wall, August First is the place to go. If not, Burlington's got lots of better options.
