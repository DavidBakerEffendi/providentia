I am new to town and this was one of the first delivery restaurants that I've tried. First time we ordered pizza and a salad, the pizza was a Margherita, which was delicious, thin and garlicky, and the salad had all kinds of vegetables, olives, red onion and an italian spicy pepper. Second time we ordered chicken parmigiana and stuffed shells dinners, which came with small versions of their salad and a wedge of garlic bread. I asked about the chicken cutlet before I ordered after reading another negative review, and the person on the phone assured me that it was real chicken - which it was. Overall I would highly recommend this restaurant for deliveries, the food is tasty and the prices are very affordable with huge portions. I asked about the dine-in option when I called second time and I was told that it is not possible to eat-in.
