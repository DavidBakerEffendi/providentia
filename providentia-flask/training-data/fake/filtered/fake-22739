I recently attended a business dinner at Romulus.  I had been traveling all day and was really looking forward to a great meal and was virtually starving when I got there. There were 7 of us at dinner and the restaurant was completely deserted.  We thought that would work in our favor and we would get super fast service.  But, we were wrong.  The service was so incredibly slow.  The waiter shorted us a menu, took at least 15 minutes just to bring us bread and water, and we had been there almost 30 minutes before he even took our order.  I ordered the French Onion soup thinking it would be amazing.  But, it wasn't.  The broth tasted like salt water and the cheese was burnt.  I thought perhaps the entree would be better, but it wasn't.  It also tasted like salt.  The meat was salty, the noodles were salty, it was just plain bad.  For the price of the food and the service, I would never go back.  Ever.  The only thing that was good was the anti-pasta which is impossible to screw up since it's just cheese, meat, and some veggies.  So, I guess if you want to go there and just order an appetizer, that might work for you.  And if you have 3 hours to spare for dinner.
