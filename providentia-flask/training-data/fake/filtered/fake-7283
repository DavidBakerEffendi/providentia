I made reservations to this place thinking this must be one of the better restaurants to visit in Manhattan.  Because I made a reservation ahead, I didn't have to wait, although others who walked in were told 30-40 min. wait at 2:30pm lunch.  The atmosphere is old world feel and it's quite nice even though tables are set very close together.  It's a very busy place and has a lot of servers.  What I wasn't impressed with was that the food I had wasn't that good.  I had onion soup and roasted lamb sandwich.  The soup was okay, but the lamb sandwich was very chewy and hard to eat.  For the $18 price on this sandwich, I wouldn't come back for it.  It just didn't taste good.  Their fresh seafood bar looked good though and people who ordered the grande at the table next to us seemed to enjoy it.  This restaurant has a reputation and that's why I went, but if the food isn't good, I wouldn't be back.  It's a hit or miss depending on which dish you order.  Not all food on the menu is good here.
