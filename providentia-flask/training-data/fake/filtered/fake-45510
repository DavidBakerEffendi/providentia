The food in this restaurant is fresh, healthy and cooked extremely well. You will NOT be disappointed. Their Thai dishes as well as their Chinese dishes are not in "takeout" style. Their are homemade, well prepared with very fresh ingredients, not oily at all. Â The atmosphere is clean, quiet and very relaxing. Staff is helpful and pleasant. It is impressive that they can cook such good food at such reasonable prices. Go there! You will not regret it.
