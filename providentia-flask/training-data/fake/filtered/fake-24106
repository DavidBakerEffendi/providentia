i love their food. yes, among the blandly average restaurants in princeton, this one is the best. however, i did think i saw a roach in my food a while back and i didn't want to be absolutely sure because i would have been too mortified. so im not positive it was a roach - it could have been a stringy brown spice pepper. i did actually find a roach in my take out from a thai restaurant in chinatown (nyc). which until that moment had been my favorite thai place ever, and i ate there several times per week for lunch and the place was always packed (pong sri). so this suspicion i had at massala grill took me back to a traumatic memory where i really didnt want to go. hence, i still eat there and still love the food and until i one hundred percent see a roach in my food, i will continue to go. however, reading the cockroach comment by a previous poster has me nervous.
