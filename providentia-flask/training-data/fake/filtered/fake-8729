Stumbled upon this place exploring areas in Brooklyn. Glad we did. It's a small place so expect a bit of a wait if you arrive later in the evening. Staff is very friendly and attentive. Shrimp mofongo is to die for and broth is delicious. Chicharron de pollo is great along with rice and beans. We ordered rice and beans, yuca and maduros and flan for dessert. Nothing bad to say about Puerto Viejo will most definitely make it a point to come back. We didn't make it in Time for happy hours but there is always next week :)
