I used to be a "regular" there cause i live pretty close, and food seems great on a first place. But still, i will never go back there, it appears i was sick 2 times after i ate there. Once, i spent a dinner time with cockroaches crawling on the walls (no kidding), had several times dirty dishes, glasses and set given. Tables are also pretty dirty and sticky (!!), and the owner is not exactly the kind of guy who cares about customers but money and frankly, except the set and the candles, it's a cold place. Tarte Flamb√©e recipe is easy to find and soooo easy and fun to do, you can custom on many ways, it doesn't worth the price to go there, i've learnt my lesson well.
