I stumbled upon this restaurant while shopping last Sunday and I am glad that I did. Â When we arrived we were greated as soon as we walked in, we decided to sit on the patio since it was so nice out. We shared an appetizer of Fried mozzarella, it was delicious and the marinara was to die for. For lunch we split the Honey Chicken as well as the Zinna's Pizza. Both were excellent, way to much food to eat so I had lunch for the next day, plus we needed to save room for dessert which the server told us were home made by the owners mother. We had the carrot cake and also had 2 scoops of gelato, cinnamon bun & chocolate. I would say our overall experience was excellent and I cannot wait until next weekend when I am in the area again to visit.
