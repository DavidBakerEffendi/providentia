Went here about 6 months ago and it was as delicious as I'd hoped it would be. Place is pretty tiny and it can get really hot in there so dress accordingly. Party of 3 guys and we tried a bunch of stuff, but the ribs stood out as the best item of the night. Lots of great flavor parings and combos. The pana cotta was really nice for desert, but don't miss out on the bacon donuts. It's a small plate affaire, but everyone can usually get a few bites of each dish.
