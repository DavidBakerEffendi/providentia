I gotta tell ya, I just got in from California and the first thing on my mind was PIZZA! Lucali's is the answer! Despite waiting to get a table, the greatest thing about this place is that as you wait you get acquainted with some really nice people and then once you get in you are surrounded by a soothing ambiance of dim lighting and soothing Italian music. Then you are provided with great service not to mention the lightest and best tasting pizza. This is the first time I ever ate pizza and did not have that heavy sleepy feeling, not to mention the guilt with eating other pizzas because they are so heavy, not with Lucali's Pizza.......mmmmmmmm GOOD! Â The sauce, the cheese, the thin crust, I can go on and on. It was just plain perfection. Mark and Val, thanks for making my pizza experience the best tasting experience I have ever had! I will be sure to pass the word around! I sure hope everyone feels the same as I do!
