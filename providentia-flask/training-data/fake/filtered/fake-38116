If you're looking for upscale bar food with a definite twist then you must hit up this cozy, mahogany-drenched nook the next time you're wandering around Center City with a craving for something sinfully good. Their burgers are to-die-for, the veggie sandwich is the perfect midday meal, and the baked mac 'n cheese is as creamy and decadent as they come. And, do not forget to dive into a bowl of their sweet potato fries that are crisp, yet tender, and simply sweet. Looking to go a little healthier? I continually order the calamari salad complete with a sweet and sour vinaigrette; the Good Dog Salad is inundated with goat cheese, dried cranberries, nuts, and fresh greens; and their Chicken Caesar is anything but bland. If you go after 5, be prepared to wait a bit, or take a seat at the bar, because it consistently seems to be the place where everybody goes, though you probably won't know their name.
