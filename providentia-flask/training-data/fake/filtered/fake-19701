After hearing alot about robertas fried chicken, i decided to head there to take my significant other for a special birthday lunch. What a disappointment! The margherita pizza was salty. The fried chicken was undercooked with blood and wate dripping out when we cut into it. When brought to the attention of the waiter he said that it was on a timer and it was normal for dark meat! He brought it back to the kitchen and said another would be cooked - but continued to try and justify that it dripping blood and water was normal. Overall the food was very disappointing for all the hype. Aside from the food, the atmosphere was good. Too bad the food wasn't up to standard.
