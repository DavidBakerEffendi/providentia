I have been to this restaurant for thanksgiving for 4 consecutive years. Three of those years I had a good experience. This year, however, it was pretty bad. I took my family there and I was completely embarrassed by the rude waiter as well as the absolutely horribly and inedible food. We ordered the antipast and everything on the plate looked and tasted awful. Then we ordered the thanksgiving turkey dinner. All of the meals came to the table STONE COLD. When I told the waiter and he saw how upset I was he just looked at me and told me in an impatient and angry tone, "I heard you". He then took them back to the kitchen. When brought back the exact same plates, the plates were hot but the food was just as cold as the first time. The stuffing was a gelatinous inedible mess that looked like something the dog vomited. The mashed potatoes looked and tasted like overly reconstituted powdered mashed potaoes which made them inedible. The turkey was tasteless. The only good part of the meal was the fresh vegetables. I told the manager on duty and the chef about our experience as we were leaving and they did not even off as much as an apology. They charged $25 per plate for an awful turkey dinner that I could have gotten from any diner in NJ for half the price and it would have been better and served hot. We will not be going back.
