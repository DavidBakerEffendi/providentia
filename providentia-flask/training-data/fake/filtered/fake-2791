cuban pete's is a horrible place!!!!! we decided to take our daughter for her 25th birthday!!!! this restaurant was recommended to her, so we said ok. when we got there they took our name, we waited for 2 hours. we were a party of 5, but they only were sitting parties of 3 or 4. we got there at 7:30pm and they called us at 9:30pm. the two hostesses were rude and nasty to everyone, the manager was walking around kissing and flirting with cute girls. very unprofessional. finally after we sat we ordered appetizers, the croquets were terrible, cold and soggy. we ordered out entrees i ordered the churassco with coconut rice and mango yams. it had no flavor, literally no flavor. they call that cuban food. Â plus everything else was cold. i couldn't eat it and my family either. believe me i go to many restaurants and this one is the worse ever....if any of you want real spanish food, go to don coqui in new rochelle is the best. the service is great! overall experience........hell on earth. we will never go back.......plus the idea of taking your own liquor is so stupid.
