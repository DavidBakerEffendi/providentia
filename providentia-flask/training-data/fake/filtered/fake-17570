I've eaten the Eggs Florentine and the Vanilla Infused French Toast. The Florentine was bland and flavorless (although the potatoes it comes with were not bad). The French Toast was soggy, not particularly tasteful, and there was no "vanilla infusion" to be tasted. The syrup was mediocre. I think this restaurant has been overrated; I am sorry that I went there on Yelp!'s recommendation. I would not go again or recommend it to a friend.
