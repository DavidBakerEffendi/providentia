This place was so good, I created a yelp profile just so I could add and review them :) Was driving on my way to work and I saw this place, so my husband and I stopped in for dinner. Oh my. I was in HEAVEN. authentic, delicious, flavourful food. I cant reccomend it enough. Everything I had was amazing! I had the beef stew with rice, some potato salad and plaintains. It doesnt get much better than this!
