Overrated!! The IDEA of a crepe place is awesome. These are so-so. Not French village worthy but sweet enough to mask the disingenuous flavor. The worst part is the restaurant. Â The inside of the shop is disguting-old and dirty. If you're into hippie-old-we-dont-use-gloves restaurants this is your place; which is the only reason why Vermonters recommend it. I prefer clean and contemporary. Gag.
