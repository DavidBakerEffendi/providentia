Jose Tejas is absolutely the best.  Their crawfish etouffee is the best I have ever tasted.  In fact, I have not tasted one thing on their menu I did not like.  Plus the prices are very reasonable.  The only negative thing I could possibly say about Jose's is during dinner time any day of the week there is always a wait but even that is bearable because everyone gets complimentary freshly made chips and salsa to snack on.  I'm planning my next trip there soon.  I'm craving it!
