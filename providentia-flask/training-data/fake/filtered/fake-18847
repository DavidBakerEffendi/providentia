Patronized High Street twice this weekend.  Plus take-out.  Overall - such a well-run comfortable casual attractive space with a serious kitchen producing flawless dishes, flawless pastas, the best 'salads' and vegetable preparations in Philadelphia, a superior on-premises bakery, wonderful hostesses and waitstaff.  Subtly pickled vegetables and salads, hearty dishes, respectable portions.
