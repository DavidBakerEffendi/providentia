This was possibly one of the worst meals I have had. Both dishes had sauces that were so thick with cornstarch that you could almost taste it. To add to that, when I got my credit card bill, someone had forged the tip to make the total even, adding an extra twenty six plus change to the tip, hoping nobody would see it.  AmEx did refund the difference, but with the exact total even, the restaurant was hoping I would not see  and just look at the listing.   Beware...always check your statements for the tips. Someone in that place is dishonest
