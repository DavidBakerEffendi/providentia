We ordered online after having a craving for poutine and seeing that this place had it within delivery distance.  We also ordered the steak tartar because I never turn down a chance for steak tartar.   The steak tartar was ok.  I loved that it was small chunks of steak and not steak puree.  However it wasn't overly flavorful, I didn't get a strong steak taste (probably a good thing) but I didn't get much of any strong flavors, no salt no pepper, nothing.  I wound up adding salt and some siracha and then it was pretty good.  Could have used more toast.   As for the poutine, I'm confused as to how this is considered poutine.  There was NO gravy.  AT.  ALL.  The idea of poutine is that it's fries with a meat filled gravy and cheese curds.  All we got were the fries and cheese curds.  The fries were soggy.  There was no hint of gravy anywhere in sight, trust me we looked.  Very disappointing. On the plus side the food was delivered promptly but in reality I was excited for so much more and it was pretty disappointing.  Probably won't be back, wouldn't recommend the food there.  Maybe the bar portion is better but in an area with so many other options I'm sure I can find someplace with drinks AND good food.
