Stopped in for quick drink and bite with my wife after checking out Chelsea area. She had and amazing blackberry mojito ($12) and I had a fresh limeade ($3). Shared the sweet sausage and grits ap which was amazing! Great tastes, presentation and simplicity. Great value for Â $12 and we were very pleased. Nice outdoor sidewalk seating, although we chose the cooler inside bar area on this hot day. Definitely one of our NYC highlights!
