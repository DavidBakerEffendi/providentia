Bills isn't really a place to go for food's to all the people that left a review complaining that the food was "mediocre" or not satisfactorily... Bill's ISN'T a five-star restaurant....so if you went in there with those kind of expectations...that is why you left unsatisfied. Bills is a FANTASTIC place to meet up with friends or new people for drinks....i am a regular at Bills...i've been going there for about four or five years now and i absolutely LOVE the place! I find the food to be delicious! The fish and chips is one of my Â favorite things to order on the menu...The staff is friendly and attentive, the drinks are reasonably priced, and it's always fun to meet new people! I do not have a single complaint about this place. It's definitely the place to be every friday night!
