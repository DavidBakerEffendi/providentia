Good food, straightforward service, bright and cozy room.  But noisy for no reason: someone has already mentioned the conversation-stopping metal chair legs scraping the stone floor.  I'll add the squeaky bathroom hinge echoing throughout the room as people go in and out.   Grease the hinges and put little felt pads under the chair legs!  Diners will be so much happier.
