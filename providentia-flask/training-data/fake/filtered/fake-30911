Jimmies has always been the the place to go for seafood and ambience since childhood but it is no longer ! It really needs  a face lift and the food quality has fallen into decline as well ! We ordered Lobster Rolls which in the past has been just lobster meat drizzled with butter on the side so you  can add your correct amount! Not hte case this visit!! They have in small print that senior eyes dont always catch, the roll is now filled with a lobster blend of crawfish n lobster !! We were hard put to find the one piece of lobster among all the crawfish in the small roll !! Between the decline in the ambience and the BIG decline in the FOOD we will not return to our old family favorite!  We sure will be steering our friends away from such a disappointing establishment as well! GOOD BYE JIMMIES OF SAVIN ROCK the haydays of the past are gone!!
