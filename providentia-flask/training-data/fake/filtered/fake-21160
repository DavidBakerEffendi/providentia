Ernie's is AWESOME!!!! You don't have the nutty crowds & lines of tourists that you run into on Wooster St. & get fresh, excellent, quality New Haven pizza. When my wife & I 1st started dating & she told me about New Haven pizza 20 yrs ago (I was living in NYC at the time), I thought she was nuts. Then we went to visit her family & I was hooked. We have eaten at them all several times, but we are hooked on Ernie's. Pat (who owns Ernie's) & his staff/family are fantastic; as accommodating & friendly as can be. My family has  lived in NJ for the past 17 yrs & will take a special road trip up to Ernie's a few times a yr for a pizza fix. When we do, we make sure to clear out our freezer to bring home some extra pies, (they reheat GREAT). We also get several orders from neighbors that we have gotten hooked, often bringing home 10+ pies (remember they only take cash if you plan to order extras). My wife & I  have to travel to Boston a few times a yr for business & will call a day or 2 ahead to order pies for on our way home. Since Ernie's is just off the Merritt, it is a simple & easy to get off the highway, grab the pies, get back on the road & have a very happy family when we get home. Once the restaurant was closed for a death in family, & I picked up pies at Pepe's. upon getting home I wrapped up 3 pies to put in the freezer & put 2 more in the oven to warm up. When ready, I called the family to the table & after a few bites my 2 kids (11 & 14) looked at me with disappointed faces & said, "something is wrong with the pizza...it doesn't taste right. They had no idea that I stopped somewhere else to get the pies. When I explained that Ernie's was closed & that I had to stop somewhere else in New Haven that makes very good pizza to get the pies, they ate it, but kept grumbling that it just wasn't as good as Ernie's, & next time don't stop if Ernie's isn't open. Guess it is safe to say that Ernie's has a 2nd generation of loyal fans in my family's ranks! THANKS PAT!
