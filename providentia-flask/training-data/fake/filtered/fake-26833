I moved from San Francisco to New York city 12 years ago in April.  I have finally experienced a burrito that resembles a "San Francisco style" burrito in NYC.  I can't even put it into words why it good.  They know how to wrap a burrito, and fill it the way I expect a burrito to be, and it tastes like the Bay Area.  I have been so disappointed with mexican food in general,  protest that there isn't mexican food here at all. In my early years in New York,  I would buy 6 burritos in the Mission and put them in my freezer when I got back here and had them to eat when I wanted a burrito.   Well, finally there is a burrito I don't have to bring back on the plane!  My only complaint is that the "basic bean and rice"  burrito comes with cheese and sour cream automatically.  At a San Francisco taqueria, you select each ingredient and pay for only what you want.    But since I live in NYC now and have for 12 years, I understand.  You always pay for stuff you don't want here...that is how they pay the rent.
