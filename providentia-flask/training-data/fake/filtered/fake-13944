My wife and I recently had dinner at this highly recommended Philly restaurant. We couldn't get a reservation so we arrived at 5pm on the dot on Saturday night and sat at the bar (recommended). Great atmosphere, great staff and a wonderful menu. We both thought the food was very good but not like Wow.. We tried the Fico pizza, good. The Pork popcorn, pretty tasty. The braised short ribs were cooked well but were just missing something. The stuffed meatballs were tasty. The salted caramel desert was the best.  Very good.  We would go back but I can't give it a 4.  If you like this type of menu try Langosta Lounge in Asbury Park, NJ . Similar in certain ways but a little tastier.
