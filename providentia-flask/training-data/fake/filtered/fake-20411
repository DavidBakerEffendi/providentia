LOVE Tiny Thai!  Great food at a great price.  I have noticed that the dishes are made a little differently depending on the day, but they still always taste great.   The food at the Winooski location is better and more consistent than the food at the Essex location. One thing to be careful of if you order takeout....There have been multiple times that the dish I've ordered was cooked with the wrong meat or the wrong appetizer has been put in the bag, so check it out before you leave!
