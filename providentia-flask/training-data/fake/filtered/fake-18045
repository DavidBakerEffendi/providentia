Love this place.  I've only been for brunch.  It's pretty tight in there, but cozy is probably a better word to describe it.  The wait was short, and we opted to do so outside.  Very cool - the waitresses come out and serve you drinks while you wait on the sidewalk.  Best bloody mary I've had in sometime.  The bacon, as I can rarely say in this town, was cooked to perfection.
