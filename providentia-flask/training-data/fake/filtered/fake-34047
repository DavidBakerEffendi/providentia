Just had a great Mother's Day experience mid-day, easily landing outdoor seating on a beautiful day.  We ordered two appetizers, and 4 Greek specialty plates for a family of five, which was  overwhelmingly too much food. The roasted pita slices with  Greek herbs flowed freely and, frankly, the appetizers and the bread would've been enough for a family.  The Chardonnay, which the manger explained could be offered without a full liquor license due to NJ law nuance, was surprisingly quite drinkable and refined for a downright inexpensive bottle. Yet, the place still functions as BYOB----best of both worlds.   Staff was attentive and aimed to please. Each dish was quite tasty and we're stuffed.  Definitely ordered too much we these portions.   Livingston family
