I have been going here or having takeout from here with my family since before I can remember.  Over 20 years later, and no longer living in Morrisville, every time I get to come back is a real treat. This town has no shortage of great pizzerias but Originals is, in my book, the best.  The service is friendly, the prices are reasonable, and the food is excellent.  I particularly like the sandwiches from here, such as the chicken parm or the pizza steak.  There were years where I'd eat pizza from here every friday and a sandwich every saturday.  Not the healthiest, I admit, but boy was it satisfying.  Now that I'm grown and living out of the immediate area it can be a long while between visits.  Sure enough, when I go in to pick up my pizza, Sal (the owner) remembers me and asks about my family.   Not much more to say than that: definitely try this place if you get a chance.
