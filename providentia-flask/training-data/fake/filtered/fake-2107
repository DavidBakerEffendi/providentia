I loved the margherita pizza. My only wish was that the bottom was a little charred like the crust. Otherwise, delicious. Excellent caesar salad & fresh Mission IPA on tap. Simple meal, perfect. I liked the laid back decor but I wish the rest rooms were "labeled" as universal. There was a line of ladies waiting to use the "womens" room. Altho a waiter walked by and said to use the "mens" room not everyone is comfortable. So I hope that the next time I return the wc's are not marked by gender!! Back to the pizza: WELL WORTH THE REPUTATION!
