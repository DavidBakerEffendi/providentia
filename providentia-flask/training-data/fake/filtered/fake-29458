Absolutely horrible experience. We had a reservation for our party of eight but when we got there we still had to wait 20 minutes. We waited for our food for over an hour and when it came I was very disappointed. Having spent a lot of time in the South I know what good Southern food is, and this was not it. None of the spices or flavors tasted right. I ended up paying too much for a meal I could barely eat.The only good thing I can say is that their fried chicken is good. Overall it was disappointing.
