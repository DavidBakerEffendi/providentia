First time compelled to write a review. First, we sat and waited for over an hour for our entree. When we finally decided to get up and leave, we expected to see a packed dining room. We were only one of three tables there. The outside seating apparently take priority. Second, very unprofessional. The host, if that is what he was, wore a baseball cap on sideways and t shirt. Third, we paid the waitress for our app and actually tipped her on it. As we left, some other guy, stopped us as if we didn't pay. We guessed he wanted it to make it look like we had the problem instead of it being their service. I have eaten at most of the places on this strip and have been dining out for two decades. This was my the worst experience of my life. There are plenty of equally fine restaurants with similar cuisines in the area who know how to treat their customers.
