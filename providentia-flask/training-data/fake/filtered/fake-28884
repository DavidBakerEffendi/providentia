I'm gonna echo some of what Stephanie S. said. Diners are generally known more for their variety in food choice than the quality of the food itself. Allwood certainly has variety, but in my experience their food is anything but sub-par. Normally I have one or two "go to" items at a restaurant, but I've tried many things at Allwood Diner. They have excellent open faced sandwiches, good burgers and a great buffalo chicken sandwich. I've also been impressed by all their breakfast foods. Most recently I tried their Oreo Belgian waffle and would definitely order it again. The chicken noodle soup is home made and works perfectly with a light meal. And Stephanie got it right about the rice pudding: It's the best I've ever had. The only things I wouldn't recommend are the southern fried chicken and the fried clams. I should have known better than to try seafood at a diner. (For the record, I've never tried any kind of steak or pasta) This is just my opinion, but as a guy who loves to eat I think Allwood offers very generous portions for their prices. The service is fast and the staff is generally very friendly and courteous. While I'm aware that some people on this page have overheard screaming from the kitchen, I've dined at Allwood at least a dozen times now and can't say I've ever had such an experience. It's a very well kept, clean and organized diner from the customer's vantage point. And just as a side note, it's smaller than your average diner on the inside, so you might want to think about avoiding peak hours so you don't have to wait for a table. My advice: don't go to Tick Tock Diner (which is a couple miles down the road) if you can go here. Allwood is far and away the best diner in Clifton. If you go, I hope you enjoy!
