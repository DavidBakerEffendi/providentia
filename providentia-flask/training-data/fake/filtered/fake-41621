Barcelona New Haven was my go-to for quite a while. I love the dim lighting and the music, perfect for relaxing after a hectic workday. I usually sat at the bar and tried a different wine every time. The bartenders are always pleasant and have good recommendations. Tapas are usually tasty and right up my alley. I came here during restaurant week with a date when they had a deal on tapas; you picked three to share, plus received olives and bread, all for a very decent price. Even their regular menu is reasonable, in my opinion. The conversation is always great, whether it's with the other folks at the bar, or the staff. They attract a very mixed crowd, yet it strays from the typical Yale party scene, which is refreshing. Love this place, will always stop in when I'm in New Haven.
