In a town filled with great sandwich spots, this is one of the best. Can't really go wrong with anything your order here. Absolutely delicious and great service. You like oreos? You like cookies? How about a cookie with oreos IN IT. Yep, they have that, too. Love me some roast beef on peasant bread with swiss and herb mayo.
