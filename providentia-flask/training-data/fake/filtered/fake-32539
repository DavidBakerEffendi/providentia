Quality BBQ through and through ! They have a well made sweet,smokey BBQ sauce,from scratch cornbread,and friendly customer service. The pork ribs are very very good for the price,the chicken,though a little bland, is not over cooked or dry,and the fact that they actually use steak fries is by far my favorite part about ordering lunch from here...the rest of the sides could use some work, i was very disappointed with the mac and cheese,the sweet potatoes and beans were par at best,but despite the sides being roughly average the rest of the meal is always top shelf...i recommend if you want some real BBQ and are in the area
