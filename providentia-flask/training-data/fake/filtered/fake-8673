The burgers are outstanding but the big drawback: there's no ventilation at all. It got to a point where I had to go outside for air. I simply could not breathe. My clothes were permeated with the smell of smoke and meat for days. It was gross. PLUS_ no coffee?! If they fix this problem, I would eat here ALL THE TIME but It's close to intolerable.
