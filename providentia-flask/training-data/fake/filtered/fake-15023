I used to love this restaurant...but in the last few months it has gone down hill. I loved their garlic bread that they would always bring to the table. Then one day it was brought out STALE. I complained, and the waitress said that yes, she thought it was stale too.  I asked why did she still bring it out, and she shrugged her shoulders!     They used to serve soup with their sandwichs as part of lunch. That has stopped. They never serve any side dish with their sandwiches...not french fries or chips. Nothing.     The wait staff will frequently sit and eat their lunch in the dining room! I feel funny even asking for anything whule they are eating!     Last week they stopped serving their garlic bread with lunch...a small tasteless loaf of Italian bread came out...simply terrible. THEN, the cappuccino had ground clumps opff coffee in the botto, of the cup.     They have lost me as a customer. There are enough small restauirants close enough in the area that I don't need to go there anymore. What happened, Angelo's?
