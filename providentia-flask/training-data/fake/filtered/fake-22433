The food was so good!  My friend and I went on a Tuesday around 9pm for dessert and ended up sharing the fried bologna sandwich and hot chocolate ice cream  The blend of flavors was delicious and the fries seemed freshly cut.  The ice cream was nothing special, but they had just baked fresh gingerbread cookies and those really hit the spot.  Praise for being BYOB.  Cant wait to come again and try more menu items.
