Philly sports fans unite under one roof at the ultimate sports bar. The place is famous for their crab fries, which are basically krinkle-cut fries dusted with old-bay seasoning. The entire menu is filled with great choices (I've yet to order the wrong thing). The wings are meaty and just the right spice. The salads are the best in town (though I would suggest sticking with the signature dressing). Seafood is a specialty, with the mussels and crabs each getting two thumbs up. Did I mention it's a bar? Drinks are moderately priced, and there are specials daily. Food service is fast, and the atmosphere is perfect for pre-gaming. Stellar food, quick service, and a fun atmosphere make it a must visit stop in Philadelphia.
