I LOVE this place! Came here with my friend John, in town from LA for NY Fashion Week. I was able to score a corner table @8pm, Not bad, eh? So we ordered 3 apps, 2 entrees, 1 pasta, 2 desserts, and drinks. No complaints...everything was delicious. Sheep's milk ricotta, olive oil poached fish, grilled octopus, fantasia... can't wait till next time
