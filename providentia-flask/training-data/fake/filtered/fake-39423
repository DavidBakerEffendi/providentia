Great service, great atmosphere (loved the decor, wasn't your typical greek flag and pics of white stone houses with blue tops)! Our waitress was fantastic, the food was delicious and I loved the menu.  I dated a greek guy for years and to tell the truth eventually it turned me off to when anyone said "let's go for greek." This is a very modern adaptation of a greek menu, kudos to Executive Chef and his crew for making an a very affordable appetizing menu :) I highly recommend the zucchini chips.   And of course, no greek meal wouldn't be complete without a Frappe! And mine was just like being in Greece again. Keep up the good work! HB
