We enjoy murder mystery dinner's.  It was a nice summer evening.  Yes it is a limited menu, but it had plenty on it for us and we are picky eaters.  My husband had the Chicken Rosa and I had the Penne Vodka.  We both had the vanilla gelato for dessert.  The whole meal was wonderful.  The murder mystery show was very interactive.  If you choose to participate it was quite entertaining.  There was a cast of 5 actors.  They built their characters based on answer cards from the audience.  One of the actors, was the victim, who died very early in the evening. The other actors were the suspects and the audience had to ask questions to determine which actor killed the victim.  That was followed by a newlywed show for 2 couples.  One couple had been married over 40 years and the other couple were married less than 2 months.  A fun time was had by all.
