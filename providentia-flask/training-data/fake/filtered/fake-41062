I tried many pizza joints in the U.S. and in NYC, NY truly has the best pizza around, but this pizza is the best I have ever tasted for sure.  It is in a great neighborhood in Little Italy located in historic Manhattan, New York.  The crust is perfect, the sauce is flavorful and the pepperonis are unique and they cause your tastebuds to burst!  One more thing, it is coal oven pizza so it is a must try.
