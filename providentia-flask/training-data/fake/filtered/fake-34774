I pass this place every day after work and went in for happy hour that began at 4pm. Got there, saw a wheel and spun! But didn't know how it worked so it was useless that I landed on the mousse dish. We waited to be seated in back for the specials. Was told we couldn't order from dinner menu till after 5 because kitchen crew was on break but we could order from happy hour menu. We started with dry flavorless chicken meatballs and sauteed mushrooms and was onto our 3rd glass of wine before we able to finally order the BJ burger which was served with chopsticks??? Service was really crappy from 4pm all the way till we got our bill at 8. It was confusing as to who was servicing our table, one person took food orders, another one took drink orders then they disappear and then they switched it up on us. The three stars are for the atmosphere. I doubt I would go again.
