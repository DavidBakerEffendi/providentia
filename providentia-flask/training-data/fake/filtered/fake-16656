I always have a great experience here.   The beer selection is great.   They carry my favorite German on tap!    The oysters always taste super fresh and tasty.  Dinner platters aren't huge but quite good too from the burgers to the salmon.    The only thing here is it's pretty pricey compared to some other restaurants with similar fare.   But to not have to travel to Manhattan and stay close to home is also priceless.   If you don't mind spending a little extra $ then don't hesitate.  Also, on Sunday's the brunch menu is good too.   I'm a fan of the salmon benedict.
