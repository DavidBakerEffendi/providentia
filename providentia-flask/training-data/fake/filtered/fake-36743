I have been going to P.Y.T since last summer and I love this place.  P.Y.T is a hidden gem in Philly.  If you love burgers, this is the best burger joint in town.  The milk shakes are great! I love the virgin black and white milk shake.  They always have a burger of the week that they feature.  I have them send emails to me thats how much I love them.  Its great for a date or when your going out with a group of friends.  In the summer I always bring my dog and sit outside and relax. Its at the Piazza so its so much atomsphere there.  I love this place!!!
