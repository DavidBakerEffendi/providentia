This place is disgusting, the overall appearance is a disaster and pizza guy is repulsive. I am not sure if that is the owner making the pizzas but he resembles a larger mario brother, he is extremely rude to the staff and Â  seems like he just rambles on all of the time. My experience here was very poor and disturbing concerning the (what i think may be) owner's loud and obnoxious comments. Never again will i go here, the headache is not worth the pizza...the very average pizza they serve. Also, the place is very small, there is the same color wood from top to bottom, the sound of the squeaking kitchen door constantly, and the dirty bathrooms will drive one insane. I strongly advise staying away from this place.
