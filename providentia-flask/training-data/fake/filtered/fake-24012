normally order spicy chicken breasts. Went to the Wayne NJ Popey's and placed an order for 2 piece dinner with the breast upgrade (spicy). Got mild instead. Checked with the counter man and was told the mild was fresher. Told him i wanted spicy as ordered and got 1 spicy and counter man slipped in 1 mild. I was not given the option to cancel the order. I have been a Popey's customer for the past 25 years (20 years in Rockville Maryland and 5 years in New Jersey but i will think 3 times before i order from Popey's again
