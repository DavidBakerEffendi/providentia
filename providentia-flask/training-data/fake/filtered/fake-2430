0 stars.  went in to dine with 10 yr old and 12 yr old ( 13 months apart in age)  waitress looks at 12 yr. old and says she has to pay adult price, so I asked why and told her  her age  ( I had announced us previously as 1 adult, 2 children ).   SHOCK  !!! " she's over 4 ft 5 ins. was the answer....not her age....but height .... and a yardstick to measure kids was stuck on a wall  !!!!!  Ridiculously, the 10 yr old is over 4 ft 5 ins also, but gets to pay kid's price...Is this legal ?  pay by height ?  will contact town tomorrow.   outraged   sharon c   7/2/13
