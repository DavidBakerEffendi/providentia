I went to Sally's last week for the first time in a few years with some childhood friends of mine from New Haven.  I was wondering how good the pies would be.  After one bite, I knew.  Heaven, nirvana, ecstasy.  Ultra-thin but chewy crust, with delicious sauce and toppings.  The aura of the great Sal Consiglio stil hangs in this place.  My only regret was that Flo wasn't there that night so I could give her a hug.  My brother will be visiting from Georgia in a week and we will go there to eat and buy a few larges to bring back to my mother's house to freeze and enjoy during the rest of his stay.
