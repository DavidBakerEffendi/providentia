Beautiful restaurant.  Professional wait staff and maitre de.  Food is fantastic and  the freshest sushi I have every had. Hibachi chefs will bring a smile to your face and will wow you with their expertise.  Waitresses are very knowledgeable and right on top of everything.  Extremely child friendly.  Also great date night.  Separate party rooms.  Surprised at the wide variety of excellent desserts.  A true winner and a restaurant I will visit again and again....
