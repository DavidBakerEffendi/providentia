amazing food, amazing prices!!!! the best place around!!! we ordered out for valentine's day and had a great dinner at home!!! we spent $25 and had leftovers!!! the dinner sets come with soup & salad (my favorite) and plenty more!!! totally worth it! i highly suggest going there! the place inside is small, but clean & cozy! if you eat there, you get plenty of free-be's!!! 5 stars for sure!!! :)
