Every time I go to Montclair, Le Salbuen is a must.  It had a great atmosphere and the service has always been wonderful.  I never write reviews but felt this restaurant deserved doing a review.  Some standouts are the pork and bacon burger which is excellent, and the chicken and mushroom sandwich which always has you eating the entire sandwich even though you know if it too large to eat the whole thing.   I have also gone for breakfast/brunch and have had wonderful eggs - there is one with a scrambled egg and bacon on a Baggett, I don't know the name of it but it was excellent. I would return for that dish alone. Our server was attentive and had a great attitude.  He was managing a number of tables in a this small restaurant and everyone was served quickly and was he able to keep all the tables happy. I would recommend this restaurant for ladies doing lunch, or a romantic lunch/dinner, or actually for anyone.
