Went over the summer on a Friday night. We wanted to sit outside however the place was slammed! My 2 friends and I didnt want to wait forever so we took a seat downstairs. Downstairs was nice but was kind of secluded and had a strong musty basement smell. Can't complain too much about the food though, it was pretty good! And our waitor was nice also.
