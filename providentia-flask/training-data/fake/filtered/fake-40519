My husband and I recently got married on October 7th, 2012. We were so impressed with not only the food and hospitality, but the decor as well. Our decision to have our wedding ceremony as well as the reception at the Paris Inn was the easiest decision we made. Manager, Antonio, made our event absolutely perfect. The intricacies of our wedding were overwhelming even to us; however, Antonio and his team made so many accommodations. I am confident you will not be able to beat the service and the fantastic food. In display and taste, our meals were amazing. Our guests were not just satisfied, but blown away by how beautiful the ambiance, hospitality and quality was of everything. From bartender to waiter, the service staff were friendly and accommodating. I look forward to enjoying ALL of our anniversaries at the Paris Inn. The loving, family-friendly environment and overall level of service made us and our guests feel like royalty. I recommend AT LEAST enjoying the best meal around at the Paris Inn, if not hosting a function (business or otherwise). I must thank the entire staff that directly and indirectly serviced us and our guests, including Antonio, Steph, Alex, Ronnie, Dana and Liz (our new favorite bartender in the world!!!) Despite the challenges that our group and us presented, they all displayed nothing but beyond-professional, helpful fantastic service. We look forward to sitting down for another meal there.
