When I arrived for our 7pm reservation at 6:50 (note: there were no 6:30 reservations available on OpenTable), I let the hostess know that we were attending a show at 8pm at the Pantages, and she promised to get us in and out quickly. At 7:15, we still had not been seated, so we ended up dining at the bar (they came to show us to our table a couple minutes after we placed our order). The bartenders are AMAZING - very nice, friendly, and courteous. They got our food to us quickly, and we were done by 7:45 - in plenty of time to make the show.
