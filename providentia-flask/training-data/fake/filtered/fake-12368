The food is not bad but I have tasted better. While I was visiting Parsippany, I visited this place a couple of times and tried following items: * Biryani - Above average. However, I have tried better ones * Kabobs - Average. * Nehari - Mediocre Their customer service is terrible. I asked a quick question on the phone what he had in curry today. He said he does not have time to talk...'quickly order' Then they refused to accept credit card and when I insisted on paying their charges to credit card company he frowned big time. I believe he mumbled and cursed...Terrible! I will never be visiting this place again!
