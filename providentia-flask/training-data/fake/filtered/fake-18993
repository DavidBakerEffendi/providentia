I consider myself a pizza connoisseur.  Seriously, I grew up on pizza and this food holds a very special place in my heart.  I ate so much of it growing up, that my name might as well have been Ray-Rayangelo (the secret 5th brother of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles).  I know, I'm witty. If you haven't read any of my previous out-of-town reviews, then you may not know that I'm in a band.  Yeah, I'm in a band, no big deal.  So while I was in the New York area for a gig, a friend of mine suggested I stop by Artichoke's to try some of their awesome pizza.  I wasn't able to get to the spot until 11pm, and by that time, it was super packed.  There was a line out the door, but I already committed to eating at this place, so there was no way I was turning back now.  It took about 30 minutes to get through the line and get my hands on the awesomeness that is Artichoke's pizza.  I ordered a slice of Crab and a slice of Sicilian.  One word: AMAZEBALLS!  Not only were the ingredients fresh, but the slices were cooked to perfection.  The crust was slightly crispy and the cheese was melted just right.  Out of the two slices, I preferred the Crab over the Sicilian and I'd recommend all you n00bs to lean that way as well.  I mean come on, how often will you get to have a Crab pizza for Christ's sake.  Although I'm giving the quality of the pies at this pizzeria five stars, the lack of seating and long lines is forcing Ray-Ray to give them a 4 star Yelp review.  DEAL WITH IT. Artichoke's is pizza for the sophisticated diner.  You know, a guy or gal that can eat a Pink's hot dog for lunch and then head over to Harris' for a steak dinner.  You know, it's for the type of guy that would wear a tie with tennis shoes.  You know, It's for the type of gal that actually likes drinking beer with her pinky finger up in the air.  In other words, Artichoke's pizza tastes like a Care Bear riding a Unicorn in the sky.  If you're a fan of pizza, you should totally check this place out.
