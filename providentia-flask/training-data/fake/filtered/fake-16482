I feel like this place is overrated.  The prices aren't *that* cheap and the food isn't *that* good or unusual.  I got the Dominican Club, which was just a turkey club with avocado - not too sure what made it "Dominican."  The bread was this disappointing grocery store sandwich bread.  Sure, the people were nice, but I'm not in a rush to go back there again...and I work right in walking distance.
