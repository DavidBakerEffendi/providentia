Truly the best sushi I've ever had. Â This place is not cheap but nothing this good ever is. the Giant Clam Himo and Kanpachi are to die for. Put down the chopsticks and eschew the tired desire to over soak your sushi in soy. Also, ,make sure you sit at the sushi bar so that you can see the master at work!
