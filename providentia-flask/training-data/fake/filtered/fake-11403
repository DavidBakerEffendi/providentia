We started with some white wine and two cheeses, a firm goat cheese and a creamy house made ricotta, each served with a jam and thin crackers... So good, especially the ricotta. For my main, I had the mushroom garganelli, which was delicious.  My husband had the branzino, which I would say was average (and a small portion - needed more substance, the olives kind of overpower things).   Finished with the olive oil cake. I had read reviews and had high expectations; it did NOT disappoint. I can't get over how amazing this cake was, I couldn't stop eating it.   Big bonus; Excellent service. :) Highly recommended for a nice date night/occasion
