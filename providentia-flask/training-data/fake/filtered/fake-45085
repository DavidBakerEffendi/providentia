This was recommended by a family member. Took a while to find this place, but that's probably because we had the  wrong address. We spent an hour trying to find it but it was an hour worth the wait.  The boyfriend and I were seated immediately and was attended to pretty quickly considering the amount of people in the joint. We ordered the signature bar size pizza and the homemade gnocchi with vodka sauce and...IT WAS AMAZING!!!
