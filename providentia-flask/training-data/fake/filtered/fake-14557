I love the cheese pizza from here but it makes my stomach bubbly after i eat it. The one thing that I absolutely love this place for are the chicken rolls. they are deeeeeeelicious! they come in small pizza box with 12 rolls & sauce on the side. They are stuffed cheesy chicken bread goodness. I'm willing to bet all flavors are great. A must try!!! PS, I also disagree with Nina, the people are pretty friendly, but if you walk in there with an attitude, you probably will get one back.
