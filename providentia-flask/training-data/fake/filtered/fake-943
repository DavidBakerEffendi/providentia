My fiance and I go to this BBQ place a few times a year and their food is nothing short than incredible and full of flavor. I ordered a BBQ chicken sandwich and a side of burnt ends the BBQ sauce is delightful! My fiance ordered the same and was equally impressed. We also came in just before closing the and employees still greeted us with smile and we stayed to eat and they did not rush out even though they were closing. We look forward to many more visits to Uncle Willies!
