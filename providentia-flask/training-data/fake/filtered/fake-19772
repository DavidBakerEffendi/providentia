Went to Guru Palace for a private affair the other week and was absolutely dissatisfied with the way management handled the event. First: The heating was broken and the manager never told our friends who booked the place until midway through the dinner. Even when we first arrived to the place to set the tables, the lady would go up to the thermostat and press a few buttons, and say "Yes, I just turned it up all the way, don't worry." It was only until my brother went to the thermostat did we realize she actually didn't even press anything and the heat was not turned on. So, we turned it on ourselves, but still no heat. We told management, and they said yeah, our heater is broken and set us up with a few space heaters. These space heaters did not get the job done at all, unfortunately all our guests had to wear their jackets and coats throughout the dinner to stay warm. Second: with all the space heaters setup and plugged into the wall, Guru Palace did not have proper electricity wired to handle a simple DJ setup with two speakers. It caused a circuit to break and the manager told our event organizer that either "we don't have heat or we don't have a speaker" Third: With all the complaints that happened already, the manger threatened to not serve dinner if payment was not received. Words were thrown around, and I was appalled by some of the things that were coming out of the managers mouth, it was very unprofessional and rude. We of course paid the full amount, and received cold food; the naan was dry, the chicken tikka was plain boring and cold. I will never go back to this place again, or, recommend anyone to try it. Terrible management tied with subpar food equates to an awful dining experience.
