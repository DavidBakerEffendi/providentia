When I was growing up in Montclair, Â I would go to Sandwich Theory (still the Cheese Shop to me) at least once a week, despite the fact that it was probably not a great idea since I wasn't made of money. I was introduced to the number five and it became my FAVORITE. SANDWICH. EVER. They have delicious food and wonderful service. In the years since I have left Montclair, one of my favorite parts about coming home is still being able to come back to this place, eat delicious food, and see the wonderful people who make that place what it is (Ben, Joey, Graham, among everyone else whose names I don't yet know....sorry!) This place is incredible and remains number one on my list of favorite lunch spots.
