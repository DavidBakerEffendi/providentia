Gotta love freemans! This place is another fave. Very good menu(checkout the artichoke dip), good beverage selection, knowledgeable staff. It gets packed so the wait time can be horrific and the no reservations for under 6 people can be down right frustrating but you know what it worth the wait cause you're sure to have a great night at Freemans...... Note: Head straight to the bar out the back right corner.
