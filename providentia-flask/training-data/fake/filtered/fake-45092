+ Service polite, most speak English well +/- Ambience: relatively clean for C-town +/- Food Steamed Tiny Buns With Pork - 3.5/5 - steaming hot, skin a bit thick but tasty Salt and Pepper Squid - 3.5/5 - nice combo of sliced hot green peppers, scallions and golden fried bits of garlic - batter crunchy - squid was chewy and hard to eat--pieces need to be cut smaller Shanghai Rice Cakes w/ mixed seafood - 1/ 5 -avoid--limp, too much soy sauce stuck to the cakes, seafood tastes old (this is opposite of the above Fried squid)
