I've been a steady customer at the Thirsty Koala for the last year and I can say that I've NEVER had a disappointing experience. The food is always delicious, the service exceptional, and a consistently delightful atmosphere. I usually stick to my favorite dish, the steak tacos, but have enjoyed the lamb lollies as well. The chips (fries) are the best I've ever had, with the most delicious sweet chili sauce on the side. The daily happy hour is the best deal around. 2 for 1 cocktails is a deal and these drinks are amazing. I'd highly recommend the "Dingo", or one of their amazing beers. Always a good end to a day! I dare you to find a more friendly/helpful wait staff in NYC. Seriously. These people are amazing and always put a smile on my face. If you haven't yet tried the Thirsty Koala, you don't know what you're missing. I'll be a life-long customer!
