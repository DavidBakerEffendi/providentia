Love this place.  Good vibes, great food, friendly staff... one of the only places in the neighborhood that got it all right.  They have a decent amount of vegetarian options for their small menu, and their daily brunch is delicious.  So far, every experience at cafe Ghia has been hassle free and tasty.
