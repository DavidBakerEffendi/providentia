I had first heard about Roma after buying a Groupon for it. Having seen the less than glowing reviews both as far as food and service, I had reservations about even going, especially since I had taught cooking classes and had been a customer service manager. Within minutes, they brought out some of the best bread that I have had, equaled by only the finest of bakeries. The first thought that had gone through my mind is that Roma should focus on Paninis and even consider having a bruschetta and crostini bar. My appetizer was calamari that was crisp and perfectly cooked. As a side dish, I chose a tossed salad, that while rather common and ordinary was perfectly dressed. As an entree, I had veal rollatini that I thought was rather dry. Â Having only tasted two dishes, my review was most accurate, given the smaller sample. My desire to write this review was as much a factor of my customer service experience that in no way, warrants the poor customer service reviews that it has received.
