Wow! Very good food. Very amazing. The place is nice and clean and one of the best ramen stops in the neighborhood. Place can order to go or there to eat. When ordering to go they put the soup and noodles and other food separate so that when you go back home. Nothing is soggy and still has crunch and texture. Beautiful.
