one of the worst  restaurant to visit by a food lover.. Other than the ambience nothing else it good. Anyone who knows authentic indian food would never recommend this place. It doesnt match up to Rasoi ( Newark Ave)  and Rasoi 2( Edison) taste. Pav Bhaji is tasteless, n Pani Puri with black chick pea.............LOL!!
