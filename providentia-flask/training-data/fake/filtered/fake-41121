ok so the food was yummy and in front of me before I took my coat off... BUT WHY IN THE HECK DID IT TAKE 2 1/2 HOURS TO SEAT US!!! REALLY on a TUESDAY night at 8;30 I put my name on the list for 2 people and we sat at 11! really!! Then I was so hungry I ate in ten minutes and got out! Why couldn't everyone else do that. Why were they sitting at the tables talking?? What could they possibly have had to say that they didn't say while waiting for TWO HOURS!!! oh yeah, I'm hungry, let's eat, how is yours? mine is good... slurp, burp, let's get out of here! I must say as well, while waiting and watching the cooks, I saw them eat with their hands while cooking, blow their nose while cooking, why did I wait... hunger & hypothermia do strange things to you! I will go to Terakawa Ramen on 9th and 57th NEXT time I want Ramen. How hard can broth, noodles, pork and scallions be to throw together?! the wait staff was efficient...got to give them props.. they got is in and out
