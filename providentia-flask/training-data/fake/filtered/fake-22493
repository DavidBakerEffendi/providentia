My husband and I have been fairly regular customers since you opened. We love your food, your wine list, and your cocktails. We love the restaurant's physical space. We have brought our parents for special occasions. We have recommended Roia to our friends. That said, we have some, well, reservations. Surely you've also noticed that your dining room is barely full at 7 pm on weekends? Your service is terrible. It can take as much as thirty minutes to get a cocktail made and delivered or an hour for an entree. It is hard to say whether this is a problem of the kitchen or of the wait-staff. It seems likely that it is both. Either way, it is inexcusable. We have sat at the bar and watched the bartenders switch between activities, drawing out the work, moving with no sense of urgency for any task. Even when the restaurant is totally empty (and it often is), service at the bar or at a table is slow. You have an incredible range of spirits displayed on your bar, yet even on a Saturday night, your bartender has no idea what to do with them. Why are you paying for alcohol you don't use or a bartender who doesn't know how to use it? The staff at the table are often similarly incapable. They know the menu well enough, but are slow, hesitant, and awkward. They're always very nice but we have yet to be served by a quick and competent waiter. We've been faithful customers since you opened, but it's hard to keep going back when meals take hours and even popping in for a cocktail can consume half the evening. We'd hate to see your restaurant fail, but with service at similarly priced restaurants (Olea, Zinc, Caseus) so much more consistent and with food just as good or better, it's unlikely that we'll return.
