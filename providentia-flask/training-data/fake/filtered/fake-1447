I went in Â there couple of months ago with my hubby, it must have been the first couple of weeks they opened. So there was no wait (luckily!). Try getting a reservation now, it is sometimes weeks away. We were wandering inside ABC (as I usually do when I pass by) and realized that there is a brand new restaurant downstairs. We decided to give it a shot since we have nothing planned that night. The decor and the ambience was chic but very comfortable. It felt like we went into someone's summer house almost. I ordered beets with yoghurt and the fried organic chicken and my hubby went for the halibut. I couldn't believe how a simple dish like beets and yoghurt could taste so sophisticated and my chicken was tender and delicious. Hubby definitely like the halibut. All we did was to talk about the place, utensils, plates and what an extraordinary job they did for the place. Another important point for was their ingredients were organic and local. It has been a real delight! I tried going back with my girlfriends but we could only get to sit at the bar. Hey, word spreads really fast in NYC. I think it is a great addition to a great store like ABC and I will definitely be back.
