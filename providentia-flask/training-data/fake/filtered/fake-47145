Absolute joke. I usually don't write poor reviews, but I'm making an exception for this place in hopes to save people money. My girlfriend and I wanted to try out a new place this past Saturday. Everything was great, until I got my entree. I got ravioli. Now, let me ask you something, how do you screw up ravioli? My meal came out cold and it tasted like I was chewing on rubber bands. I come from an Italian family. I love my pasta dishes. I called my Nana later that night to tell her about my terrible experience. She laughed and told me I should probably kill myself now. She was joking, of course, but I considered it. Entree BYOB - BYOB as in Bring Your Own Bullets...to blow your head off with.
