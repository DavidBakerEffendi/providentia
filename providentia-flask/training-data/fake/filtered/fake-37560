I usually don't use this app but this I had to, we walked in few friends and ordered few platters to share we had the shakshuka, hummus masabacha and the falafel trio, the cauliflower side and breaded fried eggplant, everything was so good and the pita bread was fresh and hot the falafel and hummus feels like it was just made overall it was a very good experience and would highly recommend to try it. Btw the lemonana was delicious too..:))
