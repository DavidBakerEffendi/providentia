Had a terrible lunch here. Waited way too long for our lunch. All we ordered was a soup, a sandwich and a burger (how long does that take?) The soup was warm, the burger overdone and the sandwich which was supposed to be hot was cold. The restaurant was very cold and the manager was a jerk. He wandered around with our food looking for the right table. When he finally got to us we told him that it took to long for the food to come out. He looked at us, turned around and walked away. After explaining to the waitress how unhappy we were she sent the manager back over to our table. When we told him Â we were unhappy with the fact that he walked away from us without saying anything he got very defensive and walked away again! We all agreed that we would never go back there again nor would we recommend it!
