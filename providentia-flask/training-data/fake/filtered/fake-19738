I have always found both owner and employees very polite and helpful.  They will offer samples of cold cuts or cheeses so I will know if I like them.  I m always very impressed with how reasonable prices are compared to the supermarket for MUCH better quality meats, sausages of all kinds, cold cuts and cheeses you won t find in most grocery stores, and interesting European products, not to mention wonderful fresh old-world breads -- love the crusty linseed bread -- great for sandwiches with those cold cuts and cheeses!  Worth the trip for a visit.
