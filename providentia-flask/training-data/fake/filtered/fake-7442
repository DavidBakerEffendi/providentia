I've been eating at this establishment since it opened, and for good reason. The food is delicious and fresh, the staff are courteous and friendly. I couldn't ask for a better lunch spot around work. You'll probably want to take your meal to go, because this place is rather small, and busy. My only complaint is that around lunch time there is a line out the door.
