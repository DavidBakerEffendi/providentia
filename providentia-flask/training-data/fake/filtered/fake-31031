This place is awesome!  The food is really great quality.  We especially liked the cream of asparagus soup special, the fried mozzarella and potato cake!  Nice atmosphere and music, and even though we didn't drink, the selection looked amazing.  Reasonably priced for apps, entrees and dessert.  Our waiter, Jason, was top notch!  Attentive, knowledgeable and a great personality.  Highly recommend!
