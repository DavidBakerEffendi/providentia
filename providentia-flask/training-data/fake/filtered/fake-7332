Took notice of a bustling bar, in what appeared to be a tastefully-assembled venue.  I ended up sticking to a liquid (largely digestif) diet, after taking a look at what was a seemingly divine menu.  The raw bar, in particular, piqued my interest and appetite, alike; regrettably, it was a chance drop-in where my time was too limited to try anything. Bar side, a range of liqueurs and old world vino are at the tenders' disposal to potentially prime your palate.  I appreciated the variety of Italian liqueurs and after-dinner juices, but felt the wine list, on the aggregate, to be narrow in scope and exceptionally over-priced (and YES, I do understand location breeds such).  Staff was knowledgeable and seemed to be having a good time; the clientele a blend of ages with a uniform felicity..  Didn't feel there would be much of a dress code to stress as long as you can somewhat put yourself together.  Will return in the future
