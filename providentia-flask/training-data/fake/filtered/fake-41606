I love Barcelona in downtown New Haven. The food and the service is very well done. There is always someone there if you are in need of something and the food is always up to par. I love that the menu is always changing, so each time I go in I can try something new that the chef has created. My one concern with the restaurant lately is all the changes in managers. As a matter of fact, last week when I came in for some tapas and a cocktail with a friend of mine, there was a new female manager who was acting like she was better then the servers at their job. I have had the server a handful of times before and they have always given me quality service. That is the only time the restaurant has left a sour taste in my mouth. She needs to be spoken to, these kids work very hard and do not deserve to be treated in that manner. Â Oh and you have to try the Lobster and pasta dish as well as the hanger steak, both serious go to items on their menu.
