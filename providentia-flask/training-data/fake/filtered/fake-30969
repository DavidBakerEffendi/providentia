This place is awesome! The owner is very friendly and personable. I heard about this hidden gem fro ma friend who goes there on Wednesday for the ham lunch which is sliced right from the bone in ham. I eventually started trying the sandwiches and the the "The Hartford" Â which is a roast beef sandwich is incredible. The rolls are very fresh (everything is) and it's a great sandwich for $5.95 and you get to pick a side dish with it. You can't beat the price or the taste.
