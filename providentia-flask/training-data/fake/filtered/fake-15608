Such a great addition to the neighborhood food culture. Battersby already stands out as a lovely place for great service and a memorable meal. I have to say- I'm a big fan of Frankie's and Buttermik Channel but the food here is more creative and also more crafted. That's a pretty amazing feat! Definitely planning on returning soon.
