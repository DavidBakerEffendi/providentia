This place has the best buffalo chicken wings that I've tasted anywhere in the five boroughs. I think the owner is from Buffalo and thats why they get the flavor exactly right. You have your choice of mild, medium, or hot. Be careful, the hot ones are scorching! Also they double fry their french fries for a crispy outside and a soft middle. The atmosphere is very casual diner style. Sit at the counter for the full effect. If you like wings this is the place! The rest of the menu is good too, burgers, steak sammy's, chili, salads, and a nice beer selection. Looking forward to my next wing extravaganza!
