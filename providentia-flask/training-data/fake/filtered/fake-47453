Very disappointed all the way around. Staff are rude, pizza is very thin w/little to no taste, cash only, long lines if you don't go early & not very organized. My daughter was visiting from out of state & use to work at a pizzaria. She saw the high rating & reviews, so we tried it. When we arrived a gentlemen sat us right away. Â We waited 12min before he came back for our drink orders, then we found out they have no liquor license, so we ask to get it to go & he ask us to get up, go to the front & order up there. We did, it didn't take long for our pizza, but we left to go eat by the water & when we got there realized they gave us the wrong pizza. We brought it back, was ORDERED to "wait here outside the door" for them to make it, even tho I called ahead for a replacement pizza. We brought the leftovers home to my husband & he said it was awful. He is a native New Yorker who has lived here for 49yrs.
