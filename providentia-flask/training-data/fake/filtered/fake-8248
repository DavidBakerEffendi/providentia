Happened to have their cheesesteak at the Old City Festival, and it was seriously the best cheesesteak I'd ever had (I don't like them overly greasy or drowning in cheese). It didn't hurt that the Conshohocken Bakery roll was also the best sandwich roll I've ever tasted. So we made a point of going to National Mechanics next time we were in the neighborhood. Really hoped to re-experience that cheesesteak, but unfortunately they don't have it on their weekend brunch menu (me, I'm not from a place where there's brunch on Saturday, so I was surprised). No complaints, though. We had a veggie burger and a delicious tuna melt, all quite tasty. Nice atmosphere, busy and lively but not jammed. Also, LOVE the excessive copper plumbing in the bathrooms -- just a fun touch. It'll definitely be our go-to in that part of town.
