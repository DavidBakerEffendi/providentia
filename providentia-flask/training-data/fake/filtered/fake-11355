I heard I had to visit this place.  It was described to me as an Italian Whole Foods/Willam Sonoma on steriods.  I could have walked around all day.  I had a fabulous panini and an espresso.  Next time, I'll sit and try some wine and cheese.  Great books, cooking utensils.  The Nutella Room smelled so good.  My son would have never wanted to leave!
