I forgot what I ordered but the broth and noodles were simple...idk I was hoping for something more. Nothing great about it but it was filling. My bf and okaasan had the akamaru and that had more flavor to the broth. Btw the atmosphere was nice but everytime a customer walks in they yell a saying, I don't mind it, but one female worker there really exaggerated on it and I found annoying but funny lol
