Cosy ramen joint. Bar seats, 2 tables of 4 and 1 table for 2. Be prepared to wait if you're not there when they open. Th mega ramen was everything you want on a cold winters day. Warm, rich, well seasoned pork broth with extra charsiu and the perfect side fillings in the bowl - scallions, fried garlic, garlic horseradish. I ordered the Rayu chilli oil on the side as recommended and was instantly grateful. Gave me the chance to sample the broth on its own and halfway through with some spice which really brought out white pepper notes in the broth. Was it life changing ramen? Nope. But it was damn satisfying and I left with a full and satisfied belly knowing that should a future ramen hankering come about, Totto will be sure to satisfy.
