I've been twice: for drinks, and for drinks/dessert. Both were phenomenal. It's usually so crowded but I ended up getting there both times around 9pm. Parc is beautiful but loud. Great outdoor seating but it's so pretty inside, it's hard to choose! My date drank a mojito and I could smell the fresh mint from where I was seated. Lemon bar was nice and tart.
