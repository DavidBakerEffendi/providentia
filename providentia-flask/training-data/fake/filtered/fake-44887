My wife and I just spent 4 amazing days in NYC and Emporio was the culinary highlight! Everything about my experience was excellent. One really nice touch was the fact that you can actually call the restaurant and speak to a person to place a reservation. However, this was quickly topped by the warm welcome upon our arrival, prompt seating and great service during the entire meal. We were on a budget and passed on wine and desert--I expected to be guilted for this--but our server kept up her pleasant attitude and our tip reflected this. As for the food, the calamari and shrimp app was the meal highlight-tasted fresh, hidden inside were several fried artichokes that exploded with flavor! My entree was the spinach linguini with ragu-great portion size, tender flat noodles and the gravy was extremely well done and could be tasted in every bite. My wife really enjoyed her shrimp/cauliflower with ottelle noodles. Awesome flavors! I would definitely return and highly recommend Emporio on Mott St.
