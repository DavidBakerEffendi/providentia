My friend and I are on a quest for the best burger. We decided one stop should be the Corner Bistro in the western village. Written up many time as the best burger in NYC. Inside, the place was crowded (on a Wednesday night) but with a friendly environment, with multiple lines leading to the bar, restroom(s), and to be seated. It took roughly 20 minutes to get a table, but the waiter was extremely helpful and kept us updated the entire time. We ordered fires and on first bit we realized we were eating BACON (FRIES)! Yes, bacon. With bacon being a staple on many of their burgers, we can only guess that they add the leftover bacon grease to their fryer turning their standard thin cut frozen fries into something fantastic. A few minutes later, our 'Bistro Burger' finally arrived... a cheeseburger topped with bacon, lettuce, tomato, and (raw) onions. We promptly split it in half, each took a big bite, and practically in unison, each said that it was a good burger. Not amazing, not fantastic, or even great... it was just 'good.' For a place that's had numerous write ups as being the best burger in NYC, we were extremely disappointed. If you're in the area, it might be a fun place to visit (especially with $2.50 draft beer), but don't travel out of your way for their burger.
