Great food, attentive staff making great suggestions as to what to pair with that great food, bustling, but friendly and warm. I love this place at all times, but am looking forward to the next great NYC weather event that tells us all to stay home...Me...I'm braving the rains and going to UPSTATE for oysters and white wine while the candles burn.
