AMAZING!!!  We recently tried this place after hearing about it from neighbors in our building and we keep coming back!  The dumplings are so delicious--even more delicious than my taiwanese mother's homemade dumplings (but I"ll never tell her!) and I love trying all the different noodle dishes.  The lady that takes orders is incredibly sweet and seems to remember all her regulars.  This is definitely our 'go-to' place!
