Great place to have an in the evening spend time - went with my buddy. we had fish slider mobile phones - that we really loved - along with a salad w chicken and veggies... lovely! wont imagine returning but when im around and have no idea what to do, would likely return We'd a couple of drinks - happy hour $7-$10 wine (not for those wines therefore if that means something - request which of them are)... $5-$8 ales.. that is great if u drink beer
