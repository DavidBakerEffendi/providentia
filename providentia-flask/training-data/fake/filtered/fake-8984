I had heard a lot of great things about EO, so I decided to come in after work on a random Wednesday night with my girlfriend and we had a blast. Great service by our waitress Elyse, who was the sweetest. She guided us perfectly throughout the meal to make sure we had the best possible dining experience. Her recommendations were impeccable from start to finish. The steak tar tar is a must have. They mix all the ingredients right in front of you, and customize it according to your personal taste. The chocolate pudding was really good too. Really original. Will definitely return soon!
