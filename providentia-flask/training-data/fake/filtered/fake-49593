Oh my god! The Glasserie has taken a space that was not even usable several years ago, created an amazing setting, and good fresh local food. Ok, kids here is how it goes.. Henry will make you the most thought out drink at the bar using the finest of ingredients. Then...... Your waiter comes and your order...moments later comes the FLAKEY BREAD AND LABNEH!!!! It should be illegal, but it is not, but we did order a second order tonight. The lamb tartare was the best tartare I have had in ages, and again, we had to order a second dose. Chef Sara is clearly using the freshest ingredients, so the menu changes a bit every day, so someone like myself, who is a wannabe regular at the Glasserie, can taste the subtle changes from night to night. Tonight, the beets, were to die for. I went with one other person, so after all that we ordered we did not do the rabbit, but that is the plan for sunday night !!!!!! So happy to have this in Greenpoint!
