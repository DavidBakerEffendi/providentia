As a person grown up to love noodles, I must say that they were pretty good. But Â if you are a party of 3 or 5, forget it. The restaurant, designed for communal seating, only seats tables of 2 and 4 in a prompt and timely fashion. Any other seating arrangement you will be waiting for centuries. Even if a couple arrives way after you have, they will be in and out the door way before you are seated. We went knowing we had to wait, but after seeing couple after couple entering and exiting before we even got our chance i began questioning the hostesses method of wait times and seating. After kindly asking her why she was doing what she wAs doing, her rude , unprofessional and lack of consideration of customer service put ,e on the edge. To our experience even worse, we ended up with a greedy, selfish and inconsiderate waiter who believed that placing a bowl of noodles in front of you was fantastic service. Coming from the service industry myself, a tip is earned and reflects not ony your service, but the experience the restaurant gave. Well after we gave what we thought was an appropriate tip for our poor experience, our server complained about his tip. Saying that our poor experience at the front of the house had nothing to do with him and that he was a poor student trying to make a living and that he wasnt being paid enough by the restaurant. Well dear greedy server, Tip is earned not deserved - it's not only about you, but how the whole restaurant treats you You have the right to ask if there was something wrong with the service, not to ask for more money If you have an issue of being underpaid. That is a discussion between you and your manager, clearly someone is making money and it certainly isn't you If you aren't happy with your tip, then give it back. Sincerely A disappointed customer
