Like one of the previous reviews said...too bad they don't give 1/2 stars.  I'd give this place 4.5.  I haven't had sushi in quite some time and forgot how much I love it. I thought Palace Sushi was suspect when I pulled up, but I have to say they proved me wrong.  I loved everything I had...the yellowtail smelled a bit fishy, I'm picky with how fish smells.  I was with a large group (15+ people) so I tried a lot.  Spicy seaweed salad was unique...I'd go back for that alone:)   Waiters were pleasant and helpful.  Avoid Saturday nights...it's packed.
