The best lunch spot in Old City. The Turkey Pita Sandwich is incredible and the Calamari Salad is my favorite!!!! The drinks are a bit on the expensive side, but they are delicious. There is a martini with Tang in it that is the absolute best. With the warm weather, it's an awesome place to hang outside for some drinks.
