I have been eating in good Chinese resturaunts all my life. Flushing has some of the best and most authentic food. Now, for the first time, Wayne New Jersey has an excellent quality and service Chinese resturaunt in Chendu 23. Kevin the owner is very helpful in explaining the chinese dishes. They are incredibly tasty, plentyful, fresh, varied and interesting. Periodically the whole manu gets a make over so you can try many new foods. There are so many dishes to choose, American as well as Chinese authentic styles. On and off the menu options available. They make to your taste. Dim sum is terrific on weekends. I go here as often as I can, and many times take home a few days worth of food. I only wish my stomach was as big as my eyes!
