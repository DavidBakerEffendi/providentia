Hands down the best Cuban resturant in NYC. I have been coming here since I have any recollection. Great food and service. Everything on the menu is amazing, but there ropa vieja and vaca frita is the best. I recommend this place to anybody who want authentic Cuban cuisine. Rincon Criollo well not let you down.
