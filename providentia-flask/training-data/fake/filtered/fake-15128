I am gluten free and discovered this place through a gluten free network, but I have brought innumerable non-gluten free friends here and they have all loved it.  Many now regularly go for lunch or dinner without a GF companion.  As for me, this is one of my favorite restaurants of all time.  It's cute and small with great music and a fun waitstaff and the food is simply incredible.  Definitely Italian comfort food at its best.
