so i'm walking down south street on my way to go pick up a couple mixed six packs from hawthorne's when i notice a sign that reads "craft beer to go" in front of this place between the tla and copa. it's cold out, so i decide to pop my head in and warm up for a minute. a minute turns into almost two hours. here's why. first is the music. ruth brown, kitty daisy & lewis, big joe turner, otis redding, betty davis, screamin' jay hawkins. are you kidding me?!? since when does a south street spot play anything worth talking about on their house playlist? on top of that, the bartender was able to field every dated reference i threw at him. then he made me a perfect rye whiskey manhattan. then a vodka lemonade with thyme. then another bourbon drink he called "the black pearl." all three were outstanding. after chatting his ear off, i told him i was ready to pick out some beer to go. he walked me over to the beer box which housed maybe 100 different bottles, including some really hard to find large format bottles. i give this place a 5, and that's without trying any of the food, though it looks and smells fantastic. can't wait till next time.
