This my first time to the restaurant.  I heard good things about it, so I decided to stop by and give them a try.  Oh well not pleased.  Steamed fish was dry as heck which means not steamed or stewed.  I hate when I go to West Indian restaurants and they serve you whatever because they believe you don't know better.  Both of my parents are W.I. due to time I didn't cook it myself but I guess I should have.  I won't go back.  They don't share food and give you whatever
