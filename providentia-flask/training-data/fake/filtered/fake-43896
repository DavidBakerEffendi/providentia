I don't agree with any of the bad reviews! I've been to Llama Tooth twice, and it's been a marvelous experience every time. Their food is absolutely AMAZING. The eggplant fries are great. Today, I got a B4 Burger. My friends got every type of mac-and-cheese and the stuffed french toast with peanut butter. Couldn't complain at all! I love the friendly atmosphere. The owners are absolutely adorable and so funny. I enjoy the emails as well. I thought the place was so fun. Thank you so much for the great experience, Llama Tooth :)
