Love the atmosphere...owners...food and drink! Not one thing that I can say that I do not like about this place. The food is fresh and different.  Very flavorful!  They have this amazing fresh orange juice...that is not quiet orange juice.  A family secret it is so refreshing a good.  My son is obsessed!  Great decor and wifi.  The perfect place to get a bite or get some work done!
