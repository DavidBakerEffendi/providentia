First time customer and must say I'm already a fan! Â The ribs were the best we ever had, meat was so tasty and tender. The sides were delicious, coleslaw, cornbread and crawfish hush puppies The cashier and owner were also extremely pleasant. I know we will be known by first names soon since we are going to become regulars Highly recommend!!
