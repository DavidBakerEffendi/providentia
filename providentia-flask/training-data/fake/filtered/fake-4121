What a great addition to the Olde City scene. Unlike other bars/restaurants, this place has a more upscale feel. The decor is well done and the atmosphere is cozy. The hubby and I had drinks at the bar and were served by Sam. She was very friendly and helpful and even offered information for local businesses to hold a happy hour. Its refreshing to have a staff member actually seem to enjoy working, and was so attentive to making sure we came back. You could tell she wanted to make the restaurant a success. I ordered a "watermelon hooch" martini and it was absolutely amazing. My husband had the beer and moonshine shot special. He enjoyed it. My only reservation is that the prices are a little hefty ($12 martini and $10 beer/shot) If we had gone for the happy hour, they are half price (which is a deal). Overall, we definitely plan on going back and will be sure to bring others!
