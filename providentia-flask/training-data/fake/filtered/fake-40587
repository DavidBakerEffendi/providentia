Seriously, come here ONLY if you are a tourist. I have been to lombardis a few times the first time with my culinary business class and the other few with friends and each time I am disappointed . They don't believe in seasoning here so everything is bland,bland,bland. The dough,sauce,cheese,topping-bleh. The service isn't spectacular and one time I went their they placed us in the room upstairs which happens to be right over the oven and me and my friends were sweaty within 3 minutes. If your gonna seat people up there at least make it accommodating. overall, I will never waste my money in this tourist trap of a place again. so much better pizza in New York City such as Little Italy Pizza on 45th, grimaldis, artichoke.. Go there and do yourself a favor!
