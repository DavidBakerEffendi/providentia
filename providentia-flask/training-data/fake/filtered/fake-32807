I've been going here for over a year. Its my little hangout. The Arepas are amazing. I've tried most of them. The Arepa pabellon s my favorite it has a little of everything. The service is very good and fast. I love the music and the Parchita Sangria (passion fruit). For App try the mini platter it's a selection of mini's, sweet arepa w\ cheese, fried yuccas, empanadas, and Mozz stix. Not too much on the desserts Â but the Tres Leches is really good. ENJOY
