Sometimes i got lost and end up dining in another neighborhood. That is what happened last week. First time and it sure didn't disappoint in any way! Place is charming and intimate. We went for an early dinner @ 5:30 and took advantage of the prix fixe menu, available til 6:30, which included an appetizer, entree and dessert. Portions were sizable, without being too much or too little - just perfect! Service was exceptional! Our waiter, Seth was attentive without being all over us, and we never felt rushed. I had the frisee salad, (which I order every chance I can), with a light delicious dressing and the steak frites, cooked very rare, exactly as I requested. I also ordered a side of brussels sprouts, which were so tasty and cooked perfectly. My girlfriend had a salad and the duck, which was tender and tasty. For dessert, I had a fantastic apple crisp and he had a whipped banana dessert that was fabulous! Great place! Look forward to going back! It is open all day, from breakfast thru dinner. It's a gem!
