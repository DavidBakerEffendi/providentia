I write this in hopes that this restaurant can be as great as it was the first time I visited. After our first dinner at The Pines, I would have given a 5 star rating but having been back for brunch (a 2 hr. ordeal in an emptyish dining room and having been served absolutely RAW sausage) and a subsequent dinner (again, over an hour wait for RAW meat and barely cooked pasta), I have to say I will not be coming back. I do not review often but the food here was so revolting and overpriced that I will be doing everything short of screaming from the mountaintops that this place should be avoided at all costs until major changes have been made.
