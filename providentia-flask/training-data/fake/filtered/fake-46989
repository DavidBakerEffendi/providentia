danny meyer hits the mark again. all here was great. from the greeting at the front door, the sparkling lambrusco while we waited for our table, the bread, the spring veg pasta w. artichoke, fava, lemon and peas..., lamb panini, rose wine, and the price tag. the best food for the best price. it was pissing rain out and we sat, enjoyed our lunch, unfettered by the weather, left very happy.
