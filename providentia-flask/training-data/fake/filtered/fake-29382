This place is awesome.  Seriously.  The hangout me and my friends have been craving.  I've been there a few times now and it's just a cool, corner spot.  Still undiscovered, in a good way, so I'm somewhat hesitant to write this review.  Beer selection is solid (some good crafts); laid back hangout vibe with some energy (djs, great juke box).  Like cheers with edge.  Great mix and match of people.  Watched the Phillies there last night and will definitely be back or game 4 tonight!  go Phills!    Try the chicken cutlet sandwich with and ask for hot peppers!
