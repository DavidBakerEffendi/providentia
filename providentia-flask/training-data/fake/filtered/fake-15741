First Things First, I absolutely fell in LOVE with this place first going inside. Visiting this place today really was a spontaneous visit but a for sure thing that will happen occasionally! What grabbed me inside as I was about to walk past this place and head to another place next door. The black neon chalk written sign brought me in with it saying Â " Grilled chicken with rice(green salad w/ginger dressing) All for $5.95!", I immediately thought you can't beat that and I wanted to try something different, than the average grab a slice and go home. I walked inside of I Tea and the place was beautiful. I loved the chic feel but lounge type setting the restaurant displayed. They also had the culture's music playing in the background & the lighting was really pretty. First, I walked up to the counter and asked the young lady who seemed to be a young girl (whom was really nice btw) asked me what I would like. Told her this was my first time being here and I would like to try the Grilled chicken with rice(green salad w/ginger dressing), I got a egg roll on the side which was $1.25 cool in my book. After placing my order, I went to have a seat and waited approx 10 minutes for my food. Everything came out delish! They serve you as if you are in a restaurant. (Normal Chinese places I know make you come pick it up), so that was a plus! for style :)!!!! Lastly, I was satisfied with their overall customer service and couldn't have asked for better! Definitely will be going again!
