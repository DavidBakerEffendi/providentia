While I'm typically a fan of the Veggie Heaven experience, I can only give VH Montclair 2 stars. Starting w/ the service, it was less than desirable as it was lunchtime but hardly any patrons were in there (4 tops). That said, I felt rushed through my meal, before even requesting dessert. Fortunately, before I paid the bill, the manager realized it was incorrect. The waiter was unaware of what was on the menu, and questioned me more than I questioned him re: how certain articles were prepared. Although the floor was clean, the ledges and tables were not. The food was adequate at best, though it was prepared quickly and efficiently. Overall, I'd say dine at the Teaneck location for better food, service, hospitality, menu options, and no feeling of being rushed (again, when 15 tables were not being occupied and only 4 patrons were there in total having lunch--still baffling to me).
