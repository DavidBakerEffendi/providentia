So I'm from California and I found it absolutely necessary to write a review on this fantastic place. About two years ago the family and I took a trip to New York for vacation. We went to all of the tourist attractions and even ate at a few places in the "Little Italy"but nothing I have ever tried here or there compared to the food at Lombardi's. I can't speak for everything on the menu, but I can say that the pizza I ordered was heaven for my taste buds. The pizza is crispy throughout and has an artisan, good quality taste to it. The pizza is very moist and flavorful and all I cn say is that it is no ordinary pizza (I'm used to pizza hut and little caesars pizza). So for this review I am giving 5 stars for the best pizza I have ever eaten up to date. -Side note :The place has a million pictures of who I assume to be the owner and its a little weird.
