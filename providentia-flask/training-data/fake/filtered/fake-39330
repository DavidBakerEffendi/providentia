great place to eat, great food and great service, we stopped in one night, and the waitress was super friendly told us about all the specials they have,and how this place was such a nice family atmosphere, we were so amazed at the amount of food that we got for the money,we even had leftovers for the next day,their dinners are super delicious and pizza is also very good,my kids love coming in to see Martha,she is so sweet and really treats everyone so nice,if you are in town stop by there you will not be disappointed, we try to go on a Wednesday or Thursday night, so it will not be as busy as the weekend!
