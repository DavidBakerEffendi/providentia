Please, for the love of decency and cleanliness, buy some fly tape.  Do something!  You have a veritable infestation - the room was swarming with them.  Throughout the meal, flies landed on our heads and arms, on our table and food, and, worst of all, on our baby. Very disturbing.  Now we know why everyone was sitting outside.  We will not return.
