I have ordered food to be delivered from Healthy Food in Verona several times.  THEY ARE THE BEST!!!  Our favorites are the Chicken Chow Mein (plenty of chicken & cooked to perfection!), lo mein, sesame chicken & garlic chicken.     This is the freshest, best Asian food that I have ever had!  In fact, I'm tempted to order some now!  The only other comment that I would make is a suggestion that they add crab rangoon ot the menu.  That is another one of my favorite indulgences, but they do not offer this on their menu.     Oh, well...........their food is still scrumptious and never dissappoints our family or guests!
