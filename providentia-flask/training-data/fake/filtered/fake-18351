went there for a birthday dinner all was very disappointed with the quality of food. ordered: kids spaghetti/meatballs, a veal parm dinner and a chicken francaise & 3 drinks. no one at the table was happy with the meal. food was bland. the "large portions" i've heard so much about consisted of mostly overcooked pasta. and the meal cost $70.00. will not return. do not recommend.
