This one's for John O. below: If you're a Native NYer and a consumer of alcohol who dines at our city's many fine establishments, then you are familiar with the fact that a customer is "cut off" when he/she (or his/her group) has reached a level of intoxication beyond which a restaurant is not allowed to serve more alcohol. From your party's request for another round after being "cut off" it is clear that you were trying to instigate unnecessary conflict (which you admit in your post). Such behavior is typical of inebriated people and certainly not the good judgment of people who are "in control", as you want us to believe you were. It would therefore follow that Balthazar staff made the right call when cutting your party off. So it is you, in your boorish, infantile behavior, who is behaving like a naive tourist (well, actually, let's not insult the tourists, who I don't believe are known for this type of behavior either!). We Native NYers Â know better than to behave so foolishly in a fine dining establishment. Bottom line: you should be grateful that the classy Balthazar staff asked you to leave in a polite manner, and please stop giving us Native NYers a bad rep!
