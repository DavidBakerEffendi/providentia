Went here with a group of 5 last night and had a great time. I've recently gone gluten-free and couldn't find any info online showing what I'd be able to eat . While they didn't have a GF menu, the staff was wonderful with answering questions and suggesting substitutions. Since the tortilla chips for the spinach/artichoke dip are not GF, they provided cucumber slices instead. Though a bit atypical it was a DELICIOUS combination. I ordered the Sloppy Max sans bread and replaced the waffle fries with a small salad. They provided a GF citrus dressing that was wonderful and even without the bun, the BBQ pork/slaw combo was perfectly sweet and tangy. The birthday girl ordered the same meal without substitutions and loved it as well, so it's a great option even if you can enjoy your gluten. :) Of course the chocolate was delicious, I honestly don't think there was a thing any of us tried and didn't like! Can't say how busy it would be on a weekend, but the weeknight experience was great. Our only negative experiences (that keep me from giving a perfect 5 stars) were that the bathrooms seemed to be a bit unkept and toward the end of the night the service drug a bit (though our server was doing her best, other staff who could have stepped in seemed to leave her on her own with a handful of busy tables). All in all, though, a great experience, I wouldn't hesitate to go back again!
