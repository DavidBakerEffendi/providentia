Drove out from NJ to go to the perogie week event and it was SO WORTH IT!!!!  The atmosphere is rock chic with 80s nostalgic toys behind the bar and old skateboards on the ceiling.  Great indie rock, punk, classic 80s and etc.  The patrons were friendly and the staff awesome.  This place truely felt like "home"!!!!!   The perogies were the best I have had aside from my Polish grandma.  In fact she would say that they would give her recipe a run for the money.  The kraut was fabulous, the farmers cheese sweet and light, the potato is exactly the way they should be.  The dough was the perfect texture and consistency. I can see myself returning often.....I think that I might become a regular.
