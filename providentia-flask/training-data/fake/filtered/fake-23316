Me and my boyfriend wanted to go to a nice Italian restaurant but we did not feel like driving into the city so we read some good reviews and decided we would try this restaurant. When we drove here we had a hard time finding the place but eventually we did find it.At first glance the restaurant does not look very nice but once your inside you see its a very nice restaurant. The food was great I had the salmon and spinach with spaghetti and my boyfriend had the chicken parmesan for appetizer we had mozzarella sticks with fresh mozzarella cheese and i had a choclolate martini,everything was great!!!
