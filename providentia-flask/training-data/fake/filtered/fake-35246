I'm italian, I've been in USA for 3 months and never had italian food to leave deeply America. I understood american way to eat, for consequence the italian thing I miss the most is olive oil!!! Today I decided to eat italian because of this and, trust me as italian, Gaia's cook is excellent, not oily as someone wrote, americans do not have idea on how helthy and good it is! I felt soooo sad everytime I had a salad without olive oil, but just sauces!!! How can you live without??? Anyway, I had a BUBY panino made with homemade focaccia (italian speciality) and fresh tomato and mozzarella di bufala! Great delicious taste and very little price!
