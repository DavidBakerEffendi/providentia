This place has amazing fries, not matter what kind (skinny or steak) !! I usually order my lunch from here which usually consists of a specialty wrap with fries. Great thing is, its their lunch special so its about $7 for the combo plus a can of soda. Sweet deal. Tried their garlic and tomato pizza, too. AMAZING. What really prompted this review was their delivery. It is usually prompt, but they must have a new delivery guy who doesn't know much about Hoboken, so my order took longer than usual. And, when he called for directions to get here... we had the illest language barrier. Can't fault them for a poor delivery guy. Five stars it is.
