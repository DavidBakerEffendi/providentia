10/27/2013 - A remarkable day for me as I celebrated 1st birthday of my daughter (who also shares b'day with my wife)... I wanted to celebrate a lunch party @ some restaurant .. I had been to Indian hut  for few times (mostly for take outs and catering orders) and had no prior complaints with them. I always found their staff was very cooperative and the food was delicious too.. So, I choose Indian Hut again...! I do not want to waste any further moment to write this review and let people know about how happy and satisfied I am with the kind of party we had today..!! The food was exceptionally tasty.. All my guests liked the food and few of them also asked me to complement the Indian hut staff for the food, ambiance & their service arrangement.. I choose my menu from the given options and called Varun (from Indian hut staff) for couple of special food items. He is so accomodative that he agreed to serve the special request items even with just 1 day notice... Indian hut staff helped me and stretched their timings for my party hall decoration, late running lunch, and any request that I asked them on last moment... If anyone is looking for Party @ restaurant OR orders for home, I would definitely recommend  Indian Hut... I am sure you wont regret!!! Thanks Indian Hut Guys, Keep it up !
