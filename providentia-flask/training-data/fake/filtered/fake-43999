I absolutely love this bar! This bar has a great staff, great food, and fantastic prices! I've been coming here on the weekends to hang out. I love the vibe of this place and it seems to be filled with pretty friendly customers. I haven't had any issues with service. I actually normally sit at a table and am waited on almost immediately. I have been to a lot of bars around the city and I am now making this place my hang out. I have no clue why people are complaining about this place not being a dive bar. I am actually leaving my neighborhood dive bar to come here because I can't stand the dirty, gross vibe and horrible service there. I love that this place is clean! How is that a legitimate complaint?
