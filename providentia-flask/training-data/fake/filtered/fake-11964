This is one of the best places to gorge.  Grass fed beef brisket, burgers, seitan reubans, and a entire buffet of hot and cold items.  That's not to mention the desserts, from vegan to over the top dairy.  Good bottled beer and wine as well.  Quick, easy, casual, satisfying.  What more could you ask for in a diner?
