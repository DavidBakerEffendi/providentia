The sushi was not fresh and the meat was not good.  The chef was very rude and made me feel unwelcome.  For the amount of money you spend, you will be disappointed. I recommend you read all the reviews on Yelp, especially the filtered ones. Also, do online research of chef Cesar Ramirez.  The Guardian has a lengthy article describing racism by Cesar. Yelp has repeatedly deleted all of the 1 star ratings on this restaurant, including mine.  I guess Cesar paid one of those "advertising fees" to create an inflated rating.
