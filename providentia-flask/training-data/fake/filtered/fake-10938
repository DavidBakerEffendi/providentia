I grew up in Montogomery TWP but have been on the west coast for the last 30 years.  Family and I attended a Family Reunion recently and I begged my mother to take us to this place.  The pizza sucked and tasted like it was a frozen grocery store staple.  What a friggin' disappointment it was.  Two pies and they both blew the monkey.  We should have gone into Trenton but we were hungry and this place was close.  The next day I had the hershey squirts and was blowin' out farts like a 18 year old beagle.  I also had to suck down a quart of peptol bismol cuz I had a 5 alarm fire in my throat.  This place sucked!
