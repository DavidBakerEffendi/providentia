I had the luxury of going to this restaurant with a group of chef friends . I left the fate of my orderage to my companions. My culinary background aside, my experience at Boqueria was nothing short of outstanding. Everything was delectable from the wine to the last course. Even their olive oil was delightful. The only dish I found mediocre was ironically the most expensive dish on the menu, which is the half roasted chicken with figs. It was good, but nothing compared to the marriage of flavors with their lamb bacon or chorizo and quail eggs. I literally had a When Harry Met Sally moment. The atmosphere is exceptionally ambient and romantic. I would definitely recommend taking a date here as long as the person is mildly adventurous and worth your spendage.
