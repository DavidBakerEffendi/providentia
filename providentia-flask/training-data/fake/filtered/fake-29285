I am definitely a fan.  I only get a chance to go for breakfast on the weekend, when it is busy.  The atmosphere is great, it keeps me coming back for sure.   The menu is set up differently, and everything is good on it.  The selection is just a bit short.  I am a big fan of sparkling water, especially on weekend mornings, so the selection of water is a great idea on their part. I'll keep coming back until it's too busy and I'll just move on to the next place for that morning.
