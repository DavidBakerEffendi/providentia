Just started going to place last week, and have already returned there 3 times.  I'm usually go to the $5 footlong place, but this place has them beat on quality and price.   The large regular bread is absolutely delicious, especially when they lightly toast.  And the BOOM BOOM sauce is amazing, get extra of that. I haven't tried the delivery service yet, but the owner said that he'd be able to delivery anywhere in Jersey City.
