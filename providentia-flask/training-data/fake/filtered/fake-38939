I don't get this place. It's very tiny and you are basically bumping into the other table whenever you move your chair. I'm a thin guy and felt huge sitting in this obnoxious place. The food is mediocre. Nothing great. I ordered the eggs Florentine with a side salad. I found a dead ladybug in my salad. When I informed our server, she goes, "ohh. sometimes they are in the arugula." Umm. That is definitely not something you should say to a customer... Â They never sent over a manager or comp'd my meal. I just received another salad which I was inspecting the entire time for more bugs. If you want tiny portion sizes, terrible customer service, and mediocre food then this place is for you!
