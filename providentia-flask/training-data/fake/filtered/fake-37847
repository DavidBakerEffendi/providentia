Hands down the best restaurant in Montclair. We have never had a disappointing meal here. The ambiance is way better than most Montclair restaurants, as is the service -- very professional and knowledgeable. The prices are reasonable as well. You cannot go wrong with anything on the menu. Don't miss it.
