I wish I could build a home next to the Reading Terminal Market so I could eat everything this place has to offer--DAILY! The food here is delicious. I usually go there for the delicious soul food and also to purchase fresh meats from the dutch-- they have huge chunks of oxtail. Unfortunately, my first time there was on a weekday and it was so crowded I felt squished, lol. However, I do plan to go back very soon on a Monday before 11 a.m. since it's less of a crowd during that time. Shame on me for living in Philadelphia all my life and never venturing out to this place until now.
