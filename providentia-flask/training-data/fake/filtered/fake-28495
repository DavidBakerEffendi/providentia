Great Food and great drinks....BUT.... if I am hanging at your bar and ordering food and drinks and enjoying the scene and watching the games on the TV then a buy back is simple Bar Etiquette . We were were there for a good 4 hours enjoying Sunday Brunch and drinks but c'mon people I am not asking for free meals but a drink comp is common courtesy especially if my tab reaches over 100 dollars. Take my advice Station House - You get better tips when you give free drinks to people who are having a fun time and kicking it back for more then 30 minutes. You are in Queens, NOT Manhattan. Even the hipster bars in BK know the deal!!
