Dry turkey Reuben with minimal sauerkraut & dressing.  Unfriendly staff at counter.  I tried to suggest some customer service training to the manager for the young lady at the order counter; but it was not well received.   Two sandwiches and two fountain sodas $21 (no chips).  Although it is a beautiful spot, I won't go for lunch again.
