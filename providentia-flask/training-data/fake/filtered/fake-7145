'Twas recommended by a nearby business, and we were grateful.  Went there twice in two days.  The lunch salmon croquette sandwich was the best croquette I've had!  The Sunday brunch frittata was outstanding and so was the home made bisquit that came with it.  It was a pleasure to meet owner Donna Lewis who is also a chief cook.  She is a kindly force whose spirit can be found in the food.  The waiters were friendly, kindly.  My next trip to Manhattan will find me there, for sure.
