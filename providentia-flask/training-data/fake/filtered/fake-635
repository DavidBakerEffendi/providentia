I like their Brooklyn pizza , so I used go there some times for that. One day I gave them 20$ bill to get two slices of Brooklyn, got less change back. Guy in the counter with think accent said , "my friend you gave 10$ bill, I can check in camera". I said go for it. This guy was very rude and accused me, instead of saying sorry to me.  I am sure if there was an American in the counter he/she would have said sorry or It wouldn't have happened since we announce louder like "$7 out of $20", that's good practice.  After that he delayed my food purposely  for just 2 slices to worm up. After waiting for 8 mins , I noticed people who came way after me getting their slices . So went back to counter asked for my food, he got so mad, and said "My friend, you will get your food ok!, you have to wait" . I felt so insulted in front of other customers at the counter, since then decided to not go there ever.  I like their food though
