ive had better i enjoyed the food but the sushi place right around the corner is soo much better my lady was a little put off by the waiter hitting on her while we were on our date for the evening and the manager seemed to be doing nothing about it i didnt wanna draw attention to it because he seemed like a broke college kid and i really didnt want to get him in trouble
