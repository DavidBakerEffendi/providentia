Midtown. Let's face it: you're going to be paying a significant percentage more than with the rent and other expenses which comes with the location. But not with Woorijip. Mildly impoverished and starving students stick together!--and finding Woorijip is an experience which happens year after year as we spread the word long after our wallets are mildly replenished. Yes, the food is not 100% gourmet. But look around: it's always bustling. There's a somewhat generous seating area in the front and back, considering the size of the establishment, but it gets crowded especially around mealtimes. Service is quick and efficient. Huzzah for providing free water (hot and cold) and a variety of affordable options. Great place to stop after watching the movies at 34th St AMC/shopping around the area.
