To call this a 'diner' is a gross understatement. The calibur of the fare is more like that of a really great restaurant. The prices are reasonable, the service is unsurpassed (their staff is friendly and efficient), and as far as I'm concerned they make some dishes that I've never had better ANYWHERE! (Eggs Benedict, Roast Loin of Pork, Stuffed Mushroom Caps, Stuffed Filet of Sole, etc.)
