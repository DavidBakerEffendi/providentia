This is a Restaurant in identity crisis, mediocre food, and poor service.  We went there for a lunch break from work and it took 20 minutes from when we sat down for the waitress to take our order, the appetizer came out cold and it was evident all it was prefab frozen to deepfryer quality, and another 25 minutes after that to get our food so lunch took well over an hour even though there were only 4 other tables filled. The food had very little flavor and nothing was fresh.  Too many items on the menu all over the place and video games in part of the seating area below is confusing, but luckily no kids were playing them that would have made the experience even more painful. Only redemption I may see is that they look like they have allot of beer options so might be ok for late night drinks and perhaps the food may even be edible after a few beers. I would suggest saving your money and appetite for somewhere else.
