We go here regularly and have yet to be disappointed. Â If you like FRESH sushi at reasonable prices in a cool atmosphere with great music and friendly service, then this is the place for you. Just the ability to be in and out in 30 minutes (if you wish) thanks to the conveyor belt is awesome for us. I am a huge believer in the power of consistency in restaurant success and Umi has always been consistently fresh and delicious. The conveyor belt is great fun, especially for kids and has helped us to successfully introduce our picky eater to the delights of sushi. The only criticism I have is that some of the recipes on the conveyor belt are, to my mind an abomination. Stuff with chicken and bacon just isn't right. But I suppose one has to cater to the western palette for business' sake. One other note: I cannot speak to the food ordered from the menu. We only do sushi from the belt or custom sushi orders. No back kitchen stuff. Maybe that's good too, just don't know.
