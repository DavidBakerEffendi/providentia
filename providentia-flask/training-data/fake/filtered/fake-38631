I stopped in for dinner with my husband one evening, dinner was great.  I went back  with a friend for lunch a few days later, and breakfast another few days after that.  Each time was better than the next...I was never disappointed.  The food was tasty, and fresh. The presentation always appealing.  This was a dining "experience", more than just a meal.  I found my new favorite restaurant.
