I generally don't like the food truck trend and find that by the time you finish waiting in line, you might as well have had a sit down meal at a restaurant with (generally) better quality food. Pitruco Pizza is different. When I know Pitruco is near, I RUN to get a pie from this truck. And it is worth the wait. I have had the Margherita, Soppressata, and Eggplant. All very different pies, but the same level of deliciousness. The sauce is yummy, great crust, and high quality ingredients.
