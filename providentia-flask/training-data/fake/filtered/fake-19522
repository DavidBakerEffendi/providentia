I used to love this place... But last night confirmed my worst fear! That all those 1-2 star reviews, even the poor 3 star reviews, are true! Supposidly the kitchen is under new managment? Cold food, tapas sized servings for double-triple the price. But whatever the case, ECR has taken a turn for the worse... My business is going elsewhere...
