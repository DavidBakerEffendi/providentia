I was party to a disgraceful and upsetting episode at this pizza restaurant. Following a request by a customer with children for space for a stroller, the customer was told to get out of the restaurant and he cursed at the customer and his children. Several times. This episode was followed by a fist fight in which the customer was beaten about the face and eyes. The children were petrified by this violence as was I. Noteworthy, a number of other patrons left the restaurant sickened by the hostility they witnessed. I cannot recommend Mama Palma to anybody.
