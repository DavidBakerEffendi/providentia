I recently visited Baoburg for the second time just to satiate the strong urge to taste their garlic shrimp - Gambas Al Ajillo. The first time I went to eat there, I was following a vegan diet for religious reasons. My friends ordered several dishes (mostly non- vegan), and the aroma from each one of them stuck with me, especially garlic shrimps and thus I was back for my share and more. Both visits to Baoburg have been wonderful. The staff were not only friendly and warm, but also very attentive to guests' Â at every table. Even the owner, Chef Bao came to our table to check on us and asked for feedback in general. I personally enjoy trying out food at mom-and-pop shops, and one thing that is an absolute delight, as well as a surprise, is visibility to the kitchen - a surprise because kitchen is a busy place and one wouldn't like to expose that area to the guests, and delight because a clean and well managed kitchen suggests that hygiene is a priority for the staff. And Baoburg earns my applause for that!! Although the restaurant is small in area, it sure offers much more than just a table, chair, and food. The service is great, food is flavorful, presentation is classy and appetizing, ambiance is cosy, and the staff is personable. You don't much after a long day at work than just that. I would definitely recommend Baoburg to anyone and for sure I am coming back.
