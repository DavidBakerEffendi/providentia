Totto Ramen is by far the best ramen place in NYC. The ambiance is authentic and no-frills, the staff is super nice and the food is excellent. I used to live around the corner and would wait 3+ hours to come here. I've recently moved downtown next to other reputable ramen places such as Ippudo and Momofuku, and Totto's is way better. Plus, they have seasoned avocado, which is so good. The only caveat is that they no longer offer the half-boiled egg, which is one of my FAVORITE things on the menu and I wish the chef would put it back on! I would be so thrilled to have my favorite item back at my favorite ramen spot. Then, I'll still make the 40-block trek to come here. Yum!
