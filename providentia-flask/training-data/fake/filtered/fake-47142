I highly recommend this new place. First, the food is very good.  The food was probably 4.5, but they're likely still working out the kinks. Second, the atmosphere is very relaxing, fun and whimsical.   Foodwise - my boyfriend and I tried a few dishes together and loved most of them.  We started with the pickles - a great dish.  I really liked the pickled mushrooms and cauliflowers.  My boyfriend loved the cheery tomatoes.   We both loved the falafel meat balls (I think it needs extra green sauce on the side).  The hummus was also very good, however I think they should serve more pita breads with it (it was too small).   We also tried the shrimps - it was my favorite dish on the menu.  For a main course we shared the steak - it was a very good steak dish; the meat was moist and flavorful; I also liked the sweet potatoes that it came with.  Lastly, we got a free the eggplant burchetta dish - overall it was nice (additional sweetness is needed for this dish).   Atmosphere -- I loved the restrooms; very cool and different from the rest of the restaurant.  I also liked the old world charm with modern spin.
