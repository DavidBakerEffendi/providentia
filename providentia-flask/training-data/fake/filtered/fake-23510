We have visited Wild Edibles on 3rd ave. The restaurant/market is very cozy with only 7 tables and 5 bar stools. The selection of seafood is one of the best in town. Everything is fresh from variety of oysters, mussels, lobsters and various types of fish. We had Canada Cup and Wellfleet oysters, seared scallops, steamed mussels and sauteed skate. They were excellent. The staff were very knowledgeable but the service could be a bit faster. Dinner with all the foods with a bottle of South Africa Sauvignon Blanc was $132 including $15 tip.
