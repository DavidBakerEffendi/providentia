I was looking over some of the reviews about this Place and I have one question. Are we talking about the same place? The Percy Street Barbecue I was at was like being kicked in the head. I came across another review from a news paper and it was saying how great this place was. So I took my wife out to dinner to have some Texas style barbecue. Like everyone said, the people there was very friendly. We sat at a table and we got a bottle of water and they put a clamp on the table with a roll of paper towels. We both ordered the Dbl Down Combo. Ribs, Brisket, and two sides for $17 each. What the waiter gave us was what most other place call a Kids Meal. 2 Ribs, 4 slices of Brisket, and 2 - 8oz servicing ( that's a cup) of sides. That's when we both got that kicked in the head feeling. Or what I like to call " Being Food Raped"  If you People think that 2 ribs make up a Texas style meal. Then you need to step outside the box and come to the real world.   I spend $42 on two Kids Meals, got food raped and everyone there did it with a smile. And on top of that, the food wasn't any thing special. We were going to go too Jim's for a steak sandwich after we left, but getting a $36 parking ticket kind of killed the moment. To say the lease, I'll never go back to this place again.
