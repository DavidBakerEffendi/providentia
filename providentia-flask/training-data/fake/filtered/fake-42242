Wow- loved, loved dinner here on a Friday night in June. Long wait, so make a reservation if you can. Sat on the patio, which was very nice and a little more romantic than the inside seating (more candles; whole restaurant was a little hot). GREAT service, only to be topped by the EXCELLENT food. Highly recommend the spicy tuna over Japanese eggplant tempura; BBQ sliders were great; and the key lime pie was fantastic (lighter than most and oh so good). Recommend for any kind of occasion with people who love good, creative food. Depending on how hungry you are, you'll have to order a few dishes. My BF and I ordered 4 appetizers, 1 main, and 1 dessert, which was perfect for us. Â Dinner and drinks for $100 for two - definitely not an every day occasion, but a really nice treat. Enjoy!
