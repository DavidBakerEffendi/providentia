Stopped in for dinner last night. Caesar salad  that was ok at best. Curasco , Chef i could not find the meat it was drenched in yellow substance that i guess was supposed to be a sauce? It has been a while and it will take  while before i return. There are some great places opening up in the neighborhood . Take a look at your food before it leaves the kitchen and hits the table.
