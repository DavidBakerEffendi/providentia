i wanted to try this place after all of the hype and i have to say it wasn't bad. it isn't great, but totally edible. ha! the interior is gorgeous and the food is good, but the prices for the portions that you get are exorbitant!!! i guess their overhead is outrageous. the service i have to say was great. The night i went the ac had broken a and it was on a day that new york had a heat advisory and the wait staff was extremely upbeat and so dotting. i won't go back because of the price, but definitely worth it just to try.
