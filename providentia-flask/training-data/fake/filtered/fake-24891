We just stopped into Max's for happy hour, which we frequently do with our 10 year old son and were told children are not allowed to sit at a table in the bar area!!  When I explained we have done this many times in the past, the waiter assured me it has been policy since January.  Really???  I have been there with my husband and son since then and were not treated as though we were bad parents for entertaining the idea of enjoying light fare on a Sunday evening as a family.  The law in CT. does allow children in the bar area of any establishment, as long as you sit at a table and food is served.  Hmm...I wonder if this has something to do with the $5 drink minimum??  I used to be a big fan of The Max chain....not so much anyone!!   J.
