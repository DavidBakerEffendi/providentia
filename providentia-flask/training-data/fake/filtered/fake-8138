Went to Yuca bar this past Sunday for drinks with old friends that I haven't seen in years. Unfortunately, our experience sucked at this restaurant. The food was AWESOME. The service was the worst ever in New York. When I arrived we were told we could not have out door seating because it was only for costumers who were going to order food. Even though we did end up ordering food, we originally thought maybe just drinks. Anyway we were seated right away, but no waiter could be found for over 30mins! We had to ask a bus boy for a waiter. She took our drink orders and left. I ordered Â water and a mojito made with sprite. The mojitos were not made with sprite and she never gave our table water. We once again never saw her till after we were half way done with our food. Our drinks were empty and she didn't even ask us if we wanted to order any more. We then didn't see her for another half hour and had to ask for our check. HORRIBLE SERVICE, wont go again, might order out the espresso ribs tho.... maybe.
