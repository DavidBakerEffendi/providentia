First off, after trying every Venezuelan restaurant in the city, Guayoyo is the one that left an imprint on my stomach for the better! My boyfriend is Venezuelan and he says this is the closest to his native traditional food. The arepas are fluffy with just the right amount of crunch, the cheese cachapas are PERFECT and the sangria is STRONG! Our typical meal consists of tequenos (cheese sticks), a reina pepiada (chicken & avocado arepa), a playera (fried fish with chipotle cream sauce arepa), and 1/2 carafe of sangria...about $40 for two people. Every since we tried it, we've been back 8 times with larger groups and EVERYTIME it was awesome. I have absolutely no complaints. The service is fine, as the waiters do not bother you by coming 15x, the music is classic Salsa that isn't too loud, and it can get a bit crowded, but honestly its worth the wait! Also, great for a romantic date! BTW, Carmen, the owner, is such a sweet woman and always gives us a hug and kiss when we arrive! Truly one of our favorite restaurants!
