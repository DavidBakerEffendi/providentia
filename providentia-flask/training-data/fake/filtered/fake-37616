POO POO  would be more accurate.  Let me start by saying the food was very good and the service was not bad, but I don't liked being rushed...especially when I travel 100 miles to meet with friends, and that's exactly what happened.  Once the check was paid the staff cleared the table AND set down new cloth, asking us to raise our still full glasses!  This is UNACCEPTABLE!!!  When we complained, a man who identified himself as the manager (even though he was wearing chef garb) told us that people were waiting for the table. In retrospect, what I should have done is spilled the small amount of sangria left in my glass which would have forced them to re-set the table.   The right thing would have been to ask us to move to the bar and offer to refill our glasses.     I WILL NOT RETURN TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT.
