The atmosphere here is what really draws you in from the street. The charm and personality of the place is relaxing, and you are able to sit and not be bothered for quite a while. However if you're the kind of customer that likes the waiter/tress to smother you with service, you won't find it here. The wait-staff is polite, and the company isn't rowdy or rude, like many of the midtown places. The food looks and smells delicious, however the fruit crepe that I had was a little doughy and undercooked and there wasn't much separation between crepe and filling. But don't get me wrong, it's definitely on my good list!
