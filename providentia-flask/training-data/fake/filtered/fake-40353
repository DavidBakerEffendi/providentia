went to eat there on a recommendation however the food was "eh" but the service was AWFUL! i wanted to feed my 2 young children chicken with broccoli with the sauce on the side, the waiter laughed at me for making such a request.  every other request was handled in the same manner- extremely rude! we were given our food and we asked for plates to put the food in.  we had to wait 10 minutes for plates.  the waiter responded with "well, you need to give us time to get the plates".  really? it's empty plates. and the last thing- no where on the menu does it say that parties of 6 or more are charged a 20% tip.  we got the bill with a 20% tip added. needless to say- we won't be going back there and i hope you don't either!
