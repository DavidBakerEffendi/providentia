Just plainly delicious. The food here is so good and service is top notch. Nothing is spectacular, down to the decor. Everything here is very reliable and consistent. Never had a bad meal or a problem at the ODEON. The bartenders are unbelievably sweet and understanding. I LOVE THIS PLACE! Brunch is the best meal by far. Great place to go stargazing as well. Every visit is a huge success.
