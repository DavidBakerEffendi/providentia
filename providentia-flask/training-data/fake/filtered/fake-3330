We are students at Drexel Law, and Savas has become a staple in our diet. We usually get the buffalo chicken pizza, which is exceptional. The take-out pizza is quick, cheap, and good, which is why so many Drexel students go there. The sit-down dining is very good as well, with an impressive menu catering to many different tastes. I have tried the gyro, which is pretty good (but light on the Tzatziki sauce), and the fries, which come in a very large portion and are good and crunchy. Jess had the chicken quesadilla, which was good, but nothing special. She is a big fan of the Nutella french toast, omelets, and bloody Mary's though. While we do not sit down and eat at Savas often, we will continue to be patrons of the take-out pizza and beer for the foreseeable future.
