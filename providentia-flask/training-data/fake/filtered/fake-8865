One word: YUM. I have been to The Gander now twice; once for dinner, once for brunch. Both experiences were fantastic.  As a pregnant woman, food is very important to me right now (well, it always is, but especially if I can't be enjoying my libations along with it), and I was beyond pleased with our selections.  I had the duck breast for dinner. Incredible. Flawless presentation. My friend had the branzino and it was so pretty it was almost a shame to devour it (which certainly happened). My entire party shared all the dishes and everyone was fantastic.  Now to save the best for last: the burger. PLEASE do yourself a favor and find your way to The Gander for brunch or lunch and get the burger. Best burger I've ever had. No joke. Perfect meat/bun distribution, perfect seasoning.  In fact, after that delicious meal, I went home to put my feet up (because why the hell not), and my baby girl kicked for the first time! Enough said, right? Oh, and the bread basket was insane, too.  I think I ate 7/8ths of it, leaving very basically nothing for everyone else. Oops. Even my friend's baby was served the best scrambled eggs I've had in years, how wrong to waste such deliciousness on an 18 month old :) Not to add this as an afterthought, (I just get hung up on food lately), but the service was great and the ambiance is lovely. Bottom line: run, do not walk, to The Gander.  It's an experience you won't regret.
