I like to think of myself as a pizza connoisseur. Everywhere I go, I taste the pizza- I have had pizza in the Northeast, Southeast, and Western US; Quebec, France, England, Scotland, Hungary, and the list goes on. To date, I only count around five places as truly "great" pizza, and only another ten or so as "very good". PEPE'S IS ONE OF MY TWO TOP PIZZERIAS! For those of you who don't know much about its history, it is the second(?) oldest pizzeria in the US, and the oldest family owned. Pizza Â began in Italy as a way to test ovens. The dough would be put into the newly heated (and thus VERY hot) oven, and topped with whatever the peasants had on hand. In time, mozzarella, simple tomato paste, and basil became the most common toppings. Peasants used coal fired brick ovens, which made he temperature VERY high, and the crust almost burnt. Pepe's is the first true American Pizza- the crust is the same as in Italy, but the sauce is more savory. Although it is still very simple, it has more garlic than the sauce in Italy. Only the best mozzarella is used, but they also use other cheeses, which is distinctly American. This place is an American landmark- don't listen to people who say go to Sally's- I have been there a number of times, and I got sick! Also, please disregard people who say the service is bad- Pepe's is incredibly busy- the people are very nice. Hope I could be helpful!
