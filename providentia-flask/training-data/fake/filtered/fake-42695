This is possibly the worst restaurant in the Upper Valley. I have ordered several times for delivery from this restaurant and they have gotten it wrong nearly every time. Two of the most recent episodes include going into the restaurant to order and having them lose my order (a simple Buffalo Chicken Salad) and today I ordered there and they sent my order out after an hour and a half. I ordered the Black and Blue Burger as is- they claimed to have remade it because I allegedly ordered it without gorgonzola cheese ( I did not order w/o anything). The burger arrived after being remade with wilting lettuce, and soggy onion rings. My home is less than a 10 minute drive from the restaurant by car even with traffic - this tells me they made my order wrong to begin with and than claimed I had ordered no gorgonzola and they had to remake it- and it sat in the back of the delivery drivers car for half an hour. This is like the 10th time they have screwed up one of my orders.  This after they charge a 3 dollar delivery fee (more than$1 more than any other place that delivers in the entire Upper Valley) ,Another critical complaint is that when you order online more than  half of the menu is unavailable on their online website. This is the worse pizza and burgers in the Upper Valley and I would just recommend going to McDonalds- they will be less likely to get your order wrongt
