Just based on experience alone - we showed up at lucali at around six on a Saturday night. The restaurant was full, but only one other person was waiting outside. The hostess told us, with attitude, that the next table wouldn't be ready until 9:30 - three and a half hours later. Are you serious? Am I missing something here? Needless to say we didn't stay.
