I paid a visit to Vonda's Kitchen on Saturday the 15th with some friends of mine.  In a word DELICIOUS!!  Vonda and her staff did not disappoint.  If you are in Newark, NJ looking for a good meal don't forget Vonda's Kitchen.i came four hours down the road to partake in the experience of Vonda's Kitchen.  I will definitely be back.
