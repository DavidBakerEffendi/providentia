Daisiwa is poor man's sushi restaurant. That about sums it up. My partner and I used to frequent this place until we started seeing frozen tuna and salmon boxes in their trash. I read Carolyn's review about the owners driving to NYC to ensure freshness. This is a bold face lie. The miserable owner is unfortunately there EVERYDAY. He is often rude and is always smoking outside. If you're looking for sushi, go to Umai Umai. The price point is a bit higher but you're not going to be flirting with getting a food borne illness.
