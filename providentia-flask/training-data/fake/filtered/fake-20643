On my third trip to Minetta Tavern, I finally got the highly coveted Black Label Burger.  It was good.  No all caps or anything though - I was surprised by how tiny it was.  Probably won't get it again, but I definitely will be coming back for other dishes. For some reason we had around 4 different waiters during our meal.  It was kind of confusing, but we were glad because the first one was a huge "B-word".  The other two or three were pretty nice, notably one man who was extremely excited about every dish we ordered, to the point of us having to stifle our laughter until he was out of earshot. I have also come to Minetta to drink and nibble at the bar with a girlfriend on the occasional week night.  Bartenders are very nice. Over all, I love the decor and the scene, the food is pretty good, and the service is above average.
