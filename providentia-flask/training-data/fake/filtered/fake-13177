The wait for a table was ridiculous. Told us 15mins, we waited almost an hr. Very unorganized.  Sat down at the table, took our drinks order, brought one drink out and we waited 10 mins for the other.  Ordered appetizers, vegetable dumplings and boneless ribs, these were ok but not great.  Placed our order for main meals crispy duck and heavenly chicken.  Duck tasted ok, But not crispy.  Waited 20 mins for the second entree to come out as they forgot to put that order in.  Chicken wasn't very heavenly.  Not sure why others review it as favorable but this place is avg at best.  Go to Chinatown in NYC. Get real Chinese food. Not this Jersey crap they try to pass off as "authentic"  what bs lol.
