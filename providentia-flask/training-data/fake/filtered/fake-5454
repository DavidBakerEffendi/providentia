Gave the place another try but seriously the staff has the personality of their fried pickles which suck btw, not once have i gotten a welcome back or a buy back......this place is a haven for poser hipsters who moved to Astoria from like Ohio or some shit....do us all a Â favor, shave your mustaches and beards and move to Williamsburg.
