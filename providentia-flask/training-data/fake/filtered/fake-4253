Everything I had was delicious. As a southern transplant to central New Jersey, the cuisine brings me back to living in Charleston and enjoying the flavors that only an expertly trained chef in the low country can create.  Must try's are the she crab soup and the fried chicken with black bean cake appetizer.  We will be back to visit soon!
