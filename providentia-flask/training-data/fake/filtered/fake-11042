Definitely my favorite chicken and rice cart in the city.   I constantly crave it now that I'm not in the city anymore.  I remember my college days, where we would take a cab 40 blocks north to get chicken and rice at 2am and cab it back just to fulfill our craving.  The combination of the pita, the rice, the white sauce, the hot sauce just can't be beat. I love that I can get this practically any time of day - so consistent and reliable.
