I've been to Kelly's a few times, always a good place to drink and hang out with friends.  It's a great place for events.   For example, Kelly's is hosting an 8minutedating event on 11/28 @ 7pm.  The speed dating event will be in the main dining area, right by the fireplace.  Free apps for all attendees, and signup has already started: 8minutedating.com/signup….
