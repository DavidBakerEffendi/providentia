Sarcone's is the best hoagie shop in Philly! Sarcone's is great because they make their own bread at their bakery two doors down, everything is made to order, and they get it right every time. They also make a mean Old-Fashioned Gourmet Italian Hoagie complete with some extra extra sharp provolone. Sarcone's has some top quality meats, cheeses and veggies on their sandwiches and everything I've had has always been really fresh. They also carry some DiBruno Bros. products as well, but they sell out quite a bit as expected. I get from Sarcone's as part of our Sunday football game watching tradition, so I always call ahead at least an hour before I'd like to pick it up. These sandwiches are the truth.
