After our search for authentic Turkish food all over the U.S. This is one of the best restaurants. The Kebabs here are even better than most of the ones in Turkey. Â We stayed for 1 Week in NY and this was the only place we would eat at. It is a small place with a few tables, but friendly service, awesome staff & cook, and amazing food. I highly recommend this restaurant especially if you are Turkish. It is very hard to find authentic Turkish food in the U.S. The prices are really good as well. As a Adana kebab lover I highly recommend for real Turkish kebab lovers.
