While reading all the other comments of the reviews i personally don't agree with anyone who commented on here.I love the food they have here because there crab legs are always what I'm looking for when it comes to buffets. The chocolate fondue was amazing because my kids love it and they even have a cotton candy machine. There stake was well cooked and delicious for me.I hope i can come here again with my family since its a 2 hour ride away from my home.
