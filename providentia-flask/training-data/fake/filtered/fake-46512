the day I leave new york, i will know the thing I will miss the most is this food cart. MIxed chicken/lamb over rice. If you don't feel like gorging, get the gyro. It's so good. The hot sauce is actually pretty hot, so try it before you squirt it everywhere. Also, there are 2 carts with the same name. They operate under the same owner and they're across the street from each other. I have eaten at both. They're the same. Don't wait in the long line like an idiot.
