went for brunch. food was awesome. coffee was so good. service was a little slow (but at brunch w. friends so we were able to catch up an hang).... plus the server knocked a few buck off the bill. Â sweet. also, going back for their homemade chocolates (which the owner makes from imported venezualan cocoa)
