We had dinner there three years ago- and it was a thoroughly enjoyable group experience, right down to the desserts.  If I lived in the area, I would probably be a regular customer. And to reveal something about the character of the place, I produced a low-budget movie (feature length) and the owners of Fedora's were incredibly generous in allowing us to use it as a location.  I would say that extends to that whole run of businesses there in Lawrenceville near Fedora's.  Very friendly, very nice to dine and shop.
