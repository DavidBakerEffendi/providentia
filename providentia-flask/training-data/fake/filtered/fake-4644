Absolutely wonderful food, plus the chefs are surprisingly artistic in their presentation.  I read one review that said the fish wasn't fresh, and I can only thik they're reviewing the wrong restaurant.  We've gone here at least 4-5 times, and I find it remarkable how fresh the fish is. Great place for singles, families, groups.  I go there with my husband, brother and sister-in-law regularly and have never had a dish that wasn't delicious.  They don't have a liquor license, so we bring our own bottles of saki, and the waitstaff are more than happy to heat and serve.  This helps keep the check very low, which is also very attractive (but I always tip at least 20-25% because the servers who are heating/serving my saki shouldn't get stiffed on gratuity of the liquor). Luv it, can't wait to go back...maybe tonight!
