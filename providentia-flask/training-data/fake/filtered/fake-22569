Rude service. The white blond guy that sits people is a bit weird and not very professional. I ve been there several times and always gives me a difficult time. Even if there are empty places he makes me/us wait without a reason. Last time he told me there was 45 minutes waiting, however the couple behind me was told that the waiting time was only 20 minutes... But the Udon is great, so I keep going :)
