Dining at Amada is a heart attack waiting to happen. If the overly salted food didn't raise your blood pressure the poorly trained serve staff surely would. Every item served was covered in salt. When we notified a server, he said someone would come to speak with us about it. No one ever came. Meanwhile, our waitress avoided our table for most of the two hours we were there. We waited patiently for the check then finally asked for the manager. After our experience thus far, the nonchalant attitude of the manager was not surprising. While he admitted that the server did inform him of the salt complaint he didn't think it warranted his attention at our table. If you wish to enjoy a pleasant dining experience, we suggest going elsewhere.
