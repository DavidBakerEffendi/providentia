I finally got to make my first visit here today. I was not disappointed. I ordered a Cheddar Dill bagel with plain cream cheese, so as not to overwhelm the bagel flavor. Oh my gosh, it was so good it didn't need cream cheese. Cheddar Dill bagels are hard to find, and even harder to find them this delicious. It was chewy, yet soft from the cheddar, with bits of sharpness from the cheese; I had it toasted to give it some crunch, and there was a hint of sweetness from the malt in the dough. No doubt that this was a fresh bagel. I also purchased a brownie because it simply beckoned to me from the display case, and it tasted even better than it looked. No box-mix baking here, no sir. The decor was warm and well-lit. I can't wait to come back and try a breakfast sandwich.
