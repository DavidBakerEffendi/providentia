This place has the worst service ever. It does not even deserve a star. The waiters were unattentive. It came out to $70 for a hookah. The Saturday night manager was offensive and rude. He told us to never come back when we tried to make sense of the check... I've been in the restaurant business and that is something a manager should never do..ever. Go to Rutherford and try that hookah spot. It's much more chill and the service is far better.
