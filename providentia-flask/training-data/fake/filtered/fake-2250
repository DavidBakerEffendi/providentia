This review is for dinner. I really liked the biscuits instead of bread. There was no wait for dinner for 2 at 9pm on a Saturday. I like that they offer pancakes and an omelet all day (although I didn't order either). I got the crab cakes dinner which was good but nothing to write home about (and not worth $21). My friend got the shrimp which looked better... Â The restaurant itself is cute, it kind of feels like a diner. I can see why it's such a popular brunch spot. However, I thought it was a little pricey for what it is. I would have given Clinton St. a 3.5 if that was an option... I'll be back for brunch, probably not for dinner.
