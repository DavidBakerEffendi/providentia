I think this is my first ever yelp review.  Purbird is a great addition to the neighborhood.  Quality ingredients, fast service and very reasonably priced.  It's a favorite for all my out of town friends visiting as a go to delivery spot.   My favorite is the spicy half grilled chicken and the jalepano mashed.  Both excellent and huge portions.  I can usually get two meals out it.
