I recently was let in for the soft opening of Jacob's Pickles. I wasn't expecting great food but what I got was outstanding. I ordered the fried chicken bacon egg and cheese. It was amazing, filled with so much flavor that will excite your taste buds. They also have great drinks and so many beers to choose from. The pickles were great and homemade. If you want a drink with no alcohol, I recommend the lemonade. Its homemade and its the perfect fusion of sweet and sour. The service was excellent, which I was surprised by because it was a soft opening. The restaurant looked great. I loved how they blended in the white paint smudges on the walls. It looks very vintage and it is very eye pleasing. I will definitely be here again and I see this being a great success on the UWS!
