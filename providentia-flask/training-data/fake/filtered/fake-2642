Everything that I've ordered here has been exceptionally delicious. I'm giving Kobeyaki five stars not because it's The French Laundry (it isn't trying to be) but because it fulfills its promise of being a high-quality but inexpensive, fast, and pleasant place to grab a bite. The food is absolutely packed with flavor and creativity! I had the salad last night--really outstanding miso dressing, perfectly ripe avocado, pops of edamame. I also love that there are freebie dipping sauces--like spicy mayo--that most places charge extra for. I'm so glad to see that there's a new location in Midtown--I wish there were Kobeyakis everywhere. Even though I have lived in NYC for 6 years and have enjoyed some amazing dining, this is the first Yelp review I've ever written. I'm writing because I love this place and want to see it succeed and expand. Kudos to the owners for the great job you are doing!
