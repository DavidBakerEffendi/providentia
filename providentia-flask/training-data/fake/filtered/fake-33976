The short line took over an hour to get through. The service is so slow. What are they thinking! After having eaten at Pepe's many times we gave Sally's a try. We were so disappointed! A very unpleasant experience compared to Pepe's. A ridiculous wait once we ordered. No chance to get a second beer as the waiter has no interest in coming to your table. Â The restroom is dirty and trust me, given the wait you are likely to visit it. The pizza is good. The overall experience is bad!
