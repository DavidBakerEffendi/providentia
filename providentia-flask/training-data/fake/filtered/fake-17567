So I was really looking forward to heading back to Jane because I had such a great experience there for dinner.  I made brunch reservations for 4 at 1:45.  We arrived early, checked in with the hostess, and waited outside because the weather was unseasonably beautiful.  We checked in with the hostess again at 2 and she said they were running behind. Well, we kept waiting and the next time I looked at my watch, it was 2:15.  Now when putting forth the effort to make reservations, one expects to be seated in a timely manner - maybe wait 5, 10 minutes, tops. Well, when these hostesses were asked the 3rd time when we'd be seated, they replied rudely, never apologized once, and kept saying "10 more minutes".  Also, when they came outside to call names you could barely hear them and they gave no real effort in finding the people they were calling.  Utterly disappointed and won't likely return - not for brunch anyway. We ended up leaving and going to Dos Caminos for brunch, which is kitty corner. Highly recommend this place, especially if you're waiting forever at Jane!
