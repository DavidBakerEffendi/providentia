Ordered delivery for the first time. Grilled lamb chops for $25. Arrived cold and only 3 very small chops with a handful of cold fries tossed in and a side of marinated salad. Supposed to come with grilled tomatoes and onions and chopped salad. Not at all what I expected and completely unsatisfying and disappointing.
