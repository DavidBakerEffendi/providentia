On grand there is a great spot for french cuisine. you can argue over its authenticity over dinner but you'll probably be just scarfing the food down because it is good. the dishes are tasty, lots of butter and flavor. the service was the best part of the experience - wine is not expensive. Worth trekking from the island to visit (worth the detour.. how they say in the michelin guide book?) because of the value! My server was a older but a real funny, kind woman. I will be coming back just for her. I loved it :-)
