Quaint is hugely overrated by Yelpers.  I live in the neighborhood and have eaten there at least four or five times...for brunch as well as dinner.  The ambiance must be driving a lot of the praise insofar as it's hip, faux-Manhattan bistro-ish.  But he food is completely average and unexceptional.  And the service is just about as indifferent and self-absorbed as anything I've ever seen.  For instance, I sat at the bar on my most recent visit waiting for the bartender to finish his extended discussions with the other staff to get my entree from the warming rack.  By the time it arrived, it was so lukewarm as to be almost inedible. Don't think I'll be going back anytime soon.
