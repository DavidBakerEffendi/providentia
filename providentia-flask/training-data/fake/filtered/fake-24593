Pshhhh.... Soup dumplings plus 100 other delicious choices in one of the dirtiest restaurants I've ever been to while sitting with a bunch of strangers- yes please. Soup dumplings are a must here.  Also the pan fried noodles, scallion pancakes and crispy beef are all necessary too.  But I could go in eat only soup dumplings and have a few tsingtaos and be completely satisfied as well. Be prepared for a long wait almost anytime you go but believe me, the experience and food is well worth the wait
