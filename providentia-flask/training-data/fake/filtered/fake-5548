We had friends from Spain visiting NY and my husband and I have heard about Tavola through a dear friend. We thought it could be a true New Yorker experience to take our friends from overseas to this restaurant, especially with the history that it holds. When you walk in, you have the feeling of an old school grosseria converted into a restaurant. You can tell that every single detail has been thought and it takes you back to at least 50 years in time. A true New York, Italian experience. The food is amazing, the brick oven pizza especially is one of my favorites, one of the best I've had in NYC so far...you can eat as much as you want and you won't feel heavy at all. As we walked in, the staff, very friendly and the owner Nick, were there to greet us, we felt like we were at home. I started of with a Presecco...delicious. One of the specials that night was lobster ravioli, all hand made with a light cream sauce....we were definitely lucky. The menu fits all palates and suits even vegetarians. Â They offered us gluten free pasta, since my husband can't eat gluten and that was a great choice. The service overall is great. They let you enjoy and savoir your food yet, they are very attentive if you need anything. The prices are absolutely reasonable and the atmosphere is fun and inviting. I LOVED LOVED LOVED the Tavola experience and now I don't have to have the excuse of having friends from overseas....we are definitely going to visit more frequently. Amazing experience!! Thank you everyone at Tavola!
