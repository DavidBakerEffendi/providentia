Ippudo in Greenwhich stands out for its famous Ramen Noodles and traditional japanese cuisine. I tried their shishitos, Chicken and Pork Buns, service is good and you're always greeted with a loud welcome and since its always busy its worth the wait for what you spend to eat. The atmosphere is enjoyable, the traditional Japanese design is great. Chef Masashi delivers the quality you would want from Â a Japanese restaurant. Overall i enjoyed it, it does get full so if waiting in line isn't your choice then move along, but its worth the wait. "Irasshaimase!" everyone
