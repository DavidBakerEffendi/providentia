This is an update after our visit on 10/19. I went on and sent a message to the restaurant after writing my review here because I wanted the management to know Â how I felt about what i got for my meal and was very upset that they did not respond to my e-mail. I thought I would at least get an answer back, but nothing, no sorry for your experience, is there anything we can do to make it up to you. NO ANSWER AT ALL. I don't think they care. I hope anyone who reads this has a better meal than I got. I will not be returning anytime soon.
