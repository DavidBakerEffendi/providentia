Although the weather outside was very winterish, but you felt cozy inside. the services was terrific in general. the waitresses were courteous and the manager greeted us when we first walked in the door. the entire ambiance was just perfect for a valentines day evening dinner, especially when the harpist started her romantic music. the food were all prepared in a very exquisite way. my entry was the salmon, that was the best salmon I ever had in a restaurant. the chocolate cake was also the best in its kind. My wife and I really enjoyed the entire experience. we would definitely be going back there in the future and would highly recommend to our friends and whoever who like to have a nice dinner in a special place."
