I ate here last Saturday with my family of four. We made an impromptu reservation for 10PM and were given a nice table around 9:55PM. The food was great. Among our favorite dishes were the octopus salad (appetizer) and the suckling pig (entree shared amongst the four of us). Our only complaint would be in regards to the service. Two times we were given our shared appetizers and shared sides without serving spoons; the waitstaff was a bit hard to reach when we needed something.
