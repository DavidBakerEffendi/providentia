I absolutely love this place. I work nights at the hospital and I literally starve myself all night so I can enjoy every single bite of chicken and waffle that place has to offer.   The waffles are big, fluffy and tosted in all the right places.  The chicken is crunchy but never greasy.  Its all perfect.  And the corn bread is to die for (hence I don't even like corn bread)   I take everyone who visit me to this place. It a must do.
