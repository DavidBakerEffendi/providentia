Stopped in for lunch on a Tuesday around 130. We started with 6 blue point and 6 noank oysters. Both were delicious large oysters but the noank had a bit too much natural saltiness to them. Between 3 of us there were two salads and my whole bellied clams. Each dish was tasty but not worth the 15-20 price tag. Overall it was a good experience although one easily outdone for less money.
