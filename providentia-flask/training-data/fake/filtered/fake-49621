A great place to get a quick bite.  Love the extra level of service (they bus your tables but no tip necessary).  Food is fresh and an excellent value.  Just make sure to specify how you want something because they can customize dishes however you want them (no tomatoes, extra broccoli etc.).  I've been in many times and they are mostly very consistent with the quality and I know if there is anything wrong with a dish or you simply don't enjoy the flavor profile (too spicy) they are more than happy to make it right.  I now travel through Bishops Corner to get to the mall or highway just so I can visit Noodles!
