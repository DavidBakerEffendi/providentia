Lombardi's was once my favorite pizza joint in all of NYC. The century-old coal-fired ovens imparted this great, smoky taste to the crust; sauce and cheese was always first rate and the marriage of the three elements, divine. Â  I recently returned and was met by hosts with earpieces chatting with wait staff and managers (!!!!!!), a doubling of the dining room and tourists, tourists, tourists. Going mass has taken it's toll. Something amiss with the pizza. It's still good but just not great anymore. Breaks the heart.
