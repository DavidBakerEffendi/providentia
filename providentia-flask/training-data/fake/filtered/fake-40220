I understand that some customers have become frustrated with difara's I have put over 300 hundred thousand. Miles  since 1980 visting this pizzeria on all of my cars i i  i have been a customer since 1969 there is no pizzeria that would dare to use Italy's best ingredients  they all have a gimmick the sugar in the sauce special breadcrumbs the coal oven the wood burning expensive ovens give me a break the best pie is in Brooklyn his name is Mr.Demarco Double 00 flour San marazano tomato d.o.p not California Israeli Basile fillipo diberrio oil parmaggiano reggiano he uses his original oven and cooks the pie at 750 degrees The sweet old guy humbly serves his guests  when the day comes his memory will be forever eched in my mind. Thank you my friend for serving us the pizza you make with god's hands
