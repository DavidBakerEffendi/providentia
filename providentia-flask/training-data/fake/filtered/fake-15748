Everything Pizza - total BS. For the most expensive pizza in the menu, I was expecting something more than broccoli rabe, plum tomatoes, mushrooms and black olives. I hoped there will be some meat on it, not a chance. Pizza has been inspected before I paid and left the place. I guess $21.50 for a veggie pizza it's a great deal... for vegetarian. ps. Menu doesn't state what's on the pie.
