I decided to dine here with my fiancé after reading all these great reviews and I must say I was very disappointed.  We were seated and our server I think his name was George was a bit uninterested in answering our questions with certain dishes. We ordered the octopus which is one of my favorites. But unlike other places it was way overlooked. The Nerai chips were oily and bland. I ordered the Rib eye medium rare and it came out well done. You think for the money your paying it would be cooked right. My fiancé ordered the dorado and it was def not as fresh as I've had in my past. Anyway I'm not gonna go on and on but I'm a nyc resident for 20 yrs and have dined at some of the best Greek restaurants and lets just say this is by far not even close. It seems to me as if people who are reviewing this place have somewhat of a connection to this place or they're just dreaming. Sorry Nerai but I was disappointed. I wouldn't come back
