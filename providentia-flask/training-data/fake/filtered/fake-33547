Came here twice and has already become one of my favorite neighborhood spots. I can talk about atmosphere/food/price, but I don't think that would be necessary since most of the previous reviews already mention how fantastic the setting is, how incredible/consistent the food and drinks are, and how affordable this place is. Don't get me wrong, the atmosphere/food/price were ALL fantastic, but for me, the impeccable and personable service make this place so great. Isabel was there both times when I visited and greeted me with my name and a great smile the second time I came. She was genuinely glad to see me, and even brought up some of the stuff that we had talked about during my first visit! Isabel instantly made me feel welcome and comfortable. Sam (or Sammy?) who was one of the bartenders the first night I visited is also welcoming, attentive, and HARDWORKING--the bar wasn't even that busy that night, but instead of standing around and not doing anything like I usually see bartenders doing at other places, she was engaging with other customers and keeping busy. Also, her beer pouring skills are spot on haha :) Lastly, on our second visit, Quin was our waiter and he was extremely attentive and absolutely phenomenal. He was articulate and extremely well-versed in explaining all the beer options and how they each taste to my friend who couldn't decide. When I couldn't decide what sauce I could dip my fries in, he brought out three samples for me to try without me even asking for them. Our food arrived on time, our plates were taken away on time, and our check was given to us on time. We were asked twice (when we started the meal, and midway during the meal) if everything was okay. My friend and I felt as though we were really taken care of, but not hovered over. It's great when you instantly connect with the staff--it just makes the whole entire dining experience x10 better!
