What Was Awesome: - The food was certainly tasty! Small portions, but hey, it's tapas. Just about everything on the menu was delicious. What Sucked: - Only cash + American Express accepted - (like most tapas) really small portions for a lot of money. If you are a guy like me I suggest eating beforehand if you don't want to go broke - No pitchers of Sangria, only small individual cups for a lot of money - Mandatory 20% tip with a group of 6 or more, and when we paid they didn't give us change on the cash, and just assumed the overage was tip beyond what we paid. When we asked for the extra money back they said they'd bring it out but didn't. - They asked us to leave as soon as we'd paid. We spent $560 on dinner for 10 people, and we don't get to hang out for a little while after eating? Overall: If you've got money to burn go for it, but I'd probably save it for a nicer tapas place.
