We have gone to Canoe over the last five years but today we were truly disappointed.  I order the crab cakes and they were hardly worth it.  Each of the two crab cakes were about the size of a 50 cent piece.  The rest of plate was filled with marginal cole slaw and undressed greens.  Charge me more and give me a reasonable serving.  We also had the arugla salad with strawberries.  The dressing was heavy and sweet.   It will be a while, if ever, we dine at Canoe again. Very disappointed
