I've been a customer of the Great Wazu for many years now because of their delicious sandwiches and quick service.  I recently tried their chicken salad w/ walnuts and cranberries and it was out of this world.  By far, the best I've ever had.  They run specials if you follow them on Facebook or Twitter, which sometimes lowers the prices of the somewhat pricey sandwiches.  But in the end, whatever the price, they're most definitely worth it!  Love it!
