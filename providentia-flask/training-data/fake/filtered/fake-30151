Mezcal is probably the best Mexican food you can find in New Haven!  It's true that if you go during a really busy time, the service can be slow and I've occasionally had a meal that wasn't searing hot when it got to the table.  But I find on the majority of my visits that the food is delicious and the drinks are strong!  As others have mentioned, they don't take reservations so avoid the peak times or be prepared for a bit of a wait.
