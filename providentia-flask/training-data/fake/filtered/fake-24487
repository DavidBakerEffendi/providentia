Not recommended. Went there on Chinese New Year Eve. The service was really bad. no reservation accepted, were asked to wait outside, and no seating before everybody arrives, even we told them that we could order right after seated. NO sense of customer service and lack flexibity at all. I will never come back again, and next time will try Shanghai Cafe instead, heard they have even better Xiao Long Bao!!!
