Well, I am disappointed again and I think this will be my last time ever visiting Temple Grill Restaurant. I went out to dinner there tonight with my good friend and we had possibly some of the worst service we ever had. Our server's name was Jamie (not by her telling us this but by looking at the check at the end) and she was so unpleasant and rude. She came over to the table with barely a smile and asked if we were ready to order. No, Hi, How are you ladies, Have you all been here before, NOTHING! She acted as if we were annoying her by just being there. We overheard her talking and she was cursing. I asked for Tabasco and she murmured something under her breath before she came over. Its unfortunate because I like the Baja Wrap there and to me, when service is bad, it ruins the entire experience. What put the icing on the cake is one of the managers or owners (not sure which) was sitting in the dining room sipping wine with the servers and not paying attention at all. The buser did more for us than the server or manager. :( We love to eat out and Temple Grill will no longer be on our list of must haves. If your looking for a cheap meal, then go, but if service and experience means anything to you, don't waste your time!!!
