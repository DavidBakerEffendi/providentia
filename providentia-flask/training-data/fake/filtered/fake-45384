I went there (by chance) at the opening party. It's hard to judge a restaurant that just opened, but.. if they keep up the solid work and attention to detail this is a very welcome addition to the neighborhood. Sure, there are already a few southern cuisine places in the area, and this doesn't feel exactly Brooklyn-ish. but this is the one you go for a change, a nicer dinner, more lively dinner. It's slightly more expensive than the local average, but worth it. They call themselves fusion southern cuisine. I'm happy for the southern part. I didn't really get the fusion part, but I'm glad about that, because I really haven't had any good fusion food either at home or abroad. The food is really tasty. I had the skirt steak, which had a delicious sauce. My wife had the salmon with was very good too. And for dessert we had the creme brulée, which despite being too soft, tasted amazing. The vibe was a little loud, perhaps because it was the opening night, or because half the place is a bar with DJ, but nevertheless I will definitely go back. The decor is nice. Like a said doesn't feel very brooklyn, and it's supposed to be inspired by the Brooklyn bridge, which you don't get at all - which is probably for the best. All in all this feels a bit like Brooklyn's answer to Cafeteria in Chelsea. Note. Like Luz, they should add an awesome $12-15  whole roast chicken to democratize the menu. It's a very sexy dish and it's alleviated me during hard times, for which Luz won my undisputed loyalty.
