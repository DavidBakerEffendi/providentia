Alex is the best. He really knows how to make you feel like your at a place of your own. We stayed at the hotel next door. We had dinner and lunch there several times. The food was always top notch. I enjoyed the Pear salad and the Harrys Bar pasta dish. The iced tea was as fresh as can be. It was poured fresh over the ice right in front of you. My kids of course loved the pizza. The complimentary pizza style garlic bread and rosemary crackers were insane. Thanks Alex. See you next summer!!
