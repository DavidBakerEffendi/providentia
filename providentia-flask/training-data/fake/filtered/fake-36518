The place offers superb steaks, whether you prefer the butta-like filet or the flavor-intense rib-eye.  I've been to a bunch of NY's venues known for their steaks (STK, Quality Meats, Angelo Maxies), and this place tops it all.  The steaks pack lots of flavor and juicy, and the meat selection is excellent.  Great wine offering, the prices are second to none.   Also loved the mini-deserts, very tasty!   Will shortly go back..   The only caveat is that they only accept reservations for parties of 6 or more, so expect a short wait (which is well worth the experience).
