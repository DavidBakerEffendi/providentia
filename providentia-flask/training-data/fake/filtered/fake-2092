Delicious delicious delicious! The crispy cauliflower is amazing. Definitely get the hummus (probably the most popular snack here) and the fried olives - great snacks while you are waiting for your courses. The seafood (shrimp and scallops) were very yummy and cooked perfectly. Like other reviewers, I wish the serving sizes had been a little larger. I would also make a reservation on the weekends. We happened to walk in early on a Saturday evening and they had two tables open; if we had waited any later, we wouldn't have gotten a table!
