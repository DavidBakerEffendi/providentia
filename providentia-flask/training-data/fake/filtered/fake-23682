Simple perfection, made with love, great service.... Had brunch, came back later to eat again. Always a nice crowd, people laughing, having a great time. Sit at the bar if Chris is bartending, Teresa is also a great server... Just good people with great hearts, an eye for detail, and amazing charisma. All around an excellent experience.
