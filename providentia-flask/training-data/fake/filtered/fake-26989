Had dinner tonight at Guild & Company.  Started with crab dip - very good.  Salad was very well dressed and featured beets and delicata squash.  Strip steak and lobster with potato-leek gratin and broccoli - excellent.  Steak was cooked very well.  Ricotta cheesecake was excellent.  New favorite restaurant.  Ecstatic to see Susan (formerly from Kitchen Table) there - will request her next time.
