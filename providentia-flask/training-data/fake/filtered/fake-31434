Went for dinner last night with 4 people.  We ordered two appetizers and 4 entrees that were all priced $30+ and then shared two desserts.  Prior to the bill being placed at our table, I presented a coupon that they sent me on  my phone.  The server showed it to the Manager who said they would not honor it because it was not printed and that I might use it again.  They lost 4 regular customers because of the pettiness of a $6 dessert.  We alternate between Caldwell Seafood and PF Market - we will stick with Caldwell Seafood where they are much more flexible with switching side dishes and don't have an up charge to switch one vegetable for another and the food is just as good.  WE WILL NOT GO BACK!
