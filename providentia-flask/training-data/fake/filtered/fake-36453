I had the WORST SERVICE EVER. I know it's called fine dining but wow. I've never felt SO belittled and forgotten. I didn't order a lot but tried a couple of the tapas(which tasted just okay) so I think the waiter was not happy about that. He was just concerned about his tip which I shouldn't have even tipped at all. Shouldn't it NOT matter how much you order? Shouldn't you still be treated with some degree of hospitality? wow. unbelievable. i would NEVER go back again.
