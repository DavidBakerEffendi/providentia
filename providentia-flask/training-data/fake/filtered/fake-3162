Tried this restaurant today for this first time! YUM!  I got the shredded pork tacos and they were delicious.  They were the perfect portion size and came with excellent refried beans and white rice.  We also had a starter of guacamole which was really good.  I never had flan before, but the sample I had was fantastic! Don't let the location scare you away... yes, the parking lot is small and the building a little out of the way, but it is definitely worth trying.  I will definitely be ordering from here a lot!
