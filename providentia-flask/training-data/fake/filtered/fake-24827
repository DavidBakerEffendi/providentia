I grew up in a German household, as a matter of fact my dad was a sausage maker and our best friends owned a family brewery, so if there is one thing I know - it's good German food. This place is all it. It's young, hip and feels like a beer hall in Germany. Yet right outside is South Street. Jeremy Nolan the chef grew up in Berk's County and learned German cooking at the German clubs that dotted Berk's County when he was growing up. His wife is a master pastry chef and makes one of the best apple strudels that I have ever eaten on this planet. Jeremy keeps the German tradition, but has updated the menu to modern tastes. I love the sauerkraut here. I love the schweinhaxen and the spaetzle is super. You can't go wrong with any of the sausages and the rot kohl is like my mom use to make. The Wiener Schnitzel tastes like Austria. The menu is super and authentic. The bar is large and you might need help picking the beer - they have so many. Brauhaus is popular that they will soon expand, taking over the furniture store next door. I love this place. It's one of the best German restaurant
