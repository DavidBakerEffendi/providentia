We had the pleasure of being introduced to this restaurant while organizing a party at home. I do have to emphasize that the quantity was large enough(thank goodness) for me to have another semi-party.The Gobhi 65 and assorted pakoda platter with their chutneys were top-notch. The paneer tikka masala and vegetable korma with pilaf were a perfect combo, throw in the papad, makes it a delight- cannot forget the palatable bhindi masala with coconut touch-yum yum. I will definitely recommend this restaurant. Where else would you have a friendly staff at the place and a follow up call to ensure quality assurance.....
