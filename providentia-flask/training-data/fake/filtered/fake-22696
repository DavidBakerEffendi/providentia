I have been here a couple times and I always get a great meal. We came back to BK for a visit, now living in DC. We didn't have reservations and were able to get a table for 4 after only waiting about 10 minutes. We shared the meat combo and the brussel sprot salad. Both were excellent. I had the Pork Marinara for a main dish. This plate is a prime example as to why this place rocks. Its basically cheese, pork and tomato. Thats it, and its fantastic. Simple but well put together and crafted items make it stand out. I always hate to see restuarants that have 27 different main course because you know there is no way they can be that good. If you make it to Frankie's enjoy the simple food with complex flavors and great atomosphere. They also put together a great cook book to bring these meals into your own kitchen. I recommend picking it up.
