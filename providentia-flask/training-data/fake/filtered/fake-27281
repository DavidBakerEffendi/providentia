I went here on a Saturday night for dinner.  It was decently crowded but we got seated promptly, which was nice.  Got (what I hope was) a decently priced bottle of wine, the escargot and frites to begin.  The escargot was bonkers good.  When you say Frites, i envision thick cut belgian-style fries and these were much narrower, but still good. The coq au vin has to be the best thing on the menu. Also delicious were the profiteroles.  It should be noted that I have no clue how to spell profiterole.  All in all, solid variety of the menu, cool atmosphere, and good service.  My one complaint is that the specials list literally took our server 5 minutes to say.  And that's too long.
