This is my first yelp review.. The food at Falansai was bad enough to prompt me to join yelp after living for 10 years in NY without being compelled to do so. The place itself is very cute.  Really nice ambiance, great light fixtures. The Dad's shrimp rolls were fine.  The green beans were fine. The pork belly was THE WORST I have ever had.  It was chewy and tough and cooked to the point of having the consistency and taste of cheap stew.  The quail eggs were rubbery and un edible.  The entire dish tasted stale and musty. The ginger chicken was pretty bad as well.  Not very flavorful, sketchy looking rubbery chicken, and potatoes that were mushy on the outside and raw on the inside. Aside from all that it was expensive!! I could have gotten an amazing meal from one of the great options in Bushwick. My advice is avoid this place.  I am disappointed, I really wanted to like this place.
