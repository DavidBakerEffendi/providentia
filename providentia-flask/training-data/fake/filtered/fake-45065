The Res HAD best pizza in the world.  I've been going there for 40 years and it HAD always been a great experience.  We moved to DE Aug 2013 and visited NJ in Feb 2014.  It was the WORST PIZZA I have ever had.  The bottom of the crust was BURNT BLACK!!!  When we mentioned it to the waitress (when we could get her away from her cell phone) she told us they had a new pizza oven.  No apology for serving us garbage.  We asked if the place had been sold but she insisted no.  We did not see any of the family who ran the restaurant for the past 40years.  Would love to know what happened to such a wonderful place.  R.I.P. Reservoir Tavern and Papa Nick!!!!
