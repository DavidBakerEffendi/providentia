I didnt even want to give them 1 star! Terrible service! I visited on Feb 2nd 2013 at about 1pm. I sat at a table for ten minutes and was not greeted or helped. I watched the bartender serve 2 people that walked in after me. I decided to get up and leave. While leaving I sarcasticly thanked the bartender for service. She then yelled at me, 'we dont serve tableside'. Well thatnks for expecting me to be a mind reader lady! She could have greeted us and suggested to take our order at the bar. This woman is killing business at your restaurant. She shouldnt be in customer service. I was a cs manager for 11 years, I would have never had someone like this as my staff.
