Delicious sushi for pretty cheap! Moderate prices for great cocktails, cool atmosphere, great music selection (between 90s pop throwbacks and fun indie songs), open late, and friendly servers :) LOVE the edamame bombers, rainbow roll, and mochi! Definitely recommend the bubble tea as well (especially spiked!) Only complaints are that the service is inexplicably slow all the time (even when the restaurant is basically empty it takes forever to get drink orders!!) and also no one ever told me about the umi points card. I've been coming to umi usually once a week for a year or so...enough that the majority of the servers recognize me...and all failed to mention this program. Not a big deal just kind of perplexing considering how much I spend there and I always tip well. All the servers are very nice though and make visits extra pleasant. Overall definitely one of my favorite sushi places and I will keep coming back
