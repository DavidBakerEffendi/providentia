EXCELLENT Food!  EXCELLENT Service!   Exceptional Place.  Diners are such a great part of NJ and this place is without any exception one of the finest one could ever attend. Until our recent move, out of State (NH), we went there *every* week and never had anything less than A++ in terms of food and service.
