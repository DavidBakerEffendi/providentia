Despite the mixed reviews I read, not only here and on other sites, my nana (a very wonderful Korean woman who could cook in her sleep if she tried) recommended this restaurant for myself and two other friends that had not been able to taste delicious Korean food. I was pleasantly surprised by the cleanliness and the service, outstanding! We were seated, given water without question and whatever drinks we ordered - and on top of that, Sunny even stayed to recommend some dishes to the two friends I had brought along with me. She even helped and corrected the pronunciation of certain dishes we weren't sure of. Both were so kind and the wait was not too bad, considering they were the only two serving the area and there weren't too many people: about three or four besides the three of us. The food was to die for, in my opinion. And I've tasted some savory Korean dishes growing up. It wasn't too expensive, for the quality of the food and as much as we ordered between three people, I'd say the price was a steal! Even so, being a server myself, I tipped well over needed and she took great care in showing her thanks, throwing in three delicious little Korean cookies (the name evades me at the moment) which she really did not have to do, she was simply one of the kindest women I've been served by and such a wonderful woman to talk to. If you have not had the chance to try, I say disregard many reviews and give it a shot for yourself; there's only one way to know if you'll enjoy it, right? All I can say is... I will be back!
