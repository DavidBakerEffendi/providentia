I cannot believe this place is still getting good reviews.  I love Bar Jamon (how can you F-up wine and cheese) but Casa Mono needs a major overhaul.  It fails in food quality and service, which is flat out unacceptable in NYC, especially at the prices they are charging.   During the past two times I have visited Casa Mono, the food has either come out burnt or incomplete.  For example, when I asked the waiter whether the brussel sprouts should be charred black, he remarked, "yes, this is the way the chef prefers to serve the dish."  On what planet is burnt food considered gourmet?  On a second occasion, the gambas were served with 1 medium-sized shrimp and what I believed should have been 1 head-on shrimp, only the dish we were served had the head-on as a decorative piece with no shrimp attached.  Again, when I asked the waiter to confirm that the shrimp did not go missing, I was told that is the way the chef intended to serve the dish - with only 1 medium size shrimp.  I'm sorry, but for $16, you can at least include the entire head-on shrimp rather than just the shell for decoration.   As for the other dishes we tasted, the broth for the mussels was overpowering and the pork croquette was way too oily.  The only good part was of course the wine.  At least there is some quality control over the wine.   Bottom line, I will never return to Casa Mono.  I'm a huge fan of Batali's other restaurants but this one has seriously taken a dive.   Maybe he should stick to Italian.  I hope a real food critic re-reviews this place because maybe it will inspire some much needed improvements.   My advice for anyone reading this review..... visit Bar Jamon but avoid Casa Mono like the plague.
