I made a reservation for 10 and was told specifically where our party would be seated. I've been to the restaurant before and knew the spot exactly. When we arrived, the tables were empty but we were told that we could not be seated in the spot promised and were asked to sit outside. It was a chilly night, and we had no other good options in the neighborhood. A reservation must be honored, no exceptions. The server made several joking comments about our large party making things difficult for her, and I feel that was inappropriate. Joke not taken, ha ha. The food was fine, but not great -- experimental and adventurous, but not as good or flavorful as expected. The dessert was a Snickers ice cream bar, in its original wrapper, cut into pieces with a few strawberries on the side. When we asked the server whether or not it had been prepared by the restaurant in any way, they said they had just bought it from the bodega across the street (no doubt at a small fraction of the price we paid). The restaurant has no coffee for after dinner or to accompany desserts.
