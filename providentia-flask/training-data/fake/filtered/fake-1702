We stopped by here for a late lunch on a Saturday afternoon and found the food to be amazing. The humus was some of the best I have had and the grilled shrimp salad was delicious. Everyone was happy with their entrees. They did not have a kids menu but gladly made a small plate of scrambled eggs for my little niece. The dinner menu looked great and I hope to try it soon.
