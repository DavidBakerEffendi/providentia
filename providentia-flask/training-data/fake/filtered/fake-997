Ordered Mother's day special meal with $35. I chewed on two finger nail size thick plastic shards with very sharp edges. My mouth hurt badly. The dinning room was already noisy with many guests that night . The hand dryer in the Men's room was so loud. I could hear the noise from the fan from my table which was four tables away from the Men's room. It seems a nice place but it did not earn my trust. Â I will not go to that place again.
