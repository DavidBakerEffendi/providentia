Tonight with some friends we decided to go to this restaurant to celebrate a birthday. I'm from Uruguay and since they have an uruguayan menu I was almost sure the food will be great for me and my friends,but what a MISTAKE..I order a "chivito" totally different to the one I know and of course "DISGUSTING",the chocolate cake "HORRIBLE",the bottles where they bring you water "DIRTY" and now I understand why they have a "B" from sanitation. Prices so high for this kind of "cave" and of course 20% tip included in the bill...(the only way to received a tip from me) because finally one of the guy from the staff was so rude telling us that we have to leave because they need our tables.. What a P.O.S . of restaurant,believe me please don't go...it's worst than a real cave with real cavemans...
