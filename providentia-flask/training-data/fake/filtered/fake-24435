I ordered the Vegetable Lo Mein as part of the lunch menu-it was the most lackluster meal I have had in Center City.  There was hardly any vegetables to speak of and no flavor - None.  The Hot and Sour soup had burnt pieces on it-I had to throw it out.  Also, I ordered soup but they included no spoon.  The portions were plentiful-maybe they should concentrate on giving a little less quantity but more quality.  I will not be visiting this establishment again.
