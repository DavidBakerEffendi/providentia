Arepas Cafe is one of my favorite restaurants in Astoria.  Their food is delicious and well priced and because of this I enjoy bringing my friends here.  All my friends love this spot and not one has been disappointed.  When we hang out in Astoria they always request to come here.  This place is small but it can accommodate big groups, unfortunately they don't take reservations.  The passion fruit sangria is delicious and it comes packed with plenty of fruit.
