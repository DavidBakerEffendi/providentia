Awful diner. Bad service. The greeter has zero personality and make you feel like you are not welcome. Service is sooooo slow and the food is yuk. The place used to have good food 10 years ago but went way down hill from there. We visited a few months ago and the was no AC and nobody waited on us. So we left. Skip this place until they get there act together.
