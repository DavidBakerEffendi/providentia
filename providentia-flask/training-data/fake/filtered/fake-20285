Someone said Spa had good food and Yelp reported having good food.  So we went for dinner tonight and we both had the Sammy Salad.   I'm sorry to say this was this was one of the worst places we have ever been to. 1.  There were so many flies flying around, I felt like we were sitting in a garbage dump.   2.  The table and sliver wear were all dirty - visibly. 3.  It was SOOOO cold in there today and even my husband was cold and he's never cold.  Also, the entire place was just old and gross. But most importantly, the food - not good at all.  The lettuce in our salads were not fresh...   I would never never never eat here again. It was so awful that I had to come home tonight and sign up won Yelp to let everyone know.
