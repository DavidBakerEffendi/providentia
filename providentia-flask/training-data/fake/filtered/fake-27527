This is a must see if you live or visiting Brooklyn, NY! I adore their pizza but, their spumoni ice cream is TO DIE FOR. I think the spumoni ice cream, needs more hype than the pizza. Also, the chicken parmesan and penne with vodka sauce is pretty dam swell as well. All in all, a great historic place to visit also. I also wanted to mention that please don't go sunday because the place is usually jam packed (especially in the summer).
