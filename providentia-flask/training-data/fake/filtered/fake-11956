Ahhhh the memories from QP... For many of us, this was the 1st pizza place we went to in our lives with our friends (without parents). The pizza is still the same and Gino and the gang haven't changed. One day the powers that be in NA need to honor the Italian Villa as a timeless NA institution. Until then... I will make sure I drop by when I am in town...
