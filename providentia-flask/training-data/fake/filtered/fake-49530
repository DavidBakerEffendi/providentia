This restaurant is very good, I have only been there once but they definitely serve authentic Himalayan cuisine.  It is not as spicy as traditional Indian food but still delicious and wonderfully spiced.  The Dal Soup and Chai are identical to the delicious meals I used to eat when living in Northern India.  And the people are so friendly too :)
