I don't know what people are talking about with some of the bad reviews but this place was great. It is not just for tourists like others have said on this and other ratings sites but the food is good, the serivice can be a little quicker but I wasn't rushing anywhere so its cool and they need to get grape koolaid - they only had cherry koolaid so I ordered a sprite instead other than that I would definitley go back to this place.
