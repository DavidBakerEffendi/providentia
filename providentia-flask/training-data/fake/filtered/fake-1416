Recently sat on the patio on a beautiful afternoon for a late lunch.  Unfortunately, the service was poor.   We ordered our lunches and waited patiently with no water for 25 minutes.  A manager came over and asked how everything was.  Really?  We are sitting at an empty table with empty water glasses.  He brought out water and our waitress who asked if wanted bread.  2 minutes later she came out with our order but no bread.  She seemed surprised when we asked for that again.  The chicken and brie panini I ordered had clearly been sitting under a heat lamp - it was dry and crumbly.  Not very much chicken and no pizzazz.  The waitress never came over to check on us, or to refill our water.  We just sat there with a table full of dirty dishes.  Finally, after waiting for quite some time, we had to ask the hostess for our check.  A busboy brought us the check and the waitress came back for payment.  Interestingly, there was a manager on the patio most of the time but he didn't seem to be interested in attending to his guests.  There are so many great places on Palmer Square, don't pick this one.
