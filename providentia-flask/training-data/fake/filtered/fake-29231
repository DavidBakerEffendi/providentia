Me and my gf stopped in on Saturday afternoon, not knowing what to expect we were greeted by very friendly staff and we ate in the patio outside. I was surprised by the presentation of the tacos never seen such elegant tacos in my life.  Food was great agua fresca Of the day amazing and the service even better. Went back again with my pops and sis and they loved it. Found out they do take out and now Im hooked. Even delivery was super fast and on point.  Going back again in 2 days with friends!
