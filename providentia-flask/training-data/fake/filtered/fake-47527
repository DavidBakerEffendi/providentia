Loved the old grimaldi's. We're eating at the new location up the street right now and it's a big disappointment. Longer line than ever, terrible service and we're still waiting for our second pie after more than an hour at the table. The new digs aren't helping- bad ambiance and a music selection that's even worse. Â Pizza is still good so they get two stars but the experience has been awful.
