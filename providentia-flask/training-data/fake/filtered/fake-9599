Over the last ten years, the Morning Glory has been my favorite place for a  mid-week lunch (that is, late breakfast).  I have always been  very impressed by the food which reminds me more of the West Coast family-owned diners of my childhood, than the stainless steel monsters one finds on the Jersey side of the river.  All the little touches where there -- from the strong coffee served in insulated double-walled, well-used steel cups to the homemade "ketchup" I still haven't been able to replicate.  My favorite items have always been the breakfast burrito and the "cultivate your own fritata" I usual order with roasted peppers and cheese and a homemade biscuit you can cover with the jam/compote in the container at your table. It's a busy place on the weekend, as is the case with everywhere good  eatery in Philly.  So, try to make it on a week day is possible.
