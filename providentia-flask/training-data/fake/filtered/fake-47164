I went here two years ago and thought it was sublime. I don't know what's happened in the intervening time, but I went again this week and it was awful. The service is wretched: 45 minutes for stale pita and 1 hour to get our water filled (for $ 20+ an entree people deserve warm bread). At one point the waiters put down two of our meals, only to realize they had made a mistake and retrieve them to bring to another table! When the food did arrive it was lousy. My chicken was gamey and my daughter's falafal was so dry so barely touched it. The decor is lovely; it's too bad you can't eat the lamps. STAY AWAY
