My husband and I had an outstanding meal here last night and I was able to tell Bobby Flay how much we enjoyed his restaurant! While everything we ordered was excellent, the service was just exceptional, from the greeting at the door to the guy serving the bread to our waiter, who was as efficient as he was pleasant. All of the food-- the grilled octopus, the chicory salad, tarragon chicken and the lamb pizza were delicious. Although we were very well satiated, it was hard to resist the peach brown butter shortcake topped with blueberry ice cream. There were so many appealing dishes on the menu, I cannot wait to go back. Perhaps the biggest strength of the food was its seasoning-- I was able to simultaneously taste mint, cumin, chili and many different herbs and spices in one dish. Bobby Flay really knows what he is doing and it was fun to chat with him as he walked in and out of the kitchen. A memorable meal.
