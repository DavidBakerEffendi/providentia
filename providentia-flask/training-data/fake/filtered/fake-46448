Five stars for Marin Computer Repair Marin Computer Repair  in San Rafael saved me from looking for a pine box!   My kingston drive failed and I could not retrieve my script - 8 years of writing - finally completed and the only copy I had was in that  STINKIN'  drive.  Thank GOD!   For angel eyes (Mohamed Rassoul)  what a cute guy!   I received great service and he saved my.....oh...you know!   91 Louise Street  suite A.    Thanks Mo!!!   Margot
