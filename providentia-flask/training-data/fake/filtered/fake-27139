Great, authentic northern Chinese grilled skewers! If you've been to Beijing or other northern areas of China, you'd know the smell and taste of those cumin fragrant lamb skewers. This place delivers the flavors and taste of those same tasty street snacks. So glad I found this place! A tasty snack that you don't find too often outside of China. And the owners were extremely friendly too!
