Beautiful restaurant. Real ambiance. I liked their take on the Bouillabaisse, North Atlantic flavor with a touch of cilantro (although there shouldn't be dill on top if you ask me, the flavors don't mix very well). The chocolate-caramel tart was very good. So was the cold corn soup with pickled melon (on the house because I was given the wrong menu) I thank my second  waitress for saving my experience in this establishment. The first one seemed to be annoyed with my presence, barely seating me, handing me the lunch menu for dinner time and making me wait over 10 mn for my beer, which is still better than the hour the couple sitting next to had to wait for their oysters. In her defense, it was not dinner time yet and she did tell me so as I arrived (lovely). But that's about it. My opinion is that if  you have no intention of serving your customers, just say your not open for service. Last but not least, I payed at the cashier, and the gentleman behind the counter was barely polite and so was one of the hostesses. Answering curtly when addressed. Therefore, my rating has to do with the taste of the food, the taste with which the restaurant is decorated and the spotless (AND also tastefully decorated) restroom. The personnel, except for the waitress who saved my day, seems to be thinking they work at the Ritz, I therefore would like to remind them that the service at the Ritz is impeccable.
