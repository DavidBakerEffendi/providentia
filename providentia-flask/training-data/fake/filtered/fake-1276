I NEVER ACTUALLY ATE HERE. I bought a Groupon back in October 2013, I believe, for Piazza Margherita. I am only reminded to do this because I got an email from Groupon today regarding my request to be reimbursed. We went to find the place to redeem the Groupon and couldn't find it, call the number and it was out of service, then googled the address and it led us here. I walked in and presented the Groupon just to get some information as to what happened to the former business and if it were still redeemable here. I didn't just automatically assume it was. Boy, did they let me know how stupid I was. Again... I did NOT just walk in and say "here's this coupon, give me all my stuff and shut up" I just tried to get information. The young lady I was speaking with was treating me as if I were illiterate and couldn't understand that the name of the restaurant was "Bella Roma" and NOT "Piazza Margherita." Our conversation was overheard by a Vinny Bagadoughnuts aye-ohh type that then told me "yea, it was Margherita, now it's Roma, we aint takin dat groupon." 0 for 2. At one point I actually had to inform them that I was not by any means debating the name of the restaurant had changed, it got that bad. I mean, I've heard the food is awful anyway, hopefully those two have since been relieved of their customer service duties. It's was as if they were angry that someone who was a little confused just wanted to ask a question or two, like I was interrupting their busy day with my blatant stupidity. Still going back and forth with groupon to get my 39 bucks back, which is a real treat. Win some, lose some.
