Had a terrible experience with the male owner. I tried to bring in a group of 16 in on a Saturday afternoon. After meeting with the owner earlier in the week to make sure there we be space, I showed up with my group. My husband and I had been here before and had a positive experience. We live right around the corner and were excited to show some of our friends/family this place (most who also live in the neighborhood). All we wanted was 30 minutes to have a few pizzas, polenta bread and beers. Upon arrival, we were told that the owner forgot to mention they have a STRICT $10 minimum per person, so we couldn't sit unless we agreed to that. There was ONE table occupied and besides that the place was empty. My husband got on the phone with the owner who was completely rude and said "sorry I have a business to run". In my opinion, he not only lost out on at least $130 worth of business but also the chance to showcase his food to people in the neighborhood. The opportunity cost was worth more than the $30 difference. But hey, if he'd rather have an empty restaurant, so be it. I will never go to this place again just on principal alone. What a shame.
