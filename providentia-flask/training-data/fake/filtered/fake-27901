i went once when it first opened and it was unbelievable how good the pizza was.  Unfortunately, it has been discovered so the wait is pretty long, BUT they are VERY accommodating with takeout.  If you call for an order, they will call you back when the pizza is going IN the oven!  That's quality service.
