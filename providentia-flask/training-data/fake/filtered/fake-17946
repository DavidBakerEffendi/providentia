They changed owners and now the food is overly salty and tiny in portion sizes.  Service is an atrocity. My family has been coming here for almost 19 years but we will not return. Yesterday we had reservations but they seated us at a tiny table for 4 (there were 6 of s) that was too small to fit the 12 dishes that we ordered. To add insult to injury, they attempted to remedy this by serving us our food on tiny dinner plates. Um, nice try...not!  Honestly. Another group that did not have a reservation came in 3 minutes after we arrived and they were promptly ushered to the larger table (it was a party of 5). When I inquired about this oversight, I was given a shrug. The sheer unmitigated audacity!  Plus, our spicy shredded beef was not spicy and the stir-fried frog was not very fresh.  How I miss the old Shiao Lan Kung!
