We were really excited about this place when it first opened, and have been coming regularly for our favorite dish - the calamari platter. Tonight we were told that calamari has been permanently removed from the menu. So sad. We ordered chicken and salmon instead, and the food was all quite bland and flavorless. Not much better than your standard chicken 'n rice to be honest: pretty disappointing. We concluded that this place was a one-dish wonder, and we won't be back anytime soon.
