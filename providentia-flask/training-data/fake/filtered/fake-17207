I order from this place quite often on Sunday nights because it's nearby and it's open.  All I wanted was an extra container of balsamic dressing for the TWO dinners I ordered (one sandwich and one salad).  The guy at the register gave me such a hard time that I finally told him to forget it.  He told me three times that there was already dressing on each of the items (which I clearly understood).  That was my last visit.  This is a foolish way to cut costs.
