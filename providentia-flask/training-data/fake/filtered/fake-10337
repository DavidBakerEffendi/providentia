Adobe Blues is a great restaurant. I personally like their dinner menu better, but it is also great for lunches. Their tamales and fajitas are amazing! One major flaw is that their specials for the night are not always true. I visit Adobe Blues often, and at least half a dozen times, they have told us that they are out of the item on the specials, even if we arrived at the time dinner starts. It is good to ask before hand just in case, before you get your hopes up on a meal that you can't have.
