We have eaten at Tahlula's Table several times and were greatly impressed with the Fountain.  The tasting menu was excellent and plenty (almost too much) food.  What was most exceptional was the service.  The staff was attentive without being overbearing.  They were able to make my wife and I feel special in a full dining room and provided several special "extras" to truly create a memorable experience.  The lobster cocktail appetizer was outstanding.
