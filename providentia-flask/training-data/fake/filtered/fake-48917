This was one of the best meals I've eaten in Manhattan.  Each course was better than the last.  My boyfriend and I shared the warm beet salad, the brussell sprouts two ways, he had the malfatti and I had the scallops.  The atmosphere is great: relaxed and casual.  The food is well made without being pretentious.  Our server was a little strange but overall, Almond is a great experience.
