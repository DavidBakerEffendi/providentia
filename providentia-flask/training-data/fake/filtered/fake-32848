Once in a lifetime experience - unless you go back for more as we did (provided you can navigate their less than intuitive facebook page to buy tickets) As others stated, this is not just a meal: it's an experience way beyond that, including participating in a performance. The courses add up to a trip: half time travel - half trip inside: into your limbic system. You don't need to follow my advice, but I recommend skipping the wine pairings: they are very good but I enjoyed the trip more fully sober.
