If I could give a negative star rating I would! This place is HORRIBLE. Can you say upgrade? This place was filthy. You can really tell how a place is run by checking out the restrooms...totally discusting. The staff are zombie's. No personality whatesoever. Definitely one of the worst service restaurants I've been to. I could care less how good the pizza is...we waited over an hour after we ordered..for one pizza. Getting a beer was like pulling teeth. You wait and wait and wait...I'd say go here if you like 1. filthy atmosphere 2. rude staff 3. to wait 2 hours to eat on a Wednesday night. Someone call the health board!!
