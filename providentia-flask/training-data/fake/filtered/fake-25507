Great dim sum and amazing Chinese. The pad thai is not thai.. Went there with a big group (8 people) ordered a lot of food and wine (big bill on a Tuesday). Had brought cupcakes for dessert for birthday. They charged about $2.50 each person to put the cupcakes on a plate which we thought was really tacky.
