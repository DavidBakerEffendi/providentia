WOW!  What a find..... I ate at Mezetto last night and have to say that it was the  best Mediterranean Cuisine that I have had in a long time.  Their Chef does an amazing job with his unique blend of herbs and spices. Everything was cooked perfectly and the presentation and detail on the plates was more than impressive!  The Scallops and gnocchi are to die for ..The interior design is chic and elegant.... Very convenient location also!!   The owners, are very hospitable and make you feel more than welcome! I give it 6 stars!!!!! I will be back and will happily bring family and friends!
