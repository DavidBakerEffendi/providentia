Delicious pizza but definitely some flaws.  First off the business hours; they are open for x amount of hours a day during work hours, I work in the city so going there is a real treat on days off, second the wait for the pizza is extremely long but clearly its worth it.  The flavor is authentic and they drizzle some aged olive oil all over the pizza once its fresh out the oven.
