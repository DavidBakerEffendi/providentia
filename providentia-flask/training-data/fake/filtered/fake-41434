This place has character and the best $6 burger in VT.  I have noticed other reviews mention questionable service, but I have to disagree.  Given the location (if anywhere in Burlington could be considered rough, this neighbourhod is it) and prices, I can imagine the stress the staff here face.   If you are brave enough, check it out, your tastebuds will think it is christmas!
