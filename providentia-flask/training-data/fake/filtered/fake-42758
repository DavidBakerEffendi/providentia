I haven't eaten there in years...the food was good back then.  But this Angelina is apparently a racist.  I walked by there the other day on my way to the Vet and was appalled at what I saw in her front window.  Nothing but anti-Obama stickers and anti-Muslim articles.  This is a place of business...have a little class Angelina.
