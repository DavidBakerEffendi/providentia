There's nothing authentic in this place, except their seaweed salad. People who rated this place more than 1 star, please try the real thing first, then you rate them again. I went to this restaurant when they first open a couple of years back, I was craving for miso ramen then, I was so disappointed. NOT EVEN CLOSE to what I used to eat during my 10 years of living in Tokyo. When they change their name to "New Ashiya" I thought the food will be better. But NOOOO! Only the name changed. Please people... don't get mislead. They look Japanese but this place is NOT Japanese restaurant.
