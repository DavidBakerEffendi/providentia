I work close to them and we order there often.  It's always a great place to eat.  The bagels are fresh and I love the variety of bagels and cream cheese.  We get the Mexican wrap and the Salmon wrap quite often.  Both are very customizable and they make them so quickly.  In the many months that we've been ordering there, we've only had one bad batch.  The sandwiches weren't made like we ordered them, but the staff was so receptive to fixing the mistake.  We still love them!  I highly recommend them for breakfast and lunch.
