Stopped into Meal one day and oh my goodness! The food was to die for. I had the Meal chips for an app and they were delicious. For my entree I had the lobster linguine. Typically I don't order pasta dishes when I go out but decided to give it a try. I have never had a pasta dish like that one. I didn't want to stop eating it but forced myself so I could take some home to enjoy the next day too. I definitely overindulged on the cheesecake lollipops but how can you say no to perfect little cheesecake balls. Kudos to the chef! The staff is very friendly and attentive which makes it a great experience. Perfect date spot. Â I will for sure be returning. Haven't stopped thinking about the lobster linguine. Very deserving of 5 stars!
