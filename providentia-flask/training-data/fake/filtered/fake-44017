I love Caracas, I've celebrating almost a dozen special occasions there, I put it on my to-do list for every visitor, and I even had regular Arepas for breakfast one day... so what. I'm so excited that there is a Caracas in Brooklyn now, its big, its beautiful, and the food is great. I only have 2 negatives... 1. I kind of miss the super homey feeling you get in the crammed tiny east village location. Its like you're in their home and you can tell everything is done/made with love. and 2. Service at the brooklyn location is awful. Downright awful. I know good service is hard to find in NY and I think Brooklyn is no exception (do hipsters even know how to hustle?) Caracas is the slowest, unfriendliest, place I've been to. HOWEVER, the food runners are fast, great, and obviously working their asses off. They should get the tip.
