You're going to be a little cramped in this hidden away little gem of a restaurant, but it's totally worth it.  The service is wonderful, and everything on the menu looks delicious. I had to go for the lasagna, and it was fantastic!  Rich tasting sauce, with lots of thin, perfectly cooked lasagna noodles, layered perfectly! Truly one of the better Italian secrets in NYC.
