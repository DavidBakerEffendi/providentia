Great old-time place passed down through generations. Real genuine family feel in that the owner, grandson of the original owner, came out to each customer and asked about their satisfaction. We were the only non-locals and everyone got a "Hi Norm" type greeting, incl. questions about how their families were doing. We were treated equally as well giving us the desire to be one of the locals! Food was great too. Comfort style with a slight twist and truly cooked the way you ask. Can't say enough about what a wonderful feel this place has. Fun U-shaped counter where the owners circulate and check on everyone
