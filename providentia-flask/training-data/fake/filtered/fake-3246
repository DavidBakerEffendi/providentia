I went a couple weeks ago on a Saturday night to have a drink with a friend. We ran into a couple we knew and took over their bar table when they left. The bartender was really rude and took a LONG time to serve us. She looked pretty pissed off and in a bad mood. My friend and I finished our beers and patiently waited for her to come around and ask us if we wanted another, but she never did. I ended up going to the bartender behind the bar and getting more drinks from him to put on our tab. Really put off by the crappy service. I don't care if she had tattoos. She sucked. I only rated this two stars because the beer selection is good and decently priced.
