well i have been there before and i never had such a bad service like  i had yesterday, we had a party for 8 and the reserve was fine but we order just cold cuts and cheese and it took 40 min to bring it to our table, i talk to our waitress and she told me " yes i know it's taking a long time" with no solution! or apologize, then our meat was supposed to be 3 parrilladas one well and 2 medium well and let me tell you that the 2 medium were so raw that  we could have a conversation with that cow, she almost was alive! when we asked her to take the food back and cook it more she didn't take it very nicely, like if she had to do it, also was so careless to our table the only time she smile was when she brought the bill with her 18% of tip included.
