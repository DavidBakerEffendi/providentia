very good food. good prices. perfect little brunch place. the omelettes, crepes, french toast and coffee were great. a little bit of a wait to get a table but the waiter was constantly refilling our coffees and quick to take our order at the start and bring the check at the end. CASH ONLY but there is a duane reade across the street with a Chase ATM.
