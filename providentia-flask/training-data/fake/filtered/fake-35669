Amazing Brunch -- I ordered Momo's Eggs with tabouli and hummus and pita -- and every single bite was so delicious that I was making sounds (yes, brought to my attention!).  Every taste was the best I've ever had -- that pita bread, straight from the oven -- hot, warm and light; the tabouli -- so fresh, with so much parsley; and the hummus -- light and lemony; also a green salad -- fresh and lemony.  Yum.  Like others said, I'm salivating thinking of it and that surely is the best testimonial to GOOD FOOD!
