Moved to the area from Chicago, and spent some time googling for good Pho places in the area.  We actually stumbled by this place and stopped in on a whim about two years ago.  Since that time, we are a regular.  Very good Pho.   We havent ventured much beyond the Pho becuase its always what we crave.  Right on the spot.  I see some reviews that complain about the size of hte soup, but you can always order the extra large which is as large as I've had at most other Pho places. Service is very friendly, and the staff is very helpful when it comes to kids. The decor is fairly basic, and the place clean enough. You can wait a bit around rush time, and the parking lot is often chaotic, but stil pretty easy to find parking.  We highly reccomend this place.
