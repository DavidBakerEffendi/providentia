Cuban Pete's is a hopping place ..BUT the owner will not seat  parties unless everyone is there. We were surprising a friend & 6/7 were there..we were made to wait untile the party girl arrived..tghen 2 people came late & were told we left. We had to wait 20 minutes to order appetizers , when we were almost ready to leave, our sangria was whisked away so quickly I couldn't have another glass as well as water & drops of wet stuff being droped all over me.  Forget about lingering....They are all about turning tables & getting rid of you. DOn't go if you want to surprise someone....the entrees were adequate but the appetizers were deep fried & lacking in flavor.
