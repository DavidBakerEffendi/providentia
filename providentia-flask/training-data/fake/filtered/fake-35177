Not authentic at all. I ordered spicy slices of meat. It didn't taste spicy at all. I know what the spiciness for szechwan food should be. They dont use much Szechwan pepper, whIch makes your tongue numb. Do not go to this place. I suspect they might have changed their cook. Otherwise, it would be mysterious to get these good reviews. The reviews are too good to be true.
