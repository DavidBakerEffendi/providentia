Hello All, I have been in Locanda many times and I absolutely looove this restaurant!!! They are very busy so servis is not that great, food is delish, but very very small appetizers and they charge a lot of many for it, which I don't care cause is very good, and wine is pretty good for $12 a glass. Everytime I go there I always see some actors and well know people.. I adore this restaurant
