We visited Tony's on August 4. This was a truly terrible experience. We were seated next to 4 ladies who had been repeatedly "overserved". They were very drunk and obnoxious.Theyshould have been thrown out. Totally ruined our meal, wish I had the money back we wasted on this place.Plus, the food was mediocre at best.
