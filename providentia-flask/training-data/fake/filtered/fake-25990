The Great Wazu has a great central location, and it is all around perfect... Some key facts in rating this place a FIVE STAR... EFFICIENCY: - 5-minutes or less wait no matter what time you arrive - hot or cold sub, - plenty of employees, and - the coolers and shelves are always stocked to the gills... PREMIUM INGREDIENTS: - Boar's Head, - Herr's, - CocaCola products, - Fresh Lemonade, - Housemade dressings, etc. SPECIALITY MENU: - Boar's head combinations you should pay extra for! - At least 3 different Italian mixes, - Innovative panini and hard roll sandwishes, - Every hot subs imaginable, etc. AND THE TUNA!!! - Oh my friends...the TUNA.  My lord, please tell me what's in it.  Get it on wheat...get it on a hard roll...get it on a melt.  Or my favorite...The Tuna Chef.  There are no vegetables, or crunchy surprises...it's plain and simply divine. It's just a great place to be...Thanks Wazu.
