oh , Anchor!  You salty old seabird you...  you've always been a home for those who can't face the idea of going home-  A haven for the true Haveners and a perfect litmus test for separating the wheat from the chaff.   If you can't find a way to love the Anchor, then the stick in your a$$ is so deeply lodge in there that it's forced your heart out through your ear.   Get in, get your beer, and be nice...  or get the fvx out.
