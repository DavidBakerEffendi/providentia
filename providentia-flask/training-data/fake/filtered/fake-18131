My boyfriend and I were walking in Old City this weekend, down Market Street and were looking for somewhere to grab a bite to eat.  Since the weather was gorgeous it was a preference of ours to sit outside and enjoy the evening.  We came across Panini and thought it looked perfect.  It's family-like, mom and pop atmosphere made it totally comfortable and relaxing.  The food was absolutely delcious and the portions were huge, so you can image my amazement when we got the check and it was far below what we had expected it to be.  Panini is perfect for the summer, what could be better then fabulous food, great weather, and even better prices.  I  think I'm going to do girls night there this week!
