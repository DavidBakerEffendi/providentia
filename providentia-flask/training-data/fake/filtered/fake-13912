Our family is a BIG FAN of punjabi rasoi...very close to home made food....we have been visiting this place for almost 12 years and always had great food. Our visitors from India also love the food at Punjabi Rasoi....my recommendations here...please do have their papdi chaat, chole, paneer makhani, veg kadai, margarita naan.....actually the list is endless. We have catered their food for gatherings of 20-100 people....awsome job....I STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE...ONCE YOU EAT HERE YOU WILL ALWAYS BE THEIR FAN!
