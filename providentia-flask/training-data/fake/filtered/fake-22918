I've been watching the transformation of Mezetto over the past few months and was finally able to try it over the weekend. The food was delicious, for the shroom fans I'd highly recommend the truffle gnocchi. I also was a big fan of the falafel, it had a unique breading very similar to the outside of a pork bun. Great place to try & share with your friend! Enjoy!
