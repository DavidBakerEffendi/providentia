My boyfriend and I were customers there for over 3 years and always recommended the restaurant to friends and family... I was there with a friend today for lunch and order one of my favorite dishes, unfortunately I found a little bug in my sauce and called the waiter over discretely to tell him about it, honestly, that happens sometimes and it wasn't a big deal for me, but he called the manager and instead of taking the dish away and apologizing or offering something else, she took a spoon and scooped out the bug saying out loud it wasn't a bug (even though it had wings), but a piece of burnt chile pepper! Â Well, I was very disappointed in her scooping that out of my dish (ok it's not there anymore, now you can eat it) so fast and "leaving" the plate there without any consideration, plus charging us for the dish on top of that!!! Very unprofessional! I wouldn't have a problem going back because of a bug, but the whole thing turned me off, and trust me I ate there at least twice a month or more...I'm NOT going back because of their lack of professionalism and customer appreciation. Very sad but true.
