I have frequented Mac's about 5 times and find it Â "Just OK" or "OK if you are stuck in Old City." Sorry! I wanted to love you! It has a really nice bar staff that is also accommodating with regards to sports on the TVs. At the tables though it is weird like you are being stalked. Our last server had us and 1 other table but he stood next to the jukebox the whole time. It was creepy being watched the whole time. A similar episode happened with a a female server during the day. Key Note = Sit at the bar
