Go to Nori if you are a sushi fan! My girlfriend and I always sit at the sushi bar. I think this is the best seat because chefs always treat you something special, but people prefer regular tables. It is probably because chefs are too busy and too shy to talk to customers. But we don't care. We always start with rock shrimp and fish delight. And we have Krazy roll ( I don't know why they name it "K' instead "C") and Knock out roll and sushi entr√©e. They are so tasty and fresh. One of servers is very humorous while the other girls are nice too. We enjoy the atmosphere a lot. BYOB is an another good reason for us to keep going back.
