A hidden gem. I used to pace this place while crossing Hamilton along Grand and always thought it was just a regular deli. I am so glad to say I was wrong!!! I have ALWAYS been disappointed in the lack of good food in Maspeth. There's okay food and there's mouth-party good. The place is inviting and comfortable. The workers are super friendly and HAPPY to be serving! You feel the love being put into the making of your sandwich. So many options, so many flavors and so far, NOT disappointing. The healthilicious is my favorite. I will be a long time customer for sure!!
