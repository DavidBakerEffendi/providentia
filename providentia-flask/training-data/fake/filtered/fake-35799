Came here on a Sunday at around 1:30pm. The restaurant was empty. My husband asked for a chicken thai basil fried rice and I asked for a duck fried rice. Ok, I know duck is exotic, but it was the weekend! Anyway, the food comes in. The duck was super stale; I knew that if I forced myself to eat it I would be sick. I asked them to take it back. They just took the plate back, didn't want to know why I couldn't eat it. I didn't order anything else because the duck had made me sick; Â they couldn't have cared less. As for my husband's meal, it was ok. The chicken wasn't the freshest but it was fine otherwise.
