Burgers and Service that is HEAVEN SENT! I can't eat a burger ANYWHERE but here because the are THE BEST. No garbage PINK SLIME in the beef...all natural, delicious, juicy and fresh. The peppercorn burger is my FAVE and the Fried Pickles are insane...now the Service can't be beat. From the Mgmt to the wait staff and I gotta give a shout out to my favorite wait staff Lucy. Quick, knowledgeable and friendly. BTW...the beer is off the charts good .... great variety. DON"T GO ANYWHERE else but PRIME 16 Orange If you are serious about having a great meal, great service and great beer!!!!
