Noticed this new spot a few months ago and heard they did delivery through Facebook so I decide to try it out. I've never had delivery this fresh, fast and delicious.. Try their wings and grilled cheese! Apparently it's also a BYO spot so I'm definitely gonna swing by with a bottle or two. Five stars well deserved.
