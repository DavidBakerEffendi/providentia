cafe gitane is amazing. everything on the menu is great. my favorite dish is the cous cous with chicken. the harissa sauce that is put on the table MAKES the meal happen. THis is a stylish place. very scene, and very good. THe little outfits that everyone has and the cool vintage water bottles that they give when one orders tap make eating there a pleasure. also make sure to get the avocado toast. its ridiculously good now please stop reading my review, get up out of your chair, and go to cafe gitane.
