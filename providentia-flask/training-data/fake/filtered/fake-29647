This place. This friggin' place. I went to Pies n' Thighs for my first time about two years ago and got my first chicken biscuit. I've been hooked since. Last summer Pies n' Thighs catered my wedding (you didn't know they did catering? THEY DO AMAZING CATERING) and I was happy with their service and hospitality at every turn. Anne Marie (the catering manager that I worked with) was great from day one. They knew how to work at my pace and they asked all the right questions to make sure my wife and I had the best possible experience. If you're in Williamsburg and you want a great tasting meal that will leave you feeling great and won't break the bank, Pies n' Thighs is the spot. Get a chicken biscuit or a pulled pork sandwich with some mac n' cheese and some baked beans. Chase it all down with a slice of pecan pie or a donut, and back in the glory of the most perfect comfort food ever.
