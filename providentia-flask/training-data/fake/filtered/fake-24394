Splash used to be my favorite restaurant. Even though the food was merely adequate, I just loved the location. Today, because of its rigid and illogical rules, my wife and I were refused seating at one of the six empty tables along the waterfront. Those were reserved for "beer parties" though clearly no one was there.This section offers the best views of Lake Champlain and it seemed perfect for a wonderful dinner. Because we were only two, and clearly not a "beer party" we were unable to sit along the water even though the seating was plentiful and where we wanted to be. This indifferent and rude attitude was a complete turnoff. We just left. You could not pay me to go there again. Of course, if the management and its attitude towards its customers changes, I'll be back in a Splash. I'd stay away until their attitude evolves towards something closer to customer satisfaction. The reason I gave it a single star is because I did not have the option to give it none.
