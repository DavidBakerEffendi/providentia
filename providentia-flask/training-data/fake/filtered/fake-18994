I am sick of poeple ragging on Artichoke Pizza. Its always people who go there looking for a classic NYC slice.. well guess what incase you couldn't figure it out from the name; its not. also; the line isn't that long if you go at a reasonable hour, it just looks long because only like 3 people can stand inside (it has never taken more than 15 minutes for me to get a slice in my hands) And i gotta say its a good marketing technique (you walk by and see a line of course you are curious!) yes the artichoke slice is greasy, but its mostly because they are so generous with the flavorful cheese! i will admit there isn't ALOT of artichoke on it (a few slivers here and there) but todays going rate for canned tomato sauce and bagged shredded cheese on bread is $2.50 so its a steal at $4... also just one slice will fill you right up! I tried the crab and had mixed feelings about it... i think i agree with what i have heard before; it tastes a bit too much like Old Bay Seasoning. i have yet to try the sicilian ("grandma") and margarita but i have ONLY heard good things... it has always been the same friendly girl who takes my order... so i say the service is great.
