First off I'd like to welcome a much needed restaurant to our neighborhood! The decor is simple and lovely and definitely a spark for conversation . I started off by having the ristotto which was absolutely stunning visually . Wait staff is very friendly and helpful in explaining the dishes. I had the burger and it was so yummy I think I need to come back At least once a week for the side of potato wedges. I topped my meal off with an American and proud to say they serve Blue Bottle coffee which is nearly impossible to find above 50th Street. Overall wonderful experience and highly recommended :)
