I had never heard of this place but was walking by one night and saw the raw bar. It looked so inviting inside i went in without even knowing the name. Had 3 dozen oysters, beers, and the tartar appetizer. It was really good. I mean oysters and beer? how bad can that be. But the service was really amazing our server was so nice, i ended up leaving him a large tip. and they always have a wide variety of fresh fish of the day. I would recommend this place for a group of friends. maybe not a first date because ti's loud. great place.
