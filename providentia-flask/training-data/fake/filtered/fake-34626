if your from out of town these people like to give you a death stare and really make u feel uncomfortable by doing that while your waiting for your order. I've been there a few times and every time its the same experience. Â Pizza could be better. There sandwiches are pretty decent but the customer service is horrible as far as every employess giving you a dirty look constantly. Unfortunately they are one of very few places to go in windsor so you gotta deal with it if you want pizza
