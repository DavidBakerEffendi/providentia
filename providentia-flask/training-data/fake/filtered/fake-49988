******FOOD POISONING ALERT*********** Went here in Saturday night for what I would say was a 7.5/10 meal.  Pricey for a place with paper placemats (the menus), which are then removed after you order.  Food was good, ambiance was so-so. However, Sunday morning I woke up with THE MOST BRUTAL food poisoning I've ever had.  Guys, tell your "purveyors" to stop getting their snails from the east river, or insist that your employees wash their hands. Since the only other thing I ate Saturday was cereal and yogurt, and I am somewhat feeling better today (Monday), it was food poisoning from this joint.   Thanks for ruining the rest of my weekend!
