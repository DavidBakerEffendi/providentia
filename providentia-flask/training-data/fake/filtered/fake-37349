Their food might as well be drugs because it is addicting!!!  I absolutely love this place not only because I feel like I'm in an episode of cheers since everybody knows my name, but because it has a fantastic energy.  Not unlike their popular neighbors (honeys) who we also love, this place is the Mecca of mornings for Northern liberties!  Family owned and operated as most good coffee shops are, this one lacks pretentiousness and seals the deal with excellent food, coffee made correctly, an always pristine environment, and great conversation.  You'll be part of the family here, I would highly recommend breakfast and lunch at this place (For lunch the Maison salad, tacos, or chicken sandwich are not to be missed....and yes I'm not opposed to eating these for breakfast, they are THAT good!!)
