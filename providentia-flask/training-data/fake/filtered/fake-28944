I went with my girlfriend last night. Â We had finished eating and were having drinks. After about a total of 90 mins that we had been sitting at our table our waitress came over and very matter-of-factly told us we had to get up and relocate to the bar in order to make room for a bigger party coming in. It was an insult to say the least. We wont be back.
