I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars because of a few things that happened while we were there. The pizza was indeed as amazing as everyone said it would be ( we ordered a traditional margerhita). Excellent flavor and crust (ask for some Parmesan cheese and they will bring out yummy fresh grated Parmesan). We didn't have to wait long but we only had three in our party. Once we were seated we were informed they were cleaning the oven and it would be about thirty minutes before they would be cooking again(it took an additional ten minutes for our pizza to arrive once they started cooking again). They brought some bread which was nice while we waited. I didn't mind waiting because our server took our order and brought us drinks etc. The part that irritates me is that they clean their oven between 5 and 7 every night. Is there seriously not a better time to do this???? I know we ate early (about 5:30) but really is there no other time they could shut down food production for 50 minutes. My other beef is it's cash only. I know that's part of the charm of the place but it's irritating to me when a dinner place where your bill will be over ten dollars won't take a card. Overall the food was good and decently priced, service was efficient but nothing to write home about, and atmosphere was fun. The only reason I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars was because of the oven cleaning and no cards accepted. I also heard other diners complain about how long it took to get their order taken. Be prepared for long waits for good pizza that could probably be had elsewhere without the hassle
