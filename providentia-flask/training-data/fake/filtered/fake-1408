Great brunch! Shared the sizzling sisig and the khao soi with the garlic fried rice. Both were delicious and the fried rice was the perfect side. The watermelon mimosa was my favorite of the bottomless mimosa options. Service was also great and I enjoyed watching the chefs in the open kitchen. Will definitely be back!
