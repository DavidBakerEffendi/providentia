I've heard a lot about this restaurant so I decided to rate it. First the the vegan food. it was absolutely AMAZING. This is the only Chinese place that actually as a vegan option that tastes good. However I was surprised by how the Chinese food tasted. After eating the vegan G.T. chicken I decide to eat the dumpling the dumpling was average but nothing spectacular. Overall if your looking to eat normal Chinese food go to some other restaurant, but if your looking for vegan option this is the place for you. Ratings out of 5 ----------------------- Food plating: 2.5 Taste of food: 3 Service: 2 Design/ Appearance of restaurant: 4 Price of food: 4 Overall: 3 stars ( rounded to the whole number)
