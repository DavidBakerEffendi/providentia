The first time I came here I ordered the pear salad with salmon.  It was , by far, the best salmon I have ever had!!!  Every dish our party ordered was delicious!  The manager went out of his way to take care of us and our waiter, Keith, was wonderful!!  Three days later we are here again and when our waiter learned that our loved one at the hospital was not doing well, they comped us a bottle of wine!!!  What a heart!!!!
