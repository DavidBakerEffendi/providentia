I used to go to Bubby's a lot and at first it was charming and though the food was just okay - I could deal.  But then the service got really spotty - it would take forever to just get and pay for the check nevermind getting another beer.  And then sometimes the food wasn't even good.  The final nail in the coffin was that one night a small mouse (not a rat) was in the dining room - I informed one of the waitresses and some of the staff tried to get it out as quietly as possible.  I was not apologized to - nothing was taken off the check - it was like IT ALWAYS HAPPENS or something (this mind you was a week before the DOH shutdown).  Recently a friend of mine said she was in there and a huge roach was crawling right by her foot as she ate dinner.  Never again.
