Apparently my review for this place has been filtered. I'm not sure why...because it was too positive? Anyway, my original review stands and this place has been a fixture of my commute to work on most days. I have seen another review regarding how friendly or rude the employees are. I have not found anyone to be rude, I CAN see why someone might think so. Some of the girls clearly do not speak english as a first language, and they have developed good english skills, but the tone can be misconstrued. Sarcasm and humor doesnt always translate. It does not seem to be the norm. All in all, the bagels are some of the best I've had in the area.
