PJ's location is great being on Nassau street. We got a great view of passersby and the university. But the breakfast is average at best. We got their combo special with pancakes, eggs, bacon, and sausage. The pancakes were really tasty, but they gave us syrups in packets, which suprised me considering even diners have a better selection of syrups. The eggs were good, bacon and sausage was very overcooked. The server was friendly, but it took way too long for our food to come and it wasn't even busy. Overall, we may go back bc it was in a convenient spot (at a non busy time), the food was OK, but nothing to write home about.
