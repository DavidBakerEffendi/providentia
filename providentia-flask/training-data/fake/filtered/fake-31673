We were so excited to see this restaurant open!  A tasty, varied menu for quick lunches as well as a satisfying dinner.  I've had the build your own pasta and two different flat breads (the Fixx is a definite favorite).  Definitely speedy with great service.  I like that it's a nice environment to eat in or you can choose to take out.   Great concept for busy folks looking to pick something up on the way home.  Also good for lunch with clients or coworkers.  Kudos to Matt, the owner, who is a great guy!
