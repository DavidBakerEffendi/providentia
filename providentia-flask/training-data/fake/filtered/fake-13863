I ordered a classic grilled cheese with a few toppings on it a few days ago. First of all, their menu outside had different prices on it than they charged me (illegal). Then, they wouldn't give me a cup of tap water and said they would have to charge me for that too (also illegal). Finally, later that day I got FOOD POISONING from this meal and was sick for 12 hours straight and had to miss work. I don't trust this place, and obviously I would never go back there again. The meal tasted okay, but customer service was horrible, and food was actually CONTAMINATED and made me sick.
