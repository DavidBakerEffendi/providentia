I love the Star! Such a nice brunch spot for me and my ladies. None of us have ever had a bad dish. The best thing on my menu in my opinion is the meatloaf sandwich. SO GOOD. You can't really go wrong with anything though. It can get a lil hectic for brunch, but that's the norm in Williamsburg really.
