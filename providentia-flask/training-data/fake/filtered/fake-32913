I went to Perilla a few months ago and will go again soon, but don't want to wait until then to review. This restaurant is absolutely amazing. The food speaks for itself. The food we ate is no longer on the menu because their menu changes quite often, but all of their fish dishes were amazing as were some really creative appetizers, like bison carpaccio which we were told is prepared in a special way - by flash-freezing it and then slicing it cold or something, just fabulous. It was one of those experiences where each diner was just staring at his or her own food, in love, and savoring every bite, trying to eat as slowly as possible. I can't wait to go back here and I would love to try brunch...
