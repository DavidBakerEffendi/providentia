Came here with my daughter and friend one night and had a great time. The food was great, and didn't have to wait long for food which was great since we had a toddler with us. Make sure you ask for john as the server, he  was kind and friendly and helped recommend us something to eat since we had never been here before.  Loved the pretzel bun with a burger, we will definitely be coming back.
