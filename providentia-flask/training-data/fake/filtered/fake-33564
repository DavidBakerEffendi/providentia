We went to Cantore's because we had heard great things about it through word-of-mouth.  I liked the atmosphere, other than we had to keep our coats on because every time the door opened, it was really cold!  My husband and I ordered the cheesy, chicken and broccoli stromboli.  It was HUGE! Definitely enough for two people.  It tasted amazing and very flavorful.  It had thin crust, crunchy outside, and stuffed full (they definitely do not skimp on the filling!).  My only complaint with it was that it had some raw dough in it, but we ate it anyways since it was so good!  :)  The employees were very friendly too. The reason I only gave 3 stars was because of the kids menu.  As a mom of 4 kids, the kids food is very important to me.  My kids each ordered the chicken tender baskets.  It was $5 and all it was was a handful of fries and 2 small chicken tenders.  The drink wasn't even included in the price.  The price for the stromboli was reasonable, so it surprised us when we got such a little amount for the kids.  I would go again to Cantore's but not if I had kids with me.
