I want to qualify this review by saying that I've worked in restaurants before, and that kitchens have off nights. I really hope that's what happened tonight. I was eating out with a friend after we had heard some really awesome things about The Spotted Pig. We sat down, ordered bar snacks and entrees, and waited and waited. After about twenty minutes the bar snacks arrived and were awesome. I could have eaten the chicken liver toast all night. That was the high point of the night. After another 45 minutes of waiting our waiter came by and assured us that our food was being plated at that moment, and it would be up in "two minutes". Fifteen minutes later it did come up. Sadly that was not the end of the problems. While the cider braised pork was very good but small, the polenta it was on was undercooked and very underseasoned. Not worth 28 dollars and definitely not worth the hour and a half wait. I was just very disappointed in the end. I really wanted to like The Spotted Pig, but I won't be coming back.
