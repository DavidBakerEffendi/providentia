Take this review with a grain of salt because...I am an ardent carb-aholic. There! I said it. I've hustled for a supple loaf of SourDough. I beg friends for their un-eaten pizza crusts. I would do things frowned upon by society just for Bedoiun's pitas. They are that good. My allegiance to this place is built mainly from my take-out patronage. Being vegetarian, this is one of the few places in the area that offer interesting, non-meat, non-noodle/rice options AND tastes fresh. The spinach and cheese pita pocket is awesome. So is their hummus and babaghanoush. My usual order consists of the aforementioned pita pocket, Â a 5-"salad" platter (which always includes the spinach and chickpeas and faol) and the the falafel platter. This combination never fails, and I highly suggest that you do the same.
