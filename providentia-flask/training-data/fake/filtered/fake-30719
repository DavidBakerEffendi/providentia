Coco's is the PERFECT spot for a night at Walnut Street theatre. So convenient...there's a parking lot inbetween the theatre and the restaurant. Highly recommended is: crab quesadilla and the gorgonzola chips. Waitress seemed kinda new, but when she heard we were going to a show...she brought everything out in a timely manner.
