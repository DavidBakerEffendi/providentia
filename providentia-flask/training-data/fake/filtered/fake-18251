Travelling from out of town and stopped at Pig & Prince for Sunday Brunch.  The restaurant is gorgeous (renovated the 3rd oldest building in Montclair).  Staff was friendly, restaurant was clean, and the food was delicious.  Brunch was 2 courses with choices that made it hard to decide what to eat.  Bagel bombs and the cinnamon roll were heaven.  And thumbs up for catering to my son and the side of extra crispy bacon.  Definitely will be back.
