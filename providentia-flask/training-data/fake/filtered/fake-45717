A fun, vibrant concept with clumsy food at inflated prices. The cafe is loud and cramped, but I liked the vibe and the low-key style. The attached wine shop is clearly a major achievement in this land of state-controlled liquor stores, and the deli section stirs your appetite. Service was professional. I appreciated that the server gave a pretty minimal menu orientation without the usual BS. Then a server came over and, swirling olive oil onto a plate, loudly announced "Our olive oil comes from California!" That's nice, I thought, my olive oil comes from Italy, but let's try it. It was really bitter and unpleasant, and started us off on a bad note. Next, we have the baby artichokes, which were smothered with preserved lemon and olive oils. I love the flavor of preserved lemon, but the artichokes were completely lost, and the combination was again too bitter. We opted for mushroom overload for the main course, splitting the Funghi pizza and the ricotta gnudi with morel cream. I was skeptical of serving gnudi with a cream sauce, and found the dish quite bland. The gnudi were essentially pure ricotta, but were surprisingly dry. If they had been cooked in a sauce, I can imagine they would have absorbed a lot of flavor, but instead, they were fussily arranged and lightly drizzled with an oversalted cream sauce. The pizza was the only well-balanced dish -- very cheesy, but savory and a little acidic with, I believe, more preserved lemons -- but was very similar to the mushroom flatbread available at the superior Distrito. Overall, a flashy and fun restaurant that needs a lot more attention to detail in the kitchen.
