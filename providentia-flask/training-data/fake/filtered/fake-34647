Although I've eaten here plenty of times and had good experiences, tonight's was very poor. They only had one waitress working the whole restaurant on a Friday evening, and based on how slow the food came out, they must have also only had one cook. I understand that staffing problems happen, but at least warn the patrons and give them the option of coming back another time, rather than turning them off with such poor service and food cooked in a poor manner. Now, we will likely not return here. BTW, they also served the worst calamari I have ever tasted. large pieces that were 90% over-fried breading with barely any sign of the meat in there.
