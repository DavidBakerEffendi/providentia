This place is amazing! All I wanted was some good tea, and I ended up getting an education. I thought I love tea, but they LOVE tea. They have an amazing selection, and it's a really comfortable environment, so you can take your time looking and what they have and figuring out what you want to buy. I will definitely be going back there. The staff was so friendly and so helpful. I highly recommend it! Â  I work in Princeton and I dislike going into town for anything because of the traffic/people everywhere, but I'd go out of my way to go into Princeton to buy some more tea at Infini-T.
