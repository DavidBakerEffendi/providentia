By far the best sushi I've EVER had. I've been to many of the top rated sushi spots in the world, and nothing beats Yasuda. Go with 1 other person and sit at the sushi bar (where they serve your sushi on a fresh banana leaf). Ask the chef what he recommends. The snapper, uni and toro are extraordinary. Do NOT ask for spicy mayo- this is not that type of restaurant. The decor of natural bamboo is sleek and clean, yet warm and inviting. Be prepared- all this bliss comes at a price (but well worth it)!
