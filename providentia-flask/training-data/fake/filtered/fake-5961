The perfect "city" brunch. Living in Brooklyn, I try with all my might not to go in to the city on the weekends, but a cousin was in town over memorial day weekend and I was able to get a prime reservation for 5 on monday brunch. Cookshop has all the makings of a successful manhattan brunch outing: busy & bustling, good music, great drinks, strong coffee, lots of tables, and surprisingly good food! I can't recall what everyone ordered, but I had the deviled eggs and radish salad. Perfect. Refreshing. Fun. Highly recommended for an energetic weekend. Check out the new section of the High Line that just opened with its entrance across the street.
