If you're in the mood for no fun, this is the place for you! I love spending time with people who have sticks shoved up their ass as much as the next person, but this place really takes the cake. I was reprimanded at this bar for clapping along with live music. Perhaps I danced a little jig, too. Sometimes I can't contain myself, what with being human and enjoying lively tunes. Why would a place have live music if they didn't want people to dance? Dancing and listening to music are age-old customs, dating back before the iphone 5 and snobbery based on looking like an asshole with clothes that look like shit but cost a lot. The owner of this bar, sitting in the back, smelling her own farts, told us that this place was not for fun, but for being 'mellow'. If I wanted a place to be mellow, I'd play some light jazz and not provide a dance floor. Or a stage. This bar is everything that is wrong with the Brooklyn culture these days. Take your overpriced drinks and Canadian tuxedos and shove it.
