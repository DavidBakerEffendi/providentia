Friendly service and great food with a cool vibe, a unique menu and great coffee. Wait times can be slower than say a diner but that's just it. It's not a diner. It's a cafe that is always packed with a small kitchen. Good things are worth the wait. If your impatient and spoiled by fast food places go somewhere else to leave a table open for me.
