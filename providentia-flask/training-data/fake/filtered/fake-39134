After 25 minutes sitting on that hard wooden bench waiting for my two shakes I finally had to leave. Wasting my break, loosing the 13.00 I spent on milkshakes for a co-worker and myself. The woman behind the counter continued to take orders from the 9 people that came in behind me, not bothering to add ice cream and milk to the machine to let it process while she worked the register. This is always an ongoing problem at this place as this has happened once before to me and twice to my manager. Get extra help for Friday nights. I wont be back. Id rather walk the extra 4 blocks to Shake Shack. At least there I always get what I came in for with a smile.
