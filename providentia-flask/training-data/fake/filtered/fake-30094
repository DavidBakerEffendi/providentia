Honestly, I've been very disappointed lately.  I've noticed a significant decline over the last two years. We keep giving them another chance, but no more! The food is good, but the Sashimi pieces get smaller and smaller, the freshness of the fish has been questionable and the Saki selection is poor.  Overall, I think the prices are higher than the quality warrants.  Sadly, we'll be enjoying sushi elsewhere from now on.
