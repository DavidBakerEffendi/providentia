Found this place on yelp during a romantic getaway weekend. It's a quaint, friendly spot that wasn't too packed when we got there. I ordered the pancakes and sausage and, being the indecisive freak I am, shortly thereafter changed my order to the pumpkin pancakes. Earl had already started my pancakes, but he was happy to throw in a pumpkin mix and it was delicious. My girlfriend went all in, ordering the eggs, toast, bacon and home fries special. She finished it before I was half done my pancakes so they must have been good. Earl came out from the kitchen to greet us and ask me how my pancakes were, which was a nice touch. If I ever come back to burlington, I'll be sure to return.
