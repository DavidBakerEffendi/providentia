This is by far the best restaurant i have been to. I am Portuguese and to eat very authentic food away from home is extremely rare. every time i am in the area and go out to eat this is my only option. the price is cheap for the amount of food you get and the quality is unbeatable. if you want to try some good Portuguese food this is the place to go.
