These guys just opened this week, and a friend and I hit them up for an after-movie dinner.  The food was simply fantastic - unique twists on french fries, as a stand-alone side with a burger, had me cackling with delight.  And I don't frequently cackle.  The bacon-wrapped jalapenos with a maple cream cheese filling, well, let's just say if there were a stack of these behind old women and small children I'd knock down both groups to get more.  Great service, waitstaff was very knowledgeable about the menu, friendly, warm, and I'm definitely going back, and telling my friends and family to go.
