Came across this place at River Front Center with my girlfriend by chance and wow glad I did! The place has a modern build out that is very cool with a huge bar in the middle. There are huge chalkboards hung on the two side walls of the restaurant with nothing written on them. At first I thought they were just decorative pieces, but when I asked my server about them she said they will be writing happy hour and specials info on them in the future. They didn't have a happy hour when I was there, so I'm kind of curious what they are planning on doing and when. The service in my experience was excellent. My server was super friendly, and we got our drinks immediately and our food within 15 minutes. We got the Marinated Tomato salad starter, my girlfriend built a 1/3 lb grilled chicken, and I had the Red Eye burger with a side of vegetable skewers. Everything we ordered was awesome, and I highly recommend the Birthday Cake milk shake! The food was amazing.  It is not the cheapest burger, aka Five Guys, but it is the highest quality and best tasting I've ever come across.  You definitely get what you pay for in my opinion.  I am definitely coming back again!
