I had a close relative pass away suddenly last week and needed to set up arrangements f/ a dinner on the fly.  I chose Bill's based on the buffet menu and the proximity to the funeral home.  Brian, the chef was very courteous and honest about having limited choices due to the short notice so we agreed upon meatloaf, chicken francaise and vodka rigitoni.  The food was okay, kind of like leftovers @ grandmas. There was a lot of filler in the meatloaf which was the best of all 3 choices and I think they may have subbed turkey for the chicken dish.  I had told them it would be okay if they had it set up by 3:30 since we'd be there no later than 4 pm.  When we got there, the chafing dishes were set up, but there was no food ready.  Eventually they brought out the salad and biscuits (which were the best thing we had) but the rest wasn't brought out until around 4:30.  The service was "okay" but what I really didn't like was at the end when the waitress presented me with my check she hadn't deducted the $150. that 2 family members had given her to offset the final charges before I had arrived at the restaurant.  When I asked her about it she said, "Oh, I hadn't deducted that yet."  I felt as though had I not asked, she wouldn't have acknowledged the pre-payment.
