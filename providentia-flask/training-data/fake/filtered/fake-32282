A friend suggested we try this hidden spot for brunch - bottom line, it's worth a visit.  Place was packed for brunch, so it made sense why the waitress might not have been as fast on the service, but the owner did a great job taking care of us and more than made up for it.  We just relaxed, enjoyed the fantastic food, and polished off our BYOB mimosas:)  Highly recommend the egg scramble and rosemary fries and the espresso was perfectly delicious.  Can't wait to try it out with the bf next time!
