My boyfriend and I love Bartaco! The food is so good, you can't go wrong with the chef's tray. It's like a surprise but you won't be disappointed! The atmosphere is awesome. We love sitting outside (and there always seems to be available tables.) It's also great that you get to write down your orders. It's a very laid back atmosphere and one of our favorite spots for the summer. I know some people are dissing the fish tacos but I love them. Overall it's a great restaurant..try it out!
