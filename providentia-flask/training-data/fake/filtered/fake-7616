Never had Bali food before and was pleasantly surprised.  The curries were fantastic and not over spiced.  I tried a seasonal pumpkin curry that was heaven.  The host paired our meal with an excellent bottle of wine. The restaurant is small so get there early.  There is a bar to move to after the meal, to allow others an opportunity to sample the excellent food. I thought the prices were very reasonable for the quality of food and the location.
