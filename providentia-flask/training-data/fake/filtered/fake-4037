My family and I visited The Shanty for dinner a few weekends ago and it was fantastic!  We were greeted upon entering the building which is always nice and welcoming, our server was friendly and attentive.  Our sons ate from the kids menu, my husband who is not a seafood lover had the chicken teriyaki, the chicken was nice and juicy.  I love seafood so i went with the Broiled Seafood combo with homemade mac & cheese!  Everything was awesome!  Can't wait to get back to Burlington to go again!
