This place has been on all of my friends tounges me being from Nola I was like let's go check it out..went in there Sunday night and the guy at the cash register greeted us with a hello,smile, and eye contact which is different I figured this would be a Â typical hipster hole like the rude clientele that was there that nite. I suggest sitting in the back the front is a bit chaotic and well if you been to williamsbug you know the type of people who live there enough said. Anyway we had the crispy juicy fried chicken with a zucchini tomato stew yummy my friend had a chicken biscuit the butter on that thing will put about ten pounds on ya for just looking at it. It's a bit much I think! Our waitress was helpful and sweet the music was on point and the keylime and peach cobbler made remember my grandma. See you there!
