This was a terrible experience. Hideous would be a better word. We spent two hours waiting for food when it arrived it was not only cold it was not what we ordered. The prices were ridiculous and the portions were very small. My steak was not cooked is ordered and my friends dish was totally different than what you ordered but she ate it anyway after waiting two hours we were hungry. They didn't even bother to send up a couple of free appetizers or something for the long wait. It was completely ridiculous the service was horrible The worst of all it was my daughter's birthday and it really put a damper on that party. We could've gone to Taco Bell and got better food in much less time for significantly less money. Â  I would not suggest anyone eat there ever under any circumstances this was a very very expensive mistake I will never repeat it!!!!!
