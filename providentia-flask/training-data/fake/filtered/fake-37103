What a great place. Al the bartender is awsome & (very handsome).  He can discuss everything from politics to sports. Drinks where perfect and a great blend of liquor with mixer.  Will definitly be back for great food, great drinks, & great conversation with Al. He is a national treasure. PS Nicole the waitress is fun two.  She is quite the hottie.
