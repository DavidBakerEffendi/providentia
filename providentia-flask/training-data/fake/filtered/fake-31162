This review is based on a recent dinner. We were a group of five people all of whom enjoy both eating, and cooking food. The restaurant itself is nicely decorated, with well spaced tables despite its rather small size. We got there early on a Friday night, with a 6:30pm reservation, by 7:30pm the place was packed. The staff was very pleasant and professional in its service although it seemed slightly overwhelmed afterwards. Our bread, salads, and mussels in wine appetizers were wonderful. My friends who did not want to go to a traditional "red sauce" place nevertheless ordered the slowly braised meatballs, and later the three meat lasagna; although tasty they were not overly impressed. However being a Yelp reader, we ordered the striped bass on a bed of couscous, loaded with pine nuts, dried fruit, and a mild yogurt dressing, simply divine. We drank with our meals both a red Tuscan, and a white Gavi both of which perfectly complemented our dinners. We finished our meal with coffee, espresso, and both the baby Jesus cake, and a tasty chocolate torte dessert. Â Overall a very tasty and satisfying dining experience. We shall return, and you too should also give it a try.
