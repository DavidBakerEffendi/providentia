What a great place!  This is a cozy little music with good food and good prices and low music.  That combination will get me to go back very soon -- in fact, I would go every other night.  My wife had pork chops, I ordered Shrimp Linguini.  The "home made" italian salad dressing was the best I've had in a long time, the white bean veg. soup was .. not to my taste. The owner came by and chatted with us, Anna was a very attentive waitress. This restaurant is located in "restaurant row" in Hell's Kitchen.  There are 26 restaurants on this one block and this one has the best prices (the owner says he owns the building so he can charge lower prices) and the best food  .. so far.  The are also known for their pre-theater dinner prices which includes appetizer, soup/salad, entree and dessert (very tasty Tirimisu).
