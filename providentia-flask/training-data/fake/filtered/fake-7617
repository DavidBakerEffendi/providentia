I finally made it over to Selamat Pagi last night, my friends had been raving about it....well, they were right.  Admittedly, this was my first experience with Balinese food, and the descriptions I've seen of 'mix between Thai and Indian' are pretty spot-on.  So we tried a bunch of the appetizers, which were all great - I would say the chicken wings, lemongrass fish/prawn satay, and the fish curry were the highlights (don't worry, there's plenty of vegan options on the menu too).  Had the beef rendang as my entree, which was unbelievable.  Hard to describe, just get it.  And then our group split all of the desserts, which were just awesome.  I'm a longtime fan of Van Leeuwen Ice Cream, several flavors of which are featured heavily on the dessert menu, so I'm a little biased, but they really nailed the desserts.  One other pleasant part of the experience was that they have an extensive beer and wine menu that is reasonably priced.  Really nice vibe in this place too, with good tunes and nice staff.  So all in all, this place is definitely worth the trip.
