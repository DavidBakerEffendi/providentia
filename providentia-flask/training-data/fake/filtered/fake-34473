I thought your last reviewer was me! We've taken our holdays in Southern Vermont most years for over twenty years.  We always visit the Country Girl Diner for breakfast and lunch because of the excellent no-fuss food and terrific atmosphere.  It's alwasy been good and the new owners continue the tradition. Great.  Thoroughly recomend it.
