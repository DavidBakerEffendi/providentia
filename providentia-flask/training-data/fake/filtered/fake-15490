A Vermont classic, with two locations, one in Montpelier, and one in Burlington.  Certainly is a must when you visit. With both delicious meal crepes and dessert crepes, this place is great.  Likewise, they cater to all your food needs, vegetarianism/veganism/gluten-free or for you meat lovers.  The pesto crepe is a hit, as well as the vegetarian one.  And my favorite is the classic nutella dessert crepe, great portion to top off a dinner. Also, they tend to have great live music.  I was there one evening, sitting indoors with the live music inside, and it was the perfect volume! Not too loud that you cannot hear your table conversation, but just loud enough that you can listen if you please. But don't worry, they also have a nice patio to sit outdoors with four to five tables.  Location is right near the water as well! Take note, they also have a vendor stand on Church St if you want a quick, tasty crepe to go!
