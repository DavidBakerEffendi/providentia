This place used to deliver food fine but now they have simply gotten ridiculous. I ordered a cheesesteak and quesadilla from them and it took them three hours...The worst part is their food is pretty good, so its a shame they don't make it for you. Their cheesesteaks are good and they use fresh bread, but the wait time is just pointless. I made another order a few months later and after an hour I called to see if it was still coming. The girl gave me a snarky attitude on the phone. I called another hour later and I she pretended she couldn't hear me even though I had full service on my phone, and then she hung up. The worst part about all this was that I paid with debit. So I think they were just assuming they could take my money and not bring me my food. Long story short, the people that work here are irresponsible and don't deserve your business. Order from somewhere else.
