I have been going to il Piccolo restaurant ever since it opened Â the place may be small but the food and waiter Dennis is outstanding. If you live in Roseland or close by you should really go there to eat. The salmon is wild salmon and is my favorite although I have eaten many of their dishes that is the best. Just bring a bottle of wine and I guarantee you will be very satisfied with your meal. Enjoy!!
