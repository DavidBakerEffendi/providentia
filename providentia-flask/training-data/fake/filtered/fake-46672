This place has some of the best Greek food in New York City.  I'd have to say it's on par with Taverna Kyclades out in Astoria.  There are a few things that Taverna does better and a few things that Kefi does better. Amazing food. For the meze, I had the selection of spreads with pita (free refills on the pita, I believe). Really, really tasty. My favorite was the orange-y one, wish I could remember the name. Maybe the chickpeas spread? For an entree, I decided to try some seafood since my friend told me that Kefi definitely knows how to prepare their seafood. I went with the pan seared bass and whoa, this seriously melted in your mouth. I've never had a more perfectly pan seared bass sitting on such a pretty bed of string beans. Overall, the meal and service was outstanding considering the price point and neighborhood.  Greek comfort food at its near best.
