I give 4 and not 5 only because of their attitudes. The man out the take out counter however is really polite, but most of the waiters/waitress's aren't. I've been here 3 times and they're really snobby, however they do seemed to be very stressed out. Anyway...the food Is a 5! SO AMAZING. I never experienced any Chinese food better then this, this is the reason I keep coming back here all the way from Long Island. This food is to die for. After all you are here to eat, nothing more nothing less so who cares about their attitude when it comes to food like this. Worth it.
