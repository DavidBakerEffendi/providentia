I know Italian food and I have to say that Spasso was completely average. Salad was over dressed, pasta was over cooked, dessert was bellow average. Service was really bad. We had reservations and waited 20 minutes to be seated, waited 20 minutes for the check and the entire time waiters were hustling past our table so fast it was hard to focus on anything else. The place also lacks a general ambiance. I went with my boyfriend for our 3 year anniversary and we were both disappointed with the over-all vibe.
