Ippudo is an incredibly trendy joint requiring an average of a 2-hr-wait on any given day for dinner. But it's well worth it, if only to taste the delicious pork buns (~$4 a piece but quite small), which I believe you can order by the bar while you wait. They were the best pork buns I've ever had. The ramen is good and flavorful but is it worth waiting in line for 2 hours and paying ~$15 per dish? Maybe not but I'd go back any day for those buns!
