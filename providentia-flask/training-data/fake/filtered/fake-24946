Service was very slow, not sure the waiter was ever a waiter before. Sat waiting for cream for my coffee for 10 minutes. Asked what was on my dessert, waiter did not know. He said sugar but it was a nut rolled in sugar. Food was good - not fab! Presentation of food on plate could of been nicer. For the price $$$$ could of been a step above.
