Best damn wings in Philadelphia. Never fried, always smoked, they taste like wings you've never had before. I also got the willie brown burger which was perfection. No room for dessert but I would love to go back to try the banana pudding our waitress was raving about. Great down south atmosphere, with the grill and smoker right in the middle of the restaurant. Tasty food and good service, I'll be coming back.
