I'm putting 1-star because you can't leave it blank. I just had the worst experience of my life in any restaurant. I visited the place today with my colleagues. After ordering the appetizers, we waited for 35-40 minutes and reminded our server, he came back from kitchen to tell us, the place was out of nachos. WOW 1! he was absolutely unapologetic so probably it happens often! When he got the entrees, one of the colleague had ordered burger without chicken patty as he is a vegetarian. This guy didn't bother to check and after showing him that he was gonna 'FIX' it. WOW 2! again no apologies. When he got our check, we had almost spend 2 hrs. in the place, he added few beverages which we hadn't ordered. WOW 3! The staff is rude and have no value for time. There were hardly 5-6 tables occupied so was not a rush hour at all. I won't be going this place. They suck!
