My family and I have been coming to Alfonso's since we moved to the area 18 years ago. The food is always delicious and the portions are enormous. My personal favorite is anything they make with eggplant. I'm not quite sure what they do it, but it is flavorful and when combined with their homemade red sauce, it's fantastic. They also have great specials on the weekends, and even a huge portion of seafood won't cost you more than $18. Plus, their homemade soups have been a welcome treat this winter. The family who owns and operates the restaurant treats every customer like a member of their family. Over the years we have gotten to know them and their wait staff and food staff, and everyone greats you with a warm smile every time you walk through their doors. We also enjoy the fact that the restaurant is BYOB and the kids love their desserts. We've even ordered large amounts of pizza from them for local school events and everyone always asks where the pizza is from. I can't say enough good things about the food, the people and the warm, friendly atmosphere of Alfonso's!
