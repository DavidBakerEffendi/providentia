I don't know what everyone prior is talking about.  I think this place is very cute and I like how CLEAN they are.  The prices are not overpriced for what you get, the prices are normal prices at any other place! $5 for a sandwich, come on people...too overpriced? Then what's Subway? LMAO. People just hating. I think the food here is great! And have just the right amount of everything in their wraps and sandwiches.  The people are very polite and welcoming. I greatly recommend to try this place.
