I've been eating at Kelly's since it opened but I can't help but realize how much the atmosphere in this restaurant is declining. On my last visit to Kelly's I was eating with my friend, but that was a job all in itself given that the manager had his loud kids running around playing in the middle of the restaurant. To make matters worse the manager started screaming at the waitstaff in the middle of dinner. It was almost chaotic. The night would've been a total bust If the food was so good. Its clear this isnt the place you wanna go to enjoy a quiet meal. The owners and management really need to get a handle on the atmosphere because most customers wouldn't have stayed through what I had to endure.
