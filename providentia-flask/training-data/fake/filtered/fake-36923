I've been here several times and have enjoyed the staff, the atmosphere, and most of all the great food. I noticed in a previous review that someone complained of the portion size and the "bangladesh" bartender- 1. The food portions are quite generous so I seriosuly question anyone who needs more than what they give. 2. What relevance does the bartenders ethnicity have in whether he's a smartass or not? (one reviewer mentioned this) Which in my opinion he's not- he's actually friendly and polite. Actually all 3 bartenders who I know work there are great! In any case, I highly recomend this place for the great overall experience it provides!
