Really love the idea of locally and seasonably grown food.  Went for brunch.  The tables are quite tight and close together which makes it hard to have a private or quiet conversation.  The noise level at times can be disconcerting.  The menu sounds terrific.  Service is quite attentive (perhaps too attentive and a feeling of wanting to 'turn over the table' quickly).  We had two different types of eggs.  Mine were not cooked as requested and were sent back to the kitchen.  Ultimately, all tasted quite yummy including all of the bread products.  Focaccia gets a 5 star as do the the Butter Biscuits.  We enjoyed our meal but not as much as when we ate at Back Forty (right around the corner) which has a very similar approach but in a larger venue, broader menu, and stronger cooking.
