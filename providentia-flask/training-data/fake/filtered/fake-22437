I first tried Queens Comfort after moving into Astoria about a block away.  I had heard from friends that Queens Comfort had great food and service, so I brought my family and girlfriend who were visiting to try a good Brunch place near me. We showed up near the end of brunch and had about a 30 minute wait.  But the wait felt like nothing! The door man named Avatar was very friendly and outgoing.  He told us jokes and made waiting in line seem a lot shorter.  They also have comic books and menus outside to help pass the time!  When we were finally seated we entered into a wonderful, lively and colorful establishment.   The place was very lively and fun, it happened to be the owner's birthday and the wait staff brought out a cake for him and the entire restaurant sang him Happy Birthday.  The atmosphere is amazing but can only be beaten by the amazing food they have to offer.  We all had a hard time deciding on dishes because they all sounded so good but I landed on a type of eggs benedict.  Our food came out fast and was amazing!  They even brought us orange juice for our champagne (it is BYOB).   Overall I give Queens Comfort a great rating and would recommend it to anyone in Astoria on a leisurely Sunday afternoon! You will be seeing more of your new neighbor Queens Comfort, thanks for the great time and food!
