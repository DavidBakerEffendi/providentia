The service was great.  The food had so much potential at the Sunday fixed prix chef's choice.  The antipasti course was good and so were the mussels, but main courses (meatballs/sausage, the pastas, gnocchi, etc. were just too salty. . .  a similar problem at Popolino, a sister restaurant in the neighborhood.  We suspect it was the tomato sauce.  We drank (what seems like gallons) of water since we returned home.  I mentioned the salt issue to our waiter and I hope he relays the information (or just hides the chef's salt). There was an overabundance of food: huge antipasti, mussels, meatballs and sausage, chicken, pork slices, rigatoni, gnocchi, bucatini, lasagna, arugula salad, selection of desserts . . . more than enough for 4 hungry people.  Reasonably priced for the amount of food. Would have been perfect with less SALT!
