It's an unusual shape. The stools wrap around the bar which sits front and center of the room. I like that even though it's primarily a drinking place the food is great. Who doesn't like a few imaginative offerings to chow down while getting drunk!? What to go for: oysters which come with some cucumber mignonette sauce. Fantastic. Their cocktails are great. Pick whatever you like and I am fairly sure you will not miss.
