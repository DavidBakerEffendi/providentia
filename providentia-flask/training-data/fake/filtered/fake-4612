I had a very nice meal here. Started with some tasty cocktails - I really recommend the cucumbertini (with cilantro!).  The veal cheeks were surprisingly good. And as others have said, the flatbread with honey was far better than I had anticipated! And the ahi...oh the ahi... Service was a bit slow, but we weren't in a rush.  Prices were a bit higher than expected for the stuff we ordered, but not outrageously so.   Leave it that I'll try to make it back.
