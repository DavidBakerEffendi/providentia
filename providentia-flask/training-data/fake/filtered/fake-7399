I do not like like this unpretentious looking place so full of... pretentions. I do not like to leave a restaurant hungry after spending $150 for two. I do not like the owner's fake smile and "Abraham the pit bull". But I really wanted to like it. So close from home. We went three times. Â Why? Food can be good and after the first time I wanted to believe that the Chef was running out of ingredients as how to explain the ridiculous size of my entree. Second time Abraham was suffering from a "hate you all" attack and the owner was looking miserable with her "minimi" hanging on her belly (good, at least the baby seems really well fed) But at our table, portion size did not increase. Third time the wait was so long that we finally found the courage to take the car to go somewhere else even if that would take us 45min to find a spot on the way back home (Park Slope can be bad, yes) Sometimes it is better to tell a customer the true about the wait: "I apologize but I don't think I will have anything before an hour". Instead of assessing a 15 min wait and expecting someone to wait an hour...Because not only that customer may not wait but there is a good chance he won't ever come back.
