One of my favorite all-around restaurants in Brooklyn. The food never disappoints, the service is always helpful and friendly, and the atmosphere is warm and congenial. The Sullivan Farm Chicken is always a good bet - moist, flavorful and more than you'd like to admit you're able to eat. However, the duck is hands down my entree of choice. Great desserts as well - but I hope they bring back the salted chocolate tart!
