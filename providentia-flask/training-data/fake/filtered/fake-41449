dinner for 4 on 4-6-2012.  We had the palntain as an app -  well done, very ripe and naturally sweet. No sugar add3ed. They could have been just a tad crispier.  Also had cod fritters as an app.  Magnificant.  Dinners were Ropa, which was excellent and Lechon (roast pork).  The "sauce" for the LEchon was perfect.  Ask for an extra tablespoon of it if you can.  Delicious.  The Spanish rice side was very nice with a hint of tabasco -  flavor but no heat.  And the rice and beans cook together was very solid as well.  The Sangria was light and delicious without being sweet or too fruty.  And the desserts were out of this world.  The best rice pudding I've ever had and the Flan was even better. We had 5 cups of cuban coffee and the bill was $111,  very reasonable.  This place is a real jewel.  It only seats about 60 people and it's always full.  They take no reservations but they seem to turn tables fairly quickly so the waits are not that long.  And dinner never seems rushed.  This is a new FAV for me.
