Stopped by burlington with my wife on a trip. Desk clerk at hotel said that the Ice House had a really nice atmosphere and would be a nice place to take my wife out for a nice meal. The place had an overall nice feel to it. Beautiful interior. But would not recommend the decks. Although my wife and I wanted to sit out on the deck, we could see that the plastic chairs would not be that comfortable and so decided to stay inside. Towards the end of the night we order the last of our drinks with desert. My wife wanted to take a look around the upstairs while we waited for desert and found the bartender in a foul mood claiming "god damit, just as I was about to close, more drinks!" My wife told me what happened and we left after desert. Overall- not worth the money or the trip with the staff attitudes.
