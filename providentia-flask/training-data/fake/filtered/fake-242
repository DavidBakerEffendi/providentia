I haven't eaten here in a while but, they've always been better than Genos. Unfortunately, Genos AND Pats are the two most overrated steak joints in the entire city of Philly! Their prices are out of whack for something that you can get elsewhere that tastes better, at a better price, and you probably won't have to drive as far to get it! They are the two most famous places, no doubt...so, if you are flamboyant, like Perez & Paris Hilton and you want flash over substance then go here and waste your money!
