Our lunch visit to Caseus was a spur of the moment reservation for my wife and I based on online reviews and their menu.  Even though it was a quick lunch, I can assure you that the reviews are not over-stated.  The food is amazing - classic and inventive, lots of locally sourced ingredients, and a knowledgeable and enthusiastic staff.  The atmosphere is personal and inviting, with a nod towards the funky.  The manager came by our table to talk and assisted us with two additional reservations in the next few weeks.  (Yes, we REALLY liked it!)  I had the grilled cheese with jambon de paris on rustic bread and it was incredible.  Yes, it was on the heavy side, but I took the second half home for another meal, and my wife did the same with her mac and cheese.  The hardest part of the first visit was making a choice from the intriguing menu items and specials.  We are really looking forward to going back for some of the more innovative dishes on the menu.  Caseus leapt to the top of our favorite spots in Connecticut list. We are going back - our only regret is that it is not closer to our home!
