I wish I had better things to say about the Wishing Well.   I live in the neighborhood, and want to love it, but I don't.  I previously steered away, as other reviewers mention, due to the smell, but still gave it an occasional visit - as their food is not bad, service typically good, and decent beer selection.  Unfortunately, I think those days of sporadic visits are over.   I was there this past Saturday around noon, during the Italian Market Festival.  I didn't think this would be an issue... I was wrong.  Our server explained that due to the festival, they had a limited menu.  Totally understandable.  I inquired about drink specials - was told the mimosas were $5.  The last time I was there for brunch (6 weeks ago) they were $3.  Price increase for the festival?  We ordered a couple of beers - served to us in plastic cups.  I thought this was odd, since we were not festival-goers, we were sitting inside to eat.  Next, I tried to order a hot dog as none of the food on the reduced menu was jumping out at me, and they were serving hot dogs outside for the festival.  I was told I could have that, but I would have to go outside and purchase the hot dog myself and could bring it inside.  Really?  My friend ordered the shame burger and it was served on a plastic plate.  I have to say I'm pretty bothered by the wishing well charging $14 for a burger and serving it on plastic... festival or not.  The service was slow and they were not that busy.   Overall, it was disappointing experience and I won't be back.
