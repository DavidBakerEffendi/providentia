Just OK for Max Fish.  My husband and I sat at the bar to have dinner and were disappointed by the slow and unprofessional service by two of the three bartenders.  The third was fantastic, unfortunately, he only helped us for a moment while the other two were deep in conversation.  Layer of dust on top of the silver box the beer taps come out of was also not pleasant to look at.  Food was served promptly and it was ok.  I doubt that we will try Max Fish again.
