I do a lot of traveling and I try a lot of new restaurants and I thought based on the reviews Ekta was a sure bet to get a good Â Indian food unfortunately I was dead wrong 1st of all it is a take out only and it is not more than a hole in the wall that by itself is not a problem, the problem is the food we tried chicken tandoori, Lamb Korma, and lamb beryani the only food that was barely eatable was the tandoori I called to tell them about our disappointment and the owner's response was to not try us again big let down.
