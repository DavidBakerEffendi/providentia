So me and few coworkers are in town and read the reviews here on yelp and decided to give this place a try. Great and friendly service, and outstanding food to boot. Make sure to save room for dessert as they had plenty to offer, but the pineapple cocconut cake came highly reccomded. We all were glad that we took the reccomendation on dessert.
