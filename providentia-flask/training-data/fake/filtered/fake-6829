I'll go there again just to support neighborhood business. Bar is okay. Don't order the Lamb. That poor wee thing, he spiced it, burnt it. May as well be an assault victim in a ditch for all the love the chef showed this food. Perfect mix of hipster style and pretension. Bar is average, will go again. Probably order a beer and some french fries. Yay! Support Local Business! Having just read the other reviews, I'm guessing most: A. Are friends of owner B. Haven't eaten at a good restaurant before.
