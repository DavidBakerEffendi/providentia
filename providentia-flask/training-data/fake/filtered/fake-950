I have to agree with most of the reviews. We have loved JoJo's since JoJo himself was around and young!! The food is fabulous..gotta say! Kudos to the chef, but the new "JoJo"(sorry JoJo! I know there will never be another JoJo!! Miss U!) his name is Carmen..the son ; he is rude, unfair, unorganized and insulting. He seats his peeps (which is his prerogative; it is his place) and leaves people with reservations waiting for and hour and a half.. Good luck with parking and seating...we won't be back...I like a place that appreciates (at least a little) our money..
