Avoided the place that was here for several years, then it shut down. It was raining and I saw a new sign up that said KITCHEN OPEN LATE. Under new management doesn't begin to say what has happened in this bar. Really friendly bartender. I had the Retro Burger and it was great. Good place to watch the game. NOW I HAVE A NEW NEIGHBORHOOD BAR!!!
