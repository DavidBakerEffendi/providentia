one of the worst dining experiences I have ever encountered. My friend and I were there today. We were the first people in the restaurant and the LAST to be served. Instead we watched a party of 2 and a party of 6 that arrived after us receive their meals first (making it worse, the party of 6 was all white women, so i guess they really didn't want to make them wait) I was utterly disgusted and couldn't believe what I was seeing. I will never eat a Peaches or Smoke Joint or any other related establishments again. I would never recommend to anyone, as much as I'd like to try and support I can't. Absolutely unacceptable and disgusting customer service.
