Been an 'Inn' fan since it opened but the food has actually gotten even better recently. Not sure why. I haven't been there in a couple of months.  I took my 2 teenage children there tonight  to send my son off to his sophomore year in college. Unbelievable meal! Staff/Service was top-notch but that's nothing new. Atmosphere was, as always, amazing. It was a beautiful night so we ended up dining outside.  I had the Grilled Ahi Tuna which was the best I've ever had. BUT the wasabi mashed potates were equally great. My college bound son opted for the thin crust pizza. Having grown up in Jersey he knows his  pizza and, as always, he loved it. My daughter went for the burger which, according to her, was better than the burgers voted 'best in Morris County'. And she would know.  Plus it's the only place where the 'crispy potatoes' were crispy as advertised. Can't wait to go back with my more discriminating friends to check out the rest of the menu.Tip of the day: If in doubt for an appetizer, go for the Crispy Calamari Two Ways, Tuna Tartare, or Seared Scallops. You won't be dissapointed.
