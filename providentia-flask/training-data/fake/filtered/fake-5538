I go to Hu two times a day. On my way to work for breakfast and on my way home for dinner. It's been a few months like this and im still not sick of it. I have been having problems with my thyroid (dry skin, losing my hair, foggy, tired, etc) so I have been very conscious about what I eat. Between hu, omega-3's and my probiotics... I feel like a new person. It's a great place to get amazing tasting food that is also so good for you. It's expensive because its quality, real food. Plus you know exactly what they use to cook everything. You can get taco bell for $2 but you arent even eating food. Its crap. Also, the people that run Hu are just really good guys. They always say hi to me and make me feel welcome. It makes a huge difference in this city where people usually treat you like crap or just dont care that youre there.  Its my happy place in New York. Get the quinoa bowl/half veggie mash with thai chicken, almond, seeds and cilantro  AMAZING! Also, their brussel sprouts and asian slaw are great plus the blondie tastes like heaven.
