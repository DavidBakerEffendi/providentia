This is one of the best places to go to have lunch in the midtown area.  The sandwiches/salads are good and the lunch special is great for a lot of variety.  Breakfasts are tasty as well - muffins and especially the croissants in a number of varieties (nutella, cream, sugar, jam, almond, whole wheat, plain).  They have some kind of dessert happy hour which means that the desserts sell out in the late afternoon.   It gets quite crowded at peak lunch hours though so it can be hard to get a table.
