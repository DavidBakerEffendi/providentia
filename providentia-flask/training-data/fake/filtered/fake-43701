If I could give this place ten stars I would.... no, no, 80 stars!I Â  I met up with my friends and had the Burger. Loved the record player, loved the staff, loved waiting, cause you will. Totally worth it, adorable staff, knowledge was key... We sat outside and ended up staying too long casue they have amazing cocktails. Burger med/rare = A+! Put an Egg on it, SLAM DUNK!
