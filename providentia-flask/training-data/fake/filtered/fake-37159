BETWEEN THE BEERS AND THE BALLS, I AM TOTALLY IN PIG HEAVEN!!! Awesome beer selections, fantastic food, great service and a very welcoming environment!!  I have been to the Blind Pig a few times now and each time I am more impressed.   First of all I am a beer lover and John, the bartender, is always attentive to make sure you are pleased with your selection.  As a matter of fact, he goes out of his way to make sure all of the customers are happy and taken care of!!  Along with the rest of the staff, John presents a welcoming environment when you come in, so much that it's hard to leave!!    (Also, if you sit at the bar and have a few cold ones, I highly recommend the organic beef and pork jerky that is made locally for the restaurant.) Ok onto the real food... When I first tried the Thanksgiving Balls I thought I was in love.  The lamb sliders were perfection and the sweet potato hash that was served with the pork chop is still in my dreams.   When I went back again I had the new "Blue Balls" which are my current love affair.  Seriously,  these things are made with true love.  The braised short ribs and the blue cheese...come on...  if you do nothing else in your life,  you have try these things!!!!   Not to mention, the mussels and the salmon, which were also quite lovely.   Whether you are going out for drinks with friends or for a full meal with family,  the Blind Pig will truly give you the experience you are looking for for a fantastic night out!
