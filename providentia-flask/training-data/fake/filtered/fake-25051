Had the opportunity to come here after picking up a friend from the airport last week.  This was a great choice!  The decor is funky and inviting, and the space itself is relly beautiful.  A teensy drawback is that, when people are loud, it can be hard to hear your tablemates, but since we were seated to a party of 10 ladies reliving their sorority days, that's hardly the fault of the establishment.  ;-) There were three of us and we shared hamachi ceviche (yummy!), pulpo skewers (awesome!), the fish tacos, carnitas, tlayudas, and then dessert.  The ironically titled Domingo Sundae and some ice cream - so good! I live in a more suburban area and the chance to get to a place in a walkable, urban neighborhood was a nice change of pace!  I'd come back to La Calaca Feliz anytime!
