Hi, I have to vote against Shane and John. I'm sorry but the experience that I've had in this restaurant is nothing compared to BRAZA!!! First- at this restaurant you pay for a plate very close to what you pay at Braza for all you can eat. At Braza they have 12 to 14 types of meats, and a very big varity of salad, which Brazil grill it's not even close!!! Braza also has a atmosphere that this restaurant can't compare to. At this restaraunt there's only bathroom that you have to share with the cleaning supplies and anyone that comes into the restaraunt. At Braza there is both a boy's and girl's bathroom with handicap accessibilty. I don't have anymore words to describe the good things that Braza has, but if you ever feel like trying Brazlian food, don't go to Brazil Grill. BRAZA IS THE REAL DEAL.
