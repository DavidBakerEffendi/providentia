I've been to this place many times, and I love it every time.  It has great comfort food with a very fun scene.  It's a great place for teenagers, with an extensive list of mocktails.  Their deserts are incredible-I love the deep fried oreos with the chocolate shake in a shot glass and the mint chip ice cream! The tomato soup is great-creamy, with a grilled cheese crouton.  The brunch options are always excellent as well.  This is not the place to go to if your a healthy eater, as delicious as the food is.  It can be hard to get into sometimes- there usually is a short wait, but nothing too ridiculous.  It's also a great place for a late night bite, as it's open 24 hours.  Though this restaurant is not particularly a kids place, if you bring them early in the day they should be fine, as it wont be as crowded and loud.  They will definitely find something to eat.  Cafeteria is a great place to go.
