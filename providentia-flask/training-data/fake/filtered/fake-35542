Best pizza ever.  I always order my pizza plain, no mozz just sauce, garlic and grated cheese.  The sauce at Modern is incredible and no one else can compare.   If you're looking for pizza with toppings like chicken or mashed potato go to Bar but if you want the best New Haven style pizza go to Modern!
