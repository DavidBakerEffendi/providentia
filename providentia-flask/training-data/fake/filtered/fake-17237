Andros Diner is one of the best friendly fun energentic hang out spot.... Their food are very good, the waitress are very friendly, the manager is a fun guy.... You can not leave without a smile on your face.... It also say a lot when the Mayor of Newark is a frequent visitor.... I very highly recommend it.... The atmosphere is like family....
