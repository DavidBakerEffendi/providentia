It was good when I went but I think I was expecting to much. All my friends and family said it was a really nice and really fancy restaurant. The fancy part was pretty much accurate but I wasn't a big fan of the food. We ordered an appetizer which was a simple Mexican dish, chips and guac. The chips were hard and cold and the guacamole was pretty good the I got this taco sampler which looked very appetizing when the server brought it out. But I didn't like it all for some reason the tastes didn't go together. I was a little Â disappointed but they seem to be doing good with the line of customers out the door.
