This was actually my first time to try a banh mi sandwich.  I have no words for how delicious it was.  I had several friends say this place serves the best banh mi in New York.  I highly recommend you try it.  There is seating, or you can take your food to go.  The portions are huge and the prices are very low.  I loved it and will definitely be going back.
