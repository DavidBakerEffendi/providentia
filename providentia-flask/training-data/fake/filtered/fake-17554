Friendly service; tons of Japanes patrons and a Japanese din.  Felt like I was back in Japan.  Quirky basement location makes it even more fun. The tendon set for lunch was nice -- delicious rice and lightly battered, freshly prepared tempura.  The cold soba was refreshing on a hot, humid day. Best Japanese restaurant I've been to in years.
