4 and 1/2 stars so far???  I don't get it, I just don't. We tried Koch's recently and were quite a bit let down.  I went wanting an egg salad sandwich.  Well, they were out of egg salad (when the heck is a deli ever out of egg freaking salad for the sake of jeebus--never on my watch), so I went with the Vegedelphia meat "cheesesteak".  It was ok, but not the greatest thing I'd ever had, and at $7.50, was a shadow of what one can get at Gianna's, for example, for a similar price.  My companion wanted a sandwich with a variety of meats, and it came to him completely unbalanced.  Way, way too much meat and not enough veggie.  The tomato was very thin, and he got only one lettuce leaf.  The sandwich he ordered was also supposed to be only $7.50, but he was somehow charged $10.50.  I'm pretty sure he got ripped off by three dollars. Sandwiches were also very slow to be made.  It wasn't like the place was packed either, with only two people ahead of us and no one waiting. Our food was not bad in spite of the place seeming dirty, and the owner seemed very nice, but we won't be seeking this out again.  Want a cleaner, better place and deal?  Try Stan's in Powelton Village.
