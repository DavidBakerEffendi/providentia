If you don't want to trek into the city and pay the toll, parking or risk getting a $50 ticket. Go to noodle chu's for authentic NY Chinatown Cantonese food. The beef or chicken pan fried noodles reminds me of hop Kees on Mott street. Their beef with broccoli chinese style is also as If you're eating in Hong Kong (and I've lived in HK). Can't beat the prices as well. Beef pan fried noodle only $10 bucks. Dim sum on Sunday is good as well but sit next to the kitchen where u get first dibs before they run out of food
