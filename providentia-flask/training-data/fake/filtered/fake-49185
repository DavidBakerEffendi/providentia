Had a very bad experience with dragonfly. I had made reservations last tuesday for 22 people for friday 3/16 for my birthday. The person on the phone confirmed my reservation and even took my credit card number to make sure that we were coming. I told all of my friends to be at dragonfly on friday night at 8:30 for my birthday dinner and everyone was coming. Friday after noon at 5:00...3 1/2 hours before we are all going to the restaurant the manager calls me and tell me that they cannot accommodate Â my party...leaving me with 22 people on my birthday on a friday night with no where to go. This was the worst customer service experience i have ever had in my life. I have read all of the other reviews for this place saying how big it is and how great it is for large parties...and they COULDN'T accommodate me. Just thought I'd put this information out there. Also, the manager on the phone didn't have any record of my credit card number, and had no idea who took my reservation which is completely irresponsible. Now I have no where to go on my birthday and have no idea who has my credit card number. Anyways, I don't think I will be eating at dragonfly EVER and I hope no one ever has to have this experience with them. Thank god for a wonderful italian restaurant in west field who was able to accommodate my friends and I last minute.
