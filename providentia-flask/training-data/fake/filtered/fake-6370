This is literally the worst restaurant experience I've encountered in my life! I arrived at 6pm on a Friday night, my party orders weren't taken until about 6:30pm and afterward were ignored until 7pm. There was only one Hibachi cheft for a busy night and we didn't get our hibachi show until 7:15pm, no joke! They screwed up our order and were really rude about it. The service is beyond slow and rude! Do not eat here if you need to be somewhere within two hours. We had to even get our own utenils the waitress was super slow and scattered brain.
