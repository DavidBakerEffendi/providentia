My husband and I, along with other family members went to Bonefish Grill  on Rt 1 in Lawrenceville NJ on March 22, 2014 for his Birthday dinner. Before we ordered the mix and share meal  of steak,salmon,scallops and shrimp, with 2 side dishes of  potatoes for $ 17.99 per person, I asked  our waitress if it would be enough for 2 people to share  and she assured us that portions were generous and more than enough for each person. The house salad came in first and it was very good.Then the shock came in second: we were served very small steak, very small salmon, TWO small flat scallops and TWO small to medium shrimp to share between my husband and me. Portions of potatoes were small too; looked like 2 scoops of ice cream , with some cheackpeas  between each scoop. Steak was good, salmon nothing special, scallops and shrimp tasted old, and really suspiciuous, potatoes tasted good. The flouerless brownies were good, but too sweet.  We shared and ate it because we were hungry, and we were still hungry when we left the reataurant. We did not complain to the manager; she was going from table to table and talked to customers and we did not want to make the noise re  the quality and quantity of food  served, but most of all we did not want  to upset my husband and his special day. We decided that we would NEVER, EVER go back there again! Why would we go back the the place were the waitress lies to us, serves us so little, but no specially tasty  food that we leave retaurant hungry( we are not  big eaters  by any means) and were there is only TWO types of fish that is wild cought ; all rest is "humanely farm raised" as stated by our waitress.At least she did not lie to us about that ! Service was O.K.;  too many servers in white jackets made the place very  crowded, and, unfortunately, they could not improve poor quality of food served. Here, I said my peace.
