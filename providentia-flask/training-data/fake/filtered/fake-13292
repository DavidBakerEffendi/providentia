Came here for brunch on a Sunday and of course  it was packed out.  However, I was lucky enough to get seated at the bar.  No wait.  Woohoo. I had the veggie burger and my friend had the special of the day which was a pastrami hash.  The veggie burger was great.  The flavor of pesto on the burger was amazing and perfect.  The burger also came with French fries that were delicious.  Not oily at all.  The pastrami hash was good.  Probably wouldn't order it again but it was nice to try.   Service was very friendly.
