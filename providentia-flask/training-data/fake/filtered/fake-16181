I went 2 days in a row and I have been satisfied. Although it's quite loud and crowded the food is filling. I had the spicy chicken, not much a fan of the sauce but love the chicken. The buttermilk mash are amazing. The drinks aren't great so I suck to th soda. The Oreo desert is ok also but the bread pudding is just too much too consume. Â This is the IT spot if you want to be seened and don't mind waiting. I will be back again at least once a wk until summed is over. I love the seating outside.
