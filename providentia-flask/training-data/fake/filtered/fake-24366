We have frequented this place several times and thought the food was good however the last time we went it was below average. The waiter must have been new and took the wrong order so by the time people at my table got their entrees I was sending back my order because it was not what I ordered, I had to watch everyone else eating while I was still waiting for my food. I saw someone in the kitchen explaining to the waiter the difference between the two duck entrees.The worst was when someone in my party who is a diabetic and is not allowed to have white rice(they do not have brown rice)asked if he could have a small bowl of broccoli was charged $4.00 without letting him know there would be a charge. Previously they never charged for this. When I spoke to the "Manager" (why a place like this would need a manager is mind boggling) he said "That's just the way it is. If you don't want to come back that's fine." Well you know what there are plenty of other Thai restaurants to frequent and for their cost of 50 cents for a few steamed broccoli florets I will take my business elsewhere. I see this as really bad customer service on their part.
