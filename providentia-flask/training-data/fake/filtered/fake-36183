The food was great but the service was atrocious -- and this is coming from generally lax, neighborhood folks who are used to bad Greenpoint service. They essentially forgot our table, which was in the corner and hot and muggy due to the fan being pointed in the opposite direction. Different waiters took 20 minutes to take our drink order then proceeded to forget our drinks. They didn't bring out silverware or napkins and food was brought out haphazardly. Additionally, our starving friend's one dish was forgotten entirely and the busboy who finally brought it over 25 minutes later (after everyone else had finished their main courses) didn't even apologize when he rested it down in front of her. Our table wasn't cleared so in desperation due to crowding, we were forced to put some of our dishes on an empty one next to us. While this felt a little rude on our part, no one even noticed, as no one had really bothered to check in with our table all night at all. After waiting to be noticed for the check, we asked for it ourselves and while we'd love to say it came promptly, it did not. In fact, we were so ignored, that we probably could have walked out of the restaurant without paying and no one would have noticed. We did enjoy the light and flavorful radishes, chicken, tomato & corn salad, beans, lamb croquettes, and flaky bread. It is a nice space and the food definitely stood out, but they have a long way to go with getting the kinks out of their service. I'm assuming some positive write-ups means that they had more crowds than anticipated. Here's to hoping that they start to better handle the modest influx before they lose potential repeat visitors who actually live in the neighborhood rather than folks who just read about the hottest new place in UrbanDaddy or Time Out and took the water taxi over.
