A very good standby when you have guests in town - a celebrity chef name and very nice servers. Â The salads/appetizers are fine, but the $23 pasta special is a nice change and there are likely to be at least two pastas you want second helpings of...Cramped space and yes, I did see a small bug crawling on the wall (it is on the bottom floor of a townhouse in the theater district restaurant row after all)...
