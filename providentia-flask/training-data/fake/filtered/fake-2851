Management/Host staff Stink!!   My family has been there a couple of times as the food is great. Our most recent experience (and last) the front desk staff were terribly rude telling my family to wait on the stairs (family = 3 kids 7,7, 10 year olds) as the area in front of the desk was crowded... I said I was fine and pointed out that it is a fire hazard to have so many people standing on the steps.  That was met with the "owner" telling me it would be 30 minutes before we could be seated followed by him yelling and cursing at me.  I was totally shocked and sad to say I'll never go back...Hopefully the kitchen staff goes somewhere else!!!
