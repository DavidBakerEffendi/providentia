Now I get it.  Rough reviews get removed.  This time I will tone it bit. I have fam who can throw-down on crispy BBQ ribs that can melt in your mouth.  I am reiterating...The Wood Pit is still the pits!  The ribs were burnt & a real jawbreaker.  The collard greens, mac & cheese were tasteless.  I did take a chance on the chicken...it was ok...I'm still here.   By the way, this is the first & last order for 3.  None of us were pleased.  I definitely will not be recommending.  FYI...the owner was not present. In response to Lawrence.  I am not offended by other people's personal opinion (reviews).  If, they enjoyed whatever was served; then, power to them. It used to be:  You can't go wrong in a hole-in-the-wall restaurant.  Those ol' school days are obviously gone.  There is no doubt, you will probably be in business for a very long time.  Good luck!
