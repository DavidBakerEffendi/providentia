I'll be brief, so I don't waste your time like I did eating at this dump tonight.  Experience: ice cold, tasteless, beans-out-of a-can meal! It was disgusting. Do yourself a favor head to the store buy a can of beans, place inside cold tortilla and save yourself $40.  You've been warned..seriously.
