After seeing this place on Man vs. Food I couldn't wait to try it. Went to the market the next day and was not impressed with the roast pork sandwich. Don't Â get me wrong it was tender and juicy from all the au jus but I just didn't get what he was raving about. Wondering if I ordered it wrong and I definitely should have gotten the long hots and not just the broccoli rabe but I still think it would lack flavor. The best thing about the sandwich was the roll! Want a tasty sandwich? Leave it!
