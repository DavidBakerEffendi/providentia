I've had sushi all around Manhattan and north Jersey, and this is quite the hidden gem.  Though they have paired some crazy combinations, which I think is a bit 'American' of the food genre, their food is incredibly fresh and well prepared.  It is also BYOB, which makes it a very affordable meal.  I live 5 minutes from this place and often call ahead on my ride home from work to pick up some food.  Never disappointing.
