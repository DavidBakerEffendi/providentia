I loved this place.  This place is where people come for some real meat, and it's not for anyone watching their weight.  Expect delicious, flavorful BBQ with serving sizes big enough that you most likely will need a box to take some home with you. I have had the grilled BBQ shrimp and "1/2 Chicken" from their menu, along with a wide assortment of sides and appetizers.  The meats are given the perfect amounts of marinades and spices (and in case you need more, they have a wide variety of sauces including their house special triple x sauce). I wasn't terribly impressed with the hush puppies the waitress recommended, but the sides were good enough to make me want to come back.  The mac n' cheese and fried okra were a delightful compliment to my meal!  I packed the banana pudding home with me, and it too was surprisingly tasty even though it seems like such a simple dessert. The price is decent, and it is the only place around this neighborhood with good BBQ.  The bar also seems to have a nice selection, and you can watch as the chefs prepare all of the BBQ meats.  I wasn't a big fan of the ambience either; the music blaring so loudly that I could barely hear the person sitting directly across from me.  Overall, I wouldn't come here regularly just because the food is so high in calories, but it's certainly a nice treat to enjoy when you're around Penn's campus.
