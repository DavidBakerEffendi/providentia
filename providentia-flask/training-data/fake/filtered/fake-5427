This is one of favorites places!! The decoration is beautiful, very fancy, I also like the staff outfit. The service was great!! The food "as usual" is very good!! The tuna tartar,the sesame tofu,the shrimp appetizers are one of my favorites. But the best part comes when they bring you the bill. Prices are very,very affordable. Is always a lots of food for few bucks. I go there two or four times a week.
