I'm addicted.  This place is right around the corner from my work and I find myself craving Nom Nom Ramen.  The spicy broth of the karai is the perfect thing on a cold, windy day.  Or, if you're feeling a bit under the weather.  The pork belly is amazing and so full of flavor.  Sometimes I find myself walking in just for the pork bun appetizer, which is a tad pricey at a little over $6.00, but so, so good.  You order at the counter and they bring out the steaming bowl of ramen to your table.  You can also order it to go, and it comes well packed with the broth in one container and the noodles and add-ons in another.   My only negative is that it's cash or level up only.  Oh the woes when I crave Nom Nom and go to find that I don't have any cash on me.  On the plus side, there's an ATM right outside the restaurant.  ENJOY!
