Admitting how often I come here is super embarrassing, but this is where I get my lunch when I'm working 98% of the time. The food is good, but what really makes me love coming here is the rad customer service. Working on Church St I know how frustrating it can be dealing with people, and I usually tolerate the subpar customer service I get at other lunch places, but I have never had a bad customer experience here. I'd love to give props to the guy who usually helps me, but I am terrible and cannot remember his name (seriously though, I'm terrible, I see him all the time) he is beyond excellent, and is an invaluable asset to the Boloco team.
