Caracas is a great ambassador of Venezuelan flavor. As a proud native i can say that they do a great job of translating the delight of eating in a late-night arepera in a new york setting. Their Reina Pepiada, although leaner than the mayonase based original recipe, delivers the same rich flavor and culinary experience. 5 estrellas!
