Found a great little Indian place, we came in early and the service was very good. Nice atmosphere, the Chicken Tika was well done and not that spicy. They also do a good take out service.  Overall a nice place to go to , price was ok,  Good experience and friendly. Pleasant and efficient wait staff.
