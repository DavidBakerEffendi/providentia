The food is pretty good, I mean I have to admit. But the service and price was ridiculous. The price for an individual dish was bearable but when the bill came to the table it was terrible. For a table of 8, we had to pay 188 (tip included). But each of our meals was averaged around $15. Here's one of the awful parts, a pitcher of soda was priced at $12.75 or so. Had I known that the price of soda was that much, our table woudn't have gotten it! We would've walked over to a Rite-Aid or CVS and bought a 2-liter bottle of soda (the same amount as the pitcher) for $2. When we actually calculated the bill, because it seemed a little high, we counted a flaw. We asked this dude to re-check what he charged us for and he came back with the bill at $10 higher than before! At this point we were crying/ laughing hysterically/ pissed because it went up, but the bill was obviously not right. We made this guy re-calculate the bill again and the price was knocked down to around $180. We gathered all of our money, which was enough for it all, and gave it to the guy. He said we were $50 short, so we knew something was wrong. This guy couldn't count for his life. I'm pretty sure he had up a 3rd grade education or something. When it was all settled, we were pretty angry at this guy. He seemed like the kind of sketchy fellow so I was onto something the moment I saw him. The wait-staff was not nice in any way, shape, or form. I wish the tip wasn't included, we would've tipped less (;
