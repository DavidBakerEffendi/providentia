So after having a great brunch a few weeks ago I decided to go and check it out for dinner.  Personally I love the style of food they serve even though its being done now in a lot of places, the local,sustainable thing.  We started with chicken wings, deviled eggs, squid, and my DC has a dandelion salad.  The chicken wings were more like chicken lollipops that were fantastic, the deviled eggs had a bit too much paprika that was echoed in another review, the squid was unbelievably tender that i could see myself wanting more.   The salad was well done as well. The entrees was also very good, we had the scallops which were cooked perfectly, carmelized on the outside and almost raw on the inside which is what i love, they had such a nice texture and a wonderfully sweet taste. The rest of the plate was garlic soup (maybe a sauce is correct) and mushrooms that was nice with the scallops.  My DC had rabbit which she loved. It tasted spiced and came with a sweet potato puree which seemed to show the changing of the seasons.  It was kinda funny to see my DC gnawing at it from her hands. For dessert we shared the molasses cake which was kinda like a pound cake and came with a fig jam and some sort of super delicious spiced butter? Very nice. Service was nice, attentive but not overbearing.  The sommelier stole the show though, he was interesting to say the least but the wine he choose went perfectly with what we had.
