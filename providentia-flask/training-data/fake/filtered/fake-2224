If I could give separate reviews for different categories, I'd give 4 for foods and 1 for services. I've had such a bad experience there. It is ok that they make us wait - it's a popular place. But after waiting for 1.5hr in Monday morning (after being told the wait will be 40 min.), and after 25 min. of being seated, NO one comes to ask you anything. We kept looking and caught eyes of the servers many times, who only looked away passed by. No "we'll be there shortly" smile, nothing. Of course the food was pretty good. Pancakes and waffle - awesome, Spanish scramble - below average. But oh how terrible the service was, if there was any! Automatic gratuity built-in the bill. I thought if a restaurant enforces automatic gratuity, they should at least note it somewhere. Us the party of three, the total of food was around 63 dollars, and the gratuity was 9 dollars. Really? When all you did was took the order after half an hour and slammed it on our table? Sure, 9 dollars may be reasonable, but after that service, not having choice to decide how much to give was hard to swallow. I did ask the unfriendly female server if they do this to everyone or just for tourists (I had two guest from Japan with me, and I thought that may be why) She rolled her eyes and spat out, "for everyone! evvvvvvryone gets it!" followed by "and you can only pay with cash." Wow, sorry I asked. I understand the food is good and the place got really popular and busy. They probably have a very good reason to have the automatic gratuity, too. However, the way we encountered the restaurant was pretty unpleasant. After the sweet food, we came out slightly bitter. Not going back most likely.
