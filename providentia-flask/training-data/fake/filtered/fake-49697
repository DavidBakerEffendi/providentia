Beautiful space!  it's just stunning....I almost was convinced that I was in a storybrook.  Food is not amazing, we had the special: braised short rib - lacked flavor and the bread was hard but the crispy shimp salad we had was good.  We asked for a well done burger but got medium well so had to send it back.  For the ambiance/look and feel the service does not measure up. If you are looking for a vacation however to get away for a day - I recommend this place!
