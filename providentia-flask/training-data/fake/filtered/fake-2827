Let me tell you a story about Cuban Pete's. Yesterday 12 of us were there for a friend's birthday, one of my friends asked the manager if he could make the very loud music a little bit quieter, he told her no, if we didn't like it we could leave. About 10 minutes later our waiter came over to the husband of the birthday girl and told him we had to leave, he went over to the manager, and the manager told him we had to leave. As we were leaving I went up to the manager with about 10-15 customers/employees standing around, and got very close ti him and said " you are a fucking asshole, this is friends birthday, but you really did us favor because we will find a better restaurant instead of this shithole place. Please do not go to this restaurant, there are really wonderful eating establishments in Montclair, this is not one of them. We ended up at Fresco, the manager could not have been nicer and more accommodating,considering 12 of us just walked in. It is new to Montclair and located on Church St. please visit them.
