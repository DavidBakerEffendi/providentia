Rudest service ever.  I tipped a snippy little server  just under 20% and she actually chased me down in the street because I guess she thought she deserved more.  Had to ask for water, had to ask for cream twice, had to ask for a corkscrew and nobody even asked how our meal was.  I don't know about you but eating out is a treat and I expect to be treated like I treat my dinner guests.  The food was so so.  My rating is based on terrible service.  If you expect a smile and kind service,  eat somewhere else.
