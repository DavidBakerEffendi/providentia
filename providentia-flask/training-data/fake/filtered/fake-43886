No frills but there is nothing but great thought and culinary execution put into every single sandwich that is made at Paesano's! There isn't a visit that has been made where I am not yearning to return for more. Skip South Philly and the cheesesteak and experience the best sandwiches Philadelphia has to offer, by far.
