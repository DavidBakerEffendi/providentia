I'm Chinese and I don't consider this a true Chinese cuisine, yet it has a nice Americanized flair to it.  I like that they use basils in their dishes that gives them a nice taste.  I think the best deal that the offer is their Chinese Menu- where they serves you rice, soup, and any 3 entrees on the menu.  I didn't think much of their Beef Noodle Soup that I have heard a lot about.  It's a "I had much better soup dishes" kind of feeling.     I find the service to be distasteful.  The servers are very rude and have very slight interest in their jobs.  I know they like to throw dishes onto the table.
