I've been to Guayoyo many times and I can't wait to go again!  My favorite dishes are Queso Blanco Empanada (savory white cheese pastry turnover), Bistec Encebollado (skirt steak with sauteed onions) served with rice and Platanos Fritos (fried sweet yellow plantains).  For dessert, the Flan with caramel sauce is an excellent choice.  Their homemade Sangria is superb.  The atmosphere is comfortable and inviting.  The decor is colorful and fun.  The staff is very friendly.  The Latin music adds a nice touch to this adorable, Venezuelan restaurant.  Guayoyo is my favorite place to dine with friends!
