I have been to this deli 3 times now and i must say it is AWFUL........  The first two times i complained of the wait time.  I had ordered already make meatballs and macaroni which somehow took 15 minutes?????? To heat up i guess.  Second time i ordered the special and i will use that term loosely.  Nothing special about it as the cheese on the chicken cutlet was dried out and barely covering chicken but proudly asked for $8.50 for this crap.  Third time and happy to say my last time i will ever return.  I had taken a different route and ordered Ham, Salami and American Cheese on a  hero.  How bad can that be???  Well i found out.  It was interesting to watch the two mexican employees handle and work as a team to make my sandwich.  After about 7 minutes they signed off on their work and handed it to the cash register creepy lady.  She felt so obligated to open my sandwich up and make it 6 hands that have groped my sandwich to find that they left the Salami off so they removed the contenets and put the salami and reclosed.  It was then loosely wrapped and tossed into my bag and i was sent on my way.  I laughed to myself and told the creepy lady that the sandwich looked like crap and i woiuld never return again.  She said Oh, so i left the deli.  Final insult was when i returned to work and found that the bread was stale.  DO NOT GO TO THIS PLACE.  They are slow, not clean and should be ashamed to open a deli when they do not know the first thing about making a sandwich.
