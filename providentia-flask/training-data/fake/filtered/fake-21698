Best clam chowder soup I have ever tasted! Very rich and creamy taste. I also like their free bread appetizer, but only when it comes out nice and hot. Unfortunately, sometimes it comes out lukewarm. I love the way they cook their prime rib. It is of good quality and also comes out just the way I like it. The portions are nice and big. The service really depends on which waiter you receive, but most of them are very nice and friendly. My only complaint is that there is not much of a selection on their menu. It would be nice if they added more main entrees and types of side dishes. They used to have nice pasta dishes, but took it out a while ago.
