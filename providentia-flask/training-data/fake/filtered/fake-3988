We went with a large group for pizza, mussels,and salad, Food was ok but the kicker was the bad service! the pizza was placed on the table between the children when one of them accidently while grabbing a slice caused the whole pie including the tray to slide on the young childs lap across the table causing a burn to his thighs! The waitress helped clean up the pie and soon returned with a new pie. When we got the bill we where charged for the pie that fell on the child. The pies are placed on this small plate stand and is very unstable! Â They were not concerned with the situation and were not at all courteous! This place is VERY expensive for pizza and salad, It ended up being 18.00 a person including the children! We will NEVER go back and will spread the word on the shameful service we recieved! Very Disappointed! BAD Business ethics!
