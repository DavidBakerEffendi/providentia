Your search for deliciously fresh sushi will end at Yoshi . The owners Jun and Del take pride in their food and it shows. We haven't had a roll that we haven't enjoyed . My wife isn't a big fan of tobiko ( fish eggs) so we get our rolls without it and if we forget they always remember for us . Don't be sucked in by the half price sushi spot by Toys R Us. I'll glad pay full price for the freshest sushi around!
