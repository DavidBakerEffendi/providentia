I recently attended a funeral repast at Miele's. I was very impressed with the food-it was delicious and plentiful! Miele's provided a buffet with several entees to choose from.The tilapia was so delicate and flavorful. The chicken seemed to melt in your mouth! Â The service was wonderful as well. The staff went out of their way to make us feel comfortable. I've been here before for dinner many times and always found it wonderful, but had never thought of them as a catering restaurant before. I will absolutely look at them again the next time I have a party. Lisa Soderman
