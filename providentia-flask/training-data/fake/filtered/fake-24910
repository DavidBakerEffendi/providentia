What Is not to love about this place? The food alone is wonderful, but to step inside and see the earnest, personable owner doing his best for each customer... Well, for me this is the kind of place I'm rooting for to be successful, though that's the least of my worries. Here's why I like the place: - the food is a great alternative to thick syrupy Chinese takeout. Everything tastes very fresh, and without losing flavor the sauces to me taste lighter - I am a vegetarian [edit: was a vegetarian] who tends to avoid eating fake meat -- primarily because I remember how much better real meat tastes and soy alternatives are usually soggy or foul. Not the case here. On a whim I tries the vegetarian General Tso's chicken and it was good, really good! So good I think that if you eat meat every day you'd eat this happily too. - dumplings. These are the true test of a restaurant, according to my kids. And they love them at Black Bamboo. Suggestion: make the vegan chicken available in more kinds of dishes. Overall: excellent!! Congratulations and keep it up!
