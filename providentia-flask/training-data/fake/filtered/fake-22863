This is the BEST Pho ever!  I love it that they have great pho but also that they have other food too; sometimes I wanna be able to eat a variety of food instead of the standard "one specialty" that most pho places often only do.  We are so blessed as this place is literally down the street and around the corner from our house and so it makes it super convenient for us to stop by any time.  The hours are great, the staff is super cool and I know it's going to be the neighborhood hangout for our families that live in the area.  I have told all of my friends about it!
