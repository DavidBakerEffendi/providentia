This is an average dine in/take out soul food restaurant with above average atmosphere, an event room/party area and a liquor license.   I was not terribly impressed with the mac and cheese or the not so sweet yams and the very average, very dry cornbread.  I also ordered baked chicken (dark meat) which was a lil dry;however, the stuffing was delicious.  The carrot cake looked deceptively moist and delicious; I have definitely had better.  From one foodie to the next I would not jump to recommend or order again from this restaurant.  I would just as soon cook my soul food dinner at home.
