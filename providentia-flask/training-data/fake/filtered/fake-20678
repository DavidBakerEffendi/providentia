Yeah, so my co-worker Klaus is from Hamburg Germany and he's always so self-righteous about burgers, acting so smug and superior, like it's his own cousin who invented the hamburger or something. I took him here, thinking if any place can get him to shut up, the Minetta Tavern will. BLACK. LABEL. BURGER. BLACK! LABEL! BURGER! OMFG, that was so good I ordered a second one right away. I didn't look up from my plate at all and when I finally did, I noticed, for possibly the first time ever, that Klaus was not saying anything. He was slumped in his chair in a happy food coma. Minetta Tavern, 1. Â Klaus, 0.
