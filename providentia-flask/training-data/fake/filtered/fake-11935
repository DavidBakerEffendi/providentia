We ate at Ton'y last evening and truly enjoyed our meal.  After looking at the portion sizes we decided to split one dinner.  Even with splitting, we were unable to finish the shrimp fra diavolo which was wonderful.  We didn't order a salad, but we were tempted by the tiramisu which was DELICIOUS and enough for four people.  Unfortunately the two of us ate the WHOLE portion. Wonderful!  We would definitely return again.
