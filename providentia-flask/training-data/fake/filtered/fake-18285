These guys are so friendly it's infectious.  the pizzas are great.  My only complaint is that their sandwich offerings rarely change.  I'd love to see a more rotating menu.  This is where Olives really shines. As a store, I cringe at their prices on staple items.  Butter is $7/lb.  Eggs $6/doz!!  But it's for the breads, meats and kitchen foods that i come here.
