Amazing beer and food. The server recommended the roasted chicken and it was the best chicken I've ever had. It was in a taragon sauce with roasted potatoes and carrots. Go here and order it I promise you will not be disappointed. I also had the summer salad with a garlic herb dressing...the.dressing was the best part. It is one of the greatest.dressings I've ever had, and I'm a sauce/dressing guy. Great beer selection and great atmosphere.
