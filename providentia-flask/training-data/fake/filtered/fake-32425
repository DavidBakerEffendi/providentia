Have just started getting my morning/afternoon coffee at Via Quadronno. The coffee is much more tasteful than the local coffee shops and the servers are personable. Only after a few visits they knew my name and remembered how I took my coffee. I am ready to move up to soup and sandwich on my next visit. Lastly, it always has an atmosphere that is upbeat.
