The appetizers are ok, and seared tuna fish over rice was good.  Sake and beer selections are acceptable.  What's wrong is this place call themselves soba-ya, place of buckwheat noodle have a bad soba noodle dishes.  Noodles are either too cooked--soggy or too hard, tastes like soba that we can buy from Asian stores, it cannot be hand-maid on that premise.
