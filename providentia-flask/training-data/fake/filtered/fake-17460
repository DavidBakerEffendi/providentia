I found out about Despana last week via the internet because I was looking for a local place to buy pata negra for my husband who comes from the South of Spain.  We got up early this Sunday morning and headed on out to Soho to see for ourselves all the authentic Spanish cuisine.  My first impression was not of awe as I was disappointed in that an establishment that sells authentic Spanish cuisine would have behind the counter women who were not from Spain (they are Mexican) not the same thing.  The owner I was told is from Columbia, another let down.  The majority of the staff excluding the manager who is from Mallorca, Spain are from Mexico.    As for the bocadillos, yes the chorizo tortilla was heavenly and the cod croquet as well.  But I went in the hopes of finding authentic churros, and what I got was a Mexican lady opening up a plastic bag of so called churros and placing them in a microwave then sprinkeling sugar.  I walked out with a big let down.  If you have to go authentic with the products, at least have a Native Spanish person put up the business and hire family members from Spain, not Mexico.
