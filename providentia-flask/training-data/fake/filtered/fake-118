There are no mistakes when I say that this place is the worst place to eat at. My wife and I ate here earlier and it gave us a really bad upsets stomach/diarrhea/food poisoning. They don't wear gloves while working with the food and charge an outrageous price for something I can get at anywhere.who cares what celebrity ate there in the past. Â Unsanitary methods of serving is a health concern. I called back to let them know that something is wrong with the food and they cursed me out on the phone, told me that "I must be eating dirty pussy and that's why I had diarrhea." If you value your health and want an enjoyable visit, then do NOT eat at Gino's.
