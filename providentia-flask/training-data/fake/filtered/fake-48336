Over-rated. I ordered a mushroom steak extra wiz wit, and not only was the wiz all over the wrapper and not on my sandwich, all of the meat was on one side and the mushrooms weren't even warm.  Others I was with had cold cheese that didn't melt on their cheese steak.  It was just an all around bad experience for something that so many rave about.  Seems they were too worried about forcing it out than actually giving you a good sandwich that would make you want to come back... never again will I go, which is ashame given all of the hype around their famous steaks. Fries were pretty tasty though, so that was nice :)
