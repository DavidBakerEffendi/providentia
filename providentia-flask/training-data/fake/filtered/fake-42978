The place is definitely worth visiting. Coupons for this are available all year round on Groupon, restaurants.com, yelp and Indian hut site. The food is very good and the servers are very helpful. The food is server with a wait of 10-15 minutes. I would definitely recommend their Gobi Manchurian and Hyderabad special chicken biriyani.
