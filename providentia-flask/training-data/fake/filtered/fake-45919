If u are looking for a good place to eat keep looking and do not try this place.  Horrible service - literally have to beg for attention.  Not welcoming environment, service is way below acceptable standards.  The menu is extremely small which fit the minute proportions.  If u commit the mistake of going to eat dinner there don't wait around for dessert or coffee, you'll be waiting for 30 minutes.  Poorly run restaurant and the wait staff shows.  Good bye Trattoria Rustica, never will u be bothered by my business again.
