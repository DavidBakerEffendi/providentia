I went back to Kelly's Friday night for a second time. Once again I was very impressed. We had 4 in our group and all decided to try different things. I had to get the onion soup remembering just how good it was the last time. We ordered the veggie stack, the sirloin medallions and the crab cakes. All of the items we chose were really delicious. I think besides the soup the crab cakes were probably my favorite. I had the fish and chips as my entree. The batter was nice and light and they were not greasy at all. I was very pleased. My friends enjoyed shepherds pie, one of the special steak entrees and the oven roasted duck and confit. I must say i kept stealing bites of the duck. All in all it really was a wonderful meal and reasonable.
