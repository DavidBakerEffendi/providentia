The food are wonderful.  I especially like the lamb, which is so special and really surprise me.  I think the lamb is one of my favorite in the world.  And the dessert, the volcano not sure is this name, with hot chocolate in the chocolate cake), is the BEST!!!!!!!!   I love it and how can i live if I never can taste it again?  Anyway, be sure to order both the dishe and dessert that I mentioned above.   Very recommanded!!
