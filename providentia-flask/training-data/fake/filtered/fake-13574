Consistently wonderful dining experience! The food is excellent, from the wide variety of appetizers, to the extensive selection of main courses, every meal I have had has been delicious. The wait staff is efficient and very friendly, salads are prepared tableside, as well as a couple of desserts which is highly recommended. I've recently dined in their Library Room which offers a light fare menu and is certainly well worth trying when looking for something a little more casual. Â Both the dining room and Library Room decor is very warm and comfortable. Carbone's is definitely my choice for the best dining in Hartford.
