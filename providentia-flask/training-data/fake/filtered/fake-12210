Hello, fellow gourmands and adventurers! I am an executive chef from the culinary mecca of Aspen, Colorado. After the busy ski season is over, I enjoy an East Coast culinary journey as my vacation and the spot is a go to. Miya's Sushi is without a doubt an amazing culinary experience and highly recommended for any foodie interested in expanding their horizons. As a chef with 20 years of experience, half of that in Japanese technique, I find this place absolutely compelling and delicious. I was attracted to Miya's at first because of Chef Bun S. Lai's unique sustainable and health oriented approach to the changing world of sushi. Now I come back for their innovative approach to this genre. This not your typical Japanese restaurant. For me, this is a great thing. You can get reasonably good traditional sushi at thousands of places but this place thinks out of the box and results are amazing. At first some of the philosophies that back up the menu items might be confusing to those that are familiar with traditional sushi. They utilize a mixed grain sushi rice instead of white rice and they don't use certain types of fish that are not sustainable or are downright bad for you ( i.e Ahi tuna). Get past these small hurdles and experience sushi like no other place on the planet. As a plus this place is very inviting, reasonably priced, unpretentious and the staff is also stellar in their attention to detail, work friendly happy attitude and knowledge of the menu. I just wrote this review and now I'm hungry for Miya's! See you in the spring!
