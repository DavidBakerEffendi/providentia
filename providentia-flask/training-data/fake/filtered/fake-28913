I've been here a few times and it has always been good.  The service is wonderful, food is delicious, and the drinks are served quickly! My friends constantly make fun of me for being a picky eater/drinker.  I like obscure mixed drinks.  My night usually goes as follows: A) The bartender says they can't make the drink... B) They make up an excuse like, they're out of the alcohol needed to make the drinks... C) They quickly say sure, and end up making something completely different then what I ordered, or a terrible attempt at what it was supposed to be. But, the last time I went to McGillin's, I was pleasantly surprised at the bartender's skills.  I ordered 3 drinks (that usually people have a hard time making, or I end up having to explain how to make it a few times for it to be made halfway decently) but all 3 drinks were made perfectly!  I did not have to repeat myself, or explain the ingredients at all! I was surprised and impressed.  My friends were happy as well since this was one of the first time I did not complain about my drinks! ( I'm not a big whiner or anything, but I am a bit critical) So, my experience here was wonderful!  Unfortunately I do not remember the bartenders name ( I feel terrible because he was great) but McGillin's is definitely lucky to have someone that is qualified to be behind the bar. So I would recommend McGillin's to anyone, especially to people that have obscure or specific drink tastes! P.S. If you are a steak lover, as I am, try the NY strip steak. 12 oz! So delicious! You definitely leave the place with a full and happy stomach!
