The food is very good!  Keep in mind it is small plates so you need to order a variety of items to fill, so it can get a little expensive.  I've been there three times and every time the food was good.  Although even more impressive is the fact that the servers are very familar with the ingrediends in each dish; as the dishes are very unfamiliar to most, unless of course you lived in Israel.  I would recommend trying this place its worth the visit
