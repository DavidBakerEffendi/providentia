Had spanish food last nite the first time at Don Pepe with family.  Our service was great but a bit slow.  We waited for a while just to get our drinks.  But the food was great!  I had veal chop and wild mushroom, my husband had Surf and turf.  The portions were huge and so was our bill! But it was all worth a visit.
