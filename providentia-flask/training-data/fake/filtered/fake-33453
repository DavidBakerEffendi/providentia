My co-worker recommend this restaurant and Monday afternoon I decided to go with it. I ordered chicken tikka roll, and it was so delicious, but the best part about it that, roll comes with two different dipping sauce which can hit you out of nowhere.. It was sooo delicious, cooked to perfection and their service was outstanding..
