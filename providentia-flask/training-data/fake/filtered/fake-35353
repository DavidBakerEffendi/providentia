Really solid bbq. I had been meaning to come here for a long time ever since I had seen the pitmaster on Chopped. Happy that I did. I had the brisket sandwich with a side of the burnt ends baked beans. Pretty great decision. I also lucked out and got the charred ends of the brisket, if you like it that way, ask for it and they usually oblige. Back to the meat, it was perfect. I really can't say enough about it other than to try it. Side note, the vinegar cole slaw is a good compliment to pulled pork or brisket, combined with onions and hot peppers makes it good. Their homemade bbq sauce is pretty sweet, but honestly you don't need it with what I ate. It didn't need any dressing up, it was just cooked perfect. I went with a friend who had been there before and he got the ribs which I also tried and they fell straight off the bone. They were perfect, not overly sauced just damned good meat. A new addition to the menu was wings which my friend and I split. HFS. Best wings I have ever had, I hope they can keep making them that way. I am not a big wing fan, but these were crispy and delicious. They had some kind of asian-style seasoning/sauce on them which was a nice alternative to the cheap tasting buffalo sauce that you might normally find. So yeah, if they can consistently make the wings like that, Mighty Quinn's is where I am going when I want them. Overall, this place is pretty great. It's not that cheap but if you go with a friend and divide and conquer, you can order pretty efficiently. I would definitely recommend this to all of my friends.
