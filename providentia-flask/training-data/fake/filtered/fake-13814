In the span of five minutes this place went from tolerable to absolutely terrible.  packed with gen-x idiots, and servers who end every spoken sentence sounding like a question.   buying 6 packs is pretty great though - and yay for the art part, i guess... although, if i were an artist id find a better  venue to hang my work than this shitstain on frankford.
