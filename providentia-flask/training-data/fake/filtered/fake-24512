I've been going to Big Wong for many many years and their food always taste as good as day one. Can't really go wrong with the roast duck, bbq pork, soy sauce chicken, wontons, pretty much most of their food is very good and cheap. Don't be mistaken, this is not some fancy 5 star Chinese restaurant but a causal Cantonese style Chinese fast food restaurant. I don't go here for the ambience or the service, just the food. I've tried many other restaurants in and around Chinatown but this hands down is the best.
