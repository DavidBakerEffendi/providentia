My favorite Ramen joint in NYC! Definitely a long wait, but if you can handle that..then it will be well worth it! My favorite is the spicy miso, I dont like what they did with the new soup base and how they mix in the ginger (since i personally dont like ginger) But its still great overall. If you go there the pork buns are definitely a must try also!
