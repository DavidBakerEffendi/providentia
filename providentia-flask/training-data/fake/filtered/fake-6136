We had heard a lot about Stone Hearth from many local friends. Everyone agreed that the food was excellent but the service needed fine tuning... Our meal last night was absolutely delicious and the service was extremely prompt and courteous. Would totally recommend! Nice alternative to downtown New Haven.
