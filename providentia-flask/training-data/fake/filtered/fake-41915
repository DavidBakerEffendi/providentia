We went to see the 2pm showing of Phantom of the Opera at the Majestic. We left the theater around 4:45 and were starving. Used my iWant app. on my iPhone which recommended this place. Thanks to the reviews of others we decided to check this place out and were more than pleasantly surprised. We had no reservations, but they welcomed us in.... helped us select our wine, and we all had amazing dishes. It was very reasonably priced and had delicious food. They were more than willing also to accommodate any dietary requests. Â Would DEFINITELY recommend!!!
