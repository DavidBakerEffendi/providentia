I stop in here a few times a month to get their oxtail, chicharon, empanadas & pernil. The coconut rice and mango shrimp are damn good too. It's byob so thats really cool. Wine w/one of their sangreas are really good or slam down pitcher of watermelon mojitos with some Bacardi. I love this place. The staff hustles hard and the hostesses are very nice. Respect the wait time. Their is a reason why it's so long. It's because this place is the bomb. When I walk up Bloomfield ave to pass this place and all I hear is the music jammin, I can't help myself and I walk in to grab a table. Thanks Cuban Pete's! I am a true fan!
