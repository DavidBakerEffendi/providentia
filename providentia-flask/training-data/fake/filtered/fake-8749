The pizza from Dayton street is very good.  Fantastic marinara and a buttery thin crust with a bit of char.  Everything you expect from New Haven style pizza.  PLUS- if you choose delivery, it come hand delivered by the hottest subaru driving delivery guy I have ever seen.  My only regret is that I didn't get his name so I could facebook stalk.
