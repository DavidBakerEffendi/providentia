First the good.  Been there twice on recommendations of friends.  Food is amazing !  Very tasty !!  Pancakes and omelets are the best I have had in my life, and their soups are the best.  So different !!  Not your run of the mill, standard cafe or diner selection of food and I applaud the effort.  Service is good as well, very attentive and friendly.  My server's name escapes me at the moment but she was cheery and seemed genuine which is always nice !   Now the bad.. the place is so NOISY !!  Way to loud for me and my friend to even have a conversation.  And my goodness it was romper room !  Seemed like dozens of unruly children all over.  While the decor is beautiful and the space is inviting,  much to loud and chaotic for me to enjoy what should have been one of the best meals of my life.  My compliments to the chef and staff but I will not be back.  I simply could not enjoy myself with that level of noise and chaos.   I will say that West Orange could use a restaurant with this quality of food and commitment to breakfast.  You simply don't see it very much unless you grab the standard stuff from the Eagle Rock diner which no one even can explain to me while it is still open.   Fantastic food and service just to chaotic and extremely hard to enjoy.
