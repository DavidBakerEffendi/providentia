OH MY GOODNESS, we were on our way to Manchester, Vermont  and took a different route thru Chester.  My eye caught this place and what  a "GEM"!.   I told them, people should be lined up outside.  The Food, incredible -  ( I was going to a 4STAR Resort and wished this place was in Manchester Village)  Sevice - like it should be - they listen to what you want and how you want it and offer suggestions - most impressive.   Absolutely no problem with any diet restrictions - they will accomodate your needs with a  smile.  Baked goods to die for.   A mini type grocery store/gift shop with very different and interesting items - such fun.  A MUST stop for anyone in the area!
