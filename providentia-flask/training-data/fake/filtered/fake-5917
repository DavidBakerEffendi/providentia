Absolutely the best breakfast in Manhattan, a bold statement I know.  Get the eggs any style with hash and bacon and you'll understand.  *****However, if you have dark clothing on (a black suit, etc.) do not let these table napkins get anywhere near you.  They somehow leave a trail of lint on you that is impossible to get off when you have to attend a meeting in 5 minutes*****
