The food isn't five star, I will hand you that, but they really will make you anything you want. It's kid and family friendly and they have a pizza that actually tastes like cheeseburgers-delicious. I highly suggest that you at least try that creation.  Service is awesome.  Management is wonderful.  At least give it a try.  So, that's my two cents. Also, who can say no to endless salad bar?  :-)
