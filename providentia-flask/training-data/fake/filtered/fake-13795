Tried Amalfi's about 4pm on a Sunday. Staff was welcoming when we entered. Bartender told us to sit anywhere we'd like. We entered the dining room and a waiter came us to us and said the same thing. We sat and immdeiately received our menu's and got our drink order taken. Our drinks were delivered promptly and we told the waiter we would start with an appetizer of onion rings. Our rings were seved in a timely manner and were accompinied by a tasy marinara sauce. Our waiter politely took our order. Plates were cleared by another fellow as we finished our apps. I had the Angus burger, it was cooked medium and juicy. Excellent taste and the bun was toasted on the grill. The waiter came back to check on us and refill our glasses a few times. Very attentive and polite staff. Restaurant is clean and very pleasant looking inside and out. I look forward to our next meal at Amalfi's.
