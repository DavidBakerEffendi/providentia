As far as the food goes, my experience was forgettable. Nothing blew me away; In fact, the greens were salty and the Mac n Cheese seemed to be nothing more than buttered noodles interspersed with some cheese in the lucky spots.The fish was good, while the shrimp was inconsistent. The fried chicken was tasty, if average. The "specials" sitting on hot plates in the front left much to be desired. Their Smothered chicken looked disgusting and their rice was crying to be moistened. All in all it was so, so. In terms of the SERVICE, Southern Comfort was anything BUT Southern OR comfortable. I encountered attitudes from several staff including older women who you would assume, by the amount of work they were doing, had nothing to be upset about. I encountered cursing between what seemed to be managers and employees and I had a young child with me at the time. I had to tell her to put her headphones in because of the profanity i heard being used. I wouldn't recommend this place unless you are trying to get someone to break up with you, in which case you should take them on a date there and let them experience "Southern Comfort "
