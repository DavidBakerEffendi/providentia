I absolutely love this place. This place is fun, young, and has a great vibe. As far as the food you can't go wrong with a mix of American and Asian cuisine. My personal favorite is Rad Na Thai Chicken, Barbeque Chicken Quesadilla, the Korean Pork tacos is the absolute best, has so much flavor. Can't forget about their sexy desserts. My absolute favorite has to be Blond Bombshell.  As far as pricing, it  isn't a wallet kiler. The price was pretty cheap for all those great foods they have. Great Job Starr.
