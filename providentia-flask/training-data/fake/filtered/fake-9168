I think Alice's Arbor is actually one of Brooklyn's hidden gems-not just Bed-Stuy, but all of Brooklyn. The food here is exceptional, and as someone who works with food and spends a lot of time eating pretty fancy stuff, Alice's Arbor ranks pretty high. They use high quality, fresh ingredients, and do new American twists really well. Their beet salad includes shaved fennel and a pistachio vinaigrette that is a nice spin on the old goat cheese stand-by. I can not get enough of their ribs with black eyed pea salad-Seriously, sometime I dream about those vinegary, slightly spicy ribs when Â I'm not there. I also think they do vegetables really well, which is usually a sign of a restaurant a cut above the rest. As I said, everything is very fresh, which is the most important component, and they also do a beautiful presentation. Their seasonal heirloom salad is perfect in its simplicity. I highly reccomened Alice's Arbor for people that really enjoy quality, interesting New American food. I'm surprised at how few of the reviews here talk about it. It's also a really good looking place, going with the current Brooklyn theme of rustic wooden tables and exposed brick, which is nice, but the food is what keeps me coming back.
