This place is such a hidden gem!  Beautiful ambiance, friendly & kind staff and the food is simply delicious!  Made RSVPS after reading the NY Times review and must say that we had to wait a few minutes to be seated, so be prepared to be a bit patient but this restaurant is definitely worth the wait and they hype!  From start to finish Salinas delivers, we will definitely be back again!
