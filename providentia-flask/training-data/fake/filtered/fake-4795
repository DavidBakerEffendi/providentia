I was glad to see a spot like this open up in the neighborhood. If you have heard of Distrito Restaurant and the Aveda School and Salon- then you will know where this is located, or maybe you've walked right past it. Across street from Distrito  walking towards 40th street. The place is defintly a  cute spot. Very modern, cool style, clean, and quiet. This spot is perfect little coffee shop. I've come here organized my taxes and gone down the street to get my taxes done. Coffee and sweets are yummy. There are couches and plenty of tables. On the HD tv's you can catch some nature videos- that soothe ur energy. Great place on a sunny day, place is warm, has big windows, and is peaceful. Perfect for some "me" time. U can go get ur hair cut a few doors down at Aveda and go gocery shopping down the street at Fresh Grocer. lots of little spots in the area- u can easily make a full day of being in the area. But this spot is perfect to just stop, slow down, and relax. enjoy!
