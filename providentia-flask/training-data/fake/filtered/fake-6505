Worst restaurant manager by the name of Andrea Lucignani, who is more concerned about having power over customers rather than understanding. Although all three of us in our group were there a minute before his prescribed deadline, he gave away our table saying dismissively that a minute or two didn't make a difference (at least to him, not even wanting to hear that one of our friends came all the way from 93rd and Madison navigating through all the UN street closures). Earlier, two of us who were there before the reserved time, made an offer to sit and start ordering wine and appetizers since our friend was just a few blocks away but was stuck in traffic. We even offered to eat as fast as possible Â to make room for another turnover. Andrea would not listen to any of it, snootily saying that it's the restaurants policy. Period. This is the kind of restaurant that makes you feel that they don't really need your patronage because they are so hip and busy. Although I've been here many times before, i'm never going back there and I'm telling all my friends and business associates not to. Unfortunately for them, my friends and I eat out a lot and we have a lot of friends who do too.
