The food is great. The service is excellent. The problem is, arriving before the sun is down and your group gets a table on the roof. The sun is really hot and the experience was destroyed by the sun on the roof.  There is a usually an hour wait for a table.  There is a bottom section and they serve a cold and raw menu.   The section is cooler than the top section and the bar is all cash in this bottom section. The roof  section allows credit cards.  If I return to this place I will stay on the bottom section. The prices are cheaper and the food is spicy.
