I love this place! It is unique, charming, tasty and thoughtful. I always enjoyed going to the Burlington location but was blown away by the new layout, menu options and the bar. I went to the re-opening party and had one of the best nights out in a long time. I have a feeling we will be seeing some amazing music in this new space. Being down on the waterfront is such a bonus as I always go for walks on the boardwalk and watch the sunset before, after or sometimes even during a Skinny hang. Â I can't wait to see what The Skinny Pancake does next and have a feeling that it will just get better and better. It seems they are working out a few kinks but I talked to one of the staff who spent a good time listening and relaying how they are working to smooth everything out. Mad respect to a restaurant that is committed to the local foods movement while also being delicious, fun and creative. Thank you!
