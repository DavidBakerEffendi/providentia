NIGHTMARE! Cuban Pete's-a standing fav for birthdays and just a good fun night out. My husband called to make reservations for my birthday-9 people-2 seniors,5 kids and us. They don't take reservations-would have been appropriate for them to tell him that big parties on weekends have a 2 hour wait. for seating. We sent my parents there early about 45 minutes ahead of us to put our name on the list and wait. We arrived and apperantly another 12 person party did as well. After 10 minutes of waiting  Dominic-the Maitre Dee- sat the 12 person party that came 45 minutes after us. MY mom 68 yrs old,(wearing a boot cast) approached the  Maitter Dee-Dominic and asked him why he seated the other party first when we were there first? He was sooo nasty to her and said, "I did it because I wanted to" and that we would have to wait at least another 2 hours to be seated. So we left. Very dissapointed and made to feel discriminated against and like second class citizens. Maybe they didnt want seniors and kids on a Friday night???
