Had a beer tasting there last night with a group of friends and it was amazing! John (the beer tasting guy) knows so much about beer and he did a great job of pairing the beers with what we had ordered for dinner and dessert. I had never heard of most of them before (admittedly I'm not a beer expert) but by the end of the night I was feeling like a pro. Well, maybe not a pro, but at the very least I felt like a... very happy and very tipsy customer.
