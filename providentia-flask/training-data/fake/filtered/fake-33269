Great intimate setting !! Friendly Staff !! Great Atmosphere !! Excellent Service !! And the food..OMG from the warm bread with seasoned olive oil brought to the table when you're seated to the amazing appetizer ( Steamed mussels in a creamy seasoned garlic broth) YUM - dinner was amazing their seafood Ravoli is to die for just rich delicious flavors.. Their steak & baked potato with an arugula salad was equally delicious.. I give Tabare 5 Starsssss... Intimate & Inexpensive
