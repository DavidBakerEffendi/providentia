I really enjoyed their style of pizza. You can't come here expecting them to make a New Haven style or such, they make it their own and they have the freshest toppings I've had in a long time. The quality of cheese they put into both the pizzas and the empanadas is amazing. Every time I've come here with a group of friends we're treated like we've been coming here for years. Everyone is very kind and I would definitely recommend their cheese empanadas... oh and the flan!
