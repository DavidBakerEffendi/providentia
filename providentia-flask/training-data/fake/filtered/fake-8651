We wanted to get some take out for a picnic lunch at Branch Brook Park today. Chose Terra Nostra and were pleasantly surprised. Chicken, white beans, sausage. For under 20 bucks we had a fabulous lunch for 2. All of the food was fresh and delicious. We will definately be back for more, as our ecpectations were exceeded.
