Ambiance is excellent: decor just right, not too noisy.  Service was as good as it gets: professional, attentive.  And the food!  Hot-sour seafood soup was quite fiery, but the best we have had in a very, very long time.  The seafood/tofu hot pot and the spicy fish and tofu were our choices for main courses. Each was exceptional in flavor and "substance" (lots of stuff in there!) and the portions were more than ample.  Price was also right.  Superb value-for-money.
