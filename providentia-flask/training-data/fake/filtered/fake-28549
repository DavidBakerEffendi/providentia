My husband and I have been to this place many times and while the service is not great the food usually is good. Well after our last dinner experience there we will never be returning! We were seated pretty quickly, the appetizer came out after 20 minutes and then we sat for an hour waiting for our main course. When it did come out mine was too spicy (I had asked for mild) the woman promptly took it back to the kitchen and apologized that they made my dish with medium spice. When they brought it back they had just added cream and reheated it so I gave it a try and still too spicy for me plus the chicken was now overcooked. I politely told the woman it was still too spicy and she offered more yogurt sauce which just make everything taste like yogurt so I said no. She asked if I wanted them to remake it and by that time it was late and we had missed our movie time and I didn't really feel like waiting but she said it would take 10 minutes. Then a man came out who I'm pretty sure was the owner and he said, "Still too spicy?" I said yes and he very rudely said, "I don't think so!" and walked off. I was shocked and then I finally started to get upset. I told the woman that he was rude and to cancel the remake. She was apologetic but I won't go back to a place where I'm made to feel in the wrong when the wait time was an hour and twenty minutes and they even admitted they made my dish too spicy in the first place! Next time I will spend my money at a place that appreciates their customers.
