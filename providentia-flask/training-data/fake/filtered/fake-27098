One of the best Italian food experiences to be had in the Trenton area. Small and intimate, the emphasis is on the food, not the d√©cor. Service is prompt and friendly. Gino, the owner and chef, often comes out to check on his customers personally. Italian food the way your grandmother made it or should have.
