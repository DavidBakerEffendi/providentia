This place is close to where I work so I go there. The bagels are really not good, but the staff did make me jalepeno cream cheese on the spot. Â And I just don't understand how you serve someone iced coffee by just pouring hot coffee over a little ice? That is not iced coffee. And then they were "out of more ice." How do you run out of ice?? Nice enough folks but the bagels just don't cut it. I hope they stay in business though.
