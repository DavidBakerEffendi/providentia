Visiting Philly and craving a late night dessert....found it here ! Â Walking in the door you'll smell cocoa and that's just the start of your sweet adventure. Waffles, crepes,, sundaes, fondues and ice cream treats, with toppings and add ins that make this MORE than an ice cream store. And, while most of the orders have chocolate on them, there are fruit based desserts as well. So good.
