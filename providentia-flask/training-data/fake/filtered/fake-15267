I LOVE PINTO .This is my go-to place whenever I want a great reliable Pad Thai, and I come especially downtown for them. When you go there, you should definitely order the Thai Ice Tea, it comes in a unique "make-it-yourself" kit that lets you control the amount of cream, tea and sugar- awesome and very special . I also recommend the super-cheap lunch deal- 8$ for an appetizer and main. My favorite main is the pad Thai of course, and for appetizer I recommend the Taro Fritters- really tasty and fun. Just a small note- the restaurant is pretty tiny, so don't come with a group larger than four or else you will have to wait forever for a table. All in all, pinto never lets me down. Try it out
