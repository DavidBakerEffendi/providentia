interesting....my review last night after an unpleasant experience at De Legna, has disappeared.  I can forgive anything -- bad service, mediocre food, but an owner who calls us liars  -- saying we did not wait more than 15 minutes for our food -- is really awful.  We got there at 6:30 and at 7:45 still didn't have our pizza. Just a mistake -- not the end of the world, until the owner came out and accused us of lying and coming in in a "bad mood."   what a shame.   Jane
