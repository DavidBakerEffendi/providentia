Went here Memorial Day morning for breakfast.  When we entered at about 7:20, there was one couple at a table and 2-3 people seated at the counter.  The waitress, who was not very pleasant, took our order.  As soon as she left, the (apparent) owner came out of the kitchen and at he end of the counter said to another waitress "if you keep pushing it, you are going to be out of here in a minute, and we will make it work without you."  We heard this loud and clear, can't imagine the other customers didn't.  Despite hardly anyone in the place, it took about 35 minutes to get our simple order of a waffle and eggs/hash browns.  When we ordered my wife asked the waitress for no butter on the waffle, she said the waffles do not come with butter but didn't tell my wife that it comes with powder sugar on, which she didn't want.  Why not ask if she wanted waffle plain or say that it comes with powder sugar when we asked for no butter?  Waffle was sent back; eggs/hash browns were OK but must have set there for a few minutes as they were not hot.  What a way to start the holiday, this is our last visit to Teddy's.
