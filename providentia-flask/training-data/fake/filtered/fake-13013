I eat here on a regular basis and the food is always excellent! The service is fast and reliable and I've never had to wait to be seated, even on a Saturday night. I live in the neighborhood and this is by far one of my favorite local spots. Whenever somebody comes to visit I make sure to take them here! I'd recommend any of the pasta dishes because all the ones I've had are delicious. The antipasti and pizza are good enough, but it's the pasta that makes this place special. They have just about every pasta combination you could ask for, so there's definitely something for everyone.
