I ordered sushi delivery from Teriyaki Boy online.  The delivery person delivered to the wrong building, so I grabbed enough cash to cover the total that was on my website receipt plus a tip for her.  Well, she brought a bill that charged me several dollars more than what the website had said... but I figured it was an additional delivery fee of some sort and that the tip more than covered it.  Imagine my surprise when she actually chased me down and YELLED at me for not giving her a big enough tip.  I was completely stunned.  Plus, the order was missing a few sushi rolls that I had paid for, and the sushi tasted old.  I will never order from Teriyaki Boy again.
