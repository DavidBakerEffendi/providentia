I tried them because of Groupon and have been back.  The food is very good.  I especially liked their burger and their mac and cheese.  I also enjoyed their "smoked" Reuben.  I have never had one with smoked meat before and it was really good.  It was also HUGE!  The mac and cheese is among the cheesiest that I have ever had.  I order extra as take out because it was so good!  I felt that the service was great and the staff were very friendly each time.  The first time I went, I was with a friend with a developmental disability that can present a few minor challenges for the wait staff.  But, they rose to the occaision and treated her like a queen.  I was really impressed.  I highly recommend them!
