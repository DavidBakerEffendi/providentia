We arrived around 10 on a Saturday night. I expected to have to wait. Instead the 4 of us were seated immediately. It was the night before Easter, maybe that's why? The pizza was great. What was most impressive to me, however, was that when our friends ordered a cheeseless pizza, the waiter didn't bat an eye. And they enjoyed it. The dough and sauce were special enough to make them very happy. So vegans need not shy away from this place. Also,a Â pizza is very reasonable when two are sharing.
