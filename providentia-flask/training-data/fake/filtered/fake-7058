I came by Hartford for the Phish concert and was told of this place by a friend so I stopped by. They were really busy and I almost felt bad for the cooks because only two people were cooking amidst a couple customers! Nonetheless the food was terrific! It was slighty messy, but the taste made up for the mess. Also they were really cramped so I don't really blame them for the lack of presentation. Nonetheless I had a Vegetarian wrap and the cook was really nice and made me maybe one of the best vegetarian wraps I've ever had! It really hit the spot! Also the workers that night were really friendly and good people! Next time I'm here I will be sure to stop by!
