Have been in the neighborhood for over 10 years and sometimes have a hard time stepping outside of my reliable faves... but Glasserie proves to bring something unique and interesting to the table while retaining an authentic Brooklyn charm ... Not the typical contrived -wannabe -pop -ups that just seem to miss the mark. From the non -abrasively welcoming staff , the atmosphere, the food... to the selection of cocktails and wine, I have had nothing but great dining experiences at Glasserie and will continue to introduce more of my friends and clients to my "new" favorite spot in Greenpoint. The menu is varied and eclectic but not for the sake of being weird. The combinations are perfectly matched and I've enjoyed trying a different dish each time. And yes the griddle bread is ridiculous.
