The food at Scarpetta is amazing.  I especially enjoyed the bread and mascarpone butter to start, the polenta, and the heirloom tomato caprese.  The service was great...  until we saw a mouse running around the dining room just as we were finishing dessert.   The restaurant manager was not surprised or apologetic in any way.  Although the food was great the mouse ruined the experience...  I am completely traumatized by this restaurant and could never recommend it.
