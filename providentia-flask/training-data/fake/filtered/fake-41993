If you are in the downtown Montclair area and looking for good eats this is definitely worth the stop. Before eating at Spice I wasn't the biggest fan of Thai food. I must say that this has changed. The talapia w/ a mango salad dish is one of the best on the menu. It was filled with robust flavors and the fish was cooked to perfection. Nothing much to complain about, highly recommend it.
