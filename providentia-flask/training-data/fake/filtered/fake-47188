While I was dining I happened to check the reviews of this restaurant and I have to say it has been a shock to see the reviews. I am a very frequent diner and I have to say the food is amazing. The service is okay as the weekend business tends to be very busy everywhere. Fortunately, I had a great experience and I would definitely come back again.
