I was here earlier today, the food was amazing. I had the strawberries and cream french toast, it was even better than it sounds. I loved the outdoor seating and the fact that it's attached to the book store. The staff was super Â attentive. I honestly can't think of a bad thing to say, I'll definitely be back
