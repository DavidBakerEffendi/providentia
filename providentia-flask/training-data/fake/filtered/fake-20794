My friends and I came here to celebrate my friend's birthday. The place was intimate, but our table's lively conversation was welcome. The manager or owner was so personal and wonderful. The food was phenomenal. 3 of the 6 of us, including myself, have lived in Paris for a few months and it gave us nostalgia being in the restaurant. Just do it.
