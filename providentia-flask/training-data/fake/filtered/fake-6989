WOW cant believe the change in this place.  The food, the service, the atmosphere was amazing it was like I was in a different restaurant then the last time i was there which by the way it was a disaster.  I must say the cowboy ribeye was awesome  cook just the way i wanted it OMG I was so excited cause we need a place like this up here.  The bar was packed with people having a good time all I can say is new management and owners keep up the good work this is a great restaurant.  I cant wait to come back again and try something else.  Thanks for the great meal!!!!!!!!!!!
