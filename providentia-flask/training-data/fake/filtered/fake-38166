I was here last week with my wife. She truly wanted Grimaldis but every time we are in Dumbos the long line never gave me the appetite to wait. So, as a Brooklyn native, I've said why not, let's wait this time to see what the hype is all about. The line went quickly, especially if you are a couple it's a lot easier to get in than with a group. We were seated within 30 mins of waiting outside, not bad. We've ordered a large pie with meatballs topping. It took about 20 minutes to get it but this is expected and not bad of a wait. I've expected something remarkable on my first bite of the pizza, and I was disappointed. I had better pizza in Bay Ridge, Bensonhurst and Gravesend areas. I guess I've wanted for the dough to be thinner and crunchier, not doughy and burnt. It was a good meal just nothing over the top. I'll leave this spot for the tourists. PS. The prices are decent for a Dumbo location.
