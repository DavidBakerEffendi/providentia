Baby blues bbq is a great atmosphere full of friendly faces and authentic barbecue. Not only do their platters come with your choice of two delicious fixins, but a piece of cornbread, and theirs is the best ive had yet! Their food menu is full of options that will leave you satisfied and full, but if you manage to save room be sure to try their home made banana pudding! Lastly, baby blues has an awesome happy hour, $3 draft beers and $5 appetizers, cant beat that! If you haven't been to baby blues you should get there asap!
