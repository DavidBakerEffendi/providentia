This place is not really Colombian. It's over-hyped, overpriced and food is less than average. Not really sure why it's called Bogota since it is not even close to authentic Colombian restaurant. It is a pan-latino joint.  I've had better Bandeja Paisa platters. This one came with cabbage salad (weird!), and then $21 a pop...too expensive!   Also, Colombian arroz con pollo served with black beans (are you kidding me?) Colombians don't eat black beans! Drinks were good and service too. Overall, sorry but not for me.
