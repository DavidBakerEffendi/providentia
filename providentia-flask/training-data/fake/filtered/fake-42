My father lives in Taiwan so I grew up eating Taiwanese/Chinese food.  I find the quality and deliciousness of Formosa's food unsurpassed by any other Chinese restaurant in CT.  I often order takeout for easy dinner parties and all of my friends rave about it and make me feel like champion for very little effort.
