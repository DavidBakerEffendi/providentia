This is THE BEST RESTAURANT I HAVE EVER BEEN TO and well worth the cost.  I live nearby and have been coming since they first opened.  The food is amazing and the drinks are solid.  The decor is understated and the staff are friendly and professional.  Every time I go out to eat somewhere else I find myself wondering why I didn't eat here.
