The place is cozy and friendly. A lot of the locals make the place unique. If I'm by myself or with others, I have a good time. I've enjoyed my meals there as there food is mostly homemade from their kitchen. They have plenty of TV's for the games and space for smaller parties. It's a good spot for families too. It's like Cheers. One of my favorites.
