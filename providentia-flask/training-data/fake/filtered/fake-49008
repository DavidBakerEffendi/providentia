Korean Fusion? I have tasted better dishes in Flushings. Whats the hype about? Semms like a start up hype for sure. The restaurant wont last few years like this. I really had high hope for new Korean fusion soot, but its downhill. B class foods. Monkey bread is good for appetizer. But octopus with Gochujang? was let down. Steak was firm and over well done when I had ordered medium rare...
