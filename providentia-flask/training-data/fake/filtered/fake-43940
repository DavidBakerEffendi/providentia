Ate there last week and was very disappointed. I eat out a lot and I must say this place needs some more practice. The wait staff got our orders wrong. And since it's BYOB we brought a bottle of wine and they took it from us to keep it cool. Then they pored it for another table. Very unprofessional and very disappointed! Not to mention it's way too noisy in that little place. BIBOU is a much better restaurant! I'm sticking with BIBOU!
