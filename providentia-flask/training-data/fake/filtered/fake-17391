We have been meaning to go to La Cigogne since it opened and are so glad we finally made it in!  Jeremy was wonderful, made it feel like a real neighborhood place.  We loved the food and the atmosphere and it has such a fun mix of people with friends, on dates, with families (we took our 4 month old who loved it too!).  Definitely will be our go to neighborhood spot, so glad they have come to town...
