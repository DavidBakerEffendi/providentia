I've got to say... I might even live in Burlington...in Vermont... because of Bove's. My mom used to go to Bove's in the 70's while working as a nurse at UVM. Though we lived in Massachusetts, we would often visit her friends in Rutland. We would always, always, make the drive to Burlington just to dine at Bove's. I fell in love with Bove's too, and also Burlington. There's just something about Bove's. I tried the cake recently and it was great...in that Bove's way.
