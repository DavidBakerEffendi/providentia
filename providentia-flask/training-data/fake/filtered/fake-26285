This place is awesome. Very authentic and if you like hot and spicy food its the place to go. Try the Terrace Curry Thai Hot. Its sad, it used to be packed until after the owner was arrested. I heard from a friend that the charges were dropped after it was discovered that a rival restauranteur had placed the camera in an attempt to hurt his business. I can't see any note of a conviction or court appearance online and it is kind of strange that he is back running the place despite having been in Homeland Security custody on a $100,000 bond. Obviously the reported story is not the whole story.
