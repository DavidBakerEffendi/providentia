Miami Mikes is the best sports bar I have ever been to.  It is an incredible atmosphere during all NFL games as well as other big sporting events.  There is usually some sort of former pro athlete in the bar hanging out which is always fun.  The food is great, the people are fun and Mike has made for quite a few fun traditions.
