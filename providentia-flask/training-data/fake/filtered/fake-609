Mu, Bailey and I did New York in 12 hours...starting from Chinatown and worked our way up to Midtown and this Halal Cart was our last stop. Boy, we sure did save the best for last. To be honest, I had no expectations for this cart. I mean, I thought that it would be a great place to grab food after a long night of partying and everyone knows that food tastes soo much better when you're a bit intoxicated. However, this was not the case. We were all 100% sober, waiting in line for half an hour, and we enjoyed every bite of our food. Who knew that chicken and rice could be so good? It was very flavorful and the sauces that were provided were amazing. One lesson we learned that night was that there's different "red sauces." I put one of their red sauce all over my rice and it was fantastic! Mu had a taste and decided to put some on his...except he grabbed the hot sauce. I don't even want to begin to describe how spicy it was...Mu kept on eating because it was so good. Bailey and I were immensely entertained. Anywho, Bailey and I decided to go back to the cart and eat MORE! Yes, we did! We got the lamb plate this time and it was equally delicious. And for those who are wondering, the lamb was not gamey at all. Score!!!
