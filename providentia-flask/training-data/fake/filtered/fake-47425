The clerk gave my wife the wrong product. I brought it back a couple days later to exchange for the correct product. I brought the receipt. However, because i did not have the non-existent "second piece of paper" - I was not to receive full credit. On top of that - Jennifer "the manager" got strangely aggressive and in my face. Not sure why. Anyway - I will take my $800 per year business elsewhere.
