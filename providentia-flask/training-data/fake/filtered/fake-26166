Absolutely cannot recommend this establishment. We received a $35 gift certificate here for Christmas and ordered a medium pizza and appetizer to pick up. They said 15 minutes. They close at 8 and at 7:20ish when we arrived already had their closed sign lit. Went inside to get our order and to use the gift certificate. Our order came to about $21. They said they don't offer cash back for the left over amounts on gift certificates and claimed they couldn't write the left over amount to be used next time on the certificate. Instead they claimed you could only use the gift certificate one time. This meaning if you spend only $21 on a $35 gift cert, Three Brothers pockets the left over money that the person who purchased the certificate spent. This is not only in poor taste but illegal. Will never give them business again. I ended up buying enough cooler drinks to get at least $33 of the $35 on my gift certificate bc I didn't want them to have the satisfaction of a $14ish dollar profit for providing no service. However, I should have had enough money to buy a whole other meal on a separate occasion. I would never recommend contributing to this type of business model. Their pizza is not good enough to deal with this type of headache.
