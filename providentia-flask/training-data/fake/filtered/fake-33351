I enjoyed my dinner at Audrey Claire.  I arrived early on a Saturday dinner since they do not take reservations on weekends.  Simple menu with plenty of options.  Pork chop was delicious but the Tuna left me slightly disappointed. It was very under seasoned and the crust was oily.  The reason I gave 3 stars is because they serve wine in small tumbler glasses!  I brought a very delicious bottle of wine but could not enjoy it to it's fullest.  Should be a bring your own bottle and glass!
