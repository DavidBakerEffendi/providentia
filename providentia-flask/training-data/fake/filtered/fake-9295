I've been going to Mulberry Street for quite some time now and all I have to say is this place is GREAT! The food is always amazing. The service is exquisite. The prices are reasonable for what your getting. And the decor is what you'd expect from a fine Italian restaurant. Plus the owner is always involved to make sure every customer has an excellent dining experience. Â  So to recap: Food = GREAT Service= The Best Price=Fair Overall experience every time you eat there = PERFECT If you haven't tried it yet, you need to right now
