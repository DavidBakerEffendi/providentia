Fuel has awesome food but HORRIBLE service. I've been there four times and have had awful service three of those times. I don't know about anyone else but I feel like those aren't the best odds... I went for lunch this week with a good friend of mine and it took over an hour to get one serving of chips and guacamole, one salad, and one flat bread. By the time we got our food our lunch break was already up and we had to eat so fast we barely had time to enjoy our food. Not only was the service soooooo slow my friend had to ask 4 times and three different people to get a refill for her water - she probably waited 10 minutes before it was actually filled. When we got our check we waited and waited and finally had to go inside to pay our bill. The restaurant wasn't busy enough to wait that long especially during the lunch hour when people only have a certain amount of time to eat. Quite honestly I don't know if I will be back...
