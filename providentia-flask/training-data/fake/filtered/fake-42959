There are many ups and downs about this restaraunts including service, quality and atmosphere. Pros: * Quality of food was very good and taste wise, it was very authentic * Atmosphere was okay CONS: * Service WAS TERRIBLE for A SATURDAY NIGHT Do not expect food to come out quickly but do expect the wait staff to forget about your requests and orders * Very understaffed ( 2 waiters serving 12 tables * Constant excuses from the wait staff were very frustrating * Some dishes came out cold/warm and NOT HOT In summation, the food was a 6/10 but the long waiting times and terrible service throughout the night easily crossed off this local restaraunt from my list of places to eat.
