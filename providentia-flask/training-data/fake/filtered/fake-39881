Tony & Lucilles is the best Italian food I ever had!  Even though the family is famous for their calzones, their pizza is out of this world!!  Fresh toppings with corn meal on the bottom of the crust.  Best white pie ever!  People who want to stand in line at Peppes for a so so hyped pizza, you don't know what your missing!! Walk across the street and taste a real pie.  You'll be surprised !!!!
