I can't imagine BBQ any better than this. North Carolina style. Dry rub or sauce. Unbelievable! If you like BBQ, do not miss this quirky little place and don't be fooled by appearances. This is a warm, friendly place and Laurence is as good a host as you'll find anywhere. Hint: try Kim's bread pudding. It's from another galaxy. P.S. get there early. It takes 14 hours to smoke a new batch of ribs, so when they run out, they're out.
