We went here starving and all four of us left without finishing our food. My son's chicken tacos were full of bones. My shrimp taco was luke warm and chicken wings were rubbery. Everything tasted like it had been sitting around for a while then stuck into the microwave. How does this place stay in business? Seriously, it was worse than fast food on the NJ Turnpike.
