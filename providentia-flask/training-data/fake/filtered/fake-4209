Yes! I actually love this place! It's a super cute and trendy spot and their food is pretty good. I was feeling the puffs honesty because instead of just doing the traditional curry puff which I like they do one with cheese and other stuff that doesn't have the best taste in my opinion. EVERTHING ELSE? Pretty GREAT! I've had the currys, fried rice, many if the appetizers and they never seem to disappoint. Really great date spot as the ambiance is fabulous. I definitely recommend eating here!
