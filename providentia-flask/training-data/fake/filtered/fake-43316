:: This is my first yelp review.  The Greek was such a treat that I just had to share my experience! :: My husband and I have been looking for a new go-to date night spot, and we found it here! The service - fabulous!  The cocktails - superb!  The food - fantastic! The owner was our waiter - he was very passionate about Greece, where the drinks / food came from, etc.  He even comped a cocktail!  The rest of the staff was from Greece as well.  They were very helpful and attentive. We shared the grilled eggplant, peppers stuffed with feta / figs, scallops, meatballs, and a slice of cheesecake.  EVERYTHING was delicious! We will absolutely be back, and often!
