My husband and I held a dinner party here for my relatives - almost 40 people.  Joseph and his staff were very accommodating and worked with us on setting up a set menu with a lot of options for our guests.  My favorites among their dishes were the Sweet & Sour Calamari appetizer, the Rack of Lamb and the Sweet Potato and Cranberry Bread Pudding.   Our group took up more than half of the restaurant.  Everyone had a great time, commented on how good the food was, and enjoyed the atmosphere. Also, I loved that it was BYOB and there was no time restriction on how long we could stay.
