Went here today to have their sicilian based on the Star Ledger article. Really disappointed. The crust was pretty good but was overloaded with sauce and you had to search to find the cheese. Maybe if you grew up with this it is good but having grown up in Brooklyn where there was a pizza place on almost every block on 5th Ave he doesn't cut it'.
