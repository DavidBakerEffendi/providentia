It's been a couple weeks, but I finally got the time to sit down and write for a minute. Go to Tink's. Go now. Bring your mother, bring anybody you remotely like to this place.  I've been here three times now and the food is ALWAYS amazing.  It seems like for the weekends most people have heard of this place and it's always packed, so beware, make a reservation and come on time, and if you still have to wait, just remember it's worth it. I actually recommend coming here earlier in the week when it's a little less crowded Now...Tink's is small, but there's SO MUCH to look at it.  They have chandeliers, copper ceilings, (maybe it's real copper, maybe it's fake, I don't care, it's georgeous), clocks upon clocks upon clocks, AND if you look closely, a pair of ruby slippers on the ceiling. Find them. It's fun. Even though it's small, it's packing some serious heat on their menu.  You HAVE to have the pretzel fried chicken, grown up grilled cheese, (leave the onion jam on and don't be a jerk), fig and bacon pizza on NAAN BREAD, shrimp and grits and just save room for desert, whatever they may be serving that day. They have good and very reasonably priced wines in addition to a huuuuuuge beer list. It's all craft, it's all good. The last time we went we actually shared our beers (sort of like a beer tasting) and blew through half the list. Just ask the staff what they like if you can't decide, they're always right. This is one of those places that I don't want to tell anybody about b/c I still want to be able to get a table when I walk in on a THursday or Friday night, but honestly you need to know. Go right now. Just go. Don't say a word, just go.
