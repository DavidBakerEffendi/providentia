Dear Judy Rittenhouse, This is not about Pumpkins!  I am very disappointed, I am visiting family for the Holidays and every year I make the fresh Cranberry Salad in your Apple A Day cookbook, my family loves it.  I forgot my book at home so I called a few people with no luck, then I got online knowing I would find it on there.  But NO, I did not!  You should have your cookbook online set up in a way that you have to know the name of the recipe to view it.  My family was really put out with you because you did not have it available.  Not to say how put out with me they were for forgetting the cookbook.  I do think that would be a very good think for you to do.  Apple A Day cookbook has been so popular through out the years.  Hope you are having a wonder beginning to the Holiday Season.  Thank you,  Sonia
