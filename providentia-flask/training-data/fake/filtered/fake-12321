Stopped by here on a whim when I first saw it was open. Maude made me one of the best lattes I've ever had, and THE best hot chocolate (I think the secret is 3 parts chocolate, 1 part vanilla. Sublime). Been making my way back ever since. I disagree with the earlier poster who said the coffee was nothing special; it probably didn't come out of a weasel's digestive tract or anything, but they serve consistently fresh La Colombe coffee, which is some of the best around. In terms of decor, the place is awesome. Crazy black and white theme, elegant lighting, quirky dog pictures on the wall, and a beautiful set of bay windows that give the cafe a much more open, breezy feel. I absolutely adore this place.
