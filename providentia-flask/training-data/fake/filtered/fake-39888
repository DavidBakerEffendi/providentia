Kandahar catered for my brothers wedding a week ago, and they went above and beyond. From the appetizers to dinner to dessert everything was amazing. Usually when a restaurant caters for a crowd of over 300 people the quality and quantity of the food isn't on par, but when Kandahar catered for my brothers weddings which had over 300 guests the food exceeded expectations. The guests kept going for more and more food and kept asking where it came from. The guests especially loved the mantu, chicken cheese adana kabobs, lamb gyro meat, and baklava. I definitely recommend anyone to cater from Kandahar, you would not regret it.
