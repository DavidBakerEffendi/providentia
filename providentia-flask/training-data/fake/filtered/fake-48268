My friend recommend this place for me to check it out--  He told me thier dipping sauces are amaZing! So I went there after my work just to try. Its a surprise to see a big line in such a small restaurant. I was the 2nd to the last one in the line. One of the guy who workes there gave a sample, he took my order nicely. He recommend the sweet mango chutney sauce, as i tried it--  i like it!! So I pick the mango sauce, I only pay $ 5.50 (a regular size and one sauce) its cheaper and worth it! I will deffinetly recommended this place to my friends and co-workers. My rating: Service-- 4 stars Food--- 5 stars Sauce-- double 5 stars! Whenever you visit manhattan, don't forget to check pommes frites between 7st and st. Mark,  you won't be disappointed.
