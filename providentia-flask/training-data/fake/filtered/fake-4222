Food: San Sai has really great sushi! I had the sushi pizza and the volcano roll with tuna and was very happy with my meal. The ingredients tasted fresh - #1 choice for sushi in Burlington. Drinks: I also had the ginger sake drink, which was delicious, but I could not taste the sake. Service: Very slow, it is a newer restaurant so I hope they are working on this. For being a tuesday night and not very busy, the service was surprisingly slow from start to finish. Not sure what the deal was there. Price: Based on quality, I thought the price was fair for my meal, sushi pizza $9, volcano roll $10, drink $6. Overall, I would definitely go back for the food and give the service team a second chance.
