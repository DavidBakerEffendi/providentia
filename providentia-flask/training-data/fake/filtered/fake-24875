I love this place! I have been going there for a few years now. I typically get the pollo mechado arepa - which are delicious. Having been to Venezuela, they do measure up (although pricey - but that is expected for NYC). The place is cozy and I have never had to wait for a table. My only complaint is that the service tends to be slow but worth the wait for their food.
