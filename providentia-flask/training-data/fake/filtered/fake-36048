This is my first yelp...YIPPIE!!!! Well, I am not typically into getting slices of pizza that are square for the simple reason that I am a bit OCD, and anything square needs to be SQUARE, and if I am going to eat a pie of pizza that is not the usual shape, what end do I bite first?  Crust, short end, long end... Could I put this aside for a slice of Roberta's...sure, why not.  I'm really not THAT OCD, maybe just particular about things...many things. I asked the guy at the counter for the squarest slice he could get me, and with my trembling hand wanting to mold it into a more perfect shape I put it in the 'ol mouth. Soft.  Airy.  Oily.  Buttery.  Fresh.  Surprising?  Sure, yes surprising. From the looks of this place I would think it was a salvage yard for dead cars, but as it turns out (thanks to my fellow yelpers), it is a restaurant with a great slice of square pizza. I won't be back for at least another few weeks, but when I do, I have to sit and eat some round pizza...the yelpers say it's good.
