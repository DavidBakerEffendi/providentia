I've been to Zavino several times now, and had such a great experience with each visit that I feel I must "yelp" it out loud! The ambiance is a wonderful juxtaposition, presenting a relaxed feel of a local pizzeria with a sophisticated and modern twist.  The service is always friendly and inviting, and above all - knowledgeable.  Whenever I have a question about potential dinner or drink choices, the server/bartender take their time to explain why a certain wine will be better paired with a particular dish.   And then, of course, there is the food.  Simply put - the best oven pizza I've had in the city.  The chefs clearly express their culinary creativity by presenting daily specials (which could be found on the chalk boards at the bar).  The staples that are found on the main menu are always a hit.  I just love the Spinach pizza.  And being able to see your pie being made in the oven just adds to the dining experience (at least for me). Overall, simply put -  a great place to enjoy a nice meal and drinks.
