Chef Mark and his staff made my daughters bridal shower exceptional! This was my first time at MEAL, and I was extremely impressed as every dish was delicious...and what great ambience! Guest favorites were mac & cheese ( this isn't your ordinary mac n' cheese), Diablo-style mussels, and the (MEAL) chips. After creative spins on classic dishes, as a grand finale, we finished off with carrot cake slices and homemade gelatos!!! Â What started as a 3-hour reservation became almost a 5 hour event. We even left a few stragglers around Mark's beautiful bar to sip cocktails at the end of the night. We still have guests reminiscing about the restaurant a month later, it was that good - special thanks to Mark for making Tamara's special day!
