My three star review is based solely on their lack of bar food. The prices are right, the bartenders are the nicest, the pool table is good enough, and the crowd is always a great mix of people. The only problem is that you can't get anything to snack on...all they serve is full entrees of Ethiopian food. They wouldn't even make me the house salad if I didn't order an entree. The menu has ethiopian "bar snacks," but they apparently discontinued those. All they need is some french fries or even some sort of Ethiopian finger food, and they'd be an absolute favorite.
