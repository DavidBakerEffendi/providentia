My husband and I were in the area visiting from VT with another couple and their daughter and asked some friends where to get lunch, 7 different ones said to try here. We're so happy they did! I got the stew, my husband the fish & chips. AMAZING!!!!! That stew will haunt my dreams in the best possible way!!! My husband and the other man with us were both pretty excited that there was Guinness on tap as well!
