We watched as the Wisdom Diner closed and signs for "Arusuvai, Coming Soon" went up. Once it opened, we were curious to try it out and finally did, two weeks ago. We were not disappointed! The decor (wisdom at the tables) and layout seemed like that of the diner that Arusuvai succeeded, but the food was exactly what they promised. We went to Arusuvai at lunch time and tried the buffet. The vegetarian dishes, condiments and dosa were authentic and delicious. Non vegetarian entrees included one of everything Â - fish, mutton,chicken. The staff are attentive and friendly, the "madras" coffee is addictive. We went back exactly a week later and we surprised by different choices. We're adding this to our folio of regular places. 5 stars if the desserts pick up a little bit!
