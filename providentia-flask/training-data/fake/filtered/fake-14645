If there was a no star option I would have put it. This place is a total dump inside and out. I wouldn't be surprised if once the lights go out the roaches come out to play. Pizza is absolutely terrible..I guess that's what happens when middle Easterns try and make Italian food.. Absolutely horrible..go to Villa on ridge rd waaaaaaaay better
