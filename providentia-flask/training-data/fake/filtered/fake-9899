Delicious meal in a great atmosphere on a cute street. I ate the yogurt and herbs, the persian spiced chicken wings and the pappardelle. I had the jalepeno margarita too. The yogurt an herb dish was delicious - it reminded me of the mos'o'khiar my mother would make. The chicken wings were cooked so that they were tasty and crunchy instead of greasy and fatty. And the pappardelle was delicious (I love shiitake mushrooms!). The jalepeno margarita was super spicy but I love spicy drinks so I highly recommend it. Overall I highly recommend Bijan's!
