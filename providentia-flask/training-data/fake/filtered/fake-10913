Ok, this is for me!  I won't write a positive review until I've been back to a place a few times.  After six visits, I absolutely am going to be a regular.  Not particularly close to my home, but it is always worth the trip.  Twice we also brought friends with us and every one of them has been very pleased (and some can be fussy).  The food is several notches above regular/good neighborhood Italian fare, the portions are generous, and if you can get Martha as your waitress, you are going to have one very nice occasion.  Do it.
