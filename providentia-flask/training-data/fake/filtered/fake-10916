Im new in town and decided to try this place with my love one. The food was excellent, Our waiter was really nice! the only thing I dislike was the professionalism of the manager. He was very rude to the customers who order take out, I over heard him label a few customers "BRO" or "BUDDIE" instead of "SIR" or "MR" He came to our table (for about 5 sec) and I didn't know what to say, Maybe his pants where too tight or he was doing leg stretching or he had ants in his pants. It was just not professional to me.
