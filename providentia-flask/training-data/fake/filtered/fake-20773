Went there on 09/14/2012 This place wasn't all that great, all the reviews on YELP fooled me! I just didn't feel comfy at this place all, the decor wasn't all that inviting either. Food was on the salty side 2 stars at most compare to other french places in the city. the Zagat and Yelp reviews are bs... I end up paying around $160 for dinner at this place with 2 apps, 2 drinks and 2 main dish, i feel like i could have went else where like Almonds, Antibes or La Sirene to get a better ambiance and better food for less or the same place. Now going again...
