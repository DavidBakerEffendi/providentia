The place is small and it gets really packed. Its clean- funky lay back ambiance. Inexpensive place to catch up with friends/family over hearty arepas and delicious natural juices. We ordered different types of arepas and they were all delicious. You will get full with one arepa-then again am nine months prego-and one arepa felt like five in my stomach =). Def recommend this place for its food and service.
