My husband and I have been following Demetri Malki for a few years now. His attention to detail, professionalism and captivating spirit impressed us from day one. When we heard he was opening De Novo we could not be happier. We knew this would be the beginning of an exciting culinary adventure for all players. We were right. My first visit to De Novo was during the soft opening. The ambience and décor are on point. We went back to celebrate my birthday five days later and had a fantastic experience. We started with some of the signature cocktails (Fig in the City was my favorite) and made our way to sangria. The Peach Cobbler sangria was FANTASTIC! We ordered some small plates that were extremely generous in size (not so small at all): prosciutto and fig flatbread, mussels, wings, and garlic shrimp. All extremely fresh and delicious! We had the scallops and cauliflower fondue for our entrée and again, fantastic. We finished off the night in the outdoor area enjoying our after-dinner drinks. From beautiful indoors to outdoor seating, brunch, lunch, dinner and bar, this place has it all. We are very excited to go back and try everything else on the menu.
