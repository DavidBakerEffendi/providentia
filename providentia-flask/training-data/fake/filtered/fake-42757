I hear the food is good, but don't call and ask about the price range it's a secret. I wanted to make sure I was prepared when I went so I called to ask and Â Joe Pesci told me he cootant give me dat ova da phone. Maybe he was afraid I wouldn't come if he told me how expensive it was. Thanks for saving me the trip pal. I'll be @ Buon Appetito down the street if you need me.
