Absolutely horrendous.  The service was terrible and the food mediocre at best.  I went with three other adults who were severed their food well before my wife and me.  We encouraged them to eat and not wait for us and so their food was gone before we were even served.  Not even their ice cream, which is their "claim to fame', was any good.  I'll never go there again
