The roasted chicken is always great tasting, finger licking good.  However, the sweet potato fries are always charred, burnt??  Burnt anything ruins the dinner.   No matter how often I have asked "please don't burn the sweet potato fries"  they don't seem to get the concept and continue to serve charred fries.  If the restaurant workers require prompting to not burn food....find somewhere else to eat. Burnt food is unhealthy and horrible tasting.  Please stop burning the sweet potatoes fries!
