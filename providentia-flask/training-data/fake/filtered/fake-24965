My wife and I always watch chopped, and we frequently see Scott Conant on the show and we thought since he is so critical of other's pasta that he must have a great restaurant, so we tried Scarpetta.  I was looking forward to trying the spaghetti tomato basil because we followed his recipe at home for it, and it came amazing.  We got to Scarpetta at 9:55.  The first thing that struck me was how small the restaurant is.  We had a 10PM reservation. They said it would be a few minutes so we went to the bar.  I ordered a glass of pinot grigio and a diet coke for my wife. The glass of pinot was 16, and the soda was 4!  We ended up waiting at the bar for 40 minutes until our table was ready!  They gave us a horrible table right by the door, where there was a very cold draft from air conditioning.  Why did they have air conditioning on when it was forty degrees outside? I do not know.  We ordered an appetizer, two spaghetti tomato basil, chicken, and the veal.  The spaghetti tomato basil was a huge disappointment.  The tomato sauce was not sweet enough. You need to use San Marzano tomatos, Scott.  And there was not enough cheese.  The chicken was pan fried. It had barely any taste. Try grilling it.  We also had three different waiters who barely paid any attention to our table even though we spent over 200.  Scott, you have great recipes, but your restaurant is sub par.  You need to stop by and cook more often.  My wife makes your spaghetti tomato basil recipe 20 times better than it is at your restaurant. Come over any time and we will make it for you.  You have been chopped!
