all my boyfriend and i wanted was some food at a late night joint last night. much to our dismay, they were closed. it was only 11:30pm! i peeped my head in and there was mariachi music blaring. the two guys cleaning looked up at me, stared for a second, and went back to cleaning without saying a word to me. so i decided to give them a call, hoping that someone would be able to give me an answer. the girl on the phone says to me, "we were slow tonight so we decided to close early." i respond, "aren't you guys supposed to be open until 2am?" she replies, "yes, but like i told you, we closed early because we were slow. try us again some other time." wow. if you advertise that you are open until 2am, stay open until 2am! i posted a status update on facebook about how bummed out we were and a friend replied to my post stating that the same thing happened to him the previous night. my goodness! thank god blue ribbon stays open until they say they are going to be, because we ended up going there and had a fabulous time. thank you blue ribbon!
