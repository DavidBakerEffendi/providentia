We went to one of the first NJ Cicis Chain store in Howell last year and saw they just opened up one here this year and thought it was pretty cool for the price.  Our daughter had a great time playing video games in the back and the store seemed really new and clean.   It is an excellent cheap place to go right before Regal Cinema.
