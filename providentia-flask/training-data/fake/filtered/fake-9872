I had an extremely good experience at Forge. We went during a dinnertime where it got quite busy but the service was not compromised at all - it was very prompt and friendly. Our table of 4 tried the 5 course tasting menu and the restaurant gave us the option having different entrees served to us so that as a table we had greater variety of dishes and can pick at each other's food. We liked this suggestion and went with it (we are a family so we don't mind sampling each other's dish). The food was very good and innovative - a great opportunity for foodies to try new combinations of ingredients. In the end, though we ordered the 5 course tasting menu, there seemed to be 8-9 distinct courses as there were some complimentary dishes served in between. Including the variety of entrees served to us, I sampled about 14 dishes in total and had a very satisfying meal.
