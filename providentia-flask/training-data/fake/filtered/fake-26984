This place is amazing! I've been there twice now. First time I went with my boyfriend for a special night out. We had a great bottle of wine... duckhorn I think, and we shared the ribeye for two. It was hands down the best steak I've had in years, maybe ever. They get all their meat from a nearby farm and they butcher it in site. So cool! The next time I went in with a group of my best friends for a ladies night. We had half priced cocktails (their "hump day" promotion). I got the old checkered house. It was the perfect blend of boozy bourbon and aromatic amaro. Sorry for the alliteration! Anyway... we all got different burgers/sandwiches. My beef burger was a perfect medium rare with smokey char on the outside and juicy deliciousness on the inside. What really surprised me though was my girlfriend's veggie burger...wow! Lentils, mushrooms, a light herby yogurt sauce. yum. I really can't say enough good things about Guild! I'll be back soon for sure!
