Max's has always been in contention with Grants in my mind, & the two are essentially right across the street from one another. The food is similar, and the prices are fairly comparable. Max's has a slightly less formal atmosphere, although don't think there's a lack of suits inside. Max's, as the name suggests, also focuses more on the raw bar and seafood/shellfish than Grants does. Not being a big shellfish fan myself, I've had a few choice fillets at Max's including the sole and salmon. But for me the reason I go there is the filet minot. On par with Grants, you won't be disappointed with the steak at either restaurant.
