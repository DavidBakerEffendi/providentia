I took a pair of interns during lunch hour here to reward them for their work. I think the best positive factor of this place I their service. Our waiter was exceptional at recommending what was great on the menu along with pairing wines with what we ordered. I had the NY Strip steak (was in the mood for steak not seafood) which was cooked to perfection the way I asked for it. We had fresh oysters for starters and their desert s equally good to the entrees. Try the cheesecake....TRUST. The staff are really good at ensuring their patrons are consistently happy with out being overly annoying. New Yorkers know that this attribute is seldom discovered. Overall a superb experience.
