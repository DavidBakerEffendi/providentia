A rare treat when the food lives up to the hype.  Made the trip from Baltimore and wanted a great cheesesteake since we were in Philly.  It beats anything I've ever had from the dozens of carry out spots I've been to over the years.   Perfectly cooked and seasoned meat.  Tender, juicy, generous amount. Perfect cheese ratio and enhances the meat, not overwhelming it.  Fresh bread and toppings.   Call ahead though because it's small and stays busy.  My only wish was that they had a larger and updated facility.  The cheesesteake is so good though it really didn't matter.
