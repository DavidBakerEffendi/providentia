I was very excited to go to this restaurant, but was very disappointed when I left. It was horrible. Everything tasted awful. First they served us the appetizers and a few minutes later they started to bring out the main dishes. Everyone received their main dishes at different times. It was so weird how every five to ten minutes one person was getting their meal. I know we were a party of 13 but get it together. The salad's did not have dressing on it. We kept asking for the dressing and just totally stopped because we basically gave up. Some of the main dishes came out cold. And some skirt steak orders were under cooked. What was hilarious? My cousin ordered steak with a fried egg on top. The waiter brings her a single fried egg on a plate. Lol. What happened to the steak? Â Lol. Overall it was a horrible experience. The waiter was nice I am sure it wasn't his fault. Obviously he isn't the one in the kitchen. Never going back there again. Would rather drive out to Northern blvd in queens and eat columbian food there. Sorry. I know I sound harsh. But it was the worst restaurant experience I have ever had
