This proves that "greasy spoon" can be a banner to fly proudly.  The food is great, satisfying and reasonable.  You can find all your favorite artery cloggers here, and they're all really flavorful and well-made.  Great burgers.  And the surroundings are really fun.  It's a "dive" but with a wink and a smile.  Nice folks behind the counter, too.
