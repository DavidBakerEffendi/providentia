I've been to Bartaco a few times over the past few years and have never been that impressed.   The restaurant is centrally located in West Hartford center.  The atmosphere is fun and casual.  My most recent trip was on a Saturday afternoon for lunch and I had no problem getting a seat right away.  There is a huge wrap around bar area with plenty of seating.  During warm weather, there is a ton of patio seating and the front of the restaurant has giant doors that open, which creates a great open air feel.   Now for the negatives.  During my last visit, I ordered chips and salsa, the spicy cucumber salad and three tacos (sesame ribeye).  First of all, the portions are TINY.  The tacos where about 2 to 3 bites each with very little meat and a small amount of lettuce.  The chips and salsa are served with 3 (yes 3!) chips, each about the size of a sand dollar.  The cucumber salad was probably about 4 slices of cucumber.  Unless you order a ton of food, expect to leave somewhat hungry.   The taste of the food was okay.  Wasn't horrible, but certainly was top notch.  Just okay and unmemorable.   Lastly, the price.  I have no problem paying higher prices for quality food, but given the portion sizes and blah taste, the price is too high in my opinion.  Not to mention, they nickel and dime you for everything.  Chips and salsa, yup, another $3 (aren't chips and salsa usually complimentary at most Mexican places?).  An 8 oz Coke, yup, $3 with no free refills (yes, 8 oz is about 4 sips).   Bottom line, the atmosphere is casual and fun, but the food is okay and is overpriced.  There are better places to eat in West Hartford center.  Unless you're going for a drink, I would skip Bartaco.
