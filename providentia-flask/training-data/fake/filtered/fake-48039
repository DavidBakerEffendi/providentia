Finally a midtown bar that is worth visiting.  Really  nice vibe, excellent drink selection and a menu that manages to be both different and tasty.  The upstairs area is more intimate and they have an outside space as well which is an added bonus. Have been there on a few occasions at different times and have always enjoyed being there.  Staff are very friendly and attentive. Keep up the good work.
