The atmosphere is quaint, typical NYC restaurant. The food was Â bland with cold spots, it was plain gross. I never thought anyone can mess up mashed potatoes and snapper. How? I don't know but I tried to eat it and I really just couldn't. Our waitress seemed to not know the words "you're welcome" so we stopped saying thank you. We barely gave a tip but they didn't deserve anything. Luckily there was a 5Guys around the corner. Spent $100 at this crappy place just to get $20 burgers.
