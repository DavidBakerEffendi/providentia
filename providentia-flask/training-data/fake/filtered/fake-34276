Great place for traditional sushi.  Make sure you eat at the sushi bar, the tables are for amateurs.  The place has a cool vibe and the sushi chefs really cater to your taste when you sit at the bar.  The 90min is weird, sushi is on the expensive side, but the drinks are cheap, and the experience is worth it.
