What a fabulous surprise!  Outstanding Italian food at a very reasonable price.  Of course, you need reservations, it's not a large place.  However, when Giorgio himself greets you, you just know you are in for a treat.   I have to confess, I never did get past the appetizer menu, but then I have a good reason to go back soon.  My byob of prosecco went perfectly with the Mussels and Clams, which were tender perfection in a light sauce that did not overwhelm their delicate flavors.  The Carpaccio was also outstanding, melt-in-your-mouth tender with just the right lemon tang, and deliciously fresh shaved parmesan.  We finished off with the Prosciutto Platter (and a second bottle of prosecco), served with fresh fruit and mozzarella.  Sounds like light dining, but we were pleasantly full, and enjoyed a wonderful variety of flavors.  Next time, the pasta.
