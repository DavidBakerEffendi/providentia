Love the lamb sandwich, love the wine selection. The wine tasting dinners are always fun and untypical. The food is solid and consistently good. No bells and whistles average but well executed. Â Brunch was a bit of a let down, I was shocked when to re-fill my "fresh squeezed" orange juice the waiter brought over the cardboard carton of Tropicana.... sad... I mean at least put it in a carafe to make us feel a little bit better about paying $6.00 a glass.
