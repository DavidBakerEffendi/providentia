wow, what a great meal i had. The food is of great quality and tastes great! All the food is interesting Â and flavorful and is great for sharing. I love the space and find it enjoyable and just a great experience overall. I can not believe that this place has only been open about a month. This will be one of the hottest places in philly for a long time to come!!! Must have the frog legs, Banh mi and the tuna tarter!!!
