OK, so we didn't sit at the sushi bar - probably our first mistake.  But should it really be that if you get seated at a regular table, your meal is going to be so much worse than everyone at the bar? The menu specifies the chef's recommendations for which sushi that were supposed to be the "freshest" of the night - so we ordered a sushi/sashimi combo to try a big variety of these chosen fish. Way too salty, way too fishy, and almost inedible. The best fish is never too fishy! Maybe just an off night?  Or maybe just overrated. check out harrietmagpie.com/?p=1613 for pictures and details of fish.
