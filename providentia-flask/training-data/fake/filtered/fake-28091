I have been to Mac's about 5 times and every time has been great.  Great bar to hang at and they really hooked me with the High Life price.  All of the food items I have tried have been excellent.  I have only eaten apps every time I have gone in but they have been everything I hoped for.  The fish tacos were fantastic.
