I eaten at Bistro about once a week since their doors opened--more than any other restaurant that I've ever considered a favorite. Their waitstaff treats the customers like family and diners are encouraged to enjoy a leisurely evening. We never feel like they are trying to turn the table over. I've eaten just about everything on the menu--highlights are the paella and all the tapas; the specials are great though, and I often skip the menu all together. This restaurant has developed a true following and if you visit it once, you'll see why!
