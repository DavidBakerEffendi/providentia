I've never had a bad experience here. It's always good and it's always fresh too. Sometimes the lines get long but they move pretty quickly so you never wait too long. Like others have said previously, don't expect to stay here and eat. There's about 6 barstools and when the place gets crammed it's almost impossible to sit there and eat anyways.
