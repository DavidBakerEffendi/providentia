A wonderful old-style diner. I'm in the food business and I can tell you that this place does not cut corners! All the little details were there: Cabot butter, real Vermont Maple syrup, high quality bacon etc. the service is outstanding and the food is delicious. My kids both ordered the chocolate chip pancakes and loved them. I had the Killington classic which was awesome. Eggs and bacon sandwiched between two pieces of french toast. Highly recommend stopping here during your travels. The prices are very reasonable considering the quality and quantity of the food.
