Wow, what an awesome experience I had here before a devils game last Friday.  Despite the crowd the service was overly friendly and the food service was fast.  They have an extensive beer menu and the waiter we had was knowledgeable of all the craft beers.  They treat beer like some other high end places treat wine. Regarding the food I had it was awesome.  Ended up ordering what I think was called a "Jersey Burger" that was topped with a fried egg and taylor ham paired with a couple double IPAs   Probably enough calories for 2 days worth but you only live once. I was really skeptical of any place around the prudential center after I had a series of incredible disasters at their competition right up the street (a place that shall remain nameless).  They have restored my faith in humanity....or at least in restaurants close to the pru center.
