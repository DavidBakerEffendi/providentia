I went there with my co workers for a team meeting and it was a great environment to be. There were about 10 of us and the hospitality was perfect. I had ordered the pancakes with mixed fruits and eggs with salmon and I had cranberry juice. When I saw my plate it was like heaven. The portion was phenomenal. If i knew that the pancakes were going to be that much i would have ordered on set to share with someone else. My coworker kept saying that it was heaven pancakes and I did not believe her until I had a bite OMG it was delicious. It is the BEST pancakes I've ever had in my life. I thought IHOP  was the best But I  was wrong. The pancakes melted in my mouth like cotton candy. I would definitely go back there!!! I am actually going there for lunch today yay me!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I can't wait!!! :)
