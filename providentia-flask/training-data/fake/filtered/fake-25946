On a recent trip to NY.  Of the four people we had two Caesar salads.  In both of the salads there was lettuce that had gone bad.  It was interesting how they presented it.  The lettuce was on the same place of two different plates. When I asked to see the chef I was told that he was having a meeting with his publicist. The place looked great, too bad they didn't take more time with the food.
