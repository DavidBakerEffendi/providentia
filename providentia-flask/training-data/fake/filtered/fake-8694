I had reservations for Saturday evening June 23rd at 6:30, table for four.  Our friends were coming from Voorhees, NJ.  When we got there the place was locked.  We called and were told the chef decided to do a private catering job. We told the woman on the phone that it would have been nice if someone bothered to call us.  All that was offered was an apology.  Not a good way to do business. We went to Dimitri's a few blocks away and that was excellent.
