Lets start off with the positives. The entire place is kept very clean, including the restaurant areas. That was it for positives. Â I suggest that you stay away on the weekends unless you are attending a birthday party. We went today at 1:30pm and it was a disaster from the start. I put $100 on the Nomads cards figuring that would be plenty. First stop was the rock climbing wall....Closed for a private party (told to come back in two hours). I was starting to see the theme of the day. Headed over to the Laser tag. Looking forward to taking on my boys in a quick game of Laser tag. Nope could not do that either. The waiting list was filled out and the next opening was 7:45 that night. Off to mini golf. Yet another letdown as they were closed due to a lack of golf balls. At this point I was glad I put a $100 on the card. Did I mention it was non-refundable. Got in line at the Bumper cars and actually was nice enough to let the three behind us go in front as I had four boys and there was only three cars left. Big mistake as one of the party host tried to inform us that he was bumping us out of the way so that his group could go on the bumper cars. I remained calm and stood my ground. My boys got to go on the ride first.....for 4 minutes. If I could have gotten a refund I would have left. Would have killed the day on the basketball courts but those are an extra $50.00 per hour. I let the boys spend the rest in the arcade and called it a day. So for $100 I got a four minute ride on the bumper cars and a bunch of video games. Next time I will stay home and play games for free. I'm sure this place could have been fun but only if you are part of the special parties. If you are just looking to take the kids out for fun then do yourself a favor and stay away from here.
