I walked into this restaurant way back in college, searching for decent pizza in the New Haven Â area. Ever since then, this place has been my absolute favorite pizza. I now live in FL, but on every visit back I drive straight to Ernie's, first thing. The BEST crust, best sauce and cheese, there is NOTHING else like this pizza, including Pepe's, Sally's and the rest. I remain their #1 fan. Try it out and you'll agree, there's nothing like Ernie's Pizza.
