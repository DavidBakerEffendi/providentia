I was thinking to go out with the friends but the place wasn't decided we tried to decide but we were confused about the places. I love this place as this was the most wonderful place in NY, I loved this place and have visited just once. A friend of mine suggested this palce to us. We went there and experienced a first class service and the atmosphere. We had a great time in there. The food here is great and the service is quick with the staff which is friendly, the atmosphere is great and calm we had fun there.The server was awesome. I am gonna visit this place again. The first experience was great, hoping best for the next visit.
