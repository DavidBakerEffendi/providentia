My parents and I go here all the time. I've never had a meal less than perfect. Oyster nights on Wednesdays are a steal! The service is great; my water glass was always filled promptly. I'm always excited to hear the specials as they are excellent. The other day I had bison and it was cooked to perfection, it tasted like filet mignon with more flavor. Great place!
