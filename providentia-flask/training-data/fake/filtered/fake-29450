Overall probably one of the BEST places to eat on the Island. The staff was friendly, helpful, and extremely attentive. The atmosphere was cozy. Prices were very reasonable and last but not least the food was great. We started with the corn nuggets which was a sweet corn mash, breaded and fried (yum). My girlfriend had a vegetable dish (they had 3 veggie dishes on the menu) that had fresh yellow and green squash sauteed with onions and corn (not many places, and I had the Drunken shrimp. The entire dining experience was supurb. We will continue to visit Adobe Blues on a regular basis.
