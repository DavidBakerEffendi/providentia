If it were just the food then I would give 4-5 stars.  However, the service has been terrible.  Each time my wife and I have ordered one of our dishes has arrived cold.  The waiters blame it on the chef; the owner says he will do something about the situation, but hasn't as yet.  And when you are looking for a waiter to refresh your drink or for other reasons they are hiding somewhere else.  This is based on 4 visits.
