The bagels were great big and very well done.. there sandwichs were amazing. . The pizza has a new york style taste with thin crust. . I will have lunch there everyday wi th great service.. from what the owners tell me frozen yogurt is coming to this place which just made it a great place... for breakfast, lunch, dinner, and now desert. . Nice
