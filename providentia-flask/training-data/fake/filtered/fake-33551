Last night for our monthly girls night out we tried the newly opened Treemont. The space was beautiful and the vibe was sexy and sophisticated. We started with some of the signature cocktails. I tried the Engineers Thumb which was almost sangria-like and then we moved on to a bottle of Sauv Blanc that was fantastic and super affordable. Our server encouraged us to share the plates so we decided to order a few appetizers and a few entrees to split between all of us. Every bite was fantastic and kept us guessing. The gnudi is a must have for an appetizer and the beef short rib was to die for. Didn't even need a knife. We asked to meet the chef and he came out. Chef Rob came out to say hello and spoke with a neighboring table as well. Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!
