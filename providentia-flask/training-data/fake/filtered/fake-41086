I have been going to Sofia for quite some time and a few days ago would have given a 5 Star review.  This past Tuesday I was meeting a friend there - it was crowded and there was no room at the bar.  There was an available table for two but the waiter refused to seat us unless we ordered food (and was not very nice about it).  Sofia is a wine bar and we have been there many times, ordered multiple glasses, bottles and probably spent more than people who sit to eat (it is mostly small plates).  Well, we went around the corner to Cava on 2nd Ave who had no problem seating for wine only and was fabulous.  Might be our new replacement!  Hopefully Sofia will change it ways and realize that a wine bar with only 6 or so seats at the bar shouldn't turn people away (regular customers I might add) by requiring them to order food.
