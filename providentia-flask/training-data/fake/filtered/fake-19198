Burrito Bar is definitely a "different" kind of place on Staten Island - and I mean good different. The food here is really, really good - the chips and salsa might be the best I've ever had. If you're here at night drinking, they will even give you them for free with endless refills! The drinks are creative and STRONG. One maui wowee and you'll be having fun no matter what! The frozen margaritas are delicious too. And the sangria.... Overall a great place to eat and drink! Oh, and I took one star off because of the gross bathroom - the toilet always seems to get clogged and the floor is always mysteriously soaking wet. Yuck.
