What a great find! Thank you fellow Yelp members. This is an ideal spot for anyone commuting out of Grand Central Station. A 5 minute walk brings you into another world. It is a bit tricky to find. I was looking for a basement entrance from the street. I ordered a dish of duck with scallions. I am no expert on Japanese cuisine but the flavor of that duck was.....well it's all it's quacked up to be! The small serving size was not what I' m accustomed to so I had to savor every bite. They have a huge sake selection but unfortunately I also have some serious driving ahead of me. Hopefully next time I'll be able to try some sake. So glad I found Sakagura!
