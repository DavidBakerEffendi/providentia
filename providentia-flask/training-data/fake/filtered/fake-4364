My fianc√© and I went to Don Peppes to celebrate our 4 year anniversary. We had heard from friends that the food was delicious there. Upon entering the place we didn't expect it to be open spaced and so casual...but after we had the great baked clams ...the unbelievable liguini with clams sauce and fantastic veal don pepe we did not care about the decor !!!! The place is a must go and we are definitely going back!
