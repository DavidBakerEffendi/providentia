Love it! Been coming here for years. This is a very popular place, and with good reason. Cheap and delicious! Get the Spicy Noodles or some of their Coconut Curry! Only issue we ever have is with the service. Service can be really spotty sometimes even when it's not very busy. Some days it's good, some day's it's hilariously bad. Be prepared to have to hunt down your waiter sometimes. All in all, for the price, the food and the atmosphere - I will keep coming back year after year! Oh, and don't forget: CASH ONLY!
