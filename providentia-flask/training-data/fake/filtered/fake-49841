I came to Lobby on a Wednesday and loved it, food is great, drinks are good and the prices are reasonable. Â My problem was coming on a Saturday, I was surprised that a restaurant/sports bar was charging me $10 to park my car, I' understand if its a club but is not! And then a rude "bouncer" asking for IDs? Really? Is a restaurant/bar , is like going to "Buffalo Wild Wings" or "Applebee's " and getting harassed by bouncer when you get in. I think the owner should be more reasonable with his costumers on charging people before even going inside that's not good customer service plus is in Elizabeth and not in Manhattan . And then getting ID at the door? It should be the waitress job to ask for ID like any other restaurant/sports bar.
