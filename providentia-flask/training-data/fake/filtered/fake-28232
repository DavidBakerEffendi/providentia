my best friend actually suggested for us to visit the restaurant, and I'm glad she did. I really enjoyed the meal. I ordered the Napa Chicken, and I thought it was really delicious. It was juicy and filling. :) The staff and the owner are very friendly and make sure that the costumers were happy. The wait was not bad at all. It took, at the most, seven minutes for our meals to come out. I would highly recommend this place to others and is definitely going to visit again.
