I was told by Yelp to write my review in detail...well, it is very simple...our experience with the owner over the weekend was awful...he has incredibly bad attitude, he is short with the customers, he has a lot to learn from the staff...the place itself is nice and food good but the owner takes the stars down with his unprofessional behavior. He should learn how to treat the patrons from his staff....sad.
