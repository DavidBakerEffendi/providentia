I dined there on Saturday night.  The decor was nicely done, very tasteful.  I was not overly impressed with their menu.  I feel there should be more choices. I ordered the Filet Mignon and it was very good, however, my friend ordered the pasta and it was just plain awful.   The wait staff needs improvement.  Very slow and clumsy.  Twice the waiter re-filled my water glass OVER my meal.  Better training is definately needed. All in all it was "OK."  I would not rush out to eat there again but I may give it another try. I do want to add one more thing.  Although I hope that the business does well, I think it may be a little too upscale in this economy.  Not knocking Bayonne as I live there but it is a little on the expensive side and I don't think too many people are willing to spend more than they can.
