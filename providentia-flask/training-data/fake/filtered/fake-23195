I came there with a party of 10! Â My friends came in from out of town and were completely blown away. The food was on point, I was temped to nearly lick my plate and when I looked over down our table my friends were swiping their fingers on the plate ,just to lick the sauce off! Lol, Amazing is all I can say! Best restaurant in Brooklyn, hands down. All the specialty drinks are made with organic fresh fruits! Need I say more? Things you must try are Wings Fried Oysters Mussels Shrimp and Lobster Grits Salmon Whole Fish with dirty rice Mac and cheese
