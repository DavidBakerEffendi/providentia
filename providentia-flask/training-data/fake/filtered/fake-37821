Roberto and his brother are rightfully making their Italian mama proud.  This  quaint restaurant, set away from the hustle and bustle of the main part of South Street is an absolute delight!  The service was excellent- they brought out a few italian tapas on the house.  The crowning glory was the rolled calamari.  Mamamia!
