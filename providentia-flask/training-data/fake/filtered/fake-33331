A 2 course lunch in a fabulous NY restaurant for $25.  Impossible, you say?  Really.  And what a great deal this is.  I tried the Roasted Apple Soup just because I had never heard of apple soup.  It was sooooooo good.  Followed that with the Prawns, with coconut and curry - a perfect combination of sweet and spicy.  It was served with my favorite squash, spaghetti squash, also perfect, a little crunch to it.  The service was amazingly good, considering the place was packed.  Not sure I can afford dinner, but I might save up for it!
