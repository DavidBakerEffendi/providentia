Good food + reasonable prices.  Cucumber capiroska was tasty.  Waiter was attentive.  But hostess was atrociously obnoxious.  7pm reservation for 6 people -  and by 7:45 she kept hawking by our table waiting to turn it.  Never seen anything like it. Busboys were practically taking the fork from our mouths as we finished our entrees.   I get that it is asaturdaynight and busy, but show some class!
