We were there on Friday nite. The place was empty. Food was ok but will never go there again. We paid for 1/3 of the bill with a gift certificate of $100.  Management came over to the table and asked who belonged to the certificate. We said we did and he said he could not accept it because it was more than two years old. It does not say anywhere that this is their policy, nor does it appear on the certificate.  After arguing with the gentleman, we had to end up paying the $100. Unfair.  The establishment had already gotten the money previously. Not only did he lose us as customers, but we are telling everyone we know not to come here.
