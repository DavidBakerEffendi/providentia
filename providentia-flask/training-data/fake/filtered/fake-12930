I don't know who they have back there in the kitchen but the food is fabulous - and the service is excellent. It is by far our favorite Italian Restaurant. My husband and I eat there often and have never been disappointed. I am a chef and an editor of an Arts Magazine that includes culinary art so I can be very critical. Â So believe me when I tell you - that you will simply enjoy both the food and the service. Well Done! Pietros on Walnut Street Always, CM
