I took my daughter out for lunch today and we went to Turks,I asked her if she wanted to go there because I was craving one of their lobster rolls.I have been going there for years and I have always like their food and their service.I didnt have a lot of time so we went over to the self serve side.Well we couldnt sit at one table because it was disgusting it looked like they wiped it with a dry rag,gross.So we found a seat and our food came out in a reasonable time.My daughter had a cheeseburger and fries and she liked both.I had a lobster roll which is pretty good for the price and was served with warm butter.I also had a hotdog and an ice tea.The ice tea was good and so was the hotdog.Here's the issue I had today and its a HUGE issue with me.The place had lots of house flies in the self serve area it was DISGUSTING!!!!!! I had a fly or two that kept landing on my legs I guess I shouldnt have worn shorts.I also had to keep swatting them away from me as I was trying to eat.When I got up to get ketchup and mustard i decided not to take any fresh onion from their condiment tray because all I could think about is how many flies were probably walking on the onion.It was so gross.I dont know what a restruant can do when they have so many flies but they need to address this issue.I dont know if I will go there any time soon,if ever again.Its too bad because Turks has a great location and does have a decent sea food menu.I did want to tell the two girls who I could see were in the kitchen,I could see them thru their window where they pass the food when its ready to be served.Well I wanted to bring the fly issue to their attention but they were too busy stuffing their faces in clear view of the customers so I just left in disappointment.Not good Turks, not good.
