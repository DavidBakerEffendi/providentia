A very good friend was talking about the rum cake.  I decided to stop by to pick up a slice and ended up ordering jerk shrimp, beans and rice, salad (all of this came with the jerk shrimp).  They put curry chicken gravy on my rice and beans.  Well ... Let me tell you... I have never had this type of food before and it was EXCELLENT.  Taking my husband with me this week to try it.  The staff is very gracious and courteous.  I went back in for more gravy because it was sooooo good and was prepared to pay and they GAVE it to me.  Hospitality, great food, and rum cake.... Perfect!  I"m in love with Jamaican food now!!!!  I wish them lots of success.... A lady from Summit!
