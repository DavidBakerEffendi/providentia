I had the same exact experience that Jay. D had I mean the same very exact experience and i wish i could of got the girls name while i picked up my order but i called later to speak with the manager because i apparently interrupted her while she was eating on the bar and gave me an attitude for bothering her while she was trying to eat and then amazingly went back to eat while talking with her friends at the bar and forgot my order that I was waiting on and some kind Spanish gentlemen came from the back and barely knew how to speak english and asked me if everything was ok and I told him my order should of been up by now i would think and he went to the back and told me it was sitting there wating for the waitress to give to me which did not happen of course anyway I called to speak with the manager about this horrible experience and was not surprised who answered (her) and I asked for the manager and she told me he is only there certain days can i please ask what is the problem? so i told her and she to my amazement laughed! the place is not bad to go to but not worth the horrible service AT ALL, I don't know if it is family runned business or they are just hiring friends they like I don't know but it is going to hurt them later on down the line, that's for sure!
