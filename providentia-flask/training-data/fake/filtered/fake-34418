Will never go back here, this is not authentic. The food came out in about 5 minutes which means it wasnt fresh. The rice & beans are straight from a can. I had the carnitas which did taste great, got terribly sick 2hrs later. My stomach was still messed up thr next day. The waiter also wasnt that great, he gave us looks when we ordered like we were dumb. Either the pork or the salsa bar got me sick, I'll never go back.
