I come here all the time during my lunch. And i must say the food is great and the prices are good Â The people are friendly.. Last week i decide to go on saturday or sunday dont really recall but the food at time was horrible. Meat was undone. I dont if they have a different cook on the weekends or is me.. The people that were working were not as friendly as the during the week.. I honestly think if you want to come here come here come during the week for lunch drinks are aswome people friendly food is great by way the soup there is great.. I would rate this 3 stars they need better cooks on the weekends.. Scott and vickki are great bartenders and the young kid that cooks durning the week..
