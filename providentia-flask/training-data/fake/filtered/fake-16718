Miss Rachel is a fantastic preparer and planner of food!  And it's 100% vegan, not vegan, like "I'll have the fried potatoes", vegan like "so much better than the non-vegan food"!!  Anyone who eats animal foods would be jealous if they tasted Miss RAchel's versions.  The restaurant is only open on Saturday night and make your reservations well in advanced.  It's a farmhouse style meal which is kind of weird....but worth it!!!
