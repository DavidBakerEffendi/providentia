Phenomenal.  Went for sister's 50th birthday party in the private room upstairs.  Ambience was very good but noisy.  Wine list was excellent.  Started meal out with grilled octopus and the fluke crudo.  The fluke was delicious and the octopus was even better.  As a pasta course we had some sort of buckwheat pasta with speck in a carbonara sauce and the tagliatelle bolognese.  They were both insanely good and I'd have been happy to have either as a main course.  Then for the entree we had the hanger steak with roasted potatoes and creme freche horseradish sauce and the second dish was grilled bronzino.  I liked the bronzino but the hanger steak was the highlight.  Typically I get steak frites whenever I go to a French bistro (a few very good ones in Philly, near where I live) and the hanger steak here was as good as any hanger steak I've ever had, very tender and juicy and the horseradish creme freche was perfect with it.  The potatoes were super crispy on the outside, soft in the middle and salted perfectly.  For dessert we had chocolate cookies with sea salt, fruit filled shortbread cookies and the olive oil cake.  It was all good.  I'd love to go back next time I'm up in the City.
