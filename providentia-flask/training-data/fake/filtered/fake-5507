UPDATE : I changed my rating from a 1 to a 4 star because their management reached out to me and solved my problems. I am impressed with their professionalism, service and the quick turnaround of customer concerns. OLD REVIEW: I live right across the street from IL Bambino and I am writing this review after coming here regularly for two years. This establishment has been a local favorite of mine (in terms of best ice coffee/coffee/warm beverages). Of course, their food is well prepared and well executed. However, given the fact that my boyfriend and I go there 3 or 4 times per week, I CANNOT OVERLOOK THE INCONSISTENCY AT THE FRONT COUNTER WHEN MAKING BEVERAGES. I used to be able to go in, order my ice coffee and it would taste the same (no matter who makes it). Now, it's like the wild wild west, anything goes. For a place with such a great reputation, its a shame that they cannot make a consistent hot chocolate at the counter, as well.
