I didn't quite get the hysteria about FIve Guys before it opened and after eating there a few times....I still don't get it. Don't get me wrong, the food is solid overall. The burgers are a step up from McDonalds and BK but not much better than Wendy's. The fries while fresh cut and nice and hot tend to be overcooked. I understand that most people like their fries on the crispy side but don't burn the damn things!
