We have been wanting to go to Le Salbuen for a while and went to brunch this morning.. food was great. service was good (waitress was very courteous) until I paid the bill ($52 + 15% tip) and was about to step out of the restaurant.. the chef (and possibly the owner) called for me and she wasn't happy. she said I was very rude (3 or 4 times) for leaving the food and she doesn't want to waste it.. I was a bit taken aback (never had something like that happen to me) and thought she is probably talking about the pancakes my daughters did not finish.. I told her I will take them if she puts them in a box. Next, to my surprise, the waitress gave me the box of fruit salad I ordered but did not get it while we sat there for over an hour. Assumed they missed putting in the order and that was it.. I was asked to pay another $7 for the fruit salad. I quickly paid the addl. $7 and got out of the place as quickly as I can... anyways, what is supposed to have been a very good brunch experience turned very sour at the end and I won't be going back to this place. (too bad - the food was great) btw, I did not even get the invoice and just handed over the credit card to pay the bill. after coming home, realized that they have already charged for the fruit salad first time and was forced to pay again after the chef told me I was rude..
