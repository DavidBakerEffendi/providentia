If I could get a table here more often, I'd give it five stars but every time we try to drop in (we live close by) or even make a reservation a few days in advance they are booked. So they end up being a special occasion place when we are able to book far enough in advance.  Once we tried to get a table at 6pm. When we walked in we were told there was no room even though there were 8 open tables. I guess they were all imminent reservations.   That aside, it's some of the best Italian food in the city. I won't repeat what has been said here. But the food is outstanding.  It's also a great and reasonably priced place for a group party if you plan it ahead with them. We had far more food than we could have finished and everyone had a great time. Only other gripe is we can't even get take-out from there when they don't have tables because "the kitchen can't handle it." My husband and I joke that we'd pay good money to have a regular table there! Enjoy!
