I came here to pick up some ingredients for dinner... pasta... shrimp tomato sauce. First of all there were mobs of people and tourists everywhere... is it a market place, grocery store? restaurant? sandwich bar? The place seems a little confused. However I will say my fresh squid ink pasta was delicious and one of a kind. Coming on a Saturday afternoon may have been a bad idea.. Maybe I'll have better luck next time.
