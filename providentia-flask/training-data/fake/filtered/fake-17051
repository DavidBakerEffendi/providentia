Traveled from NYC after reading the Zagat reviews. Expected a nice ambiance for Valentine Dinner. I was seated in a back room with no ambiance, facing a kitchen door. Dinner was mediocre, the sangria watered down. Service was lacking and had to call the owner to be able to order a glass of wine. It seems to be a popular place for the locals but if you want good service and fine dining Cubanu is not the place.
