My girlfriend and I went here for brunch yesterday and unfortunately we will not return. She had been there many times and always had a fantastic experience. Let me start with the good. The food was fantastic. Fresh and very tasty. My Bellini, while 9 dollars, hit the spot and the fruit puree used to make it was top notch. Unfortunately our waiter was the problem here. He was smug from the start and treated us like garbage. After we sat down i noticed that our table was very wobbly so I asked if we could be moved to another table or have it fixed. He said he would fix it and preceded to climb under the table and start jostling it all over the place. Our drinks were spilling all over the table so my GF and i grabbed our drinks and held them up for about 5 min while he continued to try and fix the table. After we had ordered, he proceeded to ignore us for the rest of the meal. My water remained empty for the rest of the time while we observed him filling other patrons glasses. After our food arrived he did not stop by to see how our food was or acknowledge our existence. We finished our meal and sat there for about 10 min waiting for our plates to be cleared but no such luck. I asked for our check and even when he brought us the bill no words from his mouth, a grunt, and the plates remained. When my GF was trying to sign the bill she had no room to do so as her plate was still on the table so I grabbed her plate and made a little noise as I did so and stacked our plates in front of me. Our server was at the table next to us and saw me do this and still would not come by to clear our table! We we left him a very generous 15% and got outta there. It is unfortunate as this place has fantastic food but this poor schmuck has soured my palate and I will not return.
