I got a pizza there a week ago it was tastier than the other pizzerias out there, but i'm not sure what all the hype is about. If you're walking by stop in, but it's not worth a special trip. what bothers me is the long time I had to wait until I got my pizza. after finishing the first slice I was still hungry but it wasn't worth to go thru the long wait a second time.
