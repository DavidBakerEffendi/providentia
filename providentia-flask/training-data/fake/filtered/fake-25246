The Cakes are way better than Baby Cakes! My friends got me a cake from Champs for my bridal shower and it was sooooo good that I ordered it for my Wedding! The guest loved the cake. Both vegans and meat eaters could not believe it was Vegan... All they knew is that it was delicious! Thanks Champs!
