Atmosphere:  nice industrial feel but not very comfortable.  Hard wood benches that your feet dangle off of.  Cute ideas for ordering and service requests.  Little stainless trays to eat off of. Service:  Best I can describe...awkward. Servers a bit too cheerful in a robotic way. Just too put on and lingered at table too much. Server tried to convince us the theee salsa jars on tables were fresh for each table. They were so crusty and had an old film on them, yukk!  Manager came to introduce himself to us which was nice but he almost pushed us to agree everything was 'awesome' when it was far from it! Food & Beverage:  So disappointing.  All the cute little details in presentation were wasted.  Beef tacos with peanut were DELICIOUS!  Pork belly was tasty.  Chicken tacos were just good, nothing fabulous.  Thai shrimp weren't even cooked all the way through.  The duck wa so dry and no less than two days old. Awful!  Ceviche had nice flavor but NOT traditionally prepared by cooking/marinating in the citrus acid. Shrimp was boiled....rubbery and tough.  Guacamole was a tiny portion but tasty, lots of lime and cilantro. Margaritas were just ok. Loads of big ice cubes in a small rocks glass. The 'after effects' of the food for both of us was NOT good.  Both had upset stomachs within an hour of eating. No bueno! We were given free taco coins and gave them to a table next to us. Won't be going back.  :-(
