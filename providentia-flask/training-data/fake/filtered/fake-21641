Had the lunch buffet. I'm by no means an indian food expert so you can take my review as more of a general restaurant review. Dishes offered were decent but nothing that really wow'd me. If i were to give a nod: tandoori chicken and zucchini marsala were above average. Paid a little extra today (fri-sun) is more. I guess I was expecting very fresh food but alot of the offerings looked like they had been sitting around a few days. Service was ok had to ask for napkins and water. Took 15 minutes to get a basket of Naan to the table. Overall, it was good but, in my limited experience I've had better. Â I may return if I have an uber hankering for indian but I will prob not be going out of my way.
