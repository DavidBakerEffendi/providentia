The guys that serve it usually the last guy is a complete a$$, they think they have the best food or are entitled to something, I go to any cart that hes not at, they are all the same! people that stand at the other cart,, smh just shows how america is so quick fall for a trap. people open your eyes, you cant tell!? they are the same company? the owners switched up due to fall out so they all hate each other but they were all brothers. the food is great tho. not the best but its whateves
