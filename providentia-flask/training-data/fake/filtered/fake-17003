I don't even want to give them one star. The son of the owners was rude and said that he does not care about Vets. My friend and I  did 1 tour in Iraq and one in Afghanistan and now I will never go back to that place because of the way my buddy and I were treated. Manhattan Pizza and Mr Mikes treats the military with respect.  So much better.
