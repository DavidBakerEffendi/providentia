lovely decor nice staff and very helpful in any questions I had the day I went to take out the price is right and the chicken and steak tacos were delicious.  I asked about the chicken mole but they can not make it with out their mother who is away for 3 months she is the one with the family recipe I can not wait!!  I will be going again to this great addition to Maspeth,NY  I live only a few blocks away which turns into Middle Village and it a hop skip and a jump lol
