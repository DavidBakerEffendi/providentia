I rarely leave reviews, but i had to jump on here as soon as i was done. They had some amazing empanadas. Actually, the best epanadas de pabellon that I have had outside of Venezuela. Extremely friendly staff and owner. Pretty excellent cachapas (cornmeal pancakes-ish), although not exceptional. But the empanadas were enough to win my heart. Not cheap, but not overly pricey. $22 and I am stuffed. I am counting down the minutes till I can come back.
