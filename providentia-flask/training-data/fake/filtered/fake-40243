There are so many things in the world that are a necessity, one of which is Di Fara Pizza. Dom is truly a man with magic hands I have never in my life seen someone take care of a pie pizza so well like Dom does, he treats every piece of pie like it's his own child. When u walk in to Di Fara it's an experience in itself, you must order a pie when u get there because slices are a rare thing, when u order a pie just watch how careful Dom is with your pie all the ingredients are either home grown or imported from his home country of Italy, after the wait of 20 minutes or so you watch the best part when Dom takes the pie out of the oven with his own bare hands and sprinkles fresh parmigiana cheese and then to top it all off he takes fresh basil in which he grows on the window of his small shop. Is there anything I have to say ? Strongly recommend to anyone especially pizza lovers.
