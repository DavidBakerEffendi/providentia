Came on a Groupon Deal.  Easy to park on Sunday evening.  Area is nice.  Restaurant was dark but cozy.   Waiter was nice but insisted certain beers were not included on Groupon Deal even though it was clearly printed on the menu.  Looked forward for the Steak and it was not available.  Best dessert item was also not available.  Settled for the Cannoli and it was nothing but whipped cream and chocolate chips.     Felt like a bait and switch.  We tipped on the "total value" of the meal which we probably shouldn't have...  Dinner was fair for the price we paid but not the value they claim it was.  You are taxed and tip on the value they claim it's worth...so not really a good deal.   Will not be back.
