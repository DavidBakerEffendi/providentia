II have dinned at this place for almost  a year and loved the food. But there is something here I do not like  After having dinner here on several occassion, I feel happy and  would tip the waiters.. I ve seen the waiters, almost all of them would  give the tips to the front cashier. On one weekend, I after having a dinner with my business friends,, I ask an elderly looking  waiter about the tips, and to my shocking I was informed that they are not given the tips. I then ask  another waiter,who I believed is from South India ( from the slang he spoke) and got the  same answer. Out of curiousity I asked him if he was paid above the average NJ pay scale, he told me sadly It was far below it. I feel this Indian employers are exploiting  this workers and taking advantage where they can. This is just not right.  Since then I have stopped patronising this restaurant for about  4 months. now. Yes, the food is good but seeing the waiters been made used by the employer, made me feel sad .
