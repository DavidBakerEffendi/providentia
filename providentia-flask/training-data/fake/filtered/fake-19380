I tried this new place based on a friend's recommendation. I went in and ordered a few pies for The Giant game against SF and I must say I was impressed. I was born in NYC and had the opportunity to try all kinds of pizzas. Â This place is like having a NYC pie in Staten Island. In addition, all of my friends raved about the pizza and needless to say nothing but the delivery boxes were left. I plan to take a few pies to the Super Bowl party in NYC.
