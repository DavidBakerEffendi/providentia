I loooove Locanda Verde. But I went recently for breakfast by myself and have just two small complaints: 1) it was not super busy, and the hostess and host were standing around the hosting station giggling, laughing loudly, chatting, and socializing the entire time I was there, making more noise than any of the tables. It wasn't packed, and they were very, very nice and probably just passing time, but it was distracting. Secondly the music was surprisingly more like a Denny's in the suburbs than one of the best, most sophisticated restaurants in New York. While I was there I heard the original versions of the theme songs from Sanford and Sons and Golden Girls; and that song from the Equal commercial from long ago. Not kidding-- it was as if someone had pressed the wrong button. I will come back here again and again and again for any meal and I will wait and wait and wait if I have to because the food is so stupendous and the atmosphere is great. I'm just hoping they'll fix these little things.
