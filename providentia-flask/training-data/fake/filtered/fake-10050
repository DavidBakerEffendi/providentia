I was happy to stumble upon this restaurant. Walking by with so many choices around what stopped me from continuing my search was the ambiance and the outdoor seating. We waited fifteen minutes for a table at the bar where we enjoyed the first part of a bottle of wine. We sat on the outdoor terrace. A blonde waitress arrived at the table and asked "Are you ready to order?". No "Hello" or "Good evening" no salutation, just "Are you ready to order". I said "Hello, and how are you this evening and what's your name?". She then woke up. Unfortunately the service was a zero. The bus boys were quietly efficient but were too quick to take away plates without asking if we were done or not. The food was great! The Brussel Sprouts we had as a starter and were crispy and delicious. We shared the Seabass, perfectly cooked and moist, and the Italian salad was also perfectly dressed with fresh ingredients. We skipped dessert. Ambiance 5 Stars Food 5 Stars Service Zero
