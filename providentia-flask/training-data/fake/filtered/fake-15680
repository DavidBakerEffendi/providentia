My wife and I went here before seeing a show last Friday. Random Yelp choice based on location and cuisine. We really liked it. We had veggie samosa's for appetizer and then split chinese chicken chow mein and lamb curry. All were delicious. They also have a traditional mango drink which is very tasty.
