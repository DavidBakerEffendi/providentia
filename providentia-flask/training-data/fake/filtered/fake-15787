I ate here on my last trip, but was Â a little disapointed this time. My sandwhich portion was definetely a appropriate size, but the sandwich was a bit greasy. My companions said that their food was average, but nothing to brag about. The waiter was pleasant enough, and filled our glasses quickly, but did not say much to us. Also when the hostess called out our first name we held up our hands and stood up, but she " did not see us " and give our table away. Which they could have apologize for. I mean how do you not see 4 people go from sitting to standing , with two raising their hands and another yelling out here we are..............................oh well...........we eventually got a seat.
