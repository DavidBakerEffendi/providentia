A disappointment, considering that there are other options nearby.  The hostess couldn't seat us in a booth (we were two) because they were being saved for larger parties (it was a slow Saturday), and we were seated alone by the window.  There is a nice view of of Park Avenue.  The waitress was slow "because she was working a party elsewhere in the restaurant".   The hamburger was passable at $12 (fries are extra) and comes with the tiniest pickle I ever saw.  The turkey sandwich comes with chips and is reasonably priced. A glass of Chardonnay is $9 or $10 (they steer you toward the $10) and a small pour.  There were still booths open when we left.
