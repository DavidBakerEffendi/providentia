By far my favorite Astoria hangout. Â Love the sweet tea, but usually have too many, especially during the summer. I usually shy away from sitting at the bar alone, but here I never feel intimidated. The bartenders are amiable and the service is good, even if you sit at one of the tables. Dimly lit, great music, chill atmosphere all make for a great date spot, or just wasting time with friends. The portabello burger is fantastic, as is the mac and cheese. I've never been dissatisfied with anything I've ordered.
