I ordered take out by phone last Monday evening for a large group.  The bill came to $140.00, no actually they charged me $140.02.  Must not forget the 2 cents!!!!!  When my daughter and went to pick up the food the entire order was not yet completed, so I paid and then we sat down to wait.  I remembered that I wanted some leban (yogurt) to eat, as a condiment with the 10 Kibbee balls we ordered.  I asked the waitress to please include that.  When she returned from the kitchen, she informed me it would be an additional $1.00!!!!!!! The yogurt was in a teeny tiny container and could not have been more than 2 tablespoons.  It was condiment size.  I compare it to the Hot Grill charging for the ketchup fr your french fries.   RIDICULOUS!!!!  I was STUNNED AND INSULTED and told her I thought that was bad business.  I paid the $1.00, making my total purchase $143.02!!!!!! Although all the food was delicious, it left a BITTER TASTE with me.  So for that $1.00 the owner has lost my business and the business of all the people I can tell about this.  I am sure I can find another restaurant that can provide both good food and a respect and value for customers.  The King has been dethroned!!!!!!!! in my opinion......
