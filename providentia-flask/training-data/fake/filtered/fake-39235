I had dinner last evening at Gennaro's and was very impressed.   Had the eggplant rollatini and stuffed mushrooms for appetizers and they were absolutely delicious.   Great pizza and main courses for everyone at our table were just perfect. Was very impressed with all of the food.  Large poritons and very inexpensive. The wait staff was excellent and very friendly.
