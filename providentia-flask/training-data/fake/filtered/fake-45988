I remember thinking to myself the first time I went here, "I can't believe that we get such great food for such a good price!"  Everything that I have order from Tops has been delicious.  At this point, I'm convinced that I can try anything from their menu and like it.  I have no idea how they make their poultry dishes bc it always is so juicy and tender.  Their drinks are also very good and their dessert OMG loovveee.
