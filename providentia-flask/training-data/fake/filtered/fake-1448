This space is gorgeous and really unique for the city.  Reading the other reviews, you understand that you come for the atmosphere not the food.  Everything at a more reasonable price (breakfasts and cold plates) tastes fair, and the sad truth is you have to spend a lot to have anything decent.  We finally discovered this after spending over $120 on dinner for 2. Hungarian Goulash is delish, but we'll keep returning for the coffee and torte.
