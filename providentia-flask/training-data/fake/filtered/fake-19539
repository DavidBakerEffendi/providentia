Met my friend here to watch some football.  Good specials during the game and a bunch of beers on tap.  Bartenders let us sample a few of the craft beers we didn't know and they were helpful steeering us in the right direction.  Burger was good and I love places with tots, especially dipping it in their house sauce.
