Great place, but is pretty crowded. The pastry shop just inside the door, where they sell the small cakes and such, they have bad customer service. None of their cakes or muffins are labeled as to what they are. One lady asked if I needed something, I was just in awe at the cakes and said I was just looking, to which she rolled her eyes and walked off. There are nicer pastry shops around. All because it was my first time at the Terminal and was trying to take it all in. Nonetheless, it's a unique experience and plan to go back many more times!
