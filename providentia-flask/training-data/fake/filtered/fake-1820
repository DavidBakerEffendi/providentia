Was attending an event at the Javits Center and couldn't believe how poor the food choices are on-site.  I decided to explore what was within walking distance.  So glad I found Pio Pio 8 (thanks to Yelp)!  What more can I say that hasn't already been said... great ambiance and decor, great food, and great sangria!  Would definitely recommend the tuna ceviche.
