I've been ordering from Chicken Galore for many years. It's always a treat. Some say it's expensive but that's debatable. I wouldn't be cooking wings like this in my kitchen myself and they are excellent. Sometimes I pick up, sometimes I'm lazy and they deliver. Either way it's good eats. I love the fried mushrooms and veggies too.
