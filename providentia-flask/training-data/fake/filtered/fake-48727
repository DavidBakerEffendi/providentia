I'd give Eulogy 3.5 stars for my experience, but that Scotch Ale I had left me feeling generous.  :)  Overall the experience was good - definitely a bar atmosphere, not much in the way of polished wood or fancy fixtures.  I ordered the "wild game sausage trio" or something to that effect, which in retrospect may have been a mistake - it wasn't too bad but I'd like to come back and try the mussels instead.  That seemed to be a popular choice among other diners and the selections had my mouth watering.  The beer was quite good, service was decent and the waiter seemed to know what he was talking about with the beer.  I'll be back for those mussels.
