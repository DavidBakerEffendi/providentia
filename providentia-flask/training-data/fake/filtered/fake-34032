This place it is horrible.  We actually just finished dinner there. We ordered the mussels and they were all bad and we returned them. Had the manitaria saganaki that was gross and in the end we had the seafood platter was disgusting.  The cuttlefish wasnt clean properly and my husband found a fish head inside the cuttlefish. The octopus had cinnamon on top... what the heck is that . The manager didn't bother coming by to check with us. I am greek and I know greek food and this place serves garbage. This isnt greek food. Horrible experience.
