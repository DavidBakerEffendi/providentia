Been here likely more than a dozen times this year for either lunch or dinner/drinks with friends from work, enjoy the relaxing pub style interior. Our group's favorites have included Jamaican Jerk wings, Gaelic Brie, Lobster Mac n Cheese and Shepards Pie. My favorite item for lunch is the warm Spinach/Salmon Salad, Yum! Though not a beer drinker at all, they have helped me find 2 beers I actually like,  that's a first!  They reeeeeealy know their beer and are something like a couple hundred to choose, from for those who are into beer. Friendly staff and customers, relaxing atmosphere, lively and happening late dinner on, very good live music the times I have been. Love it!
