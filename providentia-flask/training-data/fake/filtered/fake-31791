Service is spotty and nothing stands out - with ONE exception: Dynamite Sticks.  These amazing appetizers consist of shrimp, sausage, jalapenos and cheese wrapped in a flour tortilla & deep fried and are well worth a stop at Winberie's.  Skip the unremarkable salads and go for a burger and you'll be ok.
