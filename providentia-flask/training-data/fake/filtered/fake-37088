The Belmont is what I affectionately refer to as a hole in the wall!  That being said I went there and was a little suspicious.  Turned out to be one of the best nights out I had in a long time.  It was a unique experience with an interesting cast of characters from staff to fellow customers.  The regulars at the adjoining tables greeted up warmly an assured us we were in for a real culinary treat!  They were so right!  The food was just excellent some of the dishes really blew me away as I had them many times before but never cooked and prepared like this!  I lost a few pounds so I am ready to head back there tonight!
