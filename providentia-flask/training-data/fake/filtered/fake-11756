Friday we wandered around, looking for a show opening where we might find some free beer and shmooze with strangers. The show we stumbled into was pretty good, some paintings had boot-prints on them, but they weren't kitschy- the colors were well articulated and there was breathing room. They were humorous and confident. The girls found a bottle of champagne and drank it. I overheard someone saying he was a graduate of my school. We began a conversation- and pretty quickly I realized he was lying about having attended school. None of the details of his story were correct, but we played along. I wondered why he would be living this lie? What benefits was this lie affording him? I had a separate internal conversation, imagining this man lying at job interviews, or maybe as a secret agent. It reminded me to look up how people are tapped for work as spies. Isn't it funny - there are people who are really spies in the world. I pulled out my phone to make a note to myself. He saw this and said "Oh, I don't want to exchange numbers." I wonder if he didn't want to see me again because I was a reminder of his lie. He was dressed in the costume of a successful art-inclined 28 year old. I decided not to bring up the fact that he was exposed. Maybe I could turn him into a double-agent... but to what effect? Maybe I've been watching too much Homeland. Anyway- The dumplings are the best I've had in the city. I'm not sure what is in them, because by the time I arrived there was only one woman working and I don't think she spoke english. But luckily I just pointed at the pictures and everything worked out. The hand-pulled noodles were also amazing. The servings are enormous. Even if the food were terrible I would pay for it on a dollar-to-calorie ratio basis alone. But generally you don't have to think in such survivalist terms.
