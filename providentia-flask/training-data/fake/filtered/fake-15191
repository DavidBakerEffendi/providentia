This place is a little gem in Astoria. I've been there a few times now for both brunch and dinner. Every time, the food was fantastic and the last time I went I thought the service got even better. I dropped a fork and before I could get it from the floor and put it back on the table, the waiter had replaced it with a new one! LOL... I just had the feeling that they were very attentive. Great place... I'm definitely going to go back. Don't take my word for it though, try it out for yourself.
