I went to this place for dinner with the family.  I was very excited since my family is from Kiev/Cherkasy to try some Ukrainian food which I have grew  up on. We got a table near the back in a corner.  The setting was lovely, the atmosphere was pleasant and the staff was exceptionally sweet and friendly.   Maria (our server) was very sweet and helpful.  Very determined to make our dining experience well balanced.  She gave us suggestions as to what was off the charts and her suggestions did her well.   Overall we had a very wonderful dining experience and got to talk and meet some new and friendly people. The General Manager (Vlad) was very sweet, he came over to us and asked us how our meal was and we talked for quite a while.  He was very pleasant and helpful. Coming from the Hospitality background this is one place that I would be dining in again and recommending it to others .
