Hands down #1 pizza(tied with L&B's) in the world.  I say "world" because New York has the best pizza in the world and I've tried pizza everywhere! Come here when you have time and have a plan B just in case they're closed or making new bread.  The man himself is going to take his time and cook with a lot of heart and care.   Don't order slices- better off getting a pie because it's way cheaper in the end and fresh out the oven. Someone was complaining about Board of Health issues, etc...  This is an old school hole in the wall joint!  Think of it as going to your gramps crib for some good authentic cooking...
