I think most of these reviews are fake - created by the owner - watch out for this place I would give this place a definite minus. you must know that I have only walked out of a restaurant without ordering or after ordering appetizer only twice in my life (this being the second time). 1) Only one table in the entire restaurant is occupied and they take 15 minutes to seat us 2) Ordered Mirchi Bajji - dish was cold. I sent back since this is a dish thats supposed to be freshly made. Comes back in 2 minutes after heating in microwave (looks old and dried) 3) Ordered Gobi Manchurian: extremely oily - no salt 4) We walked out after eating a bit and paying for the appetizers - all our stomachs started hurting after 15 min
