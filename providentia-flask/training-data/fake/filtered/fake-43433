I've had Naked Pizza once before (from a friend who bought some), so I went into the store to order myself for the first time today. I ordered my pizza, and waited... and waited... and waited. About half an hour later, I asked the lady at the desk how much longer I'd have to wait. Alas, it turned out that it had been finished a while earlier already. Apparently, they had either neglected to inform me, or called my name quietly enough so that I couldn't hear in the noisy din of the shop. Thanks to the wait, the resulting pizza was rather lukewarm at best. The crust was also flimsy enough that the slight tilt of gravity (while carrying it back) had caused the slices to fall together in a gooey clump on the side of the box. On the bright side, the amorphous pizza blob did taste pretty good though. Though it was eaten best with a spoon. Food - 4 Service - 1 That averages to 2.5, which I'll round up to 3.
