Hubby and I took my bff here for her first experience with Indian food! She's slightly sheltered when it comes to worldly cuisines but was ready to try something new... Karma did not disappoint! Hubby asked for his "Lamb Vindaloo" spicy and the kitchen delivered. BFF had Chicken Tikka Masala which was fragrant and creamy- the chicken was perfectly done and not stewed to within an inch of its life. I had the Saag Paneer which was also fantastic. The service was also great! They seemed to work as a well oiled team with various servers and other staff attending to our needs- which were few and far between- nothing better than a water glass that is ALWAYS full! Overall, a relaxed, enjoyable dining experience with excellent service and yummy food- looking forward to leftovers!
