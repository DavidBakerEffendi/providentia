I had a chance to visit this place to celebrate my friend's birthday. We reserved a table for 6pm. We only had drinks and apps while we waited for two more people to join us. By 7pm the General Manger comes and rudely rushes us to put in our dinner order, tapping his watch, because he had a group coming in @ 8pm. We obliged but I think that was awfully rude and obnoxious. The food was good but we've all had better. Best calamari I've had in sometime but some of the other dishes were bland, cooked right but no seasonings, i.e. pork chops, eggplant mortarando, and the rigatoni pasta was way under-cooked. Maybe the cooks were rushed too? I am glad to have tried but wouldn't go back anytime soon. If you do go your best bets would be the calamari, Filet Cognac, the Goodfellas sig. cupcake. Hit or Miss dishes at this joint! I also agree with David B. 's review of this place. It's too expensive of a menu to serve only some good dishes and some blah ones.
