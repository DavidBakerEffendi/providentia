I basically grew up in this cafe, from the early days of Le Gamin, to the transformation into Le Grainne.  The food is something I long for every time I go back to NYC.  The huge bowls of coffee... the music, the crowd...surly or not... makes this a kind of homecoming experience for me.  When you walk in the door as a "regular", you are greeted by other "regulars", or if you would like, your extended family.  Every time I bring a friend they fall in love with the cafe.  It becomes their new spot to bring their friends, co-workers, family, etc.  The food is always fresh, focusing on organic, high quality ingredients, and local ingredients when possible.  I am never disappointed with the food, the music, the staff... It becomes a place of laughter, social interactions, and inspiration.  And although you may be seated between an actor, musician, model, or a group of friends catching up on a Saturday afternoon, you can always pick up a paper or one of the many magazines available, and read in your own little world, in front of your gigantic cafe o lait, and lose yourself in the cozy, friendly, french cafe in the heart of Chelsea... Le Grainne Cafe.
