This is one of those example when Yelp killed the restaurant. It used to be delicious, it used to be cheap, it used to be a jewelry store first and bakery second. Things have changed, people have found out, Â prices have gone up, quality has gone down, jewelry store shrunk in size. A real shame. They used to compete with another place on Mott street, now it's no longer a competition. It's not too late for Banh Mi Saigon to turn things around!
