First off - Really nice people!! 2nd - Really good food at a really good price! There are a lot of Italian and pizza restaurants in Bloomfield and this is exactly the type of restaurant I enjoy having in the neighborhood.  It's not super fancy, but it is very good! The pizza is crisp and tasty and the chicken parm dinner is big, well made and the sauce is never watery.  This is definitely our favorite place to order from as well as eat in!
