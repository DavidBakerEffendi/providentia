Stick with the basics: a charcoaled chicken sandwich, a burger, pizza, or the giant antipasto to share, and you'll be happy. My experience has been hit-or-miss with soups and "fancier" menu items. Plenty of draft beer options, lots of TV's, and generally friendly service make this a busy neighborhood gathering spot. We also head to Wildflowers for something to eat after most other area restaurants are closed for the night. Another plus? It's not a chain establishment.
