My family stumbled upon this tiny cozy gem of a restaurant( that as another reviewer mentioned could be in the Village). From start to finish we were made to feel like welcomed honored guests . We started with 2 appetizers and the baby greens salad with mango. The sausage appetizer served with fried yucca & lemon was somewhat similar to chirizo, but not as assertive in a really good way ( we would have been happy to just have this over and over again) this yucca was dry but with the lemon juice and dipping sauce that came with it ...wow. We also had the 3 pastry items and were expecting something empanada like, but not so; again everything had a separate and interesting delicious flavor. At this point we thought maybe we should stop here because the appetizers and the wonderful bread ( from Balthazar Bakery in NY we were told) were too good to top, NOT SO. The main courses sliced steak, chicken stroganoff (can"t say enough good things about this dish or the place will be mobbed) and the chicken with okra were all first rate and the collard greens that came with it were light and really tasty. After sampling each others' dishes the conclusion was the 2 chicken dishes were extraordinary and the steak good, but steak. After a small break it was dessert time, no chocolate desserts, but what they served made the biggest chocaholic forget there was such a thing. We tried the flan, the passion fruit mousse, and the coconut custard all I can say here is oh boy! All three excellent, non cloying as sometimes happens plus the passion fruit mouse even had a bit of tartness. Can't wait to return and try some of the other menu items, what a pleasure, a relaxing non rushed atmosphere with truly first rate food.
