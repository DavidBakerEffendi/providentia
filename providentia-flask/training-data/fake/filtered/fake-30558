Excellent noodle soups. Much better in the restaurant than as take-home. My teen-aged boys love the M Saigon special (mostly protein). I've had better deep-fried rolls elsewhere. Wear long johns because the door lets in the cold. They have recently done some remodeling and it's much nicer. Service is very quick. Prices are reasonable--but it's the food that brings us back.
