I was not a huge seafood fan but had an urge for fish and chips.  I heard they change their oil daily so would give them a shot.  I decided on their platter which was $22.  Their was so much food on it that there was plenty for 4 of us.  The fried cod was awesome and flakey and I even tried the clams which, I have to admit were tasty.  The shrimp and scallops went over well with the family and the fries were very good.  All in all a great value and would go back again
