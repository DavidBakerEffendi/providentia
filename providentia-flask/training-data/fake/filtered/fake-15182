I never expected to find a true Australian place is Queens, NY but this place was a great surprise! The waiter was so personable with me while I waited for my party to arrive and helped me order something that I would truly enjoy. Their kangaroo burger with feta cheese was delicious!! I would recommend this to everyone for anytime of the day but their Sunday brunch specials are unbeatable in price and flavor! I will definitely have to revisit this place in the future:)
