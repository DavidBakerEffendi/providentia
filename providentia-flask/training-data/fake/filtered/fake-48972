Thanks for the heads up on Facebook. I almost forgot to write this review: I've been dining at Muscle Maker Grill now for close to two years. I first dined at the one in Springfield NJ. Since my work and I moved to Parsippany I started going to the Parsippany Muscle Maker. I would eat there at least once a week with friends for lunch and sometimes after the gym. Then to my surprise I was told the owner sold. He was short bald guy who was always friendly. I believe his name was John. Also we did realize they got rid of the attractive girls who were working the front counter. I know if you are a woman customer it doesn't matter, but to men its nice to see. The energetic atmosphere is gone and you can see it on the all the staff faces. This Muscle Maker Grill use to be a fun and great place to eat.  I don't know if you can use the word lame to describe a restaurant but that's the only word I can think of. It's a ghost town. The new owner Sean seems to be lost. The manager Dave doesn't even know how to make a shake. Funny?? To bad it's not a joke. All thier shelves seem to be bare. It looks like they're going out of business. The only thing still good about the place is the VERY big guy. I don't know his name, but you will know who I'm talking about. He at least knows what he is doing. The food is blah. The menu changed and they got rid of a lot tasty items. NOT SMART!!  Now all they have is a lot of dry and over cooked chicken with tons of sauce on it. I thought chicken off a grill was supposed to be juicy??? Card board anyone?? Also since LA Fitness put in a juice bar in I've been getting all my supplements over there. They sell the same exact protein drinks and bars cheaper. They also have one of those X attractive Muscle Maker girls working over there. I won't be going back to this Muscle Maker, but I will find other ones in the area. They use to be a 5 star restaurant now I can't believe they're still open. Cheers!
