Attended a private party rehersal dinner at Olea for about 50 people.  The appetisers were delicious to start us off. That was just where our adventure began.  Every selection, every course, was presented and prepared to perfection; for all members of the party, and in a timely fashion.  I can not say enough about the multitude of flavors with just the right seasonings. The wait staff is second to none.  They really make you feel like you're part of the family.  I would certainly go out of my way to eat in such a cozy and friendly atmosphere as Olea offers again!  I highly recommend it!
