My boyfriend and I walked in here on a Friday night at about 7:30. We had been wandering the east village looking for somewhere with a short wait and good food, not an easy find. At Yerba Buena we were seated right away. The restaurant is small and cozy, a perfect first date place, not too fancy, not too casual with the right sort of ambiance (dim lights, candles, intimate seats). The drink menu is eclectic with lots of interesting combinations. We opted for mojitos which were delicious. The food was amazing and the service impeccable. We ordered a bunch of appetizers and the waiter forgot our ceviche and felt so bad we each received two complimentary glasses of champagne. I highly recommend this place and will be back soon.
