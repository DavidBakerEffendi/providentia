Been going here for a few years now.  Every time it's as good as the first.  This is authentic Greek cuisine, served by authentic Greeks from Astoria, Queens.  That's about as Greek as it gets!  Always get the lamb gyro with "the works" (lettuce, tomato, grilled onions, white and hot sauce), and it's always AMAZING!  Unlike some other food carts, the lamb is actually crispy and tastes like real meat.  Also, the guys are really fast and friendly and will remember you, as they have many regulars.  Great experience, great service, great food, A+++!!
