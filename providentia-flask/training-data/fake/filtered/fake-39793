After moving to the west coast and missing Philadelphia, Fairmount and the London Grill I was so happy to return for a visit and find it better than I when I left.  We spent the afternoon wandering through the world class Philadelphia Art Museum and headed to London for some much needed food.  The staff was super friendly and the bartender was incredible.  We nibbled lobster and duck spring rolls and were so pleased with our afternoon snacking that we are planning on returning later this week for a full dinner. Bravo London Grill for remaining a true Philadelphia dining destination!!!
