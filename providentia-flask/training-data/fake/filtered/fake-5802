I've visited twice.  I must say the service/staff is super friendly and the place is cute and cozy but the food is meh..had the black forest cake and it was awful dry and tasteless like it was old or something.  on my other visit I tried the brunch.  Although visually appetizing (lots of cheese choices, ham, eggs and some asutralian sasuage) the food left me wanting it felt like a continental breakfast nothing special about it  The Coffee was great but the food is not out worth the price.   But again the staff is very cery friendly.  would visit again but just for coffee.
