I've been going to this place for a long time.  Despite the sometimes heinous crowds on the weekend, it's a great place to grab cocktails and their menu is decent.  However, I went recently and the food was mediocre and the service was terrible.  Don't get me wrong, everyone was really nice, but it was a 2 hour endeavor to get a plate of cold cuts and cheese.  There are some dishes they serve which require time, but they also have simple platters, which are generally pretty good.  This time, we waited sooooo long for the food and it was just ok, not the usual satisfying experience.  If you go here, you know it's about the cocktails, not the wine; against better judgment, we had the wine and  it added to the mediocrity of the experience.  There weren't a lot of people there so I don't know what the hold up was; but would have preferred to go elsewhere.
