Be aware. This is the worst diner in the area. Went with my son for lunch but got a rude and dumb waitress. We got concerned with her attitude while taking the order and simply walked away as nothing good can be expected from a stupid waitress handing your food. Went to another diner down the road where the owner, staff, diner and food was better. My advice to the waitress: - You are just a waitress serving food to people while working at a garbage diner on a Saturday. What are you so proud of act as if you are someone special. Be courteous and may be you can get a tip next time from a customer who actually decide to place an order with you. My advice to the diner: - Wake up and improve your service and customer satisfaction. Don't let your business go down due to some stupid and rude staff. Thank you and good luck. You will need it.
