Fantastic, busy vibe with uncompromising food and service. Had the tasting menu and was so pleased....the portions were fair, all the dishes incredible (especially the pasta!) and we left feeling full, but not overstuffed. Great selection of reasonably priced Italian wines, and the sommelier was full of good suggestions. Highly recommended!
