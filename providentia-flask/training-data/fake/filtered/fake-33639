When to this jose tejas for dinner. My wife and I placed our order for an  appertizer and entree. As we started eating I placed an ordered for the another entree that my wife had order. Told the waiter that I wanted the entree but I might take it home if I wasn't hungry after finishing my first entree. This is the part you won't believe. I was not AllOWED to order the second entree if I was to take home the entree. This I thought was a joke since it was April 1st. It was...... wait for it. NOT A JOKE! The manager stated that they do not allow you to order something from the menu and bring it home. Been in the service industry for 35 years in jersey and never heard of something as stupid. Next time you are in Ask them about taking something home.  And wait for the answer........wait....wait ....wait......NO!!!!!!!!! Online sites claim that management sucks and with policies like you can order an entree because you might take a portion home is crazy. Other restaurants will be happy to earn my money.  Thanks for listening..
