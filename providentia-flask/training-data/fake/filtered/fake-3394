Bring earphones. Don't play the jukebox. It'll rip you off and you have no recourse. The food is very good. What?! Oh, sorry, that was the music screaming "te quiero." Order the garnachas and ceviche as starters. We liked the casado as entree. The chiles rellenos were not inspiring. Then again, my brain was being bombarded with los temereros too much to be of any use. The waitress had an annoying habit of asking questions that ended in a little high-pitched chihuaha-like yelp. Â I experienced a lot of this in Guate. My cousins there do it. Come at least once and insist that they lower the music if you need. I had to send her back four times.
