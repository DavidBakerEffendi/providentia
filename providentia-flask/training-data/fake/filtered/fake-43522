This review is not at all based on food.  We went in at 6:15 on a Friday night without a reservation.  The hostess clearly did not like the fact that we had a two year old (and five year old) with us. While "checking" for availability she glanced at the two year old more than once. She told us they had "absolutely no availability until after 8:45."  While putting our coats back on, another party without a reservation came in and she found a table for them.  After I asked, she stated that she could sit them at a larger table because they had more people.  First of all, don't tell a potential customer you have "absolutely no tables" and then seat someone without a reservation while they are still standing there.  It's possible that they want to save larger tables for larger parties (they had 5 while we had 4 people).  While I think it is a better business strategy to not turn people standing there away rather than wait for larger parties to possibly come in, I may be able to understand it.  However, sensing that it had more to do with the presence of kids, we left the restaurant, waited a few minutes outside and called for a reservation without stating we had children.  Amazing!  They could seat us within 10 or 15 minutes! We spoke to the manager about the issue and while he apologized, claimed that the opening was due to a cancellation that just  came in, and handled the issue the best he could, we left with a bad impression.   We have eaten at the Manayunk location many, many times and will continue to go there.  We won't ever go back to this location. If you have kids you may want to keep them outside until you get past the horrible hostess who needs a lot more training on customer service.  Interesting that the review from 12/8 also indicates that they were turned away from an empty restaurant with a 5-month old.
