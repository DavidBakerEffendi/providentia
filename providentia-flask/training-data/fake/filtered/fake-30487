I am not sure why this place is so highly rated.  Outside the building is a sign stating,  #1 in NJ and #18 in USA.  REALLY?  Who did that survey?  I was traveling to the area for a day and Googled best pizza and this place came up.  I am sorry I drove out of my way to find this place. I have never felt so unwelcome in a place in my life.  I am a well groomed, clean cut guy who wears business casual clothes.  I am not sure why the hostesses kept emphasizing I could have the pie to go or sit outside and wait.  She kept advising me there were outside tables, when there were plenty of empty tables inside the dimly lit restaurant with all the interior lighting turned off at 2:00 PM in the afternoon.  After placing my order she told me I could wait outside or where ever; she would come and find me when my order was ready.  I indicated I would eat in.  I went outside to make a phone call and in a few minutes the hostess came outside with my order packed to go.  When I asked if it was OK to eat at the restaurant she grimaced, said sure then again advised me they had tables outside.  When I asked if I could have a plate she sighed with an expression of distain before handing it to me.  So, I sat outside while the yellow jackets landed on my food.  Clearly not my best dining experience. The Pizza was mediocre at best.  Maybe tomato pie isn't pizza so that is why it was so bland.  Crust: Thin with firm texture but, no flavor. Cheese: On the bottom of sauce and toppings, no problem, but completely flavorless, just melted and stringy.  Sauce: Simple marinara too runny for pizza, very little seasoning, must have just heated a can of tomatoes and put it on the "tomato pie".  Toppings: Onions and peppers were freshly cut.  The few mushrooms looked dehydrated and were flavorless. If this place were in North Jersey they would have been out of business long ago.
