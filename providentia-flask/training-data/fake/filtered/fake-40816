Best roast chicken in the city! Every other time I go to Barbuto, i get the chicken. And every single time, it tastes the same - juicy, succulent...amazing! Drinks are great too! You cant really go wrong with Barbuto..though there is one moustached waiter who could use a bit of work. But, the great experiences outweigh the so-so ones, so I will keep coming back. And...the outdoor seating is great for a nice summer evening.
