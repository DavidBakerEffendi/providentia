1.) The ramen portions of my entire table were only half full.  If you are familiar with ramen shops its customary for ramen to be served in a giant bowl filled to the top. I was a bit disappointed. 2.) The broth is generally slightly thin due to almost all ramen being exclusively chicken based. The one pork based is a little better, but this could be personal preference. The noodles were slightly undercooked but softened later in the soup [possible because it was a busy night but still a strike]. The meat is cooked ok, the vegetables are cooked fine possibly a tad too few. Generally the ramen had a decent taste to it. The spicy ramen was a bit better out of the bunch. Not many customizable options in case you are accustomed to modifying your broth or noodle type. The appetizers we had ordered were cooked well, & tasted good. 3.) The place was clean & generally pleasing.  There is no alcohol but It is BYOB, in case this matters to you. 3.) Payment issue.  I had a issue with billing that took a while to resolve. I originally had given a low score because of this but after having the issue properly addressed by the owner everything is now in order and will not effect by rating.
