Mad Greeks: You know who I am because I go in there and bring friends there all the time. Below, is purely due to the behavior of ONE employee, Initials: T.W., it is in no way negative of any of the owners or cooks. This employee is just atrocious, because I said something to him as he was taking care of another customer, nothing inappropriate or serious, decides to be extremely rude and unprofessional and says to me: "you are just a rude person Alex; shut the fuck up" - He also decided to say "I'll f**king kick your ass"- which again, is just retarded seeing as how this 180 pound shrimp with no physical fighting experience says it to someone (me) who was trained in fighting for over 10 years and was a D1 wrestler. - First of all, I am not one of the cooks that the same employee gets pissed at often and can be just spoken to in a rude manner - Second, I even went up and apologized, asking what I possibly did to piss him off, he shows his immaturity by saying "no fuck you you are just a rude person" - Third, the owner heard the entire exchange and even asked me why the aforementioned employee was being so rude, to which I responded "I have no idea" - Lastly, any reasonable and prudent employee would have accepted an apology- especially when it was obvious I didn't mean to say anything insulting or annoying by nature. Apparently T.W. has never heard of "customers first"... especially when I was acting in a reasonable manner. This has caused me and will make me tell all my friends to not go there- I certainly will never set foot in Mad Greeks until T.W. no longer works there. Everything here is substantiated and can be proven by the multitude of witnesses present during this period, including at least 4 police officers who raised their eyebrows when T.W. was engaged in the above mentioned rude conduct. Mad Greeks- just because a customer is in there all the time and becomes "friendly" with the employees doesn't give the employee the right to be overwhelmingly rude.
