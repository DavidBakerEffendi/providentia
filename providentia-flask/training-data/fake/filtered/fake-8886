Dosa express is actually good... I could not disagree with previous reviewers. They must have very fine tastes. It may also be that I am a north Indian that I cannot discern between a fine Dosa and an express Dosa. I just love the dosas they make.. especially the Onion Masala dosa. Iddlis are expensive.. last time I heard they were $4.00 for 2. However they have employed a couple of Mexican staff, one in particular who was inexplicably rude towards my family - it was 9:30pm and the shop was preparing to close and my family were almost finished but were waiting on our 3 year old daughter to finish drinking water. The mexican waiter passed by us and pointed t o his watch indicating for us to hurry and leave. Ironically he made this gesture only to us and not to several other customers who were in midst of finishing their meals. We felt singled out for this treatment by this particular waiter. He was placing chairs back on the table and ours seemed to be next.
