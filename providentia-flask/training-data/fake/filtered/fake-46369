Coming from an asian background, having a good appetite and coming here with several friends, I can honestly say this is the best ramen I found in NY for several years now. While I admit, the long lines are a turn off from the place, the trick is to come 10 minutes before they open to quickly get seated. Aside from the wait, I have been a long time customer of Ippudo and have brought several friends here. My friend, who lived in Japan and grew up in a Japanese home, says that he finds this to be the best traditional ramen he's found outside of Tokyo! Once seated, I could not be more pleased by the attentive service and recommendations the employees gave constantly throughout all of my visits. I honestly don't think you can order anything wrong from here. Their shishito peppers, ramen and famous pork buns are simply TO DIE FOR. I even had a quick craving for their tender pork buns and ran by before heading to the airport. The employees were so kind and quickly fulfilled my craving. This place is definitely worth a visit. While the line is a long wait, the service and food are simply fabulous. Do try to come around opening though, the wait is a lot shorter (if not immediate seating).
