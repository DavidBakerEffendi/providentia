Went for dinner last night with my husband and another couple.  We had 6pm reservations on a Sunday night and the place was packed.  The dining area is really welcoming, with high ceilings and nice decor.  We had guac and nachos to start, then carnitas tacos, chorizo tacos, and seafood enchilada.  All the food was delicious.  Our server, Megan, was really nice.   Also, the margaritas and the sangria were great.  The 3 chile margarita was really excellent.
