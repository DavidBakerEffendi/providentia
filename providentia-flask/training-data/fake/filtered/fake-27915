Litterally EVERYONE I know told me how amazing this place was and that I had to try it! I wish I hadnt waited so long! Everything about it was so good. The lobster tails put Route 6 to shame. The manager and owner themselves were serving tables and that makes the experience so much more personal. Nice people! Cant wait to go back!
