My husband and I visitied Philly for the weekend and wanted to try an authentic cheesesteak. Â We bought one at Geno's and one directly across the street at Pat's. They were the same price but the Pat's sandwich had more meat, more cheese, more onions, and a larger roll. My husband preferred Pat's however, he agreed with me that the meat at Geno's was better. My aversion to cheesesteaks has always been that the meat is overcooked and tastes like shoe leather. However, the meat at Geno's was tender and delicious and for that reason I preferred it over Pat's. If you are visiting the area I recommend that you do the same thing we did and just try one of each to compare.
