I really thought this place would be a winner. Nice concept,  reputable owners(bar ferdinand), and experienced chef. But the food sucked. I got a "barbecue sampler" type dish. None of the three samples were very good, and all tasted like they were marinated in sea water. Very salty, not very smokey.    I dont want to rip em too bad though because they had'nt been in business for that long at the time of my visit. And it's obvious by the appearance of the place that these guys worked hard to bring a nice establishment to N. Liberties. So I'm sure they will do their best to improve as they go.       I will definately give them a second chance and update this review.
