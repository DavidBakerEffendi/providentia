Went there for Valentines day and waited for a full hour after my reservation time. I was joined by a giant crowd of angry diners who took up every spare inch of space in that place. Finally, around 9:30 I threw in the towel. I was shocked at how unapologetic and nonchalant the staff was. Needless to say it was a very infuriating experience and I am just grateful there are so many good places nearby. I will not be going back anytime soon.
