I went to this place with some of my friends for a dinner and had chicken malabari,Lamb vindaloo and chicken biriyani every thing was so delicious,after a long time we really enjoyed our food in this indian place. prices were not too high when compared to the taste and quantity,service was friendly and casual,The only thing is it was too busy when we went there so a bit noisy. But definitely i ll go there again just for the taste!!
