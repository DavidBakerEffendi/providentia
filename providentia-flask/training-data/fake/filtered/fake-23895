After the remodel and the new menu, Bridgid's has become one of my favorite places to go for phenomenal food and an amazing draft selection!  The revolving specials menu is great, and really focuses on what is fresh and in season.  If you want 5 star restaurant food at an amazing price, delicious beer, and a warm, cozy atmosphere, you should definitely try Bridgid's!
