Like everyone else, the old gas station turned surfer joint seemed like a really cool idea. They also have a web site that allows you to order and pickup on your way into town. I haven't tried it, but it could be nice. The renovations are well done, the atmosphere was pleasant but like others, that's where the compliments end. The service was really slow, water was never refilled and napkins / cutlery was just dumped in a pile on the table... I almost asked if I would get a cut of the tip for setting the table. I got 2 eggs with sausage.... both were very much overcooked. Orange juice was from concentrate (not that it's bad... but I expected fresh from a breakfast place.) The worst part of the experience however, was that when I ordered, I was asked whether I wanted fruit or potatoes... I said fruit. When the bill arrived, I was charged extra for it. Instead of removing it from the bill, the waitress brought out the menu to show me that it clearly states that fruit is extra... WOW. If she had been a little more friendly, I would have given the spot a second chance, not now.
