The first thing you notice about Adobe Blues is the architecture and decor on the exterior. It looks like an old Adobe dwelling converted into a saloon. When you walk in, that impression remains when you see the dark wooden bar and a seating area, both with wall to wall mementos of the Old American West. The selection of beer is absolutely incredible! I've had at least 30 varieties there, and they seem to have a rotating selection of between 200 and 350 different beers (my favorite is Fuller's London Porter). The free salsa tastes delicious and fresh, and they keep the chips coming. All of the burrito and taco entrees that I tried came in ample portions and tasted great. The chorizo was also very good. The mini-taco appetizers, however, seem microwaved from a box. They have live music there most nights. The Wolfpack is always there on Wednesdays playing fantastic blues! Definitely go to Adobe Blues and see if it's your style.
