I went there for lunch during the week. It was busy and had a good vibe but the food we not good at all. I ordered salad with veggie burger. The presentation was messy. Too much vinegar. Deconstructed veggie burger neither looked nor tasted good. The appetizer - chicken meatballs were not for my taste.
