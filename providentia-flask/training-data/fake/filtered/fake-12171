Pros: NONE Cons: Horrible food and service. I don't understand all these postive reviews! My girlfriend and I made reservation at 8pm and we started eating at 930! Service was very slow but that wasn't the worst part. This was by far the worst sushi I have ever had and I couldn't believe how busy it was. I ordered many rolls and none of the flavors came together. It was very dry and the fish was chewy. If you gave this place more than 1 star then you must have never tasted decent sushi in your life!!! Do yourself a favor and stay away from this place!
