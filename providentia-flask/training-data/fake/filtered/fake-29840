Whenever anyone asks me here to go in the Ironbound Section of Newark, Seabra Marisqueira is ALWAYS the respons I give them. I have been going there for over 10 years now and I have never had a bad meal. The waiters (Jerry, Mario, Carlos)... are all personable and knowledgeable about the specials of the day. If they recommend something, chances are the will also be eating the same thing at the bar on their lunch break. Octopus salad.....no one makes it better. Casserole dishes in copper pots are always a winner and you will not finish it all. Just try it....not fancy but the best food in the Ironbound!!
