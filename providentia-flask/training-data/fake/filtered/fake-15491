Excellent food and vegan friendly options.  They do not advertise vegan because an employee told me "people think it's weird and won't buy the food if we say it's vegan."  They should be proud of being one of the few places to offer truly vegan food.  I'd like to see them expand their vegan offerings because the quality of texture, taste, and presentation was top notch!  I would have given five stars because the food really is worth that, but the employees comments were just a bit of a turn off for me.  I'm just being picky I guess.
