Estia was very over priced and the food was very average. I've been to Greece many times and was very dissapointed with the food at Estia.The lamb chops tasted very weird with a vinegary flavor.My wife ordered Chilean Sea Bass which had very little flavor and was very greasy? Will not return,ever!!
