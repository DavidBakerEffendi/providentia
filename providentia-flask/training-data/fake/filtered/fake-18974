I went to Artichoke for the first time last night and had some of the best pizza I've had in NYC. I split slices of artichoke, sicilian, and margarita with one of my friends. I loved them all, but especially the sicilian (the artichoke was delicious but I don't think I could finish a whole slice since it is so heavy...). Â I just wish there were some place to sit....even so, I'll definitely be coming back. Mm pizzaaa
