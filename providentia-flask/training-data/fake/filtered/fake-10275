Ok, came here for brunch yesterday - very cool place, brick walls, fans being run by a cool old timey motorized system, staff was attentive and very cute all around - the food was pretty good, butttttttt...they are trying Way too hard to make themselves stand out as a uniquely cuisined place.  All the dishes were too complicated!  If you like that sort of thing, then def check this place out.  but I like my brunch simple: bloody mary, eggs, maybe a biscuit...  the bloody mary here had barbeque sauce in it, the eggs had weirdo sausages and yams in them and even the coffee tasted like they added something to it..  again, i liked this place - just is pretty specific taste wise - and to the whole place: don't try so hard, people will like you for who you are :)
