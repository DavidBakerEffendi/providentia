Everytime I'm in town for business I frequent the Shark Bar at Max Fish. 100% hookednon their Lobster Rolls... a little chipotle aoli and it melts in your mouth. Tonight is Valentines Day and the bartender made a special exception to allow me to order my Lobster Roll. Â Customer Service is A+. Thanks Mike!
