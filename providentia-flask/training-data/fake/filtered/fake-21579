I live around the corner, so I've been eating here like 2-3 times a week.  I've had almost everything on the menu and its all been delicious (although the chicken cashew panini is out of hand - amazing).   Great staff.  Reasonable prices.  This is what the Southside has needed for years.  Thanks Knife!
