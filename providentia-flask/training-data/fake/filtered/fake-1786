This place has definitely wow'ed my palate.  The portions are small but you can easily get full indulging in 3-4 course, including wine, and dessert for two people.  i tried almost everything on the menu and each plate has its own unique taste.  Everything was so fresh and tasty.  Their ingredients are like no other.  You can not find the same tasting food anywhere else.  The only downside I can think of is that this restaurant is fairly small.  It can probably sit about 15-20 people around the bar.  No tables.  Great for intimate dinner! Expensive but worthy!
