I went to the restaurant on Saturday night with my bf and another couple. it was amazing first I went because of the name I love that movie. We had Meatballs and Salad our waiter told us its huge so I will split it for you, well he was right on the money with that. The food was amazing the service was phenomenal I can't wait to go back!
