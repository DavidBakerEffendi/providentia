I was so excited to go to this restaurant, what a mistake, should have know when they didn't have the vodka I drink (Grey Goose), wouldn't let us order appetizers and then the main course " the chef prefers you order everything at once", couldn't get butter for the bread "the chef prefers olive oil" and on and on.  The food came in huge bowls with nothing in them.  The menu was very limited and the "chef would not make any changes".  Next time I go there (never) maybe the "CHEF" would like to pay for my meal since I had nothing to say about what I ate.  Mario....what are you thinking?
