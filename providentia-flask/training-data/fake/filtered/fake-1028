My favorite breakfast spot in the area. Friendly service, interesting specials, and good food. Cafe 72 has an inviting atmosphere and a mouthwatering menu that makes this place something more than your typical luncheonette. Stopped in this morning for breakfast. On a Sunday morning there was a short wait. Coffee set up by the door to warm up while you wait. I had a breakfast sandwich on a croissant with pork roll can't really go wrong but it was delicious. I opted for fruit instead of homefries and was pleasantly surprised to see just fresh bananas and strawberries - exactly what I wanted and much better than the usual fruit cup with canned citrus and grapes. Another notable breakfast item is the pumpkin waffles with cinnamon butter (a special). If you have a sweet tooth there are several pancake and waffles on the menu that will be right up your alley - always sound good but just too much for me in the morning! I've been coming here pretty regularly for the past year and there has only been one dish that disappointed - biscuits and gravy (a special). Nothing offensive, just bland. In short - this place is great. It's my go to place to bring visiting friends and family.
