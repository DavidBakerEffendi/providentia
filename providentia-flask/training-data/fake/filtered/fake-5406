If you are looking for a cozy, unique and authentic restaurant that serves delicious top tier food. This is the one. Perfect for a special occasion although I've been coming here with my wife quite often. But the portions are relatively small, even though it's perfect for me and my wife. If you are very hungry and have a big stomach to fill in, you should go somewhere else, otherwise you may end up ordering multiple dishes. And remember, BYOB, even better. I highly recommend this restaurant to every foodie.
