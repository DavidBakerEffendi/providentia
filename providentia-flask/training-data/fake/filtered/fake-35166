Visiting from Cali and some transplanted NJ friends suggested we try this place since they remodeled and give them some feedback. Was throughly impressed with food, pricing and service. Kudu's to mngr. Kylie who brought us a comp appetizer when she saw the kitchen backing up, will recommend to our friends when we get home!
