I have been to Gottino several times and find it consistent in its quality of food, service and wine. I have gone with friends family and a few times by myself. It is definitely a place where a girl (by herself) can get a nice glass of wine and a bite at the bar in a relaxed comfortable setting. The crostini was quite good ... though... I have not had much more than the crostini and cheese/meat plates. I love that it is like what I would have for a nice picnic... good wine, cheese & small plates in a quaint setting. Things to remember it is very tiny (don't go with a big group) & it can be pricey but hey this is ny.. so expect to spend a bit or wait for spring and just have a picnic in CP!
