This place is incredible.  What 116 Crown did to the bar scene and cocktail paradigm.... Meat & Co. has done to the sandwich. Now they have soup.  WTF.   Very limited hours!  Go there while you can. Now late night menu?!  Seriously, WTF !  Awesome! Sadly, New Haven has very limited late night go-to food.  Now Meat & Co. makes your choice between Mamoun's and Louis Lunch a menage a trois of options... I have been here a dozen times.  The new Monday special ensures  I will be here at least 52x per year! If you think $10 is expensive for 'just a sandwich' .... Go to Mickey D's and eat food-flavored poison and save your $2 and change. Seriously, try the God Forbid.  Liverwurst and hot roast beef together?  With cheese.  And coriander.  And a sweet balsamic red onion jam.  So phenomenal! The employees are all super cool and they all have uber hipster beards. Atmosphere is a cross between 116 Crown and a neighborhood diner. Everything is locally sourced, or made in house!  Support small farms & local businesses, and you get to eat gourmet sandwiches in a hip hotspot in the process? Sign me up. Go for lunch or walk up to the window after last call. Then slap yo self!
