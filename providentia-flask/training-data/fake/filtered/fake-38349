This is my favorite place to eat pizza. They have the most amazing pie that is served with sausage and red onions, it is delish. I have been there many times and have never had a bad experience with either the food, the service, or anything else. The owner Mike is so great, he is friendly and caring and makes you feel welcome. Although the staff are all great, Sal is the bomb whether he is a host or as your waiter. My favorite waitresses have to be those 2 Â lovely sisters, Angela and Gabrielle, they are not only smart and so very informative about the whole menu, they are both so beautiful inside and out. Both of their personalities will keep bringing you back, as will the food they serve to you. They take the time to explain each item on the menu and gives tips on their own special favorites. The pizza maker, Robert is absolutely the best, he always has his game on when it comes to making you the best possible pie you will ever eat. The pie is always cooked to perfection and served hot. Fabio, the other pizza guy is also very good. His pizza's are amazing, as like Roberts are. Let's not forget Izzy, he takes care that everything all comes together for the perfect dining experience, he works so well with all the wait staff, it's like they are 1 big happy Ah Pizz Family. This place is a must to try and come back over and over again.
