The food here can be absolutely delicious.  But the British woman who answers the phone is the absolute rudest person I've ever experienced answering phones in my life.  While the food is great, talking to her makes it disgusting.  If she doesn't feel like taking your order, she just keeps putting you on hold, answering then putting you on hold again.  They take credit cards but has told me flat-out, "We do take credit cards, but I just don't feel like taking your number right now."  WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!  If they are too busy to take delivery orders, then DON'T ANSWER THE PHONE!!!!!!!!!  And it is not only on super busy nights, but she is like this every night of the week no matter when you call.  It is NOT WORTH IT!!!!  When the order does get placed and the food does arrive, only about 1 time in 10 is it warm enough to eat right away.  Most of the time, I am reheating it.  Yeah, mid-day meals are probably fine when you can go there and get one of the three tables in the joint.  I'll say it again, good when it is right, but NOT WORTH THE HASSLE AND AGGRAVATION!!!!
