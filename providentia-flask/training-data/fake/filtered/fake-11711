I went here for a business lunch last week.  This is a fun restaurant and the ski-lodge atmosphere really makes it seem like you are miles away from it's Route 1 location.  The service was fast, efficient, and friendly.  The food however was average.  I had chicken, which was dry and my colleage had the prime rib and wasn't impressed.  If you are looking for a good environment and friendly service for lunch, this is a good place to try.  If you are looking for great food, I would recommend the other steakhouse in the same complex.
