My favorite place for Steaks been going there for years and will continue to do so and the fact that he has English only signs  up makes me love the place even more so...I'm lmao at all the Gino's is racist comments..yup how dare he demand that English only be used at his establishment? hilarious..this is America! We speak English! Political Correctness is the ruining of our country.  If you want a good steak this is the place to go.
