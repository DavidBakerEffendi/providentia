Since my office relocated to this neighborhood, I've been to Galli a few times for lunch  and it's been terrific each time. Everything on the menu that I've had has been great.  In particular, there's a steak special on their lunch menu that both tastes fantastic and is reasonably priced. Service has been very good as well, making the entire experience a positive one. Enjoy your meal.
