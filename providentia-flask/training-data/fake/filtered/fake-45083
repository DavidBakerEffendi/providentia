As a pizza fanatic, I found this place when going to lunch with a bunch of co-workers.  It was love at first bite! I've had John's, Lombardi's, Adrienne's, and Grimaldi's, and yes believe it not I prefer Reservoir Tavern.   I've also had the big names in Chicago such as Gino's, Pizano's, and Giordano's, but that is a whole different category, deep-dish.  The crust is near perfect, thin and crunchy but chewy in the middle.  The sauce is just tangy enough and the cheese seems to be a grade higher than your typical yellow-tinged pizza cheese.   And that's just their regular pie!   Throw in reasonable pricing and you've got yourself an incredible pizza meal.  I am now a loyal customer of theirs and take any friends that come to the area for a great slice.
