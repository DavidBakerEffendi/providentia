I have to say we were truely dissapointed......I grew up in west haven and honestly I even worked there as a busybody as one of my first jobs 20 years ago...my wife and I were out for a drive on sunday and decided to stop for dinner...asked for an outside table and the wait was short....   Downside.... Lobster bisque  was good but cold...I ordered the fried scallops and wife ordered the seafood platter. ..Honestly you can tell all the food is pre packaged  and frozen....and asking for a glass of water and more lemon seemed liked  I asked for the world to stop turning.... Upside.....nice views of water and was able to walk on the boardwalk.. I highly doubt we will be returning anytime soon except to use the bathroom when we are walking on boardwalk. ...Stowes was our first choice but line was out the door...
