We sat at the little restaurant tucked in a nook that was quite empty but holy moly was the food good. It is the real deal. So much so, the scenery coupled with the waiter's sultry Italian accent made me forget I was in NYC. The carpaccio was buttery perfection. The lobster and scallop dish was cooked perfectly and the cauliflower puree was nice. My husband's beef dish was heavenly and he's hard to please. The wine we ordered had turned so we opted for mixed drinks instead and the waiter was happy to oblige. It was expensive but you are paying for the experience and the food really was outstanding. I can imagine how lovely this will be come warm weather because after experiencing a slice of Italy you can walk it off in one of the prettiest parts of Manhattan.
