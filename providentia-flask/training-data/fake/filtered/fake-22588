Went here not too long ago and the food is average at best, the menu is limited and the prices are too high.  If you are having a decent time relaxing and drinking, the servers and management rush you to finish because the size of the pub is about the size of a one-room apartment.  Very limited tables and the management is not very friendly, like you owe them something.With all the eateries in the Queen Village area, I would not return to this establshment.
