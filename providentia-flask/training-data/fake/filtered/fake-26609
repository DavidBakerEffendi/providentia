Called to make a reservation for brunch.  Was told that you can't make reservations.  I get it, however, my mother is joining and is ill, so I asked the person on the phone if an exception could possibly be made.  She was quick to say that no exceptions could be made.  Again, I get it, she's not the manager so she can't make exceptions. So I asked if a manager or the owner could be asked and then get back to me.   This is where is get's unusual, the woman on the phone laughed.  This I don't get and this was definately a first.  I have some theories as to why this caused a chuckle, but will leave them out of this.  So, I sent a note to the info email address detailing the able, but have yet to hear back.   I think the rub is that a place like Stone Park is for me a restaurant that is striving to be sensitive to the environment, sensitive to supporting local farmers, and to being sensitive to the needs of the needs of its customers.  It's a big part of the draw for me and it's why I am able to enjoy not only the food, but to be able to feel as though I am also supporting a philosophy of mindfullness, compassion and kindness.  Again, don't expect much from the person on the phone, but it is surprising that a I didn't get quick note back from a manager/owner saying, "Sorry, we don't condone the laugh, but please understand our policy is one that we can't change, hopefully you can still join us" would have been great .... but unfortunately did not get any response.
