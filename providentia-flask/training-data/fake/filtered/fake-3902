A perfect place for an impromptu party.  I called on a Thursday for a Sunday dinner for a Birthday party for a party of 11 people.  Nick, the manager, went over the menu with me, over the phone, and said not to worry everything will be done.  I chose the verdi package and the food was served family style, more than enough and absolutely delicious.  Just a sample of our favorites...the fried calamari, the fresh mozzarella cheese and tomato bruschetta (5 stars for that  dish alone), the broccoli rabe and hot sausage (I'm getting hungry already).  The tilipia francese and the pollo puccini which is chicken, shrimp, mushrooms served in a marsala cream sauce with fresh rosemary.  The dessert was a plate of tiramisu, cannoli's and my personal new favorite cake...a toasted almond amaretto cake.  I would go back just for the dessert.  The staff, to include our waiters, Mario, Anthony and Sun, were all so accomodating.  To our surprise, Sun sang while Gloria played the piano and of course it couldn't have been a nicer birthday for my mother-in-law.  Thank you so much Nick and staff for making our occasion special.
