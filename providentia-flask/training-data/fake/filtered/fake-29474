I like Amy Ruth's food as I've been frequenting this restaurant for many years. I find that the food over all is good but has changed over the past few years and continues to change not necessarily bad but original styles or recipes tastes better. I love their salmon croquettes and cheesy grits! It's one of my favorite go to meals and I order it ALl time. I realize that the recipe has changed and it doesn't taste as good as it did about six months ago. I don't know either they have a new cook or a new recipe but they should go back to the old recipe, it tastes better! And the biscuits are too thick sometimes. Doesn't taste flaky like a biscuit, not completely bad but can be better! The mac n cheese is always amazing and the chicken and waffles are to die for. The sweet tea will give you diabetes but it's worth it. It always packed in the afternoon and for dinner so breakfast is your best bet for seating without waiting on the long line. Overall, good food but can always be better.
