Went in a few nights ago without a reservation. The hostess and manager where standing at the door and said there will be a 30 minutes wait; they took our mobile number and called us EXACTLY 30 minutes later with a ready table- talk about an accurate estimate !... The place is beautiful (love the ceilings). The service and food were both excellent. They menage to keep the classic Greek flavors and textures, while giving everything a nice personal spin of their own. also, the wine list is great, and all is very reasonably priced. If you're in the mood for Greek- this is the place to go in the city. Make reservations !
