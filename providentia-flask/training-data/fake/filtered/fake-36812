Dined at Atera for dinner one evening this week. The food, staff and room were wonderful. The seating is great for conversation with other guests and the very helpful and entertaining staff. The sommelier was especially helpful and fun to speak with. The pairings with each course worked perfectly. Very diverse and flavorful menu. I will definitely be back soon to enjoy again. The lounge downstairs is intimate and relaxing. Well done cocktails. M Lockwood
