So, let me start by saying that if I was rating this strictly on my meal, five stars is not enough. If you want a hearty breakfast, specifically for a drive home the morning after sampling some of Vermont's finest craft beers, you can do no better than a breakfast sandwich on a Vermont Country Bagel. I got a sausage patty and paired with the fennel and salt on the bagel, it was heavenly. The lack of a five star review is thanks to the odd encounter we had with the girl who made my bagel. She seemed pleasant enough, or at least as much as one could working in the pit of despair that is a bagel shop on a Sunday morning, but she asked to see my receipt after handing me my bagel. I told her my girlfriend paid it, which she did, and that I would send her up with the receipt right away. When she got there, she was met with a look of confusion and rudely brushed her off to get back to the queue. It was...really odd. Enough that I am dusting off my Yelp account to tell you about it. I don't take it personally, as I have been in her shoes before, but I cannot begin to tell you how odd that was. I can understand wanting to make sure I wasn't trying to walk off without paying, but to ask to see a reciept and then decide to trust me after all? I don't know. Have some coffee.
