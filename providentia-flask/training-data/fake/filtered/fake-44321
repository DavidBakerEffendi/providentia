I gave this restaurant a go because of all the great yelp reviews. My whole experience from customer service to the food was very disappointing. My friend and I felt rushed from the beginning. Our waitress appeared to be annoyed and she gave us our bill before we even received our food. I chose the sweet-n-sour chicken. My friend picked the beef with eggplants and oyster sauce. We weren't impressed at all by the quality of the food. I won't be returning to this place.
