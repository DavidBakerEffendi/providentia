I absolutely LOVED the food. I couldn't decide what to get so a couple of friends and I split a bunch of stuff. Â The deviled eggs were deliciously flavorful and creamy, not a big fan of potato salad but really liked it here, pickled green beans had a nice kick, pork belly was the right combination of crispy and tender, the burger and brisket-duck liver boudin balls just melted in my mouth, hot sausage was really tasty and just loved the crawfish mac & cheese. There was a good amount of crawfish morsels, very tender and not rubbery. A very warm buttermilk biscuit that hits the spot. We sat at the bar and was greeted by a friendly and helpful bartender. Even got to meet Simon and was able to tell him how happy he made my taste buds. All in all pretty great. I don't even live in Bushwick and will be back for more,
