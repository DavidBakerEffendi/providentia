Made a res 1 mo. ago. Showed up tonight w/ husband and were told we weren't on the list. I made the hostess look through her list and found my name on the "unconfirmed list." I got a new phone # 3 days ago and therefore did not receive that call. There was NO mention that there would be a conf. when I made the res. I know that for a fact b/c I am anal and write everything down - would've made note of that. Hostess said "no tables, wait 30 min." OK, wait 30 min, still no table. Asked for manager & woman whom I thought was hostess claimed to be the maitre'd and said "physically there are no tables. We will call you as soon as something comes up. maybe 30 min" We left. Guess what? It's 7:40 and I have not received that "call." Furious. Husband and I worked our schedules around for this. Then read this article: ny.eater.com/archives/20…  about owner Keith McNally and how no one is ever turned down. Too bad he wasn't there himself. Was looking forward to the food so much.
