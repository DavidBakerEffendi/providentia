I'm gonna keep this to the point. So we ordered: 1) gol gappa  - the durum puffs were stale. bad. 2) spicy kakori kebab - the only decent item. good. 3) tashan vegetable plate - sad looking, exceptionally POORLY PLATED, BAD TASTING plate of uber limp veggies for $22.  seriously? too peeved for words. 4) Kashmiri lamb shank -  all I'm gonna say is this: if my 70 year old dad, whose palate is average, can tell that the lamb was cooked/boiled separately without seasoning and still tough as leather, and then just dunked into a plate of gravy... then the restaurant truly needs to fire its chef. After leaving the restaurant we walked across the street to Dunkin Donuts for dessert, and my dad commented "best part of dinner so far."  Epic Fail.
