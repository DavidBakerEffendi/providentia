I see the potential, but for now this place is so so.  The ambience is off. I'm not sure if they are showcasing a new artist each month, but the photographs on the wall were hideous...  They looked like something I'd see at Sears. While dining at a French bistro I was hoping to hear some French pop, maybe some Serg or Air, but instead, we were exposed to Paul Simon's "like a rock" and The Who's "pinball wizard".   As for the food, the housemade bread was impressive, but we were only given 1 slice each.  The highlight for me was the small plate, lentil stuffed ravioli..  It was creative and well balanced..A great starter! For our entrees , I ordered the lamb, and my Husband ordered the grilled seitan- both forgettable.  The desserts, blah, I've had better desserts at Johnny Brendas... This place is way new, and will probably work out all the kinks in the coming months.  The waitstaff is inexperienced, but nice.  I think with a few tweaks, this place could be great!
