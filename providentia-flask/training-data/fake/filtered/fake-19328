This place is golden. Truly a hidden gem and here's why. As my profile states my favorite meal is brunch. On days when I get a late start, I will insist of having some kind of breakfast food even if it's later in the day 1, 2 p.m. Recently I moved out of the area that Almaz is located in. The day after my move out I had to clean out my old place but being exhausted and fighting a cold, I got a late start. It was 11 am before I even thought of food and what I wanted most was breakfast food. I had planned on going somewhere else far more expensive but as I came up 20th street I saw Almaz and decided to save some money. I had had a late brunch there a few weeks earlier--excellent low carb omelette cooked exactly as I'd asked --and decided to pop in again. The guy remembered my face and also remembered how I had taken my omelet. Again, it was made to perfection. Additionally, the coffee-- with free refills if you're staying-- was one of the best cups of coffee I have ever had. It rivals the most celebrated coffee establishment in Center City located just off the square-- it's that good. And on top of all this the cost of my entire meal, including coffee, was about $11-12 or so. Â It can be hard to find a place that serves brunch past 2 let alone all day, that is low key and unpretentious in Center City. If you are looking for a place that isn't too expensive, serves breakfast all day, takes care to remember what customers like and makes one of the best cups of coiffee around this is the spot for you.
