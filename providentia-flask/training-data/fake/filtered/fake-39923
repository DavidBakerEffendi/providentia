Just visited over weekend & loved this place ! Promised myself I would write a review as soon as I returned home! The crepes are wondeful & fresh. The wise and very unique variety keep u wanting more. The creativeness of the shop itself, down to the silverware add a dose of that umpphh....-LOVED IT! Definite stop each time we take our trip to the new vacation home. Keep it Up Guys!
