I visited Â this place around couple of months back and did like the food and place, but looks like that was my last experience with this restaurant. I tried to eat at this place 2-3 more times on Saturday lunch buffet but looks like they are open only for private parties on Saturday's. I am really disturbed by this and might not be considering visiting this place on Saturday's and I usually try to eat out only on Saturday's. Looks like Guru Palace management is not interested in this kind of business and want to loose customers. If they have so many parties on weekends then they should have some other arrangements for the same and not disturb their regular lunch buffet for which people sometimes travel long and come. Ambiance is too busy inside the restaurant, although they tried to make it romantic but failed in my opinion.
