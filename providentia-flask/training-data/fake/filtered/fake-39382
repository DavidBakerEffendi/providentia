Terrible food.  Unclean conditions.  Main item for lunch was grilled chicken on hoagie roll with cheese and condiments.  Manager said she was out of hoagie rolls and used a tasteless plain roll and forgot to put on the cheese.  Coffee was help yourself out of a pump container and tepid at best.  Chicken had no grill marks.  Would never return!
