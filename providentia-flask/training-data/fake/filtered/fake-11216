A pretty solid four star review for Dinosaur.  Went last night just b/c I happened to be in the neighborhood.  We were seated in minutes, and the service was fine (contrary to what I had been reading).  No long wait to order, no long wait for food and it didn't seem like anyone else was having that problem either. Brisket was solid, as were ribs and pulled pork.  The poutine fries looked and sounded great but came out luke-warm and were nothing special. Dessert was just OK - had the peanut butter pie and the cheesecake. On the definite plus side, portions of everything were big for the price, so we had plenty to bring home for late-night snacks and leftovers today. I'll go back if I'm in the neighborhood, though not worth the trip out to Gowanus otherwise.
