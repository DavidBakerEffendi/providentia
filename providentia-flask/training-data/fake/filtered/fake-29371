The best shawarma ever!!!! Being from the middle east..im very picky and needless to say this was great.. wish it wwas more authentic with the bread rolled up rather than an open face pita!! Falafel was great as well... the guy at the counter is the epitome of the NY mentality... get it while its hot and get the f@#$ out the way.. CASH ONLY!
