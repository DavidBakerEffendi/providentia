I used to work here as a waitress and I am very surprised this place is still open! Â I remember the Owner's son dripping a full basket of fried shrimp on the floor on the kitchen and picking it up and dusting it off and serving it. They reuse the tartar sauce in a glass cup and I found one with a huge hair ball in it. We would get a "free meal" after a shift and I would never take then up on the offer. Over priced, dirty, outdated, sub par seafood, and a horrific family to work for.
