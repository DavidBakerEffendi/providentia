I went to Quaker Diner this past Saturday for breakfast and as usual it was great.  It's just a little hole in the wall diner but the food is great and the wait staff are the best.  If you're in a rush this might not be the place for you as on the weekends you might find it's standing room only waiting for one of the 6 coveted booths or a spot on a round stool at the old fashioned diner counter.  Believe me, if you're looking for a good hearty breakfast you'll find it was worth the wait.
