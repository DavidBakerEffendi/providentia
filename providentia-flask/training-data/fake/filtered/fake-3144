If you're in the Newark Downtown Area and want a good place to eat, reasonably priced and a great deal for your money, go The Titanic Restaurant and try one of their steaks.  The steak will fill up the whole plate and I dare you to try to eat the whole thing.  The staff will wait on you like a King or Queen and you WILL want to come back.  There is also seating in the rear for those who want to eat family style. I usually sit a t the bar so I can eat and drink.  Restaurant serves Portuguese food which is very good, the bread is warm and the atmosphere is great.   One thing, parking is tight, due to the small parking lot next to the restaurant but there is plenty of parking around the restaurant.  This spot is a short  walk (3 blocks) from Newark Penn Station and well worth trekking out to.  Happy Eating!
