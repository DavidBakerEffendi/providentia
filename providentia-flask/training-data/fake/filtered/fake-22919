went to Mezetto to check it out since it's the new restaurant in my area.  Overall, I was pretty impressed.  I went with 3 friends and we ordered lots of small tapas.  Plates were tasty, good size.  pricing was solid for amount of food. Falafel, tuna and gnocchi were my favorite and we washed down the meal with some excellent wine (Pinot Noir).  Decor inside was cool. Service was solid.  I would recommend.  Save room for dessert, the halva was excellent!
