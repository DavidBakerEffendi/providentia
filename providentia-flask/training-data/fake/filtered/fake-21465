5 STARS IS NOT ENOUGH! This is the best place in the area to grab a fast meal!  The food is always fresh and delicious and the beer cold!  The service is fast and friendly, the prices cannot be beat in this part of town.  You can eat a decent sized meal AND get a beer for less than $15, this is next to impossible anywhere else in Chelsea or Flatiron. If you are vegetarian or vegan, there are plenty of delicious and healthy options for you (for once)! Just go there!
