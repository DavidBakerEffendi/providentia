I have been here before and always found it a great place for great beers. Today I brought my wife and two kids in the late afternoon for an early dinner. We were the first in the place and no one else around. The Waitress had the worst attitude I have experienced in a long time. Each time she would walk away from our table, she would shake her head in disgust. We questioned things like the Coke my son was drinking tasted funny. She said it was a no-name brand. Ok, explanation given, now dont walk away like we are the freaks. We left and went elsewhere for dinner. We mentioned to our new waiter our experience and he began to laugh and tell us it wasn't us, but rather the Wait staff have a major chip on their shoulder...get over it, your not that interesting!
