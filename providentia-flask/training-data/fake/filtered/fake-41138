JUST AVERAGE Totto is an attempt to imitate a Japanese ramen-ya, and by the Japanese standard it's just average. You would never wait so long, or pay so much, or have such small portions, or eat such mediocre (and greasy) ramen, or be treated so badly by staff, in Japan.  But this is the USA: ocha is extra, all toppings are extra, the bathroom is not clean, and they put your check on your table with the food, and they only take cash.  I didn't notice any Japanese eating here, only Chinese. What's more, if you don't give them at least a 25% tip (for bringing your bowl to the counter or table), they will harass you endlessly, even out on to the street.  In Japan, you never tip in a ramen-ya.  So be forewarned.  This is NOT the real deal, but it is cheaper than a trip to Hokkaido, where the best ramen is made. Complaints from other reviewers about the staff are fully justified.
