This is one of the best resturant in the center city especially if you like dumplings , I went out for lunch with my hubby and we had dumplings , cheese wonton and fried rice oh my god... best and healthy food in the town . Everything was just perfect and had perfected texture . I would love to go back and enjoy their delicious food .
