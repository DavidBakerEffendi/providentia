It shoulda been 5 stars.   A lovely meal.  My wife and I agreed we feel the Mushroom Gravy Smothered Chicken was a little tastier than the Sausage Gravy Fried Chicken, but that is a minor quibble.  The cheese grits were sublime, a term I don't often use, but absolutely appropriate here.   It was a pleasure to be served by John.  So unusual to find a professional who was helpful, hard-working (often stopping by the table to refill my coffee), and friendly without being overbearing.  After experiences with many mediocre to poor waiters at restaurants high and low, John was a breath of fresh air. And speaking of fresh air...the entire front of the restaurant was open.  It was cold.  We were told it was the policy to keep the front open.  On a cold and rainy day, we want respite from the elements, not huddling in our coats and ordering hot coffee to keep our hands warm.  We would have awarded this restaurant 5 stars, but the policy to freeze the patrons warrants the 4 (perhaps it should be 3) star review. It was our first visit to this highly rated place.  We will not return until the warmth of spring.
