this place is absolutely amazing! I cant get enough I have tried a good amount of the menu and its all great I love the breakfast all day too!! (french toast and the pilgrim are to die for) food has always been hot and presentation pretty good The service is really good I have had a couple different servers so far my favorite is definitely the boy (he looks like david cook haha and hes the only boy there) he has been outstanding everytime I have had him hes a little quieter than the others so I think he doesnt get noticed as much as the girls but he has to be one of the best servers I have come across the other waitresses are far to fast like busy bees tip: that does not look professional or make a customer feel like they are in a comfortable atmosphere... learn some stuff from the kid girls the only thing that stinks is seating if you are someone who like booths good luck cause they only have 3 and they have been full every single time I have been in basically you need to try this place you wont be able to eat anywhere else for awhile its that good!
