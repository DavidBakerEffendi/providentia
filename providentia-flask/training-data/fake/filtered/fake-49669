I have been to Feast twice since they've opened.  This place is the perfect example of what dining should be like. Living in NYC with all the hustle and bustle, it is very hard to find a place where you can eat, relax, and enjoy as if you were at home or at a friend's house.  The decor and ambience is perfect for that family/friend gathering.  The food is delicious.  What a great concept for the menu.  I cannot explain it.  I can only tell you to try it for yourself.  The coolest thing...ROOT BEER ON TAP and HOMEMADE SODAS.  I was able to get a table at the front window and the whole time I was there I noticed person after person stopping in to take a look and even stay.  There was even a line at times to look at the menu outside next to the door.  If you want to "feast", make sure you make a reservation because this place is already hot and it hasn't even had a chance to warm up.
