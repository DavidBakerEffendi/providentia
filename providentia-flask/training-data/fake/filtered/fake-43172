Excellent Services!!! Elvis is the most professional waiter I have ever met. He helped us to make some very tasty BBQ beef, shrimps. And not to metion he also put his secert ingredients sources on mussels and eggplants. Wow!! It was just Yummy!!! How can you tell a waiter is professional or not? Even he had work for 9 hours by the time he served us and was tired, he still had a very friendly smiling face throughout the night.
