I went on 9-8-2013 with my son. We were seated right away. We received the coleslaw and pickles almost as we sat down.  We watched as others came and were seated.  We watched the waitresses going to other tables taking their drink orders. We just got back from a hike so we were very hungry and thirsty.  My son is 9 and wanted a drink badly.  I taught him good manners so he wasn't loud about it.  After people were seated next to us and got their drink orders, well you guess it, we left.  I will never, ever go back or tell anyone to go there. They put a VERY bad taste in my mouth without even trying the food.
