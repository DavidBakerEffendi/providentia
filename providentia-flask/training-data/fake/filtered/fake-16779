I was here years ago and quite frankly had forgotten all about  this place until last Saturday. Walking on South Street, looking for a place to drink & eat, wanting a little more, I remembered New Wave. So glad I did! It seems to have gotten better with age. After not being impressed by the wait at South Street venues, New Wave was packed but we still got a table immediately. It was clean, our waitress was friendly (she actually smiled) & was very attentive. Our food came out quickly & the nachos were heavenly!! Seriously, I can't EVER remember having restaurant nachos that I'd actually recommend. Nachos, fish tacos & smithwicks on tap (YUM),  all served quickly by a friendly, happy waitress on a crowded Saturday evening. Sure a rarity that a place like this has improved with age!
