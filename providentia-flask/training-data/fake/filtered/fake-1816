WOW! This place was hands down phenomenal. I loved loved the d√©cor on this restaurant, the food was amazing and the portions were huge. You can feed 2 people with one portion with some of the dishes. I tried the jalea (fried seafood mix) I was in heaven it was delicious. The lomo salteado which is similar to pepper steak was sooo tasty. They also have this banana coconut tres leches that was out of this world. I would go back anytime.
