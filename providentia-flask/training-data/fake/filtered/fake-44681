My wife and I visited the rotisserie  last night for a pre valentines day dinner , MY brother and his girl friend  jointed us and it was the worst dinner date I have ever had ! I ordered a steak med well and had it show up cold and the center was raw, the summer medley veg. Came cold to. I sent back the steak and asked for it to be redone only to have it show back up cold and raw in the middle a second time . Seems like the cook has never cooked a steak before. Another item there selection of beer is terrible nothing but  Bud and miller products and most are lite beers . So to sum up this review I would highly recommend prior to going there you read the menu and plan on cold food . You might ask was the place so busy the cook was over whelmed ? There was a total of 8 people in the place while we where there so I don't think that was the issue . I don't ever see myself walking into this restaurant  ever again as there are some very good restaurants in that general area. Sorry rotisserie  but you blew it!!
