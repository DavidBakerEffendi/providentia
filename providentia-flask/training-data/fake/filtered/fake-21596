Single handily the worst dining experience I've had in the last five years.  So much so that it made me register with Yelp.  The service was so bad that it was offensive.  I came there with a reservation for 12.  Prior to the meal we asked if it would be possible to split the check into three different checks.  The waiter said he could only split it into two, but just to be sure he went to ask his manager.  The manager came back and condescendingly told us that when she goes out to eat they simply divide the check by the amount of people and each pay equal.  We told her that we were college students and some people were going to order meals and others just drinks and so that wouldn't be fair.  After hearing this she simply nodded her head and said that not only would they not split the check into three, but that they would not split the check into two.  After getting numerous drink orders wrong (and billing us for the wrong drink orders) they then proceeded to take over an hour to deliver our meal.  To make up for the horrific service the manager copped as a few bottles of cheap Chardonnay.  When the bill came the manager was unbelievably rude when we questioned the incorrect drink orders that we addressed earlier.  The whole place had above average food and horrific service.  I remember asking my friend if it was a new restaurant because it was inconceivable that so much chaos and disorder could happen with simple requests.  There are so many good family run restaurants around the area, this certainly is not one of them.
