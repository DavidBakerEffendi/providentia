We went to Junior's for lunch on a Wednesday before catching a Broadway matinee performance. The menu is wonderful, the portions are huge, the food is great, and the service is phenomenal. Our server even let us know about discounted tickets and student prices for some of the shows. I would definitely come here again and highly recommend it for anyone visiting Times Square.
