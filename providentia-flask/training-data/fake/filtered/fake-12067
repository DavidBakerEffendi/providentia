Went there with a friend and hubby after seeing it on No Reservations. nd being the meat eaters that my friend nd hubby are, figured..wth.  grass fed burgers, must be good.  Luckily we didnt have to wait since we got there b4 7 on a sunday nite. place quickly got very crowded. Nice crowd, atmosphere. We all ordered the burger.  Food had real potential, meat was good, but WAY too salty.  the fries were salty as well.  My hubby noticed there were no salt shakers anywhere, now we know why. You cant fix something after its been OD with salt.  Being we dont live in the area, its not really worth a trip there either.
