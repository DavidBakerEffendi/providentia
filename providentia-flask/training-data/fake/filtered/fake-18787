I saw some mixed reviews here, but I  work nearby and know the place just opened up. As someone who has previously worked in the restaurant business, I know there can some bumps in the road when things get started, so I thought I would give them a chance - I'm glad I did. They must have made some changes because what I got was very good.  I got the meatball sandwich which I thought was very flavorful and fresh tasting. I think the price was in line with what they offer which is something that has premium ingredients. I will be back again and look forward to trying their pastas and other sandwiches.
