They must of changed ownership over the past few years. It used to be a great place. Â VERY disappointing! It's been about 3 years since I was last there and I can tell you now I will NEVER GO AGAIN. We had to seat ourselves, wait almost 15 minutes to place an order, we were the only ones in the restaurant (should of been a clue), food was average to beige, took forever to finally get a check so we could leave, the woman behind the counter seemed to think she was doing us a favor by ringing us out. She disappeared before I even finished signing the charge receipt. When we left, there was only one other guest in the place. They might want to realize that we have choices where we dine out... won't be here. CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED!
