Wow, this place was great...we stopped in on the way home from Monster Golf a few weeks ago, and were very glad we did.  The pizza was perfect, not too thin, not too thick, with  just the right amount of oooey gooey cheese...just the way we like it.  The staff was very prompt, professional, & courteous...I really liked the way they interacted, and joked around with my youngest son.  My oldest son got a chicken parm sandwich, which he said was really good...it must have been, because he didn't even stop eating to check out who was texting him. The place was very clean, including the bathroom, which anyone with kids will tell you, is a must.  I have a couple friends that live in Fairfield that I will be visiting over the summer, this will be the place I stop at from now on to pick up lunch.  I wish they would make a deal with Monster Golf to be their new pizzeria for birthday parties...this place blows their current place away!!!  Too bad we don't live close enough to enjoy their services more often, since we usually order pizza/italian once a week...Hey do you guys deliver to Belleville????
