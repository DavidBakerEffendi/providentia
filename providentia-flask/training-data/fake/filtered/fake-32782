Flavors here are okay..  Decent food and it looked and tasted fresh.  I didn't like where they are situated.  They are very far from where I live and quite a drive to pickup passable Indian food.  If they were more downtown and accessible, they would see me every now and then.  The saag was fresh smelling and tasty.  The rest I didn't care too much for.
