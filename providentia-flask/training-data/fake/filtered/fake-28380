Though always packed with people waiting for a table they are rewarded with great food every time! The salad, super fresh, came almost immediately. Our request for a dietary alteration was accepted and confirmed by the waiter immediately. The most beautiful salmon steaks cooked and seasoned perfectly arrived in less than ten minutes!
