I highly recommend this market!  It's a true taste of Italy in Princeton, NJ.  Yesterday I tried their Caprese panino.  I just returned from a semester studying abroad in Italy, and was pleasantly surprised to find that this sandwich was just as good as the ones I was accustomed to eating in Italy!  Homemade, melt-in-your-mouth mozzarella, fresh tomatoes, and pesto that tasted as if the basil had just been picked that morning.  And authentic Italian bread!  I found out that the bread is fresh everyday, brought in from a Brooklyn bakery.  What I love most about the market is that I could come here for lunch or dinner every day, and eat something different... they have pizza, salads, panini's, a salumeria, bakery, butcher, produce, an espresso and cappuccino bar, and all sorts of products imported from Italy.  I asked at the front, and they do catering...next time I have a party I will definitely be asking D'Angelo to cater.  So next time you're craving some homemade tiramisu, or a slice of artisan pizza, try D'Angelo. Oh, and the prices are very reasonable! :)
