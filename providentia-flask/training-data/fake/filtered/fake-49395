Loud as heck!  Can't hear yourself think, or the waitress talk, or the person sitting next to you when they try to whisper in your ear that they love you!  Truly enjoyed the different margaritas and the guacamole though!  Great location and a cool atmosphere, just wish the noise level could go down a ton so that I, and my family and friends, could communicate with words and not sign language!
