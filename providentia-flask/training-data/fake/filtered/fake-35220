Hands down, this cafe has the BEST Italian pasta in the city. Words cannot describe how delicious and better yet, how fairly priced the plates are. All of the staff are incredibly kind and ensure that you enjoy your dining experience. I would highly recommend this hidden gem to anyone who wishes to experience what authentic, Italian food should taste like.
