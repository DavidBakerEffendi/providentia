Some people on yelp could be so critical after only visiting once or twice. I've been a regular at the Park Tavern for years. It's like cheers. The bartenders know the orders and treat us like friends. The food is good and very reasonable pricing. The staff is friendly. It does get busy on weekends so the service isnt 100% (thats everywhere though). The bar is lined with flat screen HD tvs. anywhere you sit you have a perfect view. Great place to spend football sundays. Great pizza, wings, and mussels. coldest draft beer in the area.
