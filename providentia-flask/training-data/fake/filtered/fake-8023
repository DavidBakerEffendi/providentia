Usually Odeon delivers really good food.  Not last week.  My friend and I both ordered the Croque Monsieur (spelling?).  It and the accompanying salad were drenched in Dijon.  When we informed the waiter, he told us to tell the waiter the next time to hold the mustard.  There will be no next time given that response.
