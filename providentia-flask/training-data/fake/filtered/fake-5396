Very impressed with the quality! Most places have pretty bland flavor to their dishes, but each of the Rice Bowl's combo lunches I have tried are absolutely delicious. Would definitely recommend the boneless spare ribs....definitely my new favorite. It's close to a lot of shopping areas, so it's perfect to stop in for a bite on the go. There's even a laundromat in the same complex, easy to throw in a couple of loads and enjoy a great meal while you wait. Great value and quality all around.
