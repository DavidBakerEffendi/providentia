Bridget Foy's is among my favorite restaurants on Philadelphia's South St.  My family and I enjoy stopping in for lunch or a early dinner.  They serve a great burger, and I look forward to eating outside when the weather warms up.  The service is excellent and its staff are superb.  It's a great break form the cookie cutter chains that overwhelm the market in the suburbs.  A definite destination when in Philly.
