The Halal cart on Broadway is one of the best deals in Astoria.  Although their chicken rice plates can be a little inconsistent at times (warning - when it's slow) - it's usually the most amazing six dollar meal you can find. Their falafel is always amazing - and I love the little salad on the side - with the pickled turnips.  Always always go for the white and red (hot) sauce - they go together like peas and carrots. Also for a change of pace - the combo plate (kefta and chicken) is a great deal and when you are in a carnivorous mood - their beef kebabs are mouth wateringly tender and an amazing addition to your plate for 2 bucks. As good as it gets for lunch (or a quick dinner) in Astoria - you can catch me there at least once if not twice a week!
