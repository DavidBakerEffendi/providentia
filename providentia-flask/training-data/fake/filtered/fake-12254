This was our second time there...first time service was horrible and food was not great but had potential. Ordered French onion soup that was cold? How do you pull that off? I chalked it up to a bad night, it was late on Black Friday. Tonight we went with our kids...problem number one we walk in and ask for a table  for 4. The hostess who I believe is an owner, says do you have a reservation. we say no, you don't have any tables in tha bar area? No we are booked, but I can accomdated you but next time I suggest you make reservations. Really? It's a glorified pub...not 90 acres. There won't be a next time.   We would have waited for a table if they weren't so rude. We sit down wait ten minutes to order drinks..then we order dinner and the food again comes out cold not 5 minutes letter, proving that food is sitting under heat lamps. My daughter orders pepperoni pizza..the waitress comes out as the food is being delivered to the table and says oh we are out of pepperoni. There was no I'm sorry..would you like something else etc. etc. you have pizza as one of the main dishes on you menu.. How do you run out of pepperoni? Place has potential, but they need to get their act together...and get rid of your reservations idea!!
