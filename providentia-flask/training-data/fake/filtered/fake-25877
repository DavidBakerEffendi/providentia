Villa Di Roma made my saturday.  My date and I stopped in to get some pasta and have a glass a wine after some shopping and, like the previous review, i was reminded of spots from my childhood.  Upon looking at the menu my friend ran out to get more cash and we decided to order more than we needed.  Gwen gave great advice and wrapped up the cannoli i  had to order but couldnt eat.  I, myself, am a server and the most i can ask for is to have great food and kind service and not only did all of leftovers not make it to sunday, we literally can not wait to go back.  THANK YOU!
