Ellary's Greens has become one of my favorite restaurants: delicious, affordable, healthy and satisfying. I love the atmosphere, it's scrupulously clean, and everything about it just feels right. I follow a paleo diet but my vegetarian and vegan friends always find something good on the menu as well - with lots of options for their diets as well as mine. My favorite is the crispy roast chicken - always juicy and tender. Though I want to try new things every time I go, it's difficult to skip the Kabocha/Butternut Squash salad with Enoki Mushrooms & Pumpkin Seeds. My experiences have all been excellent here and this owner Leith Hill did something really wonderful: I came into the restaurant on a warm day when the doors and windows were open to let in the afternoon sun. The restaurant felt warmer than usual and I was fanning myself to cool down, not expecting anyone to notice. Leith came to the table, asked me if I was warm and said that she would turn the air on. I didn't even ask! She just offered. That's super nice. I was also, finally, able to tell her how much I love the food. (Thank you, Leith!) I've read complaints about the chairs, (they're not the most comfortable) as well as about the single restroom, but these are minor complaints at a restaurant this good. I send all my friends and they come back raving. Don't forget to try the vegan chocolate mousse. Delicious! (And I'm not even vegan.)
