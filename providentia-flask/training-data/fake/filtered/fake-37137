A decent cafe with some great meals.  Well worth a visit for dinner, although it is pricey.  The duck in particular is excellent. The interior is very pleasant and attractive and the service is good.  Additionally, their coffee is among the best in Morningside Heights -- FAR better than Oren's and Joe's.
