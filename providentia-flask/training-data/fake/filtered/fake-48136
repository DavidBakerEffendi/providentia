The dining room was beautiful, and the servers were attentive and friendly. We spilled a glass of wine (the last of our bottle) and the sommelier soon brought us each a complimentary glass. That was a nice touch! The food was spectacular! Try the duck, the chocolate souffl√© and the artisan breads. This place is a must and is now our go to French restaurant in New York!
