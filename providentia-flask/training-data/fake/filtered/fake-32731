The ambience, the food, the prices, the seasonable variety, the service, and the location are all A # 1.  If you are extra lucky, you will get Josh to be your server/host/helper--he is excellent!  When do I get to go again? I've brought family members, friends, and dates there and everyone has absolutely loved Vesta!!!
