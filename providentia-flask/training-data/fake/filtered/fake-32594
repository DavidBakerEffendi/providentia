Some long-time Greenwich Village denizens introduced me to this charming little bistro on a recent business trip. It's set on a great people-watching corner (in the best French tradition) and boasts an excellent menu. The beet salad with strawberries was divine, and the baked Alaskan skate was melt-in-your-mouth good (both are house specialties). Service was attentive and the floral decor makes for a lovely atmosphere. I'd recommend a weekday visit. On Fridays and Saturdays the whole East Village seems to be flooded with young suburbanites looking for a night on the town. A longer-than-average wait can be expected, but the maitre d's do their utmost to keep the tables moving.
