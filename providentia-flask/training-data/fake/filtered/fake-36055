I came here on a Sunday with friends to watch football. We were impressed by the spacious back area and excellent Chicken and Waffles. The waitress was not overly attentive or personable throughout, but we did not expect great service during a football game. Our real issue came at the end of the experience - friends who had previously departed left money that we put in the bill along with 3 credit cards. There was seven $20 bills. When the server returned, the entire bill (except for $20) was split up on the 3 credit cards. I explained to her that there was $140 cash in the black book and she twice vehemently denied it saying we only put in $20 cash with the bill. We told her there were actually seven $20 bills and that we were disputing the charges to our credit cards. At that she walked away and we could see her discussing the situation with another server about 5 feet away at the micros station - after about a 10 minute dialogue she returned telling us that the other money had fallen on the floor when she took the bill and she just found it. While it was too loud to hear what they were saying, I saw the dialogue between her and the other server and at no point did I (or my companions) see either server reach down to the floor or look about the floor. Then, she spent another ten minutes amending the amount on our cards and when I looked at my bank statement I saw that she charged my card the new amount twice in addition to the old pending amount. Fortunately, only one of the 3 pending charges went through on my card but this was an absolutely ridiculous headache. All I can say is - if you go to this place, pay in cash and count it out in front of the server.
