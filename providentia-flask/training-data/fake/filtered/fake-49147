We stopped in Hartford on our way from Maine to DC.  We wandered in looking for food to take back to our hotel.  I cannot tell you how wonderful the staff was. We took a while to find something that our kids would want to eat (10 and 14) and the manager and hostess stood there and offered suggestions and offered to make anything they wanted.  They decided on cheeseburgers from the lunch menu (this was at dinnertime).  They talked to us about everything from our trip to what we saw, where we live in DC, how old the kids are, etc.  They told us it would be about 20 minutes for our food so they gave us complimentary water bottles so we could walk around Hartford while we waited.  When we got back, our food was ready and they threw in cheesy garlic bread and a huge bag of biscotti at no charge.  The food was excellent and I cannot say enough about the staff.  Supremely awesome!
