was at ippudo with a few friends this past weekend.  been here a few times already but never really thought about writing a review till now.  same ol' same ol' ... waited for almost two hours, ordered the pork buns and the akamaru modern and had my blood orange sorbet for dessert.  why do i always go back?  well obviously the food is pretty good but i guess i like the atmosphere here as well.  can't wait till their new location in hell's kitchen opens up ... maybe i should keep that to myself so the lines there won't be as terribly long as it is here   :)
