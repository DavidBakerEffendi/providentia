Holy prices are high, I'm not sure why. 10-15 for a glass of beer - I guess if you want to try different ones. Food is meh. Sliced ham and cheese wasn't much better than trader joes. Portions are small. They kept me waiting for an hour which happens, but it's still annoying. Bring cash, split a dish with friends, look around, and split.
