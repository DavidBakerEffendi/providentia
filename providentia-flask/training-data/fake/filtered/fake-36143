Had dinner there last night with my wife and daughter.  After being treated so rudely at Zorbas we gave the Blue Cat a try.  The evening was a total treat as we were treated so kindly by our waitress Brenda who was very professional personable and well informed.  The whole fish special was perfectly prepared and spiced as was the chicken special.  Although we were stuffed the rice pudding and ginger ice cream topped off a great experience.
