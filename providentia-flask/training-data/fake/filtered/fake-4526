1. They are friendly and speak English. 2. The food gets to you fast if you get delivery. 3. The food is delicious--personal favorites: Red Enchiladas Guacamole Burrito Cheese Gorditas Home-made salsas--the orange one rocks! 4. They are incredibly reasonable. I always try to convince my co-diners to order from Los Jalapenos and we haven't been disappointed yet.
