This place is incredibly good.  The food is delicious and the service cannot get any better.  I have gone to Roberto Cafe multiple times with my girlfriend and have never been disappointed.  It's BYOB and they do not have a corking fee.  Moreover, the first time I tried Roberto Cafe they had a lobster ravioli special with scallops, shrimp and mushrooms in a creamy vodka sauce.  It was fantastic.  Every single time I have returned to the restaurant it has not been on the menu; however, I always ask if they can make it for me and they never disappoint me.  Roberto Cafe is the type of restaurant that will bend over backwards to please the customer.  I get the vibe that the chef's take immense pride in their work to make fresh food for their guests, especially when the items they are preparing are not on the menu.  I cannot recommend this restaurant enough and I hope it stays in business for a very long time.
