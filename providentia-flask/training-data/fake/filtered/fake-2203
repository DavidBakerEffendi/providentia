The food was great..but the service was disgusting...the waitress with the blonde hair short in stature acted like she was doing us a favor by serving us. My friend's grits were cold and she huffed and puffed before she changed them......her attitude was deplorable.....We did not know about the cash only policy..so when when we inquired, she remarked very snidely that there is an atm next door-use it!.......My friend wrote her a nice note on the receipt stating that she should be nicer and instead of apologizing she started to talk about her hamstring problems...needless to say my friend took her tip back from the waitress and then the disgust vile creature said --"That's ok--we dont need patronage from customers like you"--We were all African American-----Clinton St. Baking Company will be hearing from my lawyers soon
