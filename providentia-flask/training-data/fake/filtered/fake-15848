This place is absolutely fantastic! There is seating inside and outside, but it was a little hot on my visit so we chose to eat inside. The restaurant is so spacious that for a moment I forgot where I was. We were seated immediately and the staff was quick and friendly. Food wise, it was pretty good. I ordered a club sandwich and honestly it was big enough for two! The complementary veg. was refreshing and different. THE CHEESECAKE OH MY GOD! Yes. Just order it, any flavor will do, they're all winners. Best cheesecake. Go get some right now!
