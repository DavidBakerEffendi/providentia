My husband and I tried Tortuga's back in June.  We are both big fans of Mexican, and we excited.  The ambiance was the only good part of everything.  The food was horrible.  I feel as if they didn't use any spices, garlic, or even cilantro (other reviewers will say the same thing).  Princeton has so many other wonderful restaurants, so it would be safe to skip this one.
