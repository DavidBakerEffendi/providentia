This place would be a 5, but for an unfortunate incident at the end of what was a delicious meal.  When we received the bill, we were charged an outrageous $4.50 for the extra cup of salsa I ordered.  To the waitress' credit, she mentioned the meal only came with one serving of salsa and I guess it's my bad for not asking how much the second bowl would cost (price is not on the menu).  When I complained, the manager said that the price reflected costs.  Really?  Is a cup of salsa worth 3 tamales (which sell for $1.50)?  Is it worth a beer?  I don't recall ever even being charged for extra salsa and I probably wouldn't have flinched at $1.50.  Is the extra $3 that important?  No.  But the idea of being ripped off irks me; also, the idea that the manager cared so little about my potential future business that he essentially said "Take it or leave it" to the price he made up and couldn't even note on the menu.  I don't think I'll go back.
