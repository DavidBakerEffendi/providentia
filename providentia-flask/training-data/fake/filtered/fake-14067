We went there once over the winter. It was okay, but at ten minutes to nine, the waiter practically kicked us out. We saw him do that to another couple and it was quite distressing. I guess open until nine on weekdays means get out before nine. So, we tried again this summer and went early so we wouldn't get kicked out. GET THIS! The waiter says he's made jello shots and asked if we would like to try them. We said, no but they sounded good. He brought four jello shots to the table and said he just wanted us to get the word out that they were good. So we tried them, thinking they were complimentary. OH NO. He charged us $3 each for them. $12 added to our tab. What a scam artist! Never again. If $12 is so important you would lose a $100 a meal customer over it, you're a fool. Never again, and I don't recommend this place to anyone!
