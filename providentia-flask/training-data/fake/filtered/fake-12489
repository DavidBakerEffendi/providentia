The food is one of the great examples of why I love to eat in New York. The food is delicious, fun and inexpensive. The restaurant is wildly popular for good reason, which sometimes causes the kitchen to be slammed. The food in New York is often a fun and flavorful mutation of a traditional cuisine. This is what Momofuku Ssam Bar is successfully delivering at a wonderful price point. Momofuku Ssam is one of those gems you recommend to friends visiting who are looking to have fun. You would be remiss if you never tried it. The food is not traditional Korean food. BTW I love traditional Korean food.
