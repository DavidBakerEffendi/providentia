This restaurant's atmosphere is chic and sophisticated yet comfortably casual-high ceilings, stone on some walls, white leather booths and a quite appealing display of beautiful fresh fish on ice.  Most importantly, the food is excellent. I would not describe it as Greek but rather high-end international cuisine prepared with very fresh tasty ingredients. The Red Snapper is the best ever- delicate and sweet- even for those who don't think they like fish.  The shrimp dish served with orzo in a mildly spicy red sauce is delicious as is the soft-shell Maryland crabs served in a garlic, oil, and herb sauce. Lemon potatoes, raw oysters, and panna cotta are superb. The service deserves an A+!  Looking forward to introducing Lithos to our friends.
