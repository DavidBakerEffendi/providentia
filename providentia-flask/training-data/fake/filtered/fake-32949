PRO: The dry rub on the ribs was delicious The waitress was really lovely and the chef came out to chat with us and asked for our feedback They take credit card CON: The serving size is small - meat lovers is not enough food for 2 people Prices are high for the amount of food. Food took a long time. Would have liked some corn bread or something before the food if they are going for an upscale vibe. Will be back to try other dishes but will be ready to spend more. Not cheap BBQ for the amount of food.
