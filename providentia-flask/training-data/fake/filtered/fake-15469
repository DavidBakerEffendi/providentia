Came in today to grab a quick bite for lunch. I only had about 30-45 minutes to eat, but the staff got me in and out in no time. Ordered the wrap of the day (pulled pork, cheddar cheese with cole slaw and fries) yum! Looks like they have a nice beer list, I'll definitely be back to check out the bar when I'm not on my lunch break...until next time!
