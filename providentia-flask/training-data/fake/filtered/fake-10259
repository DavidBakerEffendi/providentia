We were there recently, and the food was great.  Big portions for $9-10.  The service is a little slow, but that could be because they cook the food on the spot, and these dishes take time to cook. I had pastelillos de carne, chicken, and pork.  One of each for $5, for the three of them.  Very pleased with my experience.  The staff is very friendly and looking to please you, but if you want food asap, this place is not for you.
