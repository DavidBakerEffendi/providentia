It was a beautiful day and I met some friends for a late lunch. I have been there a few years ago and the fish smelled pretty bad so I wasn't impressed.  I thought I would give it another try. The food and service is still pretty bad. We sat at the bar. There is a nice sunny area outside to sit but you can not sit there unless your order is take out. Go figure. The view is beautiful and outside seating for take out is the best place to sit. Inside is dark and the decor is very outdated.  Drinks are very weak.
