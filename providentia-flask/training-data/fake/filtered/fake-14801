My husband and I and another couple had dinner at Centro Grille this past Saturday evening and had a delightful experience from beginning to end.  We were seated immediately and only a few minutes later, we were asked if we would like something to drink.  Our waitress knew all of the beers that were offered as well as the wine.  Our drinks were served in about five minutes.   My husband, who is very fussy about his food, ordered the grilled octopus. He thought it was delicious and while I am not big on octopus, I did taste it and I was surprised at how much I liked it.  I would actually order it myself next time.  My husband also ordered the baby back ribs, which were outstanding. It was an entire rack of ribs, which was enough for two people.  The other gentleman also had the ribs and also thought they were delicious.  Of course, I had to try them and will definitely order the ribs next time around.   I had the orchiette with sausage and broccoli rabe.  It was fabulous and also enough for two people.  My girlfriend had the chilean sea bass, which was a "special" and she loved it.   We were all very pleased with the full dining experience and look forward to dining there again.  As a matter of fact, we will be returning to Centro Grill with another couple and their two children this coming Saturday.   My only suggestion would be for Centro Grill to take reservations for any size party, particularly on Saturday evenings.  When customers have to wait for a table, it sets the tone for the entire evening and by the time they are seated, they are already annoyed and cranky.  We were lucky in that we didn't have to wait for a table and were seated right away.
