I'm a woman of a "certain age," and remember going to the Reading Terminal Market with my mother, when I was a young tween.  She would... all but... swear-by-it!  For her, it was the place to be on a Saturday morning.  She loved the meats, the Chubby's, the fish, and the variety of vendor's. Over the past year, I have been there several times, and I must say that, "I do not share my mother's affinity for it."  Although it's not bad, and you still have a variety of vendors, I'm not totally impressed.  But, I still enjoy the seafood restaurant.
