I am very disappointed in this place. It used to have the best pizza around. Last week I went and Had a glass of wine at the bar and put in an order for a pizza to go. 45 minutes later I had to grab a waiter to check on my order and he brought my luke warm pizza to me. Also it did not taste the same. I was there about a month ago and tried to get a table and there were people milling around waiting and finally one of the "customers" told us we had to sign a sheet a paper to be on the waiting list for a table. We walked right out. There is no organization there.
