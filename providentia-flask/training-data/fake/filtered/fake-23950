It's easy to miss this new Â restaurant located in a busy street where there are several other Indian restaurants. I live in the area and consider myself very picky when it comes to Indian food. The quality of the food served in some of the other Indian restaurants in the area is average at best. Talk of the town excels in everything they serve. Food is tasty, authentic and rightly spiced with an emphasis on cleanliness. Tried their Parathas, Kati rolls, chana batura and the thalis over a period of last three months. Was never disappointed. Highly recommended if you are looking for real Indian food. I am sure you will be a repeat customer.
