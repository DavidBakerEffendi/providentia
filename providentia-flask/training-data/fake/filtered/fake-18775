I ate here about 2x a month here in 2012. Loved this place. I usually got #32 vermicelli with beef, and egg rolls. Great dish for $6.95 Have not gone much in 2013 but had the pad Thai a few weeks ago. Nasty, not really pad Thai and expensive something like $15.00. I'll never get that from here again. Yesterday I ordered my favorite take out lunch #32 I have had over 20 times. Man who spoke little English took my order. I guess the mean woman owner was out. So I get there expecting to pay 6.95 and WTF he says $12.70. I say must be wrong so I look at the menu and yup it's $11.95. I ask for a copy and he won't give me one. To top it off I got the wrong dish. It's #37 which is similar ingredients but "make your own spring roll". I was already home with it and hungry so I just ate it. I will never go here again. Mostly because the OUTRAGEOUS price increases. Note that the menu posted online is the old one not the overpriced one they won't let you have.
