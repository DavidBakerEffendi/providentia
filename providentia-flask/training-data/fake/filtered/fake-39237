New restaurant open in West Caldwell, Called Gennaro's Cucina, I thought we would give it a try. What an amazing find, the food was spectacular. I had broccoli Rabe with sausage as an appetizer Chicken Sorrento for dinner. My wife had eggplant rollantini & Filet of Sole Francese. My kids shared a Grandma's Pizza that was spectacular.Best food we've had in a while. We couldn't believe how inexpensive, what a great value.
