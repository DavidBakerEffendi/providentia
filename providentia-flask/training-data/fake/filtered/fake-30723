I've gotten take out slices a lot and they are great!  But my first dining in the actual restaurant was not OK.  It doesn't even matter what the food was like, there was a waitress there hacking her lungs out all over the place.  She wasn't even our waitress but I had to go home and take airbourne and Nyquil just in case.  There was nothing else I could think about but germs, so maybe the food was good?
