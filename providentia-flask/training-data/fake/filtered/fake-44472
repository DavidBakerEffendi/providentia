This is an awesome place - a cool, cozy little place right in WeHa Center. I've only eaten a few times here, but everything I've tried here has been great! My favorite thing is the bar setup they have, which is lit in a cool blue. Every time I've come here I sit at the bar, even if I'm having a meal. The staff here is really friendly. If you ever chat up the bartenders they're actually pretty entertaining and they really seem to enjoy themselves here. Oh, and their signature martinis? Awesome! They even have a few Asian beers available, which are surprisingly good. Another reason I really like this place is they can improvise - everything is made to order, so they can adjust your meal to your liking. For fans of Thai food, definitely check this out!
