Awfully pleasant brunch today.  Server the best one we have encountered over the last several days.  Service attentive and unobtrusive. Bread basket would suit me for the meal. Frites terrific.  Salami sandwich lovely although I picked out the onions which I cannot eat and had to ask for the mustard.  Bagette impeccable.  Other egg selections very nice.  Eggs Benedict dead on, as were the omelets.  Tarte Tatin the low note.  Way too sweet, but nicely baked. Noisy but so reliable.
