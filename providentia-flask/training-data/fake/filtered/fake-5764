The place is very small with barely anyplace to sit. The food selection is sparse. The scone was okay, but was not bursting with flavor like I had expected. The coffee is delicious though and the baristas are nice, which makes this place get another star.The atmosphere is chill. It's great to have a place you would expect to see in Brooklyn or the village right here in midtown.
