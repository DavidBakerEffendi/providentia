Hands down, one of the best sandwiches I have ever had.  The Cubano sandwich is everything a sandwich should be: salty, crunchy, rich, gooey, and flavorful.  I went here with my professor from Syracuse University and her son.  Best choice I made all day.  Unbelievably delicious.  You haven't lived until you have eaten this sandwich.  Absolutely dynamite, unforgettable.  Must go again.
