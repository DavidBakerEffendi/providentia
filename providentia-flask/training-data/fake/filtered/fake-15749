Food was below par that I have experienced in an Italian restaurant in the area. I had Veal Parm over pasta (Pasta wasn't cooked, very al dente, veal was tender but mozzarella burnt on top, sauce was watery) Service was also ok, had to ask the waitress twice for things more than once. The pizza is the best thing there.
