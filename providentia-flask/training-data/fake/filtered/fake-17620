Great authentic Japanese Izakaya in midtown. I recommend their crab cream croquet. Cream croquets from other places are usually filled with too much cream and not enough crab, but their croquet has a lot of crab meat, so it's very flavorable. Reservation is a must because it's always busy at night.
