Though tucked in the nook of a small alley, Freemans is by no means off the beaten path. The wait can be pretty lengthy, since its walk-ins only. I adored the rustic interiors, and the food as well. The menu fits onto one page, but there's enough variety to make the options seem more plentiful than they are. I had the skillet eggs, bacon, spinach and gruyere with sourdough bread. I love anything that comes out on a hot skillet because all the smells become more pronounced and inviting. The bacon added just enough saltiness to the dish, and the amount of gruyere was just right (I hate overdoses of melted cheese). I wouldn't say my dish was particularly memorable, but I enjoyed it.
