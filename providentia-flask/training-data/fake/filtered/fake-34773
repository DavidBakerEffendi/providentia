This review is based on my experience on a Saturday night at the bar... The interior was clean, albeit a bit crowded.  I was there for a birthday party and ordered a few rounds of drinks.  A good portion of the mixed drinks that I ordered were either diluted with flat soft drinks or were outright watered-down. It was hot as hell in there and the air-conditioning did not even seem to be running. Whatever, that was the least of my concerns.  I chose not to keep a tab open at the bar, rather opting to pay my tab in full after each order.  What I did not realize was that I was being slapped on with a 20% gratuity on every order I made.  Seriously?  Additionally, I tipped the bartenders in cash on top of this 20% fee that I was not made aware of.  That is just straight up sleazy.  What kind of bs policy is that? If it wasn't for the fact that 2/3 bartenders there were quite friendly that night, I would have given this place a 1 star review.  Congratulations on the extra $70 or so you swindled me out of. This place is a one and done visit for sure! TL;DR: Diluted drinks, very hot/no A/C, slapped on a 20% "gratuity" to ever order I placed without notifying me, continued to accept my cash tips = GTFOH!
