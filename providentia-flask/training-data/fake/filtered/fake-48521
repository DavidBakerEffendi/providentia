Pat's is the TRUE King of Steaks in Philly.  BAR NONE. The taste of a Pat's Steak is everything you want in a South Philly cheesesteak.  Quality products from bread to meat to cheese... Pat's delivers.   Also, if you're a fan of peppers... or want to try to go out on the edge once or twice... try their cherry peppers on your steak sandwich.  You can have as many or as little as you want and you will NOT be disappointed! Let's face it, though.  Lots of folks complain about the price.  I just tell those complainers, "You get what you pay for."  While a Pat's sandwich may be just a little more than the other guys... they deliver in quality.  Why settle for less if you're going to treat yourself to a cheesesteak? And those guys across the street with their flashy signs, their bright colors, and their PacMan video games (well.... i don't think they have pac man...) THEY DON'T COME CLOSE.   I haven't lived in Philadelphia since I was a kid.  Yet I will literally go back over the bridge JUST to have a Pat's steak.  If the line wraps around the building, FEAR NOT!  The service is quick and the wait is well worth it! Going to Pat's reminds me of my grandfather.  He used to take me there all the time when I was a wee cheesesteak lover.  Make visiting Pat's a tradition in your family and your kin will NOT be disappointed!
