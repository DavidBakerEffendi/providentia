I have visited this restaurant for the 2nd time today and I do not have enough space to say enough good about this establishment.  The food, the presentation, the staff, the view,..... it is so  well blended!!!  Noel Jones put this creation of quality eats, wine, and atmosphere together with a great staff to make a great place to enjoy not just the best that Hartford has to offer, but Connecticut itself.  The view of the Connecticut river, and on a crisp, clear January afternoon, you can see all the way to Meriden from the main dining room!!! It is a special dining experience, of fine wine and fine food.  I am encouraging  everyone to visit Restaurant On 20.  You will be back for seconds!!!  Guaranteed!!!
