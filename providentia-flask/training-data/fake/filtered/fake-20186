Food is great. Nothing more and nothing less. I do like to hear the selection of their music since the Album, "The Boy with the Arab Strap" by Belle and Sebastian Â is displayed near the record player by the bar. Overall the interior of this place is fascinating, makes me feel like a Parisian of the Maghreb!
