Breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, drinks...whatever I want, they have and its amazing. Jean, you are a brilliant chef and you can do no wrong. This concept is stellar, and as a huge fan of the store, I was so happy when they opened the eatery. Now I can shop and eat, and feel happy all day. The french toast is like nothing Ive ever experienced, the drinks are hit or miss but are fantastic if you get lucky, the donut is NOT worth $10 but the jam...oh the jam, i would give my right arm for the jam. It broke my heart when I had to move, because honestly ABC is what I miss most. Dont take it for granted. It may seem pretentious at times, but just go to eat the food, not the people...mmkay.
