This place is Awesome.  The space is huge and it is a great place to kick back and relax after work or before heading to see a show.  The cocktails are always good and well priced.  And the service is great, the bartenders are always very attentive!  I have only had the chance to eat here once and that was really good as well.  I definitely will be going back again soon!
