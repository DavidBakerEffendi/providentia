This was my first ramen experience ever. Â I have never got a chance to indulges in the yummy noodles and the broth which people talk about so much. Finally, when I decided to give it a shot what can be better than IPPUDO. I visited the place along with a friend who knew exactly what he wanted and I was left wondering how to pronounce most of the words on menu. We started off with Pork Buns and hands down the yummiest appetizer I have ever tasted. I had two of them and trust me when I say I had a wild thought of making it a full course meal. I ordered the MISO RAMEN and it surprised me beyond belief. It was the perfect broth and perfect noodles ever. My friends ordered the AKAMARU MODERN and I felt it topped the MISO RAMEN. The PLUM WINE perfectly complimented out food. This is a place which should be visited at least once. All in all, best ramen experience.
