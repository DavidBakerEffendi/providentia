Had lunch here today.  Was impressed with the friendliness of the staff. The menu had a good variety of dishes.  The turkey soup was delicious and nice and hot. I also had a great salad and flan for dessert. The flan was incredible. They have a large parking lot and the restuarant is easy to find. I will definitely go there again and bring friends. There is an English translation of the dishes on the menu!
