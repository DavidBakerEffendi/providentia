They are GrEaT!!!!! I eat there for lunch whenever I get a chance. There is so many good choices, from the desserts, to the pizza, to the sandwiches. It's price is higher than most , but the quality is much better than any other places around. I usually go in for a slice, and come out with a cannoli, pastry, garlic ball, and a side of pasta. It's worth it.
