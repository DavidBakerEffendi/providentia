Yerba Buena has been like a home to us...  It is great when you get somewhere and you feel welcome. we love the ambience, the staff, the food is fantastic, every time we get there they treat us like family and that's something you won't  get everywhere in NYC.  After all this time going to Yerba Buena we decided to toast with them to celebrate our recent wedding. We are thankful because Giovanni, Mario and all the staff made this dream possible.  We are so happy we could celebrate with our Yerba Buena Family. As usual the food, drinks and service were outstanding!!! ....  and then we Thought why would you toast with champagne if you can start your life together with a POQUITO PICANTE!!!   The best drink we've ever had. So we decided to share and start our union with a little bit of spice in our lives!! Sheers to our favorite place!!! Lety
