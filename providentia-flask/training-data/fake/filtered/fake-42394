This Restaurant recently opened on Burnside Avenue. I saw the name " Tasty Ethnic Foods" and decided to go check it out. Most of the Cuisine was West African. Very nice food I must say. Price was reasonable. I ordered $10 worth of one of their specialties Waakye. Â  This is essentially rice and beans with sauce added. Nice juicy meat added also. I will definitely be checking them out again.
