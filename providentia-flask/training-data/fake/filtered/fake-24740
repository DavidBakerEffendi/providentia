I wouldn't give this place 5 stars, but still a great place to eat. Service was extremely friendly, music was on point, and you can get most of the things on the menu and like it. Personally, I am a steak guy, and the short rib was excellent. If you are one of those people who like to share and hate only eating from one plate, this is undoubtedly the place for you. Recommend to most.
