Had dinner last night - made a reservation and we arrived a little early and waited just a few minutes and we were seated. David showed us to our table upstairs and we loved it. Ariel was our waiter and was very attentive - explained the the specials and favorite dishes in the restaurant. We both had the Squid and black ink pasta with mussels, clams, squid & scallops. It was delicious! We had the soup of the day - also outstanding. The wine list is very extensive. All the wait staff was great to us - they had several large parties yet we were never left without someone making sure we were ok. We were post theater and just wanted a leisurely meal experience and had exactly that. Oh - the deserts - my husband had a canolli and I had fresh berries and creme. They were outstanding - felt the canolli was one of the best I've ever tasted. Prices were more than reasonable especially for NY. next trip to NY - we will return. Loved Trattoria Trecolori!
