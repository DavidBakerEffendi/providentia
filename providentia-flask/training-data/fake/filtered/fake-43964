I went to have dinner with my friends last night and I was really impressed. At first, I was a little bit confused due to the complex menu but then I found out that it is a "cocina de author" restaurant. The waitress was very helpful explaining the menu for us. As an appetizer, we had the black ant guacamole and we were very surprised when we realized that the salt used was made of real ants but it was really good. I had the crispy duck dumplings and they were exquisite along with the mayan god remedy cocktail which was a little bit sweet but tasted so good!! (this was recommended by the waitress) she was so right! The music was a little bit loud and the lights were dark but maybe it's part of the restaurant's concept. Two of my friends ordered the short ribs and they were delighted. For dessert we got to share the churros and the special dessert of the night that it was a winter sundae which was a pumpkin and chongos ice-cream with brownie at the bottom. We finished it all with the desire of coming back soon. I highly recommend Black Ant Mexican Restaurant!!
