We are big fans of this popular spot in Princeton, a town that should have more good restaurants than it does. Owned by the same man that owns Nassau St. Seafood, a retail operation, the food here is first rate. Though the preparations tend toward the simpler side, the fish is always very fresh and impeccably prepared. I don't think I've ever had an overcooked piece of fish here. Some of the selections can be pricey, but you can always order their incredible $22 Etouffee or Bouillabaisse (when they offer it). The salads, appys and raw bar selections are also fantastic. Cheers.
