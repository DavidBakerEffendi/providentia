Disappointing to say the least! Such a shame that this is on our doorstep the space has so much potential but unfortunately the fetfazes family have no idea how to use it. The food is overpriced and took forever to reach our table,  also don't make any special requests as "Chef Eric " does not seem to like it  (remember you have an open kitchen and your customers can see your reaction !) when the food arrived it was bland , over cooked and just like the other reviews said comparable to Applebee's ! The service was ok, despite the servers looking miserable and obviously counting down till home time! All in all save your money and stroll around the corner to growlers everything the Barrel house wishes it could be!
