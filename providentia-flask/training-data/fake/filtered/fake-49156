Had dinner reservations for Saturday night for 6pm so we could make it to see Jersey Boys for 8pm at the Bushnell. Unfortunately our reservation wasn't ready and would be about 25min. The Manager quickly came over and apologized. He also set us up at the bar with a free drink and two apps. Around 6:30 we were seated and the food was awesome as well as the service. We were able to eat and make it to the Bushnell on time. The location was perfect and the staff very nice. I also received a call from the Manager the next day apologizing once again about the delay with my reservation. I would highly recommend this restaurant to everyone for its great service and great food!!
