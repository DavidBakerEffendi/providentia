This place is wonderful. The food is tasty. My favorite were the Fish Tacos and the shrimp tacos are to die for. It's a must. Best margaritas I've had in a long time. Try the Tamarin one it will blow you away. And the cherry on top to my and my friend's experience were the two super friendly bartenders- Kike and Orlando. Â You definitely want to go.Take it from a Chicana that grew up in LA and visits Mexico every year and knows Mexican food! Two thumbs up!!!!!
