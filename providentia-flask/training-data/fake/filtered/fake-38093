After a great happy hour here enjoying the drunken hummus and a beer, we ventured back a few hours later for another drink. The doorman and hostess were very friendly but the problems started when we got to the bar. After making sure we didn't steal his friend's seats an ignoring us for 5 minutes, he finally asked us what we wanted. He indignantly questioned every order we made and when we asked one question about a particular type of beer he responded curtly "it's a beer." We changed our mind and ordered another beer to which he became instantly offended and asked why we were being snippy. He stared at us demanding an answer at which point we walked out. This place a great vibe but stay away from the dick with the nose ring behind the bar.
