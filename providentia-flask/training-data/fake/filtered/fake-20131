Went for brunch and the food was great and reasonably priced.  The coffee wasn't wonderful, but it wasn't terrible either (I guess you don't really go to a wine bar for the coffee either - the wine selection looked great). The eggs with smoked salmon were fabulous (only $10).  My friend and I split a fresh fruit salad that was nothing special, but we also had a raisin scone that was wonderful.   The seating inside is a little cramped, especially if you're not interested in sitting at the bar.  The staff was very friendly and we had great service. I would definitely come back to this place for any meal.
