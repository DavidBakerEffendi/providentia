I've known the owner of this business for years and I am writing this review not to just give a 5 star review but because the food is actually delicious, Nir knows how to decorate a dish and make it look like a masterpiece, his style of cooking originates from the Middle East and as a native I can swear that his cooking is as close as you can get to an authentic main course meal. Yes I must admit the service and wait staff can use a little work, but considering how busy they get it's understandable why the service is a little slow. My suggestion is to come in during the slower times to enjoy a quiet and delicious meal.
