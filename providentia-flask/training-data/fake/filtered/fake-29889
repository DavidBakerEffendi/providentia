Lots of food variety that you don't know what to pick. Kare-kare, beef soup sisig, pork bicol express and turon.  Crabs were big but you need to use your hands to eat them.  My son had bistec and adobo.  Dessert consist of leche flan, ube halaya, biko, peaches and turon.  None of the dessert is that good. If you are craving for Filipino food just to have a taste, go for this.  But if you are looking for good tasting Filipino food, this is not the best you can taste.  There are more better places to go. Buffet is $12 per person while kids are half price.
