Well, I've finally had the chance to check out The Spot.  Having lived on the West Coast for a time, I was excited to try out their breakfast burritos.  My first experience with them wasn't bad at all.  I ordered takeout on their website, got the food with no fuss.  I had ordered the Tsunami, which reminded me of San Diego, so I was pretty happy.  A week later, I convinced my wife to have Sunday breakfast there, along with our 10 month old daughter.      We took a table outside and the hostess brought us a high chair.  It started out well, but from there it was mostly downhill.  The waitress we got could not have been less interested in actually taking our order, serving us food, or being nice in any way.  It took forever just to place our order, let alone get our food.  But you know what, that's ok, I'm a grown up, I can be patient.  You know who can't be patient?  A 10 month old.  So when I ordered a cup of fruit so I could feed the baby, and ASK for it to come out as soon as possible, I thought maybe that's what I would get.  However, they didn't bother with that until the rest of the food came out.  Not that I could have asked her where the fruit was, because our waitress went MIA for the interim.      When the food did come, it was alright.  My burrito was good, I had the Ole this time, but my wife ordered what were possibly the most boring pancakes I've ever seen.  When we asked for a small plate to put the fruit on for our daughter, we were ignored.  We had to keep asking for things to get them and at the end of the meal I had to go back inside just to get the check.     It's too bad.  I've heard good things.  Their burritos were good and I've heard good things about the fish tacos.  I saw another waiter who I think may have been the owner.  That table was getting good service.  However, if you expect even the bare minimum from the waitress that I got, you'll be disappointed.
