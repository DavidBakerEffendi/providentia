Again, you have to understand how to order at this diner. This is a Greek-owned place. Order the Greek specials. Also, all the desserts are made in-house, and the chocolate cheesecake is to die for. TO DIE FOR. The fries...add cheese and gravy, and you're in for a heavenly experience. It's open 24 hours, the staff is awesome, and it's great for people-watching.
