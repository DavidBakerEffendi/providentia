Amazing wine collection, was very excited when I saw this, however the service was less than informative (kitchen closes at 8:30pm sharp, bar closes a short time after that), and I think it is really poor service not to inform of this, particularly when arriving in decent enough time at 8:15 for a flight that was initially meant to leave at 9:50. To me, opening hours should correspond to flight times, and that goes for providing food until a reasonable hour. Very disappointing, although I'm not sure it'll make much difference even voicing this as I got the impression that as there is no other choice in this departure area, customers will most likely have to put up with this lack of care and attention.
