I love Moshulu (when I say the name right)! I really like the atmosphere and am very glad this is the place my husband took me when we first met. Even though they got our orders wrong in 2006, we go back every year for our anniversary and it gets more wonderful each time. I wish it wasn't so expensive but the food is absolutely amazing! I do like the service, very attentive, but as someone else wrote, sometimes a little too attentive. I did use the Groupon last year which was great but while wanting one now and looking for one, I can't find one :(. Â It is well worth the dress up and trip back into the city for this girl.
