This restaurant could have a better outcome. They have a good concept on the name, decor and menu. I was really intrigue looking at their menu, definitely stand out from other places along 30th ave. We had the chicken&eggo and breakfast burrito. I was surprised when the waffle came out it was actually came from eggo, It could have been a fresh waffle and it will became a great dish.  You can taste the frozen waffle is tough and dry, The presentation though was an innovative one, too bad it doesn't deliver enough. The burrito was delicious and on the large size for the hungry ones. For service I have to give a thumb down. When a customer entering a restaurant/diner, someone need to greet them right away. I witness a group coming in and hv to wait for a minute until someone actually looking at the front door. (sorry a minute is way too long for waitress to acknowledge your present). We also served by our lady waitress, which in my opinion should hv check back after food is arrived if we need anything else, but no action was done. At the end of the meal when she deliver the check she had forgotten our to go food. We had also forgotten about it and realized until we got home. But it should hv been the waitress to remember when she drop the check.   Overall it should be the restaurant effort on improving the service, not single out the waiter. Obviously she didn't get enough training on basic wait staffing. I will give a second try to come back.
