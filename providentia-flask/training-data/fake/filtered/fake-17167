This is our Favorite Steakhouse in CT. The best steaks I have ever had. Huge portions, we both like ours medium RARE. You can even pick out your own steak upon entering, but we let them choose and have never been disappointed. We started splitting a meal because of the potion size and when you order your type of steak it comes with 2 sides. I always get the cup of chili which is Fantastic, tender high quality sirloin? and lots of beans, onions & cheese. He gets the loaded baked potato (huge) with bacon, sour cream & cheese. This meal is more than enough for 2 people.        It is always super crowded, even on weeknites and you will often be asked to wait 15mins or more, but it is truly worth it because the food, all of the food is super FRESH and very high quality. The blooming onion  appetizer with dipping sauce is also Enormous and will ruin your appetite, I would only have that with drinks next time!    The service is exceptional, as these young' adults have all obviously been trained on customer service and professionalism! They are very cheerful, ask if you have eaten there b4 and if you are not at all happy with something there is no attitude or argument, they will even take it off your bill or give you a bunch of coupons for the next meal, as happened to us when our steak was accidentally cooked more than we prefer. It is' very loud in there, (but we like it!) country music blasting constantly and lots of happy customers crowded inside and waiting to get in! It is also a wonderful place to take your children as they also have a childs menu and the atmosphere is very hospitable to kids... they love the decor and the happy attitudes of the staff.       I took my parents and my neices and nephews, (16,10 & 6)  there and the kids loved the food. My mom got the fried fish and she also was pleased. I recommend this place for down to earth folks who want to be surrounded by happy patrons in a FUN atmosphere! It's like a big party.
