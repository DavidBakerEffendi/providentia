Was a every other day costumer there for over 6 months, they have great drinks for the price, other then the restaurant cramming you in there like rats everything seemed to be okay., they really could put less tables so costumers could eat and drink more comfortably I had about enough when a women spilled her drink down my leg of course my other half n I promptly paid and left everything there heated because of what just happened Â showed up 4 months later figuring they would comp us a free drink or appetizer they refused to they also lied about using MSG in there foods they prepare. Definitely will never go there again. These people have NO moral compass and NO business ethics whatsoever.
