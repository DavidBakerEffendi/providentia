Appalling service, so-so food. Avoid this place! We went here on a Sunday morning to watch soccer and enjoy a nice meal. The lower level was packed so we sat in the bar on the main floor. We had to ask twice just to get menus, and the waitress said they didn't have enough for everyone. She finally took our drink orders, then told us that it would take a while for coffee, since apparently they only had one pot and it took a long time to brew. She finally came back about 10 minutes later to take our orders. Then we waited. And waited. And waited. After about half and hour she brought us a plate of bread and butter. Then nothing. Coffee refills? Non-existent. One of the waitresses finally went to the local Dunkin Donuts and came back with a box of coffee and proudly walked around the pub filling cups. Â  Still no food. Another small plate of bread was shoved onto our table about an hour after we ordered our food. We finally asked if they could estimate when our food would arrive, since the game was nearly finished. "They'll bring it out when it's ready." was the response. The food finally appeared on the table, one plate at a time, two minutes before the game ended, about an hour and a quarter after we'd placed the order. We didn't order anything complicated, just eggs, bread (not toasted) and pancakes. When we finished eating we had to ask them twice for the check. Did they offer an apology for the poor service? Of course not! Never, ever again. There's no excuse for a pub like this.
