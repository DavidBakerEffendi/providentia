I love Cajun food so I'm a little impartial.  This place has excellent food over all.  My only complaint is that they sometimes under staff the waiters and this will slow down orders.   It's not that the wait staff is not good it is that there are too few waiters and waitresses sometimes.  Besides that its a great place.  My favorite last time I went was the Creole French Onion Soup.  Delicious!!
