Me and My Wife went to Spot Light because we had a Groupon, The Movie was great. Theater was clean and we were out early enough to get some food at the Bistro. They were having a trivia night. It was a lot of fun to have something to do besides watch TV while we ate. The food was delicious and the drinks were reasonably priced. Trivia was fun like a game show, the host was energetic and engaging, they even handed out prizes for each round that teams won. We had a great Friday Date Night at Spotlight. We will be back on a Saturday to see if the Karaoke night is just as much fun as the Trivia.
