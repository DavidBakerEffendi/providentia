My husband and I visited this restaurant for the first time Sunday night around 6:30. I heard about it from co-workers and decided to try it out. We were amazed at how busy the place was, people coming and going constantly. Busy or not, waiting for the waitress to pay attention to our table is one way of keeping me from visiting the establishment again any time soon. The food was actually very good, and the wine that we chose was actually very good as well, we had the Menage et trois Red and White. We ended up paying our tab, with no bill to look at, because we did not want to have to wait for the waitress to make another appearance at our table. We actually paid her very well for not having very good wait service.
