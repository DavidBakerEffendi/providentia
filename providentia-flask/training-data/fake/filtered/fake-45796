Max Fish has the freshest, most amazing raw clams around!  The service is always good even though they're pretty consistently packed.  The macadamian encrusted bass with coconut milk and lemongrass was absolutely fabulous!  My husband wished they had had a stuffed fish (he didn't want the lobster) so that was a little disappointing.  He had the fish and chips and said it was very good but that was not the kind of food we went there for. The desert (a key lime tart) really wasn't up to Max's standards and we were very disappointed with that.  We had had a coconut custard pie last year that rocked our world.  We wish Max Fish would add some lighter deserts.  (The homemade pie this time was chocolate peanut-butter - WAY too rich for us!) All in all, we had an excellent meal.  Mine was exactly what I wanted, though my husband would have preferred some additional options.
