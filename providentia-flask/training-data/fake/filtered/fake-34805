BURNT - After seated it took a long time to get the pizza and when we did the pizza was very burnt, when I told the waiter he didn't seem to care. It was so bad my very hungry kids couldn't eat it. They still charged us $15 each for these 2 very small pizza. Everyone was upset, I will never go back. Great idea but no quality control or care.
