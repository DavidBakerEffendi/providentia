This is THE MOST AUTHENTIC Cantonese-Style Noodle, Congee...etc. restaurant in ALL of Manhattan.  The atmosphere is relaxing, the service is beyond belief, and the food is just simply AMAZING.  The food has the highest quality ingredients and the freshest choice of meat, seafood, and vegetables.  This place is inexpensive when compared to other restaurants in the city considering what you get for your money.  For example, the noodle soup is ONLY $4.75 with JUMBO FRESH shrimp in the wonton and dumpling.  I highly recommend you to try this place out and judge for yourself whether you think this is worth it or not.  My family and friends loved the food!!!
