I ordered the chorizo tacos and guacamole with tortillas, there were not nearly enough chips for the dip and they were soggy! Also the prices that were on their menu from the Internet does match the menu prices from the restaurant. The prices have jumped and I was not told this when ordering, so to my surprise I had a pretty high bill and they were not honoring to the prices set on the Internet. The food over all was OK I may not have enjoyed it much because I was pretty upset with the way business was carried out! The delivery boy pretty much snatched the money and ran! LOL Which I thought was funny maybe he thought I was not going to pay, but it did run across my mind to send the food back!!
