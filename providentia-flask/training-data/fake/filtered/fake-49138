In Hartford for a business meeting and Salute was suggested.  What a great Idea!  Classy with out being too formal.  Large glass of wine, delicious house Sauvignon Blanc, and the salmon.  Maybe the best I have ever had.  Generous portion without being too large, and just superbly done.   Moist and hot with a scrumptious sauce.  I could have been satisfied with the potato lasagna side alone. Honestly, I don't stuff myself too often, but we had to try one dessert.  Lemon Italian cake.  Very good.  I would come back here without any question. Cheers to Jimmy the fantastic friendly owner!
