I am officially a Pizza Brain fan. The chief reason I am truly impressed is because of the staff. They are friendly, helpful, obviously care about customer satisfaction, and seem to love their jobs. I went on a Friday night, and it was quite busy, but the staff and owner made sure my order was taken care of as quickly as possible. In any case, I Â wasn't worried about waiting a little bit for my pie because there is a lot of fun stuff to look at (Pizza Hut Barbie is underfoot, literally). Not only is the atmosphere great, but the pizza is fabulous. It is incredibly nice to have a really good vegan pizza option close to home. I am ecstatic that Pizza Brain has opened and is just a quick walk away. I will be returning.
