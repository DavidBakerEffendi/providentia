On 12/23 I took my family to this retaurant before going to a show. Everything started out great. We ordered appetizers that came out in a reasonable amount of time and were very good. After that everything went down hill fast. The main courses came out next. All dishes were room temperature at best. My son ordered one of their veal dishes and they gave him Rigatoni instead. After a little arguing they finally agreed to make what he ordered. We all now waited for his food to come out. By the time it did all of our food went from room temperature to cold. I ordered a full portion of Fettuccini Alfredo which I was going to share with my son. The full portion would fill a small salad plate. My daughter's Squid Inked pasta was mush, over over cooked. The waiter kept banging hard into my seat every time he would walk by without an excuse me or apology. The staff made no attempt to apologize for the poor service and the poor quality of food. They must have recognized their screw ups however because on a party of 5 where the tip is never figured in they made a point to give themselves 20%. I did not make a big issue of our poor dining experience out of fear we would miss our show. I will definitely not go back.
