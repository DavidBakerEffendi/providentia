After my previous poor review and Email to Marsilios, I received an apology from the owner and an offer for a gift certificate for the full price of our meal in an effort to get me to try Marsillios again.  I felt that the offer was sincere and agreed to give Marsillios another try.  The offer was made back in June of 2013.  It is now March of 2014 and guess what...NO GIFT CERTIFICATE.  Why would Marsillios make an offer like that if they had no intention of following through?  Oh well...I guess things haven't changed after all...
