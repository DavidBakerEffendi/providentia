Amazing. Came here on a double date for my best friends birthdays and though it was a little tricky to find, once we did all of long journey was forgotten. We sat outside and we were immediately attended to, our waiter gave us great drink selections which accomdated us perfectly. Though the selction of food isnt vast the quality is unbelievable. I ordered the pernil andthe serving is so big and had enough to take home for seconds. Everything is on point here, the service, ambiance, food and drinks. Will definitely be back soon
