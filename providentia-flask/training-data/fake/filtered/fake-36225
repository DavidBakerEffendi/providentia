I don't get it.  This place is always packed, so I finally decided to go.  A friend and I had dinner here one evening.  The menu was very limited and the food was a bit of a let down.  The food was fine, but nothing special and it was way overpriced for what it was.  I suppose the location is what causes it to be so popular?  I want to try having brunch here because that seems to be what reviewers are raving about, but I won't be popping in here for dinner again anytime soon.
