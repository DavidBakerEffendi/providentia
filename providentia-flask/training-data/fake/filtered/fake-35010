Pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food.  Goat cheese in the appetizer, flatiron steak, beet tartare., Lancaster chicken all Superb.  Great service (Daryl was our waiter). Window table for two in the dining room was excellent location  Plan to come back soon with friends.   Good wine selection
