I went to Jojo's wed night with 3 other people.. Their food is great! I have always been a fan of jojos and have reccomended jojos to others.. Not anymore.. they have some of the worst waitresses ive ever had serve me there! Nancy is the on in particular i am talking about.. HORRIBLE!!! and she is an owners sister!She was rude never asked us if everything was ok and never asked us if we wanted another drink.. and when i asked for one she said ok but you guys will have to find another place to sit after this i have people coming in at 830 and they want this table.. WOW!! there were other free tables.. we were paying customers.. My gf asked for a beer and she said no we had to move..  MY gf by the was has been a waitess for over 18 years!  we saw extra tables and asked why we had to move.. she said well i can seat you at another table.. but that was after the fact of her asking or no telling us to move.. My gf said shes never seen anything like this.. if she had asked us prior and said hey i have people who like this table c do you mind moving over here we would have moved.. but she didnt.. she said Im sorry but i have to take care of them they come in every night and take care of me! wow.. what a horrible experience we had.. NEVER ever will i go there again.. Ive told several people and they know all about NANCY!!!! shes bad for business..and several people said before i even told them who.. oh yeah the older women there are horrible!!! oh well..!! Delorenzos on Hudson is where i will go.. great food great people there too!!!
