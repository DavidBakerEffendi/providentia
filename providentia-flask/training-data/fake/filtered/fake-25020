My friends and I just happened upon this place and it was just one of those miracles that happen every once and a while. The place is really small and has a re-fabed industrial feel, with very intelligent seating for the size it is. The food is incredibly well priced, and our server was knowledgeable, patient (with a group of 6 like us), and caring. All of the food I ate there was excellent, but I have to say that their Tofu Salad is one of the best salads I've ever had! The tofu is pressed so well that it feels like cream cheese in your mouth... and coupled with the beautiful avocado slices, fresh sprouts, and housemade dressing, it tastes like heaven. No joke. The presentation of everything was so beautiful. I would expect that from a $14 dollar dish, but a $6 dollar dish? That's just nice! The vegetarian selection is very very good, and the service is pretty fast. Can't wait to try it all
