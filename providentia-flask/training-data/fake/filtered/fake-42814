Okay if you're looking for good Malaysian restaurant at a great price and delicious food then this is a GREAT place. I come here at least once a month with my boyfriend and everytime we go, it's always good. The service is not the best but the food makes up for it. The food I recommend is: 1. Roti Canai - Flaky and chewy pancake with chicken and potato in curry sauce Â  2. Beef/chicken Curry over Rice 3. Pineapple Fried Rice Those are my favorite and top 3, I always order those, and it's absolutely delicious and will get you full if not, satisfied. So far this is the best Malaysian restaurant I've been to, for now. I hope for all you first timer there enjoy their food!
