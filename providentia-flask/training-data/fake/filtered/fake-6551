There are many good things about this place, but equally as many turn offs. Although the place sounds like a small local breakfast place, the interior makes you feel as if you are in a small crowded food court. The lunch items looked pretty good ( I myself did not try any) however the breakfast was OK...nothing more. If you are looking for a good local breakfast place with tasty food that will keep you coming back, I suggest you keep looking, nothing outstandingly good here.
