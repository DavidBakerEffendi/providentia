Like many other BBQ lovers who have traveled throughout the country, I was sure I knew what great brisket was. But my first visit to Delaney BBQ gave me a new perspective on the experience. Descriptions like " succulent" or" melt in your mouth" sort of fit here, but cannot really convey just how delicious and rewarding my meal was. I choose equal portions of fatty and lean cuts, a half pound in total. As I watched the carving of one beautiful steaming brisket, with perfect smoke ring and pepper crusting, I was thinking that my trek to Brooklyn was about to pay off. I chose coleslaw as a side and added few slices of white bread, and found a seat. I lifted my plate to breath in the glorious aroma and began to sense that this was going to be special. My first mouthful gave a rush of flavor that I knew would set a new hallmark for all of my future BBQ life. I love this brisket and Delaney BBQ is a great place to enjoy it. The restaurant is casual, comfortable and charming, and the staff genuinely conveys your that you are very welcome here. Put Delaney BBQ on your gotta-do list, right at the top.
