My family recently had a repast following my mother's funeral at Miele's.  Steve and Carol were so professional and accommodating during this difficult time, having had to set this up on very short notice.  As always, everything was delicious.  We frequent Miele's a lot, and highly recommend them to anyone who hasn't checked them out yet!
