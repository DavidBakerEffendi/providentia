I agree with the others. We arrived for dinner at 6:45 for a 8pm show next door. 35 mins later our app of calmari arrives, after asking 2 times for it and the manager coming over to tell us they are slow for some reason, etc. When server came back, he then told us the filet was out and my niece needed to order something else and he said "but hurry it may take a while" well she ordered a salad and it came with out meals at 7:42pm!!! The chicken dinner was terrible, no taste and was told it was boneless, it was NOT!! DO NOT GO HERE!!!
