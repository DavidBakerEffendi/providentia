My favorite pizza in Brooklyn. Yeah, that's right, I realize what I'm saying. We order delivery from them frequently. My #1 favorite is the Navy Yard, which is pesto and sopressata, second is the Grandma's Favorite, which is like tomatoes and basil leaves, and the third is the Brooklyn. Great, crisp crust.
