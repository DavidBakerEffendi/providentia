Upon searching for a place to have a drink after class, my friend asked if I'd every been inside.  I hadn't, so he suggested we stop walking and land.  It was the best decision ever.  We came back 4 days later and began the odyssey. We started with the red Sangria...it seems as though it was a bottomless pitcher.  The best I've had in some time. Next was the delicious bean soup and the Portuguese bread. I could taste the love.  The bread was to die for! I ordered Linguini  with Seafood: clams, mussels, lobster, squid, and shrimp in a white sauce...oh...I couldn't eat it all.  The plate was huge and the prices were great! The staff is stellar and it's a great place, clean, warm and welcoming. Upscale and relaxing all in the same breath!  I don't know if I'm gonna cook anymore, it's so close to home!!
