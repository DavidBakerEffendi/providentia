Outside the Big 3 in new haven, this is the place i go for pizza when im not in new haven. Great thin crust and sauce. Dine in is also great ive had several of their dishes there (chicken parm, cavatelli, lasagna) all were good and being italian i am picky about going out for italian food. The subs ive had were great too.
