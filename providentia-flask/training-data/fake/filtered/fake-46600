The food here is usually pretty good but the service is pretty much always terrible.  The counter/waitstaff are either too busy chatting with each other to notice that you want to order/are still waiting on food you ordered 20, 30, 40 minutes ago or...they are too swamped with customers and not prepared to take orders efficiently. I've gotten coffee and/or lunch here several times and it is always a slog to get your food.  The staff (the young women who work the counter) are usually unfriendly, unhelpful, and inattentive to the customers who are (over)paying for their food.   The last straw for me was bringing a friend there, ordering food, waiting 30 minutes for our order with no progress or even check-in from the staff.  After we inquired about our order it appeared on the servers counter to go out.  We asked if that was our order after watching other customers get their food for 10 minutes.  We were told it wasn't.  We waited another 10, decided to forget it, get a refund and go elsewhere only to be told by the counter person that the order STILL sitting (and getting cold) on the server's bar was actually our order.  We told them no thanks and left.   This place would be outstanding if their service wasn't the absolute pits!  Go to Lena's or Delaney's instead.
