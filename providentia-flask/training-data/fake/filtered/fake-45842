I have been to Fat Salmon many times, and I have never been disappointed. The quality of their sushi is fantastic (I am very picky when it comes to sushi) and they specialty rolls are phenomenal. They have a large selection and they can satisfy any sushi whore's taste buds (vegetarian, spicy, etc.) By far my favorite sushi joint in Philly.
