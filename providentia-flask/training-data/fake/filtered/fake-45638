Basil duck was $19 and tough as rubber. I mean my jaw hurt from chewing, plus the duck meat had no flavor. Tom yum soup was ok but Â lacked many of the distinctive Thai ingredients (I have been to Thailand several times). Frogs legs were tasty. Much better than Lemongrass, which was really bad, but leaves much to be desired, especially at that price. This was based on one visit, but not inclined to go again given tasty Thai places in Hartford that are less expensive.
