I went here for a work dinner.  At first, I was nervous because Spanish food isn't really my favorite and I didn't want to come off as picky. Oh my gosh was I wrong.  EVERYTHING was amazing.  There was nothing I didn't at least like.  We got a very extensive tasting menu (I would estimate approx 1/4 of the menu came around at some point) and every course just got better.  The servings were plentiful and everything was perfectly prepared and balanced.  I think I may have eaten an entire plate of the garlic shrimp by myself.  I just couldn't stop! The service was attentive and friendly but unobtrusive.  All of the courses and servings were handled with precision and flowed wonderfully. I had the chance to meet Chef Garces a few months after and he was such a genuinely nice guy and really enjoyed meeting his customers.  That makes me even happier to support his businesses.   I can't wait to go back.
