Beautiful decor; Customer service leaves much to be desired. Food ok if you like average American meals cooked with an exotic flair. Constantly different staff which appears to only be "Milk" skins employed and no "Honey" hue folks are ever hired. The lack of diversity is obvious and quite unsettling.
