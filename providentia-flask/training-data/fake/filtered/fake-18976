This pizza is so freaking good. There's always a long line so I never bothered and the name, artichoke made me think,healthy, which doesn't interest me when buying a slice of pizza.. So I was with a friend, he's a regular, he asked if I went there, he explained the difference with this pizza,( it's not traditional pizza folks)how it's made and we went. He goes, I'm a get a crab pizza, I wrinkled my nose and said, see fish and crustaceans don't belong on a pizza... He got me a plain ole slice,which was delicious,but I was staring at his it had chunks of crab and a white cheese sauce(chowder?) and I took a bite,oh yum! I ate his pizza then sent him back 4 more! What I noticed was Â it was saucy but the pizza dough was NOT soggy it was crispy,how'd they manage that? The crab was fresh and so flavorful I defitnitley recommend
