I'm a visitor from London who had read great reviews about this restaurant so couldn't wait to drive the 45 minutes from Manhattan to Brooklyn to eat here! Got there - mouth watering - only to get to the door and see a sign saying 'Closed from 3pm-4:30 for the World Cup' - I looked at my watch and thought 'phew, it's 4:35, right on time!' - opened the door only for a Polish lady to rush over and proceed to say they were closed. Looking at my watch again, I remind her that the sign said closed until 4:30 and it was now past that.... 'oh I'm sorry, we'll probably open at 5 now' - she says. 'we're watching the World Cup' - she says 'sorry bye' - she says. Ended up going to an AMAZING restaurant instead about 5 minutes down the road, who took the initiative to have the game on so their customers could watch, eat and drink all at the same time. She was dismissive and rude too. No thanks! (P.S - Amazing restaurant was called 'Giovanni's Brooklyn Eats')
