My partner and I have been loyal customers for the last 2.5 years and Grill 21 does not disappoint: authentic Filipino food, dependable service and a welcoming environment. Having spent time in the Philippines I can tell you that the food at Grill 21 is authentic - from flavors, textures and presentation. We typically go for brunch (topsilog is my favorite) but we have tried many other items on the menu. We highly recommend and look forward to many more great meals.
