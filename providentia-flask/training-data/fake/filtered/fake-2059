I am officially boycotting this restaurant due to their horrific customer service. I have been a loyal customer to Northern Spy for years as I am a store owner just a few blocks away. As such this has been a regular haunt - I recommend this place to customers, accompany clients to the restaurant, bring friends etc. etc. For the past few months, however, I have seen customer service decline more and more. A few times I have went with friends and been embarrassed with the service and have hears similar stories from my circle of clients/friends. They went from not taking reservations to taking reservations to not having food delivery to having food delivery to not having it again... and all these times I have been informed of their "new poicies" they treat you as if you are already supposed to know. As a regular I can't seem to keep up with the inconsistencies - not making reservations and getting ready for the wait, but then arriving and there being turned away for a private tasting (which was no where on their web site as warning) the next day to come back and be practically yelled at for not making reservations -?? They just do not seem to care anymore - the wait staff/manager is so incredibly rude and has no qualms about being rude. Today was the absolute icing on the cake when I arrived a few minutes PRIOR TO 4pm to ask for a kale salad to go when the manager tells me that the kitchen has closed. Apparently it "closed" at 4pm even though it was not even 4pm. Was it that much trouble to throw the kale in a to-go container and mix it with the other raw ingredients that require absolutely NO cooking at all? I communicated that I am a loyal customer and he just did not care. Maybe my less than $20 kale salad order did not mean anything to them but what they didn't realize it goes way beyond the kale salad. They lost not only me but an entire circle within the East Village community. Thanks for taking care of the loyal locals, Northern Spy.
