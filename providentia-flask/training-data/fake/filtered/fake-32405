TERRIBLE. The JB Killa was literally dripping with grease and the vegetables tasted like they had gone bad days ago. I got the tots with cheese and mushrooms and the tots had the consistency of breaded mashed potato balls. They tasted old also, and I'm guessing they were because the outside was burnt but not warm on the inside. Housemade pizza rolls were the best thing we got, and I'd only give them one star. Barely any filling, and also dripping with grease. Way overpriced for such disgusting food.
