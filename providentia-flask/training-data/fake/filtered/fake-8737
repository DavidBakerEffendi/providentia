Love! Love! Love this place!!! The dining experience overall was amazing. The charming restaurant caught my eye. Must honestly say i was not expecting the delightful experience, the Dominican cuisine is delicious, attentive service, loved the rustic decor, definitely economical, If you are looking for, delicious food, warm and pleasant ambiance, and great service in Brooklyn, look no more. This is It!!! P.S. The Sangria is Wonderful!!!!
