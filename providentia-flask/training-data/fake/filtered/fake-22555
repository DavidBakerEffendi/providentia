Oh Feedbag de Chao..... How I love thee!!!!!!! They seem to have steeped up the quality of the service. Went for a friends 31st Birthday and our party was well served while being sat in a remote corner of the restaurant. All meat entrées made their way by at least twice.  Servers were attentive to the color disk displayed  if you are full or working on your plate put it on red my friend  Meats were well seasoned and you got the cuts served to your liking.  Plantain banannas were a little soggy and the salad bar did not have as wide selection as years past (That Obama economy at work.) Large parties sitting at long tables did significantly raise the noise level but all in all will be back to enjoy the experience. Some trivia.... The servers in the Gaucho pants with boots supposedly prepare the meats they are serving. Regular pants are just your standard waiter.
