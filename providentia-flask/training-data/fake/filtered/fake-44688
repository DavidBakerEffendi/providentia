I came here with co-workers for a weekday lunch. Although the d√©cor was interesting, and the food was good, the service was bad enough that we will never be back. We ordered two BLTs and two salads. We were not served our food until 50 minutes after we had ordered it. We only had an hour for lunch, so we immediately asked for our check and to-go boxes, as we did not have time to eat at this point. Fifteen minutes later, we had not received either. We had to go to the counter and threaten to leave without paying in order to get our check. We never did get the to-go boxes, we left the food on the table.
