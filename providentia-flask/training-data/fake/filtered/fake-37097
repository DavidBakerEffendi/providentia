Always warm attentative staff, has the most amazing Manager I have experienced. Great food, great seasonal choices. I have had an ocassionally under cooked steak but never a problem with a send back. I recommend getting one level of prefered cooking up from usual. Love this location and frequently eat there at least twice a month.
