A truly remarkable gem in a overcrowded area of delis, salad shops and lunch carts. What it lacks in tables - it makes up with their amazing Italian food. I eat here often and this place is the real deal. Try their focaccia (especially the olive) while you wait - you won't be disappointed! Â The antipasto has an olive oil dressing that should be bottled and sold. The bread for the panini is exceptional. When you focus on the small details like olive oil or a high quality bread, you know the owners mean business in producing a great product. Yes, it's crowded but the wait is worth it!! One of the best around!
