I'm a sucker for a good Italian BYOB and Modo Mio did not disappoint. The $35 Four course tasting menu is perfect, solid food at a good price. The bread and oil served in the beginning also came with a mild ricotta cheese which was a nice touch! My choices were as follows: 1. Antipasti, Scallop over zucchini cake (really really good, but small, wish it had more then one scallop) 2. Pasta, Gnocchi ( my fav of the night, delicious light gnocchi in a tomato sauce with panchetta throughout, good portion size too) 3. Secondi, Melanzana Eggplant (my one mistake of the night, I love eggplant but this layered eggplant dish was dry and not so flavorful. It didn't seem fresh) 4. Dessert, Apple pecan cake (tasty and a nice ending to our meal). We did have to wait about 30 minutes after our reservation time, but cracking open a bottle of red in the waiting area by the front door wasn't so bad, they brought us glasses. I'll go back again minus the eggplant!
