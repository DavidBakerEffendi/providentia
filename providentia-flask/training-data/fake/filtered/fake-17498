Scarpetta was chosen by my friend and every detail and waiter recommendation was incredible!! I had the scallops, they melted in my mouth. My friend had the duck and foie gras ravioli, they floated off the plate. The wine was a perfect wine and dessert was chocolate with salted caramel ice cream. Everything was delicious.
