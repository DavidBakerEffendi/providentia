What a great little gem in Newington center!  The food is amazing!  3$ for a yummy, delicious bruchetta?  I mean...where can you get anything anymore for $3?  The panini's are fabulous and  the homemade gnocchi is to die for!  I can't say enough about how wonderful the food and staff is.  My neighbor finally went last night after hearing our praises and said it was the best risotto he has ever had.  And he is from Italy!   I only hope more of these wonderful restaurants pop up around the center!
