A sweet spot near the subway; great for drinks, hanging out and some grub. There is not much of a selection for food but I must exclaim to the world that they have the best Grilled Cheese Sandwich I've ever tried, Hands down! Kick back and take a bite into that delicious sandwich and Sweet Afton has you going back for seconds.
