How do you say "Your Sanwiches Suck" in Spanish? Really for a guy who is really proud to be an American he certainly is shaming us with sub par product. I ordered mine in English and I got a big wet sloppy piece of mierda that all the ketchup in the world couldn't help. Do us Americanos a favor and move to a third world country so we don't have to claim you as one of our own.
