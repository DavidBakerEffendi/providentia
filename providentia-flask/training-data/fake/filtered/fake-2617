I had my birthday dinner here with six people. It was a very, very pleasant experience. The placed in a very quiet area of the restaurant which was very nice. The restaurant has a great ambiance to it. A good meal will come out to around $30-$35 per person, but its a bargain when you consider the quality of the food and service. Delicious food and A++ service.
