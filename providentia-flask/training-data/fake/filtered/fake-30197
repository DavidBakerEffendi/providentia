Ok, so Ive been ordering here for a few years. The deals have always been great. The food used to be great too, but now its utterly disgusting. I recently had chicken alfredo penne. Its such an easy dish, it should never be ruined this badly. The sauce was almost completely water and the chicken was gross and tasted old. And, somehow, the noodles were burnt crispy. How do you burn noodles to a crisp when boiling??? Never again will I order here. Never ever ever again
