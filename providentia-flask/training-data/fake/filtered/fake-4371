Okay, I've now eaten at Church and Main a few times this past year.  Over the course of those visits I've tried the Steak Frites, Mr. Church's Chicken, Squash Salad, Strawberry Salad, Ceasar Salad, Fried Calamari, Flatbread, Chicken Legs, Chocolate Mousse, Citrus Sorbet, to name a few.  I feel that I'm in a position to say that the food is always well-prepared with a bit of craft that's a cut above typical Burlington restaurants, save a select few. Well...this last time I went in and was surprised by something completely new: the cocktails.  I was with a date and we sat at the bar b/c we hadn't made reservations and the place was hopping on a Saturday Night .  After noting what we were each looking for the bartender recommended that we try a Gin Fizz and an A+ respectively. Spot on. Both were expertly crafted drinks: great flavor, just the right amount of kick. If these were any indication of the rest of the cocktail menu, this could quickly become a favorite. I will continue to come back for dinner.  Now I'm going to back for the cocktails too.
