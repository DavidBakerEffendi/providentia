We were very excited to visit our friends in new york city and we picked yasuda for our Thursday evening meal. We did our reserach and picked this place because it was very highly rated by zagat and had a good prix fix menu. My boyfriend and I each ordered the 5 sashimi and 2 rolls prix fix and got an assortment of sashimi and rolls. One of the sashimi we got was the clam and when my boyfriend ate it he thought it wasn't fresh and tasted bad, but he didn't say anything until later when he was violently sick from the bad clam. I know that you take a risk eating sushi, but you would think that a place like this would not serve old clams. It was gross. And although we had a nice experience while we were there, we decided it overrated and nothing special and this was before my boyfriend got sick. Throw in the fact that he got so sick, Â that leads to my one star rating.
