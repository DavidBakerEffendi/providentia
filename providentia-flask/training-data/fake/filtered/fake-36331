Our experience at Scarpetta's last May 30 taught us not to rely on other people's reviews nor recommendations. The food was good but the service sucks! We were not allowed to take our seats until our party of 7 was complete. The head waiter wouldn't take our order until everybody was seated.  The waiters did not know how to handle a child's request for special food, the kid being allergic to a lot of food.  Because the line was full of waiting customers, we felt we were being rushed to leave our table, despite consuming 2 bottles of expensive Italian wine , expensive entrees and a total tab of close to $600.  I give it a 5 for food and a 2 for service.  I would not recommend the place to my friends. I already announced Scarpetta,s bad service to my Facebook family. Bad choice, another sad learning experience. San Francisco treats their customers better!
