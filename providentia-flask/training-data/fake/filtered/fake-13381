Perfect place to catch up with your friends over margaritas! It is a bit noisy, but the food is delicious and the service is great. I have also gone there on dates and I will say that it's a better hangout for friends since it's usually hard to hear in there because it's always packed! Shared munchie recommendation: any of the nachos - the plate is huge! Margarita recommendation: any of them. All great! If you go here, you will not be disappointed!
