Soba-ya introduced me to Japanese food that wasn't sushi. Go. Watch the soba noodles being made. Eat the soba or udon, hot or cold. Try vegetables like lotus root that you never even knew existed. Perhaps avoid the salted squid guts, or man it up and try them out! Decent saki choices available as well. Kampai!
