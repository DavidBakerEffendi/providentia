The food at this place is incredible!  I was in the neighborhood and looking for a quick bite when I stopped at this place to look at the menu.  They have a beautiful deck outside complete with plants and hanging lights.   I ordered the Sopa del Dia which was a creamy broccoli that came with a small mexican grilled cheese on the side.  So good!  After that, the mussels that were on special were perfect.  They seem to change their specials weekly and I can't wait to try the others. Service was friendly and professional and the drinks were priced normally for Old City.  I hope they get more events going to liven up this neighborhood some more!
