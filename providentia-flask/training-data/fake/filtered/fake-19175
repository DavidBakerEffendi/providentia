My boyfriend and I decided to go to this BYOB to celebrate our 6 year anniversary. This place was AWESOME. The dining room was full (but surprisingly not loud and obnoxious) so we took a table outside. Without us even saying anything about how wobbley the table was, the owner herself came over and fixed it for us. Overall, the service was great! Now the food: ooh, the food! We ordered three tapas items to start. (I would like to add the only reason this place doesn't get five stars is because they didn't have mussels on the menu, which the bf and I were dying to have that night, but no harm done). We had the vegetarian spring rolls--surprisingly fresh and light, with an amazing chili dipping sauce--the calamari--amazing. this is a must have!--and the shrimp--delicate and simple yet delicious! For my entree, I had their special for the evening, the veal medallions--seriously tender and cooked to perfection. PERFECTION PEOPLE! My bf had the sea bass with rissotto, tried a bite and it was light and flaky, I would highly recommend that dish any day of the week. We then had the chocolate torte (bf ordered it. looked pretty awesome but I was way too involved in my dessert) and I tried the tiramisu, which was another special of the evening. Heaven. The tiramisu tasted like heaven. Plain and simple. So we clearly ordered A LOT of food, however the bill was not bad at all--very reasonably priced, great service and even better food--August is a definite must on your BYOB list!
