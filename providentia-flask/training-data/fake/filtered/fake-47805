So glad we came here this past weekend.  The place was packed, but we were seated right away.  Everything we tried from raw oysters to the mussels were delicious, but the true standout for me were the peel & eat shrimp...wow!  Service was friendly as well.  Would love to go back next time I'm in Philly!
