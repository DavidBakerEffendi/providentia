Very good but hectic. Maybe too much of a scene to appreciate the food. We had two decent appetizers, very nicely done but nothing spectacular. The entree was delicious. Beautifully sauteed Arctic Char in a polenta-ish corn meal with string beans. Desert also delicious, a peach cobbler with peaches that tasted like peaches and a baked crust that almost tasted like shortbread cookies. The scoop of pistachio ice cream that accompanied it was pushing it a bit. I think I might have preferred a boring vanilla to go with the beautifully cooked cobbler. Again, very good food but I'm only beginning to appreciate it now in retrospect. When I was in the restaurant I felt a bit strained and pushed even though the wait staff and the hosts were all as accommodating as can be. I think I prefer "Five Points" where the scene is a bit more subdued and you can actually concentrate on your food and dinner companions.
