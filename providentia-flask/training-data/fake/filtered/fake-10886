I never give any reviews but this is THE best indian restaurant we have tried. Great service and excellent food, good portion size. The staff is super friendly. Me And husband went once for dinner, we were not aware  this  is bring your own bottle service place . They do not serve alcohol when we asked the manager, he offered us couple of beers from his personal fridge and they did not charge us for drinks. We highly recommend this place because it is very rare to find great food, excellent service, nice ambience in one place.
