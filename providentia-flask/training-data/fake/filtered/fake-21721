I walked in after the theatre and was very surprised to see the place packed! Got the last table available and enjoyed our meal and service thoroughly. Wife had large Chicken salad and I had very good sauteed liver. Ambience was great. Â It has a NYC vibe. Would definitely go back--but next time I'll make reservations.
