Being a recent import from south Texas myself, finding authentic, fresh corn tortillas has been like a slice of culinary home.  The blue corn tortillas are my favorite, and cost the same as the white corn ones, but are only available first come first serve on Saturdays so see you there, just don't take "mine." When I make the trek into the city for them, I buy 6-8 kilos (approx. 13-20 pounds) at a time and freeze them.  Having to avoid gluten (celiac) and an almost unnatural love of corn tortillas this will last me only about a month. On a side note: do yourself a favor and heat them on a griddle or directly on the grates of a gas stove, not in a microwave.  Try it and you will taste the difference and thank me for saying something.
