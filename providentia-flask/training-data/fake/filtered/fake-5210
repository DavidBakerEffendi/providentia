This restaurant is a bad excuse for an Italian restaurant. The bad (bordering on rude) service and awful atmosphere could be excused for good food and good prices. Marzullo's had neither. The food was not very good (under seasoned, over oiled, and chicken marsala where the mushrooms weren't cooked!!!) and way over priced for what it was. I have had better food from neighborhood pizza places at half the price. I'm not sure how this place survives considering the amount of fine restaurants feet from it's door. Unless it lives off of "regulars" who know no better, this place can't last much longer. Save yourself some grief (and quite a few dollars) and head further into Montclair for some MUCH better food.
