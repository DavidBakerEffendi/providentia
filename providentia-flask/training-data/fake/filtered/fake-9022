Great place to eat with family and friends. Their modest prices, good food and friendly atmosphere make of this restaurant one of the best places to enjoy Spanish cuisine in the Ironbound section of Newark. I think that a lot of other places are overrated when it comes to heir food quality and prices. I really enjoy this place and specially their sangria, it is the best.
