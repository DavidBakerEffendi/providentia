Pit-Masters they are not!!!  In fact, I doubt there was any wood in the smoker. The smoked ribs were served cold, under-cooked and partially raw.  They were not fall off the bone tender but rather a bloody mess of partially raw meat.  The smoked chicken wings were even worse... how can you screw up chicken wings? When I brought this to our server's attention, she explained that smoked meat will be a little red.  We spoke to a manager who told us the same thing, adding that the ribs were cooked properly and that they were smoked for 15 hours.  They went on to say that during the cooking process, the blood vessels explode causing the red color as blood oozed from the ribs.   There was no smoke flavor on the raw meat.  Also, there was no smoke odor on the food, inside the restaurant, or outside of the restaurant.  There was however a bloody raw meat odor on the ribs.   The food was cold and the dining room is unheated.   Red I Saloon serves severely under-cooked meat, what's worse, they don't recognize cooked meat should not bleed if cooked properly.
