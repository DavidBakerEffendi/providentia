pub is what i'd like to call a black hole.. you never make it out of there sober but you don't end up spending all your money. the drinks are cheap and the bartenders are smokinnnnn hot!!!!!!!! my favorite nite is wednesdays where it is a bit more laid back with karaoke and beer pong and drink specials.. if you're looking for a dancing nite i'd suggest tuesdays for $2 bring your own mug.. it's a great bargain and tons of people go..mostly college people. the place is so diverse you'd be surprised of the difference from a crazy nite out to a chill happy hour. i love going to happy hour there after class because it's right by MSU and they have real cheap food and drinks til 8pm. can't beat it!
