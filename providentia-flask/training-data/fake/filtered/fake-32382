So disappointed!  Organic should actually mean something.  Those beef patties are far from hand crafted. I doubt they were actually organic as the color of the patties were gray.  More like pre-packaged!  Quite honestly, I wished I ordered from five-guys.  Or better yet, made it myself!  The fries upon delivery were oily and soggy.  For pre-packaged patties they should at least make timely deliveries.  40 minutes turned into over an hour!  No one likes luke warm burgers and fries.  If you're looking for "organic" meat...look elsewhere!   Tip to management, hire a chef, make your own burgers!  Customers can tell that you don't!
