Pumpkin is a fabulous restaurant. I have never had a course that was anything less than outstanding. The cuisine is so artful and elegantly prepared. We are truly blessed to have this gem in our backyard. On Saturday June 9th I returned to celebrate my birthday. My wife and I were amazed at the degree of precision used to prepare their dishes. Ian and Chris are in a class by themselves. Walter Matweychuk, Ph.D.
