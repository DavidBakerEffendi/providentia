I knew my neighborhood had finally turned into what I wanted it to be when the Chubby Muffin opened up right around the corner! I haven't tried all the food yet but they have some great lattes and some fun muffin flavors. What I like best though is the neighborhood vibe. The guys already know my order and that I like to get a side of bacon for my dog. The seating area is cozy and filled with locals hanging out, reading books out of the well-stocked bookshelves, and hooking up to wi-fi. The menu is filled with local Vermont products, and non-profits are often allowed use the space in the evenings. This is a great little place and I hope it achieves the success it deserves.
