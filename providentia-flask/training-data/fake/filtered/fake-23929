A group of six of us went to Talk of the Town last night. It was fantastic! Super friendly service, delicious flavors, a number of things I'd never tried before. We let our server order for us, so I'm not sure of the names of the dishes we ate. But we finished off with homemade mango ice cream that was phenomenal!
