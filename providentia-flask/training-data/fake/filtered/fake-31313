I ate at Verjus with a party of 11 and we had a side room to ourselves. I had corn chowder to start which was excellent.  The crusted salmon was delicious also. The word around the table was that the food was very good. The service, however, was, as another reviewer put it, not well timed.  There were continual mix ups as to who got what appetizer or what dinner and what dessert, and for every course at least one person waited a long time before his dish appeared. My brother had to wait until everyone else finished before he even saw his dessert. Coffee did not come until more than halfway through dessert. Would I come back? I don't live near Maplewood so the question is probably moot. I would not drive the hour just to eat there, but I would go if business took me into the area.
