The best, quality sushi in the town. Service was great. Although the place is pretty small, and not good for the young kids. I mean, 3 or 4 years old kids can easily bother the other customers who sit next to. Whenever I want to eat sushi I think about Ajihei, but I found myself in Whole Foods Market which is convenient for my children.
