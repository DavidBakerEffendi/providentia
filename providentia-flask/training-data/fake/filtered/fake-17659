horrible service, way over priced even for Williston.  $10 for a sandwich and a little side salad.  Waitress was more interested in dealing with the table next to ours--they were all drinking beer--Hello remember designated drivers????? My husband likes beer, so I was the driver for the day and this waitress didn't give us the time of day.  lousy menu options--your a brew-tap house--there should have been more pub type appetizers.  firt and last visit!
