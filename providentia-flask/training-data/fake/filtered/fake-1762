Talk about incredibly large portions.. The food was definitely filling, but I honestly was hoping for quite a lot more in terms of taste. The "famous" chicken was notably dry, and there really wasn't much substance to their fries. The only thing they had on point was their pasta. The food definitely isn't bad, but at the same time doesn't live up to the hype.
