Good food, interesting atmosphere, and friendly staff. Everything we got was really delicious! The fried chicken has good flavor and fantastic texture. The sushi was very good, and quite reasonably priced. Good seaweed salad, but not anything unique about it. We ordered several rolls of sushi, vegetarian gyoza, seaweed salad and miso soup. My favorite dish of all was the vegetarian gyoza. I've been trying to recreate my dining experience with Momo's gyoza ever since (unsuccessfully). The skin was oh so thin but chewy, and the filling even better. The gyoza was accompanied by this spicy sauce in addition to the traditional dipping sauce... divine. It still haunts me to this day, and this was a while ago. It's that kind of attention to detail that will keep me coming back. Thanks for a great meal, Momo. See you next time!
