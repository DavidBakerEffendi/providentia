I used to love Amy Ruth's, but not anymore.  I used to order their catering for my clients in Harlem, and knew Carl the owner.  But that was a few years ago and now I wanted to order just a couple of dishes for a party I'm having do I went on-line to see if that;s still something they do.  I wanted to order the Mac & Cheese and the Collard Greens for 60 people.  I decided to make the arrangements in person and after work, traveled from Brooklyn on the subway.  They weren't interested in helping me because it was after 6 pm and the rule is that catering orders have to be placed before the catering manager leaves.  I was bent because it didn't say that anywhere on their website. (OK- my bad for not calling first.) So the trip wasn't in vain, I ordered a dinner plate to go: smothered chicken, mac & cheese and greens.  All told it came to $15-- (plus my carfare) and it was not even good.  Just OK.  No corn bread, and the portions were small.  I will not go out of my way for Amy Ruth's again.  And I'm ordering from someplace else for the party.  What a turn off.
