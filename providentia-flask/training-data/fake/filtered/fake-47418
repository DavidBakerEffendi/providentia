This is one of our favorite Italian places outside of Italy.  It's sad to see some reviews on here talking about undercooked pasta.  Yeah, real italian pasta is not over cooked.. It's just under. This place is perfect and it holds up to the Morinis and Babbo's.  Try the squid pasta, it's incredible
