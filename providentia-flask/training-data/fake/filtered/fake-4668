Never a bad experience here.  Huge portions, delicious food, and BYO.  We've had the hummus, spicy feta, and tzatziki appetizers, all of which were good (especially the feta).  We always get the charcoal grill platter for 2, which is always excellent, and is a ton of food.  Everything is well prepared, and the service there is great.  The restaurant itself is nice and cozy, and appears to be family run.  Definitely one of our favorite spots in Philly.
