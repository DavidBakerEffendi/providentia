I found this vegetarian/vegan restaurant/take out spot while exploring the city and what a find.  Their vegan take on everyday Philly eats like cheesesteak was so tasty that I have been back a couple of times already.  I don't even want to get into the desert, which is delivered fresh every Thursday from what I have been told.  Sometimes I have to fight the craving, but as you can tell by my review that is not a fight that I win very often.  Check this place out ASAP.  LoL!
