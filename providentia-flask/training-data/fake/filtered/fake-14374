Very limited menu makes it hard to go too often. Also, the service was excruciatingly slow - took 40 minutes to get our drinks and appetizers. And, tables are left with dirty dishes, and they use that tacky butcher paper over their tablecloths. However, the french fries are good. The foods OK to good. I had the worst mixed drink I've ever had anywhere.
