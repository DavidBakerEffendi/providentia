I came in with a Latte (which they don't serve) to the restaurant only be be told I need to throw it out before I come in. The approach was not really polite but I didn't want to make a big deal out of it. The waitresses all seemed to have a scowl on their face, ours came over and just asked what we wanted without any hello. To be fair I must say the Pizza was good. When I asked for a refill of my diet coke they said there is an extra charge. It would have been nice if they mentioned this when I was ordering. There seem to be a lot of rules put in place by the owners of what you can and cannot do. The most surprising was the automatic addition of the tip to our bill. I understand that our friends from the North have had a bad history of tipping but we are locals. I would have given a lot more for good service but Ken's Pizza is probably the worst service and eating experience I have had in years!
