After reading some of these reviews I really needed to comment on Papa's, it's history, and food. For the record, I am in no way associated with this place. I just like to eat.. =) I have grown up here in the Mercer county area, and understand the different types of pizza and tomato pie. I have spent more time than I am willing to admit in Phily and NYC. This place was in Trenton for-ever, and just came to Robbinsville this year. (2013) Remarkably, they have brought their taste of 'Trenton' out to Robbinsville. (According to the owner, they even brought the stones that they cook the pie on with them to try and preserve the flavor of the pies.. ) The area they were in origianlly was becoming unsafe. They operated there for a long time, doing things a specific way to preserve the tradition. and I personally enjoyed the Pie.. I also want to make sure folks understand this is a small business, and Robbinsville is a small town in many ways.. Folks, I just want you to keep your expectations in check. This is one of the "Trenton" tomato Pie's... When you order, expect tomato pie. If you have never had it before, stick to the basics. Order a plain pizza. Leave the toppings and the mstard pie for another visit. Taste it for what it is worth. If you enjoy it, then get some toppings, or a side the next time you visit. It's easy.. This place has a really good version of their own tomato pie. It's not Papa's Salads, or Papa's Side dishes.. That stuff is just to hold you over until the pie comes. If you are expecting high end decor, or want to pay for high end, go to NY or Phily. If you want a crispier crust, go to Delorenzos. Which I enjoy as well. But try to get a Delorenzos pizza delivered. Â =)
