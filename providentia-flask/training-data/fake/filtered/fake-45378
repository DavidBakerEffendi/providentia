Was bar hopping on a lovely Sunday eve in Fort Greene and popped in for Â a drink. Drinks were okay, a lil sweet on the mixology and the beer list could definitely use improvement... but we happened to be sitting next to the hostess ( I think she said her name was Kai) who had just gotten off and was eating with her mom.. We were not even hungry but she showed us everything on the menu with such vivid description, and even got us to try her lobster and grits (Ahhhhhmazing!!) So of course, hungry or not, we had to try the mac n cheese and greens and yes- we will definitely be back. Thanks Kai!
