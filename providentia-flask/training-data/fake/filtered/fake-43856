A new restaurant in town, and a brand new building with a seemingly good breakfast history. My wife and I decided to go there for lunch today. The outside decor, and newness were awaiting us. Inside, booths ,chairs and tables were viewed as a step up from a Denny's! Now the food. My wife ordered a short stack of Pancakes with Bacon, and Maple syrup. She enjoyed them, but when the bill came we were somewhat surprised. I ordered a Turkey Dinner. For the price I thought I would receive Roasted Turkey with Turkey Gravy with many thick slices. What was plated was lots of stuffing, a small pile of shaved Turkey that was supposed to be oven roasted, A white floured gravy, veggie, and mashed potato.The staff was friendly, kind of green, and did not make up the difference for the lack of good food. The total bill was higher than I would pay at a better restaurant! The restroom had much to be desired especially for a new restaurant. Looks like the folks at Chip's were trying to save a few dollars on this one! The other thing that really gets me furious. Chip's charges for soda water....that is nothing else but Tap Water with carbonation. Many restaurants are not charging for this For the money, the taste, and presentation this dining out experience was not worthy of another visit.
