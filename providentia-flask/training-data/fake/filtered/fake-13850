The best Thai restaurant i've ever been to... small quite, nice place... friendly staff and owner. The food is always fantastic! nice flavors and fresh ingridients. We tried other thai restaurants in differents locations and Spice Thai is by far the best. If we live in Belleville, we will probably be here every other day... LOL writing this review made me crave for some red curry and sum tom salad! yuuum!
