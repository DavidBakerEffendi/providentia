I went to Brasilia Grill for dinner with a friend.  Having arrived early I checked out the hot/cold buffet table, it looked good.  When it can time to order we both decided to get the buffet.  It was a wise choice for both of us.  The stewed chicken is what caught my eye, it just looked so good.  The stewed chicken met and exceeded my expectations, it was just delicious. The beans and rice, roasted vegetables, the plantains were all so good.  But the surprise of the night was the beef stroganoff as it was very flavorful.   Although we did not participate in the Rodizio, I can remark on it.  They had a steady pace of servers coming out of the kitchen.  Some places you need to wait a while for the next meat, not here, it seemed like someone was always carrying a skewer of meat.  Next time I go, I'm going to fast all day and order the rodizio!  It is worth the trip.  Oh, forgot to mention the parking lot, a nice plus! The Birthday song made me feel like I was at a soccer match.
