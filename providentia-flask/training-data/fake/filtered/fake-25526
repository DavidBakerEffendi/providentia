Fiorino Restaurant, with one exception, is an excellent restaurant.  The food is superb.  The service is courteous, efficient, and fast.  We had to wait only about three minutes for our table.  BUT: The noise is oppressive.  We were there on Saturday, and the noise from the other diners was deafening.  We could not hear each other talk, and therefore had to talk even louder, the same thing that the others were doing, and this made everything worse. The owners could simply put in some sound-deadening materials on the walls (at present the walls are painted plaster), and install an acoustic ceiling.  It would not be difficult. We would go more often, but the unpleasantness of the noise is a big deterrent. Peter
