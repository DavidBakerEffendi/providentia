Worst dining experience I've had since I moved to New Haven over a year ago.  The wait was ridiculously long --25 min to get a table, then over an hour after ordering before we actually got our food.  The waitstaff was not very attentive.  We flagged our waiter down to refill our empty water glasses and only after we told him we'd been waiting for our food for over 45 min, did he apologize for the wait!  On top of that, my friend's first water glass was dirty (it had green things stuck to the sides and floating in it).   The food (when it did arrive over an hour later) was unexciting and bland.  Both my friend and I were completely disappointed with the food, and I didn't even finish the sushi I'd ordered. I don't know what all the hype is about this restaurant because my first experience at Miya's was a complete disappointment, and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone!  Neither my friend or I will be returning.
