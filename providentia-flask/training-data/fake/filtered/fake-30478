My favorite Korean Restaurant in New York.  A bit pricey but for the super fresh ingredients it tastes like everything is made from scratch and with love.  As a Korean from Seoul...trust me..this place is authentic. I love bringing my kid here because I know that it is not too sweet and uses spices that Koreans use.(not just sugar and MSG like the majority of Ktown)  If you notice the restaurant is filled with mostly Koreans.  That is ALWAYS a good sign.
