Ordered a vegetarian pizza and needed a magnifying glass to find the toppings.  The ever so sparsely placed broccoli was tiny and over cooked.  This pizza was all thick chewy dough, very little sauce, and a handful of toppings that tasted like they were from a can.  I've had veggie pizzas from other establishments and this pizza rates at the bottom of all the others!  So very disappointed and confused by the positive reviews of Pompeii...go somewhere else!!
