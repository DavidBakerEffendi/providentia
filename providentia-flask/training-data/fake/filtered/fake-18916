Sometimes I still come back here even though I don't live close to one and the place next store (part of their restaurant) wouldn't let us sit there and eat, even though we had a whole pie from their business and it was raining. Anyways that was a long time ago. I swore I wouldn't come back but how could I resist a slice of the original artichoke every once in a while? Â It's not as good as when they first opened but it's still better than 90% of the pizza joints in New York (now that's saying a lot).
