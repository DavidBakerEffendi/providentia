this restaurant is exactly what the neighborhood needed.  good italian comfort food, cool vibe. i had been to their sister restaurants on LI a number of times (Mama Theresa's and La Piazza) and knew that this had to be good.  it didn't disappoint.   the rice balls and parm dishes were fantastic.  its great italian food "like mama used to cook" without that stuffy old school vibe you'll find at other restaurants that serve similar food.  and the portions are just right.   can't wait to get back and would highly recommend it to anyone
