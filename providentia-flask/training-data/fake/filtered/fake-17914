Our family absolutely loves Osteria. The food is consistently amazing and we get excited every time we go back. Every plate that comes out of the kitchen is made with a lot of love and hard work. We are never disappointed with our meal. Unfortunately, we had dinner at Osteria last Thursday night and had a very bad experience. While the food was again outstanding, our service was beyond poor; it was very bad. I could not believe it, in fact. Our waiter, a tall balding gentleman, was unfocused, lazy, gave us no attention whatsoever, and was very rude to me on one occasion when I asked about the wait for our main course. 43 minutes passed from the time our apps were cleared off our table to the time our main courses arrived. It was unacceptable and I believe, solely the waiters fault. When the food came it was delicious, but the waiter's rude comment to me, telling me I should learn my "manners" ruined our entire experience. I wanted so badly to stand up and walk out, but I did not want to disappoint my guests. Will we be back? Yes. However, I will request my waiter for now on. I will not eat there if I have this man again. I have been in the restaurant business for some time now and can tell you that any critic would have destroyed Osteria Giotto if something remotely close to what happened to me, happened to them. It is not expected at a restaurant like Osteria, in fact, I would not even expect it at the local barber shop.
