You cannot go to The BT and complain about the surly servers, the atmosphere, or the food not prepared to your perfection.  Why? Because then you shouldn't have stepped foot into the DeLorean for the ride of your life. All of that is THE BT.   It's like a blast from the past or being an extra in any Scorsese film.  The jukebox belting out 50's tunes (I swear I thought I was in a scene from Goodfellas), the bartender who could care less about your fancy drink order or the server who needs the table pronto because she has people waiting for over an hour.  So was I perturbed that they almost took my savoy juice away before I was finished dunking?  Heck yeah but my looks could kill and she knew to take her hands off.  After all,  Jersey girls know that unspoken body language with each other and you'll find them here for sure.  Scungilli salad, cavatelli & pot cheese, chicken savoy.  Staples.   Clams organata and hot peppers, occasionally a must.   Order 3 portions of chicken for leftovers.  And stop whining.   And enjoy the show.  Ya whimps!
