This is the purest definition of "comfort food", the twist is that even a grilled cheese feels like fine dining here.  The portion to price ratio is definitely in the customers favour.  The food is exactly what comfort food should be, hearty, wholesome and approachable.   The draft selection is limited to 3 taps, Switchback of course and two rotating lines that I've seen range from the usual locals to more rare and higher end offerings such as Southern Tier and Founders.  Choosing something to compliment the fare is never a problem. The service....well....here's where the 4th star was lost.  Some nights it feels like your the only table the server has eyes for...other nights I've actually felt like an inconvenience.  granted I'm a late night diner but this doesn't excuse being treated like a pest.  The bartenders and mgmt always seem on their game but the table service leaves a lot to be desired.  Just because the food seems like it was cooked at home doesn't mean the service should be left at home.  overall though the food and cozy environment win out and this is one of Winooskis true treasures and a real VT gem.
