I absolutely love The Sushi Cafe!!! The fish is fresh, the rolls are unique, and the people who work there are great. It is always a great vibe when i come and visit. Not to mention how awesome the chefs are. I have been coming here for a decently long time now. Any time i want to somewhat, "customize" a roll, i just ask or write what i would like in it and the great chefs will make it with ease. Myself as well as my friends have never had a bad experience at the S.Cafe. Sometimes the sushi will take a little bit longer to come out than usual, but that is the risk one has to take when entering the taste zone of the Sushi Cafe!!!!
