Grounds are beautiful, however the food is par which would be fine if it weren't for the sub-par service.  Best to bring a sandwich or eat at the dozens of others restaurants in the area.     I took my Aunt and 5 others for my Aunt's 80th Birthday celebration.  Service was terrible; wait staff was inattentive and unresponsive.  Condiments were never brought to the table, cocktails were never refilled, food was served when not all of the dishes were ready, the hot dishes were served cold, we had to ask for our plates to be cleared. The waiter brought the check without clearing the plates even though we had told him we were there for a birthday celebration; and we had to ask for dessert menus.   Then they had the audacity to add 20% gratuity to the check!
