I usually hate it when reviews give low stars for service instead of the food, but after waiting 30 minutes to get a table, we waited 60 more minutes to get our brunch entrees only to find out that the chef had forgotten to cook our order.  (It was an ordinary order, no substitutions or special instructions or anything.) We actually received our appetizers, French onion soup and skewered french toast, which were good, but not that much better than a standard brunch/cafe place.  Overhyped, avoid.
