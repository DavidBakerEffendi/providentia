Pizza is excellent NY Coal Oven Pizza, but everytime I go I regret it because the experience is RUINED by the HORRIBLE SERVICE! The old man maitreD is rude and obnoxious and not interested at all in getting diners in the door. After a long wait even though half the tables are empty, once in good luck getting a server to recognize your presence - in a small restaurant, last night I was ignored for 20 minutes before I had to get up and demand to be served. And then they act like we're being a bother for interupting them not doing anything. And not once in all my visits have I ever had a server return to see if I need anything else or a refill on my drink. Needless to say, they won't get a tip from me.
