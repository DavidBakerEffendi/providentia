Very cool little place that serves excellent food. Downsides are that it's quite cramped (but they're expanding!) and also the service is lacking. Orders are often brought to the table incorrectly or not at all and even though the place is small, it's hard flagging down someone for help. The food is great and the place is super unique. I recommend it for a casual night out/lunch but not as a date night as it would not leave you a lot of privacy.Welcomed place on Staten Island!
