Excellent pizza! My friend and I stopped in on a Sunday afternoon for some Pizza and wine. And WOW! It was delicious we got a margherita pizza that tasted so fresh we ordered a second pie! We had about four of the bottles they put wine in and it we definitly received more than we paid for THANKS GUYS! The waitress was so sweet people should request her she's a blonde with dreads, she even noticed we had a little bit of wine in our glasses so she came over and picked up the bottle of wine she left for us at the table and poured us more with out asking. That's the kind of stuff I really appreciate and love. Will definitly be back!
