I went here with friends on a Friday night - I had heard about the place and also had been to their other two restaurants.  This place is small, I liked the fried green tomatoes and I was able to get their mashed potatoes with the turkey gravey and it was really tasty.   I was happy to see their drink menu and my friend and I tried one of the specials - it was vile.  So bad in fact that I asked for a glass of pineapple juice and some tonic water to fix it and even then it was barely drinkable.  Some;thing they might want to work on or get a new bartender. My friend had the chicken with the pepper - she had gone there before and had the spicy and she said it was inedible.  This time she requested the mild and she still could not eat it.  I am talking about people who grew up in the caribbean and was given habaneros in their milk bottles.
