Quick, healthy, delicious food at it's best! their fresh cut potatoes (pommes frittes) have more vitamin C and protein than most red meats. Their warm and healthy soups turns one into a machine. I in particular keep going back for their highly alkaline salads garnished with the most healthiest and tasty veggies... The sauces on the fries are beyond any tasty word can describe.  I keep wanted to go back, cause of their Afghan  hospitality and highly ascended energy & love they put into the food... And, honestly, I can feel their love when i eat the food and keep wanted to go back for more... I like spending time in the restaurant as well, as it's very cozy while european music w/ a touch of middle eastern plays in the background... I can go on and on, describing the atmosphere and how great the food is, but, it's all about experience, it cannot be talked about or taught through words, but ONLY experienced.... I'm smiling now...
