This is my favorite restaurant in the neighborhood right now. The food is unreal. Best burger/fries in NYC. Great wine selection. Nice staff. You just have to pick and choose your battles at this spot because it is small and can get packed. I don't usually go on the weekends and will often times grab a drink, or a few, at Nights & Weekends or Manhattan Inn if I'm with a group and there is a wait.
