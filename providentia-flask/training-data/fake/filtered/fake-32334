Believe the hype. This cart is amazing. I once got there and the line was all the way to the c town. I wondered whether or not it was worth the wait. People got in line behind me so I decided it was and was not disappointed. They give you a piece of falafel while you wait and their energy and good cheer is contagious. The food is to die for..any of it, all of it. I keep going back to try more and i cant get enough!
