I ate with my fiance at Sugar Freak about a month ago, and meant to post sooner. This is a delicious place. I tried the buttermilk fried chicken, and he got a po' boy - catfish, I think. I also tried the regular fries and he got the sweet potato. I can't say enough about the chicken it was tasty, lightly spiced, and not at all greasy - the way fried chicken should be when made just right. Between the two kinds of fries, both were good but we liked the sweet potato better. We had read about the caramel popcorn pudding in Boro, so we decided to split it despite being quite full. It was delicious! Well worth it. I was initially worried it would be too sweet, but it was not. The topping was sweet, the popcorn a little salty, and overall it was balanced by the mild bread pudding. On top of the food, our waitress was attentive and personable. We asked her to switch off a speaker near us that was crackling in a distracting way, and she did immediately. Our food came out quickly, our empty plates taken promptly, and our water refilled constantly. We haven't eaten at *every* place on 30th Ave, but this has been our favorite experience by far.
