Went there for a friends 30th b-day on her choosing and really enjoyed it.    She had ordered the whole suckling pig for her party.  It comes with 4 side dishes.  We ordered about 6 other tapas while we waited for the pig.  One was better than the last. Each friend had a different fav. I really loved the Short Rib Flat Bread, and the peppers stuffed with crab.  The highlight of the meal was the pig skin that was amazingly perfect!  The service was great too!
