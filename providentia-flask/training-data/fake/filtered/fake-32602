To say that this place is A-M-A-Z-I-N-G..it's like nothing to say. Great atmosphere...great service...And Oui Oui...they speak French there. Good place for some practice lol..)))! French onion Soup ....Delightful..Oh My God. I also got "Salade de chevre chaud"...Yummy! Goat cheese croquettes with arugula leaves...and apples. Thumbs up. Plus:for $16 brunch menu, Â they do have unlimited drinks like Sangria.( which is very tasty & refreshing), mimosa , blood mary and house wine. Dessert was also Great...With my friend we got profiteroles w/vanilla ice cream. And you can listen such an amazing jazz music. Mmmm...Lovely place.This place is really worth to go. I'll be back 100% to try some other dishes. And i'm definitely sure other dishes will impress me even more.
