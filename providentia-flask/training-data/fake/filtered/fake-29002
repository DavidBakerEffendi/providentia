I've been coming here with my husband for a while now and we absolutely enjoy this place. We're huge wine lovers, and their list of Spanish wines are our favorite. Not to mention their food is devine! I normally get their Medallions of filet mignon sauteed with onions, garlic, and mushrooms, which is delicious. Really mouth watering just thinking about it. I want to try their scallops next, and take a look at their lunch menu since I've only been here for dinner. I really wish it wasn't so pricey, but it's definitely worth it if you want to go to a really amazing Spanish Tavern.
