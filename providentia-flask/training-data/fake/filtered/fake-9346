I went here last Sunday afternoon with my girlfriend and her friends. The drinks were good but the bartender was rude, unabashed and borderline insulting. I've been told that the staff of some establishments will act like this to give one an "authentic" New York experience. We did not appreciate it and he did not seem to be picking that up at all. There are many other places to have a drink in Manhattan. I won't be going back to The Bar Room.
