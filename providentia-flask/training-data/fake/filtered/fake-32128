Absolutely awful!  Very unprofessional staff, rude and wait staff was not very knowledgeable about the menu.  We were yelled at for coming too early, all tables were off limits until 1:00! (we got there at 12:45) then after being seated and ordering it took over an hour to get our order which was only soups and salad.  My daughter's order was never even placed and when they came out with the completing wrong item I had to follow them into the kitchen to even have her get something to eat. Oh and their diet soda machine was broken. .. Best part of whole experience was after complaining to management they comped the whole order.  There were other tables around us having similar issues as well. Thank you manager but we won't be coming back.
