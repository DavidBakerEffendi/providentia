It is difficult to get the cooks to actually follow through with any requests for "how you'd like your sandwich."  I've been there several times in a clinch for time, asked for my bacon to be crispy on a BLT, but regardless, they will put a piece of limp, fatty bacon on the sandwich every time with absolutely no regard for your request!   Even when I pointed out that the bacon was not crisp, they argued with me, even though clearly when holding the bacon up in the air it was limp, soggy, and flexible.  When I pointed out that crisp bacon can be held up in a horizontal line that is stiff like a board, they refused to make more bacon!  What ever happened to wanting to please your customer!  This place may be convenient to pull into from Amity Road, quick, and well-known by the blue collar workers and locals who frequent it daily for lunch, but it is not a place for someone who really expects to get a great sandwich.  So, expect it to busy with a lot of truckers, etc., in the parking lot and an rude staff who relies on business from people who are in a hurry and just want to fill up an empty hole!  Oh, and there is no place to sit inside, but there are some run-down picnic tables on a grassy lawn.
