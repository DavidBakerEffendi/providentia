So Fat Salmon provides its diners with great service, atmosphere, and delicious sushi for a very fair price. Make a reservation if possible, because the place is popular, and you don't want to find yourself standing outside the ethereal blue glow of this little Walnut St marvel with a sushi-less tummy. If you want good sushi for a decent price, check this place out.
