Fraunces Tavern is a historical oasis in a strange little area. I absolutely love this place. I have been here for brunch, dinner, and late night drinks. They have my favorite cheese board in the world and are the only place I have found Kopparberg Strawberry Lime Cider, which is basically summer in a gigantic jar. They also have a wonderful beer selection, George Washington's favorite pot pie, and great mixed drinks. Really recommend it.
