Don't expect anything above and beyond when it comes to "late night" service. We arrived at 11:20, we were told the kitchen was closing immediately. Being waiters ourselves we ordered immediately. The food was on point. When we tried to order another round at 11:45 we were discouraged. After paying early (before midnight) and tipping nearly 30%, we were treated with all the lights being turned on, the music stopped, and the wait staff hovering. Before we could finish we were asked to take our things to go. Nothing makes you want to retract a healthy tip like being booted out of a seat you paid for at 12:10. Lesson learned: when they say they close at 12, that means they stop practicing customer service at exactly that moment and you might as well be an inconvenient vagabond who's wander in asking for tap water and spare change.
