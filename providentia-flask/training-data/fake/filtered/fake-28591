This place is pretty solid. All those people that gave it low ratings need to modify their expectations of having all their wishes and desires granted in one eating establishment. The atmosphere is a huge bonus, it's dark and pretty inside. The ingredients are all high quality. it makes for a nice night. Maybe it's just the way I talk, but whenever I mention this place, people think I'm saying "Juicy Penis". so be aware.
