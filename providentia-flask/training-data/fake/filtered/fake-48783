My second time at Ducks...great vibe, everyone is warm and welcoming...opened only 3 weeks, still need to iron out a couple of kinks around organizing service...awesome,creative drinks, and food......loved the presentation....smoked, glazed brisket was fantastic, ribs were tender, smokey, moist and yummy,their beef jerky and "trail mix" is crazy..I think I may be addicted! Owned and operated Â by a very cool brother and sister team...I'll be back, a definite destination!
