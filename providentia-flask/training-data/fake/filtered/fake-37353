This is a french-lebanese cafe and is definitely the most elegant place in NOLIBS and one of the nicest cafes in the city.  The interior is beautiful and the food is unlike anything else in the city.  Great for coffee, breakfast, brunch or lunch.     Try the iced tea with rose or the orange lemonade, which is fresh squeezed.  My favorite item is the Haloumi Press Sandwich and the brioche french toast is so yummy!   They serve la columbe coffee and the owner says the secret to great coffee is having the cleanest machines and she details hers every night.  This place is so clean you could do surgery in the kitchen.     The cafe has a lot of unique items and they are all delicious.  I was surprised how much I loved the dish Foul which is beans.  I recently tried lebne (sp?) - which is a lebanese cream cheese - but better.  My friend swears the hummus is the best in the city and wants the recipe.   It's the place to have a great cup of coffee with your girlfriend, a great place to have a quick meeting or even better THEIR BRUNCH IS FANTASTIC.  I know they don't advertise it but you can definitely do BYOB  BRUNCH (I'd call first and let them know and leave a good tip).  This cafe is perfect for a special get together where you want ambiance but would rather not drop over a 100 dollars ordering memosas for your girlfriend, friends, family etc.  It's like Parc without the price tag.  I absolutely love it.   Don't be intimidated by the menu the owner is very nice and will help describe the menu items which have some french or arabic names.
