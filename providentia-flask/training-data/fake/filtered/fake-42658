This place I had heard of and finally visited Saturday evening.  What a gem!  I am going back again next weekend and many more times!  The food was fantastic the service great, beautiful inside, nice and clean, and great variety more than worth your money.  Had a wonderful family dining experience for all our ages, everyone got what they wanted and then some!
