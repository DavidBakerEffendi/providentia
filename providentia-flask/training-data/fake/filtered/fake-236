Tasty steak, only go here trashed after 3am (When Jim's closes). Which sadly ends up being more often than I would like. Does the trick, lines aren't that bad just be prepared to pay cash immediatly after ordering or they will just brush you aside for the person behind you. Leaps and bounds better than Geno's, but don't measure up to Jim's or Tony Luke's. Not the best steak in Philadelphia, not the worst.
