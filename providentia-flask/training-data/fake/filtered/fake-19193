I've lived on Staten Island my whole life I've driven past this place a ton of times My friends have been here so I've decided to make a late night dinner date with my friends we arrive at the place around 9:45 pm WE GET AN AWESOME WAITRESS BY the  NAME OF GABBY SHE'S FUNNY ATTENTIVE VERY SWEET AND  EASY GOING AND MOST IMPORTANTLY PROVIDED GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE ! I was happy to have her because for me a bad waitress kills my whole mood when I'm out but Again Gabby was incredible. I loved the food ! I ordered a drink called FLOWER BOMB which was lovely  MY ONLY qualm I had was how long we waited for our food and the fact that we kinda felt a little rushed toward closing  time  or table was being cleaned off before we said we were done HOWEVER THEY MADE UP FOR THIS MISHAP BY REPLACING A FEW THINGS THAT WERE THROWN OUT BEFORE WE WERE FINISHED .. Overall I will be back to eat here I loved it I love the atmosphere I loved the set up of this quaint little eatery !
