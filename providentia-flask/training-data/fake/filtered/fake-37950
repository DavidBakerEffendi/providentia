I've been to Cask a few times and always kinda eh.  There is nothing really appetizing for a vegetarian on the menu - hello, veggie burger!  Cheap and simple.  Sure they have a mac and cheese that you could order without bacon but that is soooo heavy (and fatty) or a pizza but it is so boring in flavor.  I got it once without cheese and it tasted like Wonder Bread.  I, like many other vegetarians I know, like a good brew but I rather choose a place where I can eat AND drink.  Beer selection is amazing but nothing special when you consider the other places in the New Haven and Hamden area where you can also get a good craft brews these days, and eat.  Bartenders and waitstaff are always very friendly, which is nice.  BTW- its kinda weird to get carded at the door.  Makes you feel like "you in da club".  Shouldn't the server be doing this?
