bought some sandwiches to take on the road (in the cooler) and just ate the Diavolo, one day later. what a mouth burst of flavors...they just keep coming as you eat and one hour later I'm still dreaming of the taste. great little shop, friendly servers and really good stuff. too bad I only get to Philly every 5 years. this would be the franchise to get.
