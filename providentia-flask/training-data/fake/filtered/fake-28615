Came here the other day with a group of friends. Although not a huge selection, they have good beer on tap. The staff was super-friendly, especially Jeff (owner). He introduced me to Matt and John (bartenders) and they took care of my friends and I. Jeff hooked up rounds of Jameson on the house (my favorite). Buybacks are always a cool gesture. To the females in my group, this was just another bar... Until they tried the food. I ordered the fish tacos with special sauce, and it was off the hook! My g/f wasnt too hungry so she ordered chicken fingers. When they came out, these were chicken fingers on steroids. The dish came with 4-5peices and they were huge! My g/f ended up packing half of it for lunch. I also stole some fish & chips and clams from nearby patrons (friends). I'm not typically a big fan of fish & chips, but when I had it here, man! you can tell the fish is fresh and done crisp. The clams were cooked nicely, but the red sauce was mm... mmm... good. My friend Lui polished off the clam sauce as if it were soup. Another friend ordered a tray of brownies straight from Jeff for our group. Those were just plain old Awesome! Nice chocolate flavor, fudgey, moist, warm, etc... If there were two words to describe the food at the fish market, it would be; Done right.
