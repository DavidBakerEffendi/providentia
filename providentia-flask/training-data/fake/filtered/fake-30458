Wow. Wow. Wow. I enjoyed both of my 2 visits to the South Philly Cantina, but each time I was bothered by the mediocre service. This new one doesn't have those issues and it does have an incredible tequila menu and a far more authentic dinner menu. I lived in Mexico for 6 blissful months and this is the best Mexican food I have ever had. It's like what you get in someone's home only better. The bistec tacos are perfect. And the cabrito is flavorful and intense the way it is meant to be. By far my favorite dish, though is the pulpo. It is the best octopus in the city beating out my old favorite, Dmitri's. I didn't have a drink because I was driving, but I cannot wait to go back and try some margaritas and more of the menu.
