Honestly, this place does not deserve any stars.  My food (just a hotdog & fries) was awful & the service was worse.  Some middle aged woman with a bug up her butt was R-U-D-E to all the customers and never once washed her hands after handling money, then dealing with food!  YUCK.  The staff was very slow.  I asked three times for relish on the dog & was given a snotty answer that she could "only do one thing at a time".  There was no relish on the dog.  I found the place dirty, slow & rude.  We will NOT be going back.
