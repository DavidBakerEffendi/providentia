Awful service when crowded. I spent an hour and 20 minutes waiting for my food in the blazing sun outside. The system for ordering food is an absolute failure for big crowds so if you go, make sure it's not mobbed. The food is great though which is why I didn't give it 1 star, but the I had an awful experience today (enough to write my first yelp review ever). They absolutely need to rethink the process for ordering food, maybe hire a waitress or two?
