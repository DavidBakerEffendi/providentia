I see alot of 4 and 5 star reviews and I can't help but wonder, is the the same rubirosa I went to? I've been a hand full of times and it has progressively got worse with each visit. The server was making comments that might have gotten him fired from any reputable establishment. Everyone else working was very friendly it was just the one douche server. The food was 3 stars at best, average salads that could be made at home. The "amazing" thin crust pizza everyone is raving at can be found at probly 100 other places thru out the city. The sauce is actually pretty good, but some salt is desperately missing. Sure it's kind of a hip and cool place but I'd take quality service over that anyday.
