I go there at least 2 times a week. Im addicted. I swear they put something in the food to keep you coming back. we work right over the bridge in nj, so its an easy commute. It can get costly, but in my opinion well worth it. TRY THE CRUNCHY ROLL...mmm to die for! Bamboo cheesecake is really good too, but costs $8. Thai salsa beef is REALLY GOOD....i've heard bangkok chicken is really good as well. staff are always nice, except for one waiter who plain out came and asked us if we left him a tip, and then proceeded to count the $10 (on a $40 bill) in front of us. i thought that was REALLY rude, but we haven't had him since.
