I am shocked by the previous reviews... I expected to see all 4 and 5 star reviews on here... This is one of my favorite restaurants... It is actually the new spot my family comes to for all occasions. The food is delicious and very reasonably priced. If we are not sitting down at Buon Appetito we are ordering their take out. They have a great deal going on... $25 and you get Chicken Francese with pasta, garlic bread, a salad and a bottle of soda... it says it feeds 4 people... but it really feeds 5-6. Friday is their Seafood day and they have this Fish Salad that my family can't get enough of. I am a big fan of the Lobster Ravioli and the Scallop Scampi... but really everything I've had from here is great. The only thing bad I can say is sometimes the food takes a while.. but I am willing to wait! The deli sandwiches are delicious .... and I almost forgot... Their Tiramisu Â is amazing! I get it everytime.
