The food is great and at a very reasonable price. The management, however, is horrible. Was there today for the second time and the manager made a scene in the middle of the restaurant, yelling at my waitress to "wake up!" and other things that shouldn't be repeated on yelp. Needless to say, they lost a potential life long customer.
