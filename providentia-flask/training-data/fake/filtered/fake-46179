After reading several rave reviews on this site, I decided to try what so many people were saying is basically the best ramen possible. I am a big fan of ramen but had never eaten it at a restaurant before. I often order udon at Japanese restaurants and I enjoy that very much, so I was expecting to be impressed by Ippudo's ramen. I ordered the Akamaru Modern and was decidedly underwhelmed. The noodles (in the straight Kyushu style unlike most ramen) were good, but the broth that so many people were raving about was nothing special. It was quite flavorful, but just wasn't all that memorable. My girlfriend who is from Korea and is more familiar with Japanese food than I am liked the Akamaru Modern less than I did. It was a decent bowl of ramen but I felt like an idiot paying 13 dollars for it (actually 15 if you want an egg boiled in the soup) when I can pick up a case of 24 instant Shin Ramyuns for 13 dollars at Costco. I wonder if people who rave about this ramen have had really good instant ramen. I for one believe that some of the Korean and Japanese brands of instant ramen, including the aforementioned Nong Shim Shin Ramyun, are better than Ippudo's ramen. If you want to go to a noodle restaurant go to Rai Rai Ken and save yourself some money or get a set of udon, kalbi, and rice for 11 dollars at the nearby Udon West instead of paying 16 dollars for ramen and four tiny strips of chicken over rice at Ippudo. That being said, the staff were very friendly at Ippudo and the decor wasn't bad either. If you simply want to try all the ramen that New York City has to offer and don't mind the price, try Ippudo. I caution you not expect the best ramen on the face of the planet though.
