I've been to Zahav several times and have never been disappointed. Last night was no exception, but the level of service was extraordinary, and truly set the bar. We'd pre-ordered the lamb and had the tasting menu.  I mentioned to our waiter, Chris, that I love a particular flavor. He said he had just the right dish in mind.   However, unbeknownst to me, this dish was not part of the tasting menu. Midway through the meal, compliments of the chef, a sublime lamb something arrived for each of the four of us. It was exactly the taste I'd said I loved. Not only did Chris make sure I got to taste it, but he also provided it as something extra to our meal, at no charge. Wow. Then, a little while later, a manager appeared and placed new wine glasses on our table. As he opened a bottle of wine, he explained that the lamb was taking longer than expected and as thanks for our patience (we hadn't uttered a peep about the wait), they were giving us a bottle of wine to enjoy while we wait, and to have with the lamb. They were gracious and generous, and at the same time, unassuming and not all over us. Truly perfection. And yes, each dish was excellent. The complimentary lamb dish (I wish I could remember what it was called) was outstanding, and I'd return just for that. But everything was superb. Thank you to Zahav for a great evening.
