I was at Cuban Pete's tonight and the manager was rude and do not respect your time or money. I waited over a hour and a couple came in and ask about the wait and the manager immediately sat them at a table. I asked him about that and his response to me was he is the manager and he do what he want. We are the customers that spend our money there and we should be respected. Service is horrible and very unsanitary to have a crowded foyer with food passing by.
