Thank you On Tap for handling our very demanding group.  The service was great, you can tell your employees are happy and work hard together as a team.  The food was good and our overall experience was excellent.  I can tell there have been some upgrades to the space since I had been there last.  Keep up the great job, we'll be back for our holiday party!
