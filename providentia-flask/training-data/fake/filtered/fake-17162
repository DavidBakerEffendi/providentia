My fiance and I visit this location quite frequently.  It is by far one of our fave places to go for date nights.  Not only because the food is amazing.  they are well known for there rolls and butter.   our reason for going back time after time is the amazing staff.  I do not think we have ever gotten the same waiter twice.  However, we have always had beyond excellent service.  I dont recall ever having to ask for my drink to be refilled they just bring a refill right away.  always friendly and upbeat. I would say we have been here about ten times or so, never getting same wait staff yet always getting the same phenomenal service as the last.   texas roadhouse at this location has done a wonderful job hireling the best of the best and training them to be the best of the best.   five stars to the staff!!
