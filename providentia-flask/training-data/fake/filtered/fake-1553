If you're in Brooklyn and looking for excellent Indian food, look no further. My husband and I were in from out of town and happened upon this place thanks to the other Yelp reviews. We had the samosa, chicken tikka masala, the chicken briyani, nan, and the cucumber raita. So delicious! The interior of the restaurant is nice, dimly lit, and clean. It's small and intimate. The waitstaff was outstanding; incredibly attentive and friendly. I also got the impression that they do an excellent take out service. Overall, it was a great experience and we will definitely come back next time we're in town.
