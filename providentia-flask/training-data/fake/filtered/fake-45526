Recommend go for "Create-your-own-pho-bowl option". My wife doesn't like beef so she ordered the pho with chicken instead and she loves it because it is dark meat =) The soup really tastes so incredible yummy. Price is considered competitive cheap and big portion. Only one thing I don't like is the atmosphere... It doesn't look hygiene enough. That's why I give 4 stars.
