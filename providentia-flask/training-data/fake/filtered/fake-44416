I would give this place a qualified four stars-- it is not the place for a taco that is blow-your-mind delicious if that's what you're looking for, but it's a fantastic hangout spot with tasty food , very very strong frozen drinks, and cheap beer. I went their with a friend for drinks and we were just looking to relax in a laid back atmosphere. The outdoor seating at picnic tables, pretty lights, and great location just outside the entrance to the Lafayette C train makes this an awesome spot to meet up and start the night. We had the frozen mojito-- it was very good and very STRONG (watch out!). The corn is fantastic. But the carne asada tacos we ordered were just average. Overall it was a fun time and would definitely recommend checking out for a great night outdoors this summer.
