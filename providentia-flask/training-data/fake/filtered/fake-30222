Tried  their new breakfast menu twice.  The food was okay (for fast food) but was disappointed by the absence of availability of decaf coffee. How the heck  can the chain throw big bucks into advertising breakfast and yet not offer decaf coffee?  Have always thought that David Novack, CEO of parent company Yum brands was a pretty  sharp guy but it doesn't take a rocket scientist to know that if you want to compete in the breakfast market you need to include decaf coffee on the menu.
