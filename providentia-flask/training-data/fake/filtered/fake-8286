If you plan to have a great time with friends and do not want to drink and drive DO NOT go to Chickie's & Pete's. When I returned early the next morning I found my car had been towed! Cost $205 to get the car out. I guess they encourage drinking and driving. What a joke!! Â (There were no sporting events at the time.)
