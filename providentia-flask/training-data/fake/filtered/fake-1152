More hyped up than it should be. From the beginning: We made a reservation (DO THIS) and arrived a little early but only had to wait for about 5 minutes for our table. We chatted with the hostess who was very sweet and welcoming, poor girl has to stand next to that door that lets in the freezing air which we felt from our table(!!!!)..she weighed about 5lbs she's going to get hypothermia. The tables are very small and close together, my wife was basically cuddling with the woman next to her. The waitress was okay, I think her deep scary voice threw me off but the service was good. She explained all the items on the menu that we had questions about and was a solid server she just lacked a sweet attitude. The wine list is incredibly lacking and overpriced. I got the meatball appetizer and really didn't care for it but my lamb shank was very good. why no baklava on the dessert menu?! i was too disappointed to order anything. The manager or owner came over and spoke to us as we were leaving and he smelled like cigarettes and booze. I just wasn't in love.
