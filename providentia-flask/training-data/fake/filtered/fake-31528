I am giving BLEND ON THE WATER 4 stars because they have amazing food and service as well. My server Alex Sanchez was a very sweet tiny waitress who took the time out to point us in the right direction from the moment we arrived. Everything she recommended was great and her drink choice 'Sangritas' was truly amazing. My friends and I were very happy with her service she was friendly, funny and definitely made us feel comfortable. That actually made us not even realize how long the food took. I will be back and hoping to be seated with her again. Many Thanks Alex!
