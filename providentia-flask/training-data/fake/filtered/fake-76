This is an awesome restaurant for large parties!  Raoul, the sweetly charming and attentive host, made my birthday truly festive and memorable.  The champagne sangria, the asparagus, the croquettes and the octopus were delicious and reasonably priced.  I would come back with my friends anytime I wanted a comfortable atmosphere, good drinks and a bill that does not ruin the evening.  I made a reservation a couple of days in advance for 8 with no problem.
