And so when I arrived at Sawatdee, on the corner of 15th and South, for my usual Friday get together dinner with the gurls, I was ready to be blown, away.  By the spices of course. I order the standard Thai iced tea ($2.95) for starters, which is a strong black sweet tea served condensed milk but like most of the Thai ice teas that I have sampled in Philadelphia it is missing the combination of Thai spices, such as ground tamarind and star anise mixed in with the drink, that gives it its extra oomph. My main dish was the Pad Ka Prao Talay ($13.95) which is seafood served in a chili garlic sauce and it was more garlic than chili. I ordered it with the expectation of having the flavors of a Falcon Studio orgy in my mouth but what I really got a cuddle fest with a good chick flick for two. It's not that the dish was bad or that it was bland, but it was just missing that bang. Dessert made up for it as the end with their Thai custard with sticky rice ($5). The sweet smooth coconut custard mixed with creamy sticky rice brought tears of nostalgia to my eyes and scenes of the sun kissed beaches and tall elegant waving coconut trees. I think that is the true magic of food, it is not something that you not only enjoy but also have an experience with. Dear Sawatdee, ! ? Xoxo MOAF Overall Rating: 3.5/5
