The best burger ever made, hands down, no competition. Their BURGER alone got this place a Michelin star, so forget everything you know about burgers and come try this one.  I come here every single time I come to NYC because this is not just the best burger I have ever had, it really is one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth, ever.  The fries are really good, too.  The beers are great, and they have a good selection, and while their house brews seem a little expensive (shouldn't house brews be cheaper?) they do have Pork Slap Ale if you're feeling cheap but still want a decent beer. They have some very tasty and very interesting appetizers. Try the deviled egg.  It sounds plain, but man, it is so damn good. The gnudi was SO GOOD.  The devils on horseback, OMG delicious. What a cool place.  Such great food, they definitely have a world-class chef working here, you can tell.  There are no reservations, so if you don't want to wait for a long time (1-2 hours), come early, and come before Thursday.  Even then, expect a wait of at least 45 minutes, but you can walk down to Hudson for a drink; I recommend a little tapas bar called Caliu, which has 2 different sangrias, and when we went there we got the BEST little cheese plate for free just by checking in with FourSquare.  It's totally worth the $6 or whatever it normally costs, it was really, really good.  There's also a cool little bookstore called BookMarc another block down on the corner of 11th and Bleecker.  There's lots of other places to check out, too, it's a great little neighborhood to walk around in.
