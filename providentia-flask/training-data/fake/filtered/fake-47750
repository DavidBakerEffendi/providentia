I'm from Wisconsin and took a vacation to NY to have REAL NY pizza, Grimaldi's gave it to me! Unfortunately I had to take it to go, but just the small experience I had of walking in, smelling the beautiful air and seeing all of the sexy men working hard to make wonderful pizza's through the glass divider, made the pie so much better then i anticipated!
