I love this place! The staff are friendly, the restaurant is clean, the meatballs (I have had the chicken, traditional, and 'special balls') are DELICIOUS! They are flavorful, juicy, and the aged provalone is out of this world. I appreciate that they have a focus, the do one thing, and they do it well. I wish them the best of luck and encourage anyone who enjoys a good meatball to try it, you will not be dissappointed!
