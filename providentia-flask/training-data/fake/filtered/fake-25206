Although I love Vegan food and the food is GREAT these people SUCK when it comes to customer service.  I have been to Champs multiple times in person and the service has been downright rude - rushing me out, rolling eyes at my toddler daughter and getting orders wrong.  I mistakenly chose to order from them via Seamless three times.  Two out of three they have been over 1.5 hours to deliver the food and one time arriving with lemonade spilled all over the bag and seeping into one of the entrees.  When we called to let them know they said there was nothing they could do, "sorry" and hung up the phone on us.  Bottom line: If you want delicious vegan food, pick it up from Champs. Don't try to eat in and DEFINITELY do not order over Seamless unless you want to be tired and hangry.
