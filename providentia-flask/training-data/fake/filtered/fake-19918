Live close by and wanted to check it out since it is in the neighborhood. It was early in the evening and although the place was 90% empty, we were told that no seats were available. The hostess/server was nice enough but clearly overwhelmed by the prospect of our walking in. I commented that I thought it was a walk in place, and she shared reservations are taken for 6 and the place would be filled in an hour. She offered the chance to hurry up and eat Anyway, this is not a knock on the place but either it should be a precious restaurant with reservations and sufficient service staff OR be more downtown casual and inviting to the neighbors. You can not have it both ways. We walked over to Back Forty at 12th and B. Good food, very welcoming and by the time we left the place was packed.
