I've visited only once and had their basic Mac and cheese (with bacon). It was amazing! The textures in the dish and the balance of the three key ingredients (macaroni, cheese and bacon) was almost perfect. I would have given them 5 stars but I'm reserving that for after I taste a few more items. Oh yes I'm definitely going back. Again and again and again.
