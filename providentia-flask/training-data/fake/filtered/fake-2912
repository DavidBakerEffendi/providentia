Awful.  Awful enough that I created a yelp account just so I could chime in with my vote for awful. I should have walked out after my first experience of their awful service.  The hostess asked how many, I replied and then she picked up menus and started walking into the restaurant without saying anything.  I tentatively started to follow her and she turned around and said, "Where do you think you are going?"  Pardon?  So I walked back to the hostess station where I stood ignored for a few minutes before the manager/owner asked me if I was being helped.  He grabbed a waiter who seated me in their extra room across the courtyard.  It was almost empty and he put the menus down on the table next to the constantly slamming door and walked out without saying a word. Again, at this point, I should have left. The waiter then refused to give me water or anything until my friend arrived and asked me three times when she was coming in the ten minutes it took for her to get there.  Then he told us we had to order everything at once - appetizers and entree, took our order and we never saw him again.  Someone else brought our food - one wrong dish and the other pretty cold.  We didn't even bother to send them back, we wanted out of there. Luckily we'd brought wine.  That was the best thing about this meal.  It wasn't even the conversation because the music was so loud the waiter even had to keep saying, "WHAT?" just for us to order.  Twice the owner walked into that room and turned the music down and each time the waitstaff walked right back over and turned it up. I'm glad I live on the West Coast and never will have a chance to be near this restaurant again.  AWFUL.
