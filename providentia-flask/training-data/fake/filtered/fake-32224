I really enjoyed this place. The atmosphere was quaint, the staff are very friendly, and they had a nice selection of  food to choose from. I ordered the croque monsieur. It was very tasty and I enjoyed it a lot. It also came with a salad on the side.  The owners are French so when it comes to generating that French bistro feel, they know what they're doing. i will come back.
