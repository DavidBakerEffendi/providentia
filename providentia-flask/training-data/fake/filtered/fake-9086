My friends sing the praises of the renown Phat Lady but I think their simplest meals are their best meals.  The Bacon, Egg, and Cheese omelette (on half a hoagie) roll is fantastic ANY time of the day.  Overall, Hoagie Haven is a great restaurant. So much variety- there's something for everybody, no matter what your taste.  Don't be afraid to take a peek at other people's orders as they are being made. You may just discover your new favorite sandwich.
