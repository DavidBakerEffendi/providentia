When we saw they were making a Houlihans right by us we were set to be the first ones there. Well for one, its a new place so dont expect the waiter/waitress to know any of the food your talking about. We had a very nice waitress and the staff seems cool. Its crowded but comfortable. The best part about this place is the FOOD. It.....was.....amazing. Try the shrimp scampi. I swear you"ll jizz on yourself.lol. Anyways overall its AWESOME and a must go!
