Ok, so this for all you jerks that give restaurants and bars great reviews when they clearly are undeserving. Continue, if you'd like to read a TRUTHFUL review.  Traif looked cool, my friend and I have visited a handful of times.  We've noticed that the only time we really enjoyed the food was when we showed up shitfaced drunk. The servers lack competency and have barely a clue of the food served in this restaurant.  The wait time is standard, and they try to keep you entertained with Alice in Wonderland style complimentary cups of soup. I ordered the Brussels sprouts with grapes, puffed rice, cherry tomatoes, etc.  My first bite tasted like a bad acid trip.   There was an explosion of repulsive flavors and tastes which I couldn't stomach.  When the waitress asked how I was doing, I told her that everything but the Brussels sprouts were edible.  She addressed my concern and insisted on taking the food back.  Once reviewed by the manager the waitress returned to tell me that the brussels sprouts were cooked fine and that if I wanted my dish she could bring it back to me.  WTF. I told her to bring the dish back, and ate everything but the Brussels sprouts.  I've never been quite as disgusted or embarrassed, all at the same time.
