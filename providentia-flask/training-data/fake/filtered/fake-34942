I heart Frank Liotti (the bartender). Not only is he charismatic, funny man - his Manhattan rocked my world. I have not tried their food, so this 5-star rating is really for the talents of their bartender (75% of my score) and the surreal setting (25% of my score), which management pulls of quite well. I swung through here with a few friends on a Friday night a short while back and had drinks at the bar for one or two hours. Such a picturesque setting - nestled into the end of an alley, Freemans feels like you are stepping on to a movie set. And what a scene - in typical New York fashion, at the end of this alley way, you step into what seems like a completely random place, only to find that it is bursting with put together people lapping up their dinner and laughing across their tables. The icing on the cake, though, was the bartender's skills and demeanor. He even gave us a little tutorial in Manhattan's. I was not surprised to find out toward the end that Frank also has a career as a standup comic - because he kept us laughing too (but not in a constant, conversation interrupting way - very appropriate, well-timed interludes or punctuations throughout our time at the bar).
