Great little eatery/market for the area. Not a place you would pick up lunch every day but maybe a daily chocolate chip cookie (for 1.50 and the size of my face) or other sweet treat. Don't get the roast beef & cheddar pre-made sandwich. Unless you like really chewy hard to eat, looks almost raw and is fatty roast beef. Waste of $8. Do get the prosciutto & fig pre-made sandwich, which is much tastier! Don't get the coffee, overpriced and slow service if you're on the go. Do get their salads ... all of them are delicious! (around $8-15) Don't go there for lunch every day ... you will go broke! Overall, you're paying for the ambiance, name and service which is all excellent. Cute place for a lunch date so grab someone and go!
