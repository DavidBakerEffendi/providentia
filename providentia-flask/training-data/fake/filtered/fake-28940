Stopped by for burgers and beers on Friday at the end of happy hour.  I cannot complain served by a very well versed in beer male bartender the entire night. But, I purchased one drink from a very fast paced  female bartender with short black hair. After barely finishing half of the beer and explained that I wasn't going to finish the rest, she immediately went to the POS system and charged me for the beer. Her explanation was  that her letting me "taste" the beer was the reason she charged me for the full beer.  RUDE! I was taken aback. We immediately paid for our bill and left. That is not customer service even after letting the customer taste a "sip" of the beer! I will take my business some where else. This  bartender should be talked to by someone  about whether its Prime 16 policy to make people pay for beer they don't  like.
