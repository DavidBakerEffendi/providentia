Dammit!!! Why are you so good!!??!! Absolutely dig this pizza and without any inclination to justify my unequivocal bias towards this hot spot I will say this: go with someone who can carry a conversation. Yeah, most likely you will be waiting a short while (30-45-1hr) so going with someone who is a mute or an introvert will find you talking to yourself most of the time or to the other patrons who all usually speak some sort of foreign language with minimal understanding of the english language. I've done this twice. With two different people. Long story!! Anyways, the pizza was absolutely delicious and baked with fresh ingredients. This is as good as it gets people!! My favorite is the Tomatoe & Basil Pizza with extra cheese.
