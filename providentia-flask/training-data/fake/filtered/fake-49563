This is the best sushi restaurant in Northern New Jersey. Their apps, their rolls and especially their specialty rolls are excellent. They seem to use the best quality ingredients. On a Saturday,  they get pretty busy from about 5pm. Their service is excellent, and it is a really cosy  yet modern atmosphere. I also think it is exceptionally reasonably priced. Zen was rated as the best sushi restaurant in NJ by the star ledger last year - not that i trust the star ledger - but I do trust my own taste buds. Check this place out.
