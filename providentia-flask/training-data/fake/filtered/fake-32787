I love Penang for a quick, inexpensive takeout meal, late night run-by or lunch. They have a comprehensive menu and I love that many items are so authentic they understand the American taste buds may be challenged (hence the caution on many to consult the server before ordering!)  I'll admit that not everything has been a hit, but the stuff I love is relatively cheap and keeps me coming back: Boneless Curry Chicken with Rice, Mee Siam, Beef Chow Fun (puts the "fun" in Chow Fun!), Pad Thai and several of the "Noodles in soup" dishes, such as Prawn Mee and Java Mee. The decor is fun, intimate and funky, very open with industrial exposed walls and venting that adds to the urban and urbane nature of the experience, if you're dining in.  They keep it moving, so not a place for a lingering meal usually, but the intimacy can make it an interesting date night option and the large tables make for a great group throw-down spot. For those who are looking for a change of Asian pace from Chinese, Japanese and Thai (or even Indian), Penang offers a great mash-up that is uniquely Malaysian and slightly out of your comfort zone in the best kind of way. Hope you enjoy!
