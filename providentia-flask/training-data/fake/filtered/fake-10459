This is probably my favorite place in the world. The drinks are super cheap, everyone that works there is pleasant, you can always run into Rob & Stef from Zipperhead/Crash Bang Boom. I must say, in all honesty, taco Tuesday is the biggest selling point for me. I was expecting the worst, but aside from the tacos being room temperature, they're not horrible. Two more words: Waffle. Fries. Who in the world could ask for anything more? PLUS! you get toys. What could be better than free toys?
