This place is AMAZING! I live around the corner on Atlantic Ave. I have known the owner since I was a little girl before the old restaurant burned down. Now 10 years later I return home more frequently. The owner still remembers me and always comes over to chat. Every time I am in New York I make sure I eat here (one a month). This place is truly amazing. The staff is great and so is the SANGRIA MY FAVORITE!!!! I WILL ALWAYS CONTINUE TO EAT HERE and Bring new friends with me!
