This is one of my favorite Queen Village spots, especially for happy hours! It's quiet, chill, and generally pretty crowd-less, which is a big plus for me. Two things keep me coming back again and again...Abita on tap (my favorite), and their po boys. Oysters, fried shrimp, soft shell crab...they're all delicious. Be warned that some of their dishes are a little bit spicy, but the servers are pretty good at telling you before you order what's going to be a little hot. They also have an outdoor dining area for when the weather is nice. Also, make sure that you get dessert - especially the buttermilk gelato, if they have it on the menu!
