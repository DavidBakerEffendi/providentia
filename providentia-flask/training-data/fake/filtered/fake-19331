I went to twenty manning for the first time since their reimaging/renovation. It's been a while since I have eaten there, though I have eaten at their sister restaurant audrey claire more frequently. Food was good overall. service was better in the beginning half of the meal than it was for the second, but that may have been because it got really busy. We ordered a few appetizers (calamari had a good texture, but was too salty to finish the dish. crab cakes were better) and burgers for the main meal. the tuna burger and bison burger were great. big food portions and tons of fries. both were cooked wel. my only complaint is that they have a new corkage free of $35! we weren't properly informed of this fee when we arrived. Audrey claire is still Â free corkage as many other byobs are, but twenty manning is not really a byo. they're trying to deter outside wines so that customers drink their restaurant's own alcohol to make a profit, though i have to say they're making more off of corkage fees than if you ordered a few glasses of wine or drinks there. it seems to be an arbitrary fee as some people were priced at $20, 25, or $30 recently. We complained that we weren't properly informed so they reduced the corkage fee, but wow...$35 has to be a first for me, especially in philly which is known to be a fee free byo city. If you plan to go to twenty manning, order drinks there or drink elsewhere before/after eating...not worth the corkage fee when you've already paid for the wine!
