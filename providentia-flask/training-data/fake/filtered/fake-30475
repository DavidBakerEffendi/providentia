Perfection, as long as you go early.  My friends and I try to have lunch as soon as they open, because this place is so good it is almost always crowded after that!  This place made me truly appreciate bean curd, which is wonderful in their bibimbap.  Most of the staff is great, especially the older lady we had most recently who was more of a mom than a waitress.
