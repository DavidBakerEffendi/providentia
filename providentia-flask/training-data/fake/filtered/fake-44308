The Parker House Inn is everything you could want in an Inn.  Amazing food and a cozy atmosphere.   I always feel like I am eating delicious food in some obscure town tucked away in Europe somewhere - It's fantastic. What a great escape.  The wait staff and Inn keepers are delightful.  Such a pleasure to walk down from your room to be greeted by such lovely individuals.  Sitting on the porch at night and having a meal and or a drink and then going right up to bed in their cozy rooms...Ugh I want to go back immediately just writing about it.  I have stayed here three times and loved my experience each time!  You would be a fool not to pay the Parker House Inn a visit.  Also, you don't just have to stay here to have dinner or drinks here!
