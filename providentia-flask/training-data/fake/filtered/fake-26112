One of my personal favorites in the EV.  I've been here numnerous times since it's opening and have never been let down.  The chef (Jeremy Spector) has done a great job at creating dishes I routinely find myself craving (Brandade and Baked Oysters espeically).  I love the cozy setting they've created and the fact that I always feel welcome.  Normally I'd review an individual dish but I've had almost everything on the menu over the past 8 months and all I can do is invite you to experience all of it for yourself.
