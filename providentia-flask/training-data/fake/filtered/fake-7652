This place is the dankest. A friend and I stumbled in here on our way to the Knitting Factory, and stuffed our faces with amazing Mediterranean food/imported beers. Started with the beets/lentils, a great appetizer salad, before working into the chicken shwarma platter and the lamb pita wrap things. So delicious! We were so full after all of the amazing food. Deliciousness aside, the place gets five stars for the intangibles. The plate presentation was great (I may have been watching Chopped recently). The staff was very friendly, chatting with us as we sat at the bar, offering us house-made hot sauces, and even giving us a complimentary dessert for no apparent reason. The music was great too - the place had a very relaxed and trendy vibe. All in all, it was a great dining experience - so much so that I'm actually taking the time to leave them a 5-star review.
