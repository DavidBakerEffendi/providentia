This is my go to place for seafood in queens.  It's a not a big restaurant and it's usually a wait for a table, but the most I've had to wait was 30 mins and that was for a group of 10 people.  Everyone is very nice the hostess will keep you updated on how much longer it would be. While you wait, they serve you a glass of wine. Nice touch.  As soon as you sit down, they serve you hot bread with olive oil, delicious. Appetizers I usually go with the large Greek salads (with a brick of feta cheese), fried calamari and stuffed grape leaves.  As a main course, the stripe bass and sea bass are awesome and nicely portioned. Stuffed shrimp with crabmeat is a winner.  The lemon potatoes are awesome and dessert is on the house.  I feel full just writing about this place, that's how much food they give you.
