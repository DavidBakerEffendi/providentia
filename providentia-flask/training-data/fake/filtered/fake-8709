Best Italian restaurant in the city and, a bonus, not in Center City, but close to my Port Richmond/Fishtown home. Getting reservations on Saturday night is a pain...that is why only 4 stars.  And even then you will likely wait a bunch of time.  Not fun if it's February and you're crowded into their little vestibule with 19 other people.  The restaurant is very boisterous when full as well, so it's not a place for a quiet, romantic dinner for two. But the food makes up for it all.  Try the turista menu and pick and share dishes with your table-mates.  They pair really unique flavors together that you won't think will go together, but they do in your mouth. If you want a quiet time, try going in early (5:30 ) on a Sunday.  Not many people know they're open now on Sundays.  But the menu is set by the chef and you have to eat what they are making that day.  The food is so good, you won't miss being able to choose yourself.  But it's a great way to get into this very popular restaurant on a weekend.
