Amazing food & Service As always I get five star service. Was at SOCO last week and had my favorite the fried chicken w/red velvet waffle, mac & Cheese and I had a glass of moscato. One small suggestion is to hire a seasoned expert mixologist, whomever has created the drink menu did not match up creativity with taste. I know a few people who can make outstanding drinks if you'd like a recommendation. Otherwise, great times were had! Â Robert was fantastic! check out my YouTube review- youtu.be/Bl0_cVbuRU4
