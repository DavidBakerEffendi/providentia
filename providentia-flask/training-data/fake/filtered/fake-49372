I've been here a few times and loved the drink and the atmosphere  but a about 6 weeks ago I went with a friend and there was hair in her food. We complained and they brought  her anther order and guess what? There was hair in that too. The worse part about the night was, the Manager that came out  to speak with us had the attitude of " I could give a fuck". Needless to say this was the last the last time i was  there and i have no plans to go back ..... I was not as disappointed over hair being in her  food as much as i was disappointed that no one made it seem like it was a big deal...
