I live in the area and have been wanting to try this place. Finally I did so with a friend the other night. The menu was not very appealing to me at all. My friend and I ended up ordering the potatoes and lamb tapas. The potatoes were way to salty and I like salt. The lamb had no flavor and was chewy. The highlight was the Rioja White wine that was a very pleasant white. I'll probably pass up this place in the future.
