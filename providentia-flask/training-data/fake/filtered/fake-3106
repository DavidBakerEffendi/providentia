It sucks that they don't take reservations, because this place got pretty crowded. All I can say is the earlier the better. They take all credit cards, I was worried they wouldn't take my Amex because it was such a small place. Love that it's BYOB! The waiters were great!! And the food and speed of service were even better! Classic Cuban cuisine with wonderful flavor. Best rice I have had since my grandmother. If you are looking for someplace different and are a self proclaimed foodie, this place is it! Whether it's a night out with friends or romantic evening this place is made for both.
