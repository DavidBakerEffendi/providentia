Well, first of all, I've got a pretty refined pallet.  I've traveled to over 40 countries and enjoyed the cuisine of each place visited. Girlfriend and I went to this restaurant after reading all the reviews and arrived with excitement.  The menu was diverse and looked tasty.  We wanted everything on the list but settled on 5 appetizers and wine.   The food - These guys should learn to season with something other than salt.  The food tasted as if someone spilled a container of Morton's on everything!!!!  So much potential and  we were tremendously disappointed.  It sucked!!! The wine - amazing.  Nuff said. The service - top notch. If u want great wine and nothing else, I recommend this place.  They should fire the chefs, empty out the fridge and load the place up with their tasty wine.
