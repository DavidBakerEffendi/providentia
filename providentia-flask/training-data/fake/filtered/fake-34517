HANDS DOWN BEST PIZZA    NO QUESTION ABOUT IT # ONE !!! When I got my driver's license, some 47 years ago, the first place I drove was to STAR.  Fast forward to age 64 I now go with our son who is 26 ! 2nd Generation.  Everything on the menu it terrific.  I have had the pleasure of having BRENDA take our orders from her first day "on the job" Yes...the wait can be long for the food, only because they are very very busy, gaining new patrons daily and the kitchen ain't gettting any bigger. Also, I have always loved the Original cola, Royal Crown (RC) Cola and that is all they sell at Star.   Finally a place that realizes THE cola that is really the best tasting.   Parking is ample, a cop is usually on duty to watch you & your vehicles.   One day - I hope to meet the owner & shake his hand, for giving me such a great place to dine, and the #1 pizza in the land.  I do miss the small one serving of Merlot in glass bottles.  I wish they would return.  HINT
