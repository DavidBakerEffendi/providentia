What a disappointment. My friend and I ordered a cheesesteak with whiz and onions. The steak cost $8.50. Here are the pros: it was fast Cons: it was small, the meat had a lot of gristle and was overcooked, and there was hair in it (from the looks of the hair it must have been curly arm hair--I hope!). I can overlook the hair. It's pretty nasty, but this stuff happens. I can't overlook the bad meat, small sandwich and price. Go somewhere else. Try Philip's.
