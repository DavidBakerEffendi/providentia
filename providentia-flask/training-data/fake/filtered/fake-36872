My wife and I had such a great experience at Walters that we finally created a yelp account just so we could write a review of this place. When we arrived there was a bit of a wait so we decided to grab a drink at the bar. Thankfully 2 seats opened up and since the bar was full service we decided to stay there. We ordered the spicy deviled eggs, the raw bar sample platter and we split the fried chicken for dinner. Everything was absolutely delicious. The seafood was fresh and served perfectly. The portion was generous so we were a little full when the chicken arrived but it ended up being the perfect amount of food. Â  In addition to the great food, the bartender was extremely helpful and friendly; exactly the reason this place will do well. He offered us a complimentary glass of white wine because he thought it was a great pairing for our oysters, and he was right. The service was phenomenal, the place was immaculate, and the food was delicious. We are so happy to have a place like this in Fort Greene and will happily continue to dine there.
