This is overhyped, overpriced and underwhelming. Maybe because pizza is a big part of the menu, there were as many families with kids here as at a Pizza Hut. This would be fine, except you come here expecting a great dinner in a sophisticated atmosphere, not an Applebee's ambience. Aside from having my chair bounced several times by the kid at the next table, the food and service were also disappointing. A flan with a side of gelato was served with the gelato already melting. A request to split a glass of wine was answered by having one glass plopped on our table, for us to negotiate the pour. No dish was particularly memorable. Not worth journeying up Broad St.
