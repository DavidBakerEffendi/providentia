been there 3 times now, twice with my wife for a lazy brunch on sundays ( my wife is a fan of their bloody marys), and once when a friend of ours joined us for a mini pub crawl. Enjoyed each vist., A friend told me they beefed up ( punn intended) their veggie options on the menu which we will soon go back & check out. The staff has been great on each visit.
