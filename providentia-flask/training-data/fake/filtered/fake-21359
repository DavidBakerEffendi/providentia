What can I say?  I recommend the place constantly.   Must trys include the "Sangrita"- a frozen margarita with sangria poured over!, plaintain encrusted chicken, empanadas, coconut shrimp, garlic rotisserie chicken... I've been there in groups of 2 to groups of 10.  Call ahead!   So happy that they are now open for lunch!
