I was excited to go there because i kept reading reviews about how they have the 'best burger in nyc', but i'm sorry to say - i was disappointed. I really liked the fact that it's a dive bar with cheap beers, but the burger wasn't even close to being the best i've had (and it was over cooked too!) .  The quality of the meat is just ok - nothing special at all - same with the bun, cheese and fries.  They are cheap, but i would have gladly paid an extra couple of bucks to get the 'best burger in nyc'. If i was in the hood, i might give it another shot, but i wouldn't make it a destination.
