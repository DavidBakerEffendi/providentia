I have had Luigi's food a couple times now, once delivery and once pickup and after giving it two chances I have to say I see no reason to eat here. Last night my husband and I got a cheesesteak and penne a la vodka to go. The cheesesteak was so bland and flavorless and the bread was chewy and bland as well. I would almost have wished it were greasier because at least then there may have been some flavor. the fries it came with were soggy and flavorless as well. The penne vodka was not a vodka sauce at all and tasted and looked more like a melted velveeta sauce. It tasted nothing like what I expected, the sauce was really thick and cheesy/creamy in a suspect way, the pasta was overdone. The one time I got delivery I ordered their special Blue pizza because I love pan pizzas. It was really kind of soggy and greasy when it arrived (after not very long, I will give them that). The crust was not what I would expect from a good pan pizza. The pizza looks good for picking up a slice in store, but overall I think there are better places in the neighborhood with similar menus. Pete's cheesesteak was much better and Fairmount pizza was far more flavorful.
