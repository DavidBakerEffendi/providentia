Barbuzzo is a terrific restaurant! In the many times that I have been there, I have never had anything bad there! The food is out of this world. The staff there is really great and is always there when you need something. I went there on a Friday afternoon and there was a chance of rain but my friends and I decided to sit outside. When, the rain started, we hadn't gotten our entrees and the restaurant did everything they could to get us them so we could take them home. They were really accommodating!
