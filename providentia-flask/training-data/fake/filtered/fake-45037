Rye is a restaurant in Williamsburg which serves a good seasonal food . The space is decorated in a dark wood with a big bar. I came with a party of four , we were seated quickly. The waiter was professional , he did not spend a lots of time with us because that night the place was busy. We started with cocktails which were not good and we quickly switched to wine. The food was great. If you go there order wine and food do not experiment with cocktails.
