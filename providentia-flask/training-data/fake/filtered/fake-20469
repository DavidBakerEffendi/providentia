I don't think I'll be going back any time soon.   I was there with a party of three during restaurant week.  First, the valet is located across the street at Positano Coast (where we probably should have gone to eat).  Its not easy for women in heels to walk across the street so it would be a good idea to drop them off first.  The table was not ready when we arrived for our reservation.  When out table was ready, were were not given the option to transfer the bar tab to the table.  I realize that the bartenders rely on tips, but they should be able to work that out with the servers.  At the table, in serving the wine, the server broke the cork in half in the bottle, left with the bottle and then returned with the wine in a decanter.  We should have been offered a new bottle.  This sort of thing is not something I expect at a decent restaurant.  Overall, we didn't feel very welcomed and the food was nothing special.  Best thing was the hummus and bread.  I've heard that the lamb is wonderful, but was not available.  I heard in the past you could order it in advance, but not anymore.  They have it or they don't.
