What a lovely restaurant! Went here on a recommendation from some friends, and loved it! The inside is very nicely decorated, with a spectacular cozy bar. The staff was extremely friendly, and the manager made sure our experience was a good one.  My husband and I each ordered steaks, which were cooked perfectly. The side dishes (whipped potatoes and asparagus) were an excellent compliment to our steaks.  Chocolate cake and carrot cake were the perfect ending to our meal. Highly, highly recommend!
