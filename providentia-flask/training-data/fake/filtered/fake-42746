A jewel of a bakery! This place always makes me smile whether I walk in to be greeted with a complimentary warm slice of fresh bread, or whether I drive by and remember what it's like. Besides top quality bread, their Panini are delicious and the atmosphere is always warm and welcoming. Try it, you will want to go again!
