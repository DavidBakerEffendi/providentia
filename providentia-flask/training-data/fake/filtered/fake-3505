the gentleman working on the pizzas shuffles over from counter to oven. and though i love the attention he gives to his creations, boy is it painful to watch how slowly this is all taking. after all, we are in ny. we're all about getting things done. but despite the tortoise-like pace at which these pizzas are coming out, the slices are definitely worth it. its a bit oily for my liking, but blot that oil off - i know, lame - and start munching. its bizarre. the first bite, i was thinking, "not bad". then bite by bite, it got better and better, til by the end i was won over. that was a damn good pizza. just fyi: its a thin crust with no bald spots or clumps. they are cash only. not many tables/chairs, but some. you will probably be waiting. its def worthwhile if its not too much of a trek. go with an appetite or a group: 5$/slice vs 25$/pie.
