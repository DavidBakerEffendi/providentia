Good food, prepared well. Staff is always welcoming. I've been here for dinner and brunch and both meals were very good. Bartender makes a great old fashioned. I love the cheese grits, shrimp and poached egg for brunch. Also like that they have bagel hole bagels. Good place to take the parents/in-laws when they visit.
