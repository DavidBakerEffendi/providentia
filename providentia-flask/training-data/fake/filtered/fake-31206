Overpricy.  I order Pollo a la brasa, It was dry. Jalea Especial, It had nothing special, just salty and the fish was spoiled. Anticucho,  it was raw, and not enough aji panca. ceviche,  the amount of food wasnt even enough for a baby. but i admit it was the only  dish that in taste was ok. The owner went to the table and wanted to describe the flavor of spoiled.   The place look nice, but music too loud you cant even talk, and service very empiric, they try so hard to be fine dinning, without even knowing what that is that they forget how to cook Peruvian. Total ripoff
