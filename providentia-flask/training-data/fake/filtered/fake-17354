I went in w/ my mother to get a platter of sashimi take-out but they didn't have any party platters so ended up buying sashimi deluxe instead.  The wait was what i expected to be and while waiting, the lady brought water for us to drink (tasted like tap water)..and gave us an extra miso soup.  (I guess Sashimi Deluxe is for one person since there were total of 2 soups and 1salad.)  I thought all that was nice until we got home w/ the Sashimi and when we opened the container, we could tell the fish was not fresh and of low quality.  I had went there previously, and did not notice it (i went during 1/2 price Wednesday w/ a friend) since we ordered a lot of rolls but Sashimi's had a fishy taste to it and you were able to tell the fish was not fresh at all.  Needless to say, I wanted my money back but decided never to go back there again.  The most important thing about sushi is that they're fresh and it did not meet our expectation.  Now i know, 1/2 price or not (or whether it's rolls or sashimi), i'll never go there again.  I give one star for their service, which wasn't superb either.  I guess i'm being generous.
