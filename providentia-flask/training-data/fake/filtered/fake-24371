Stopped by for a lunch time bite with friends and kids in tow. This was a pleasant addition to a neighborhood that has benefited from well conceived "slow" food outlets. Had the chance to try several sandwich options, soup, and coffee. The duck confit was underwhelming, however the burger, emental grilled cheese, and roasted chicken sandwiches were sublime. All things considered, their coffee is the shining star, drip and espresso were exceptionally brewed and presented. The space is comfortable and bright, service was gracious, and small market is well curated. Welcome to the neighborhood. I look forward to returning.
