Not only is this the best Indian vegetarian restaurant at which I've eaten (and I've lived and eaten in Jackson Heights for 14 years, and overseas in a half-Indian country for two years), but it is probably the best vegeatarian restaurant I've encountered, period.  The food is wonderful.  The room has a very pleasant ambience and the staff is gracious and proficient.  And after, or before you eat explore the enticing neighborhood, accessible via 5 different subway lines.
