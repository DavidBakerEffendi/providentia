wow.  Amazing time.  My buddy just graduated with his MBA, so we made plans to check out vernicks afterwards.  about 10 of us went over and stood up front by the floor to ceilng windows and had small plates, toasts and drinks.  The cocktails were amazng, great beers on tap too.  After tasting almost all the small plates, we had to try the dry aged steak; and it was life changing!  Im from New Jersey, but an hour and a half drive is nothing for a meal like that.  Next time it will be just my wife and I, but whether you have a group looking to try everything on the menu like we did, or a intimate evening out, this is the spot.
