If you want to wait more than 2.5 hours for your food, this is the place.  Never again will I order from this place.  When I called to complain a worker indicated that it would be leaving in a few minutes.  Half hour later I called and it still had not left.  He put me on the the owner "George" who was ZERO help.  Come on people!  This is NYC - dont you know that people can go eat anywhere and word of mouth is everything!  Customer service and prioritizing orders is a MUST!  This kind of food is not made fresh it is made in advance...how hard is it to wrap pre-grilled chicken in a pita?
