My girlfriend and I have been eating at Agricola almost every week since they opened.  It is by far our favorite restaurant in Princeton.  Really, it's one of our favorite spots anywhere. The food is excellent.  For dinner, make sure to try the flatbreads.  We usually split a salad, a flatbread (the mushroom flatbread is our favorite), and an entrée.  For brunch, split a sticky bun on the side.  Our go-to choice is (split between two) a salad, sticky bun, and eggs benedict.   The atmosphere is really pleasant and down to earth.  And the decorations are really creative, keeping with the "farm-to-table" theme.  The staff have always been nice and helpful.
