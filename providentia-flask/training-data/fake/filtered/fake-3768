Wife and I went for the two day Pig Roast and Clam Bake last year. Last year we BOTH ordered Pig Roast and enjoyed it. We eagerly awaited this year's event. This year Saturday wife had Clam Bake and she absolutely LOVED it. I had Pig Roast and Â liked it. Wait staff was very pleasant. We enjoyed their hard cider. I had thought that maybe we would go again Sunday and maybe switch dishes, but music was too loud so won't do that. We actually had to RAISE our voices to talk to each other at the table. I may be tempted to go for brunch, but a good idea may be to call on phone to get an idea of music loudness before going. They lose one star because of loud music, sounded like a disco.
