I have to say that I LOVED LOVED LOVED this place! I went today for lunch with a co-worker and had the wings with the rub and spinach salad with cranberries and walnuts and a bacon vinaigrette...but wait that's not the end of this love affair. We split a slice of caramel streusel cheese cake. When I tell you this was awesome, so awesome that we asked if it was boxed or homemade and our waitress got the cook/chef to come out to us. She is the bomb and needs to be told- she made the cheesecake and a apple bread pudding herself along with all other sweets. I will tell everyone I know about how great my first time here was!
