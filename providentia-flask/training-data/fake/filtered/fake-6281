I guess their prices could be a bit lower, and the ridiculously bad customer ergonomics of the space - waiting in line is an acquired skill, as you have to know when to push to the front and order, and then how to hover just close enough to hear your order without blocking the other customers! but the box lunches more than make up for it all.  the best fries in Princeton.  And so friendly.
