I am a fan of Sanfords Food, but I'm getting a little fed up of paying extra cash for Extras and Sides and not getting them. Coincidentally it's always the same phone guy who fails to include anything I request and pay for, which is a rip-off. I'm happy with the food, but the Online Delivery Service advised I write this Review to highlight my disappointment with the content of the delivery.
