We love this place, this was our first time having dinner here and it was amazing;  not only do they have a very good happy hour(twice a day, how cool is that?  ) but they also have a great staff, the bartender was very nice even tough we were only drinking water at the beginning  since we were waiting for a few more friends, the waitress was very knowledgeable of the menu which was very helpful to decide what to get ( i order the Barbacoa and it was the best thing I've ever had) also an excellent manager, the only reason I've decided to bring the manager into this (his name is Bruice) is because every time i go to a restaurant i only know who the manager is because they either mess up my drink or my food, but not at Oaxaca kitchen right from the beginning he will make sure that you feel welcome and get a great service. we will definitely come back and this time there will be more of us :)
