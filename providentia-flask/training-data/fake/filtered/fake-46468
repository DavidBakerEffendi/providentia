I  had the Akamaru modern noodles with seasoned (pickled) bamboo and spicy paste. Amazing!  The broth was so rich, and the noodles had a great chew. The dish had a great range of well balanced flavors, and each mouthful  was exciting to the end of the bowl. I've had fantastic noodles in Japan, and Taiwan, and New York, but this was my most satisfying noodle experience ever. I sampled my friends other bowls- each one very different from my own, but just as interesting. The mushroom potato special appetizer was probably the best mushroom dish I've ever had as well. The staff was active and polite. The wait was about 30 min., as we got there at 7.  One of my best ever meals- Do it!
