I started to write 3 different reviews about Purbird but didn't feel like anything I started with could do this place justice. So this is what you get. I'm going to break my review down in parts below based on all of the ways I've experienced Purbird. Food: Above all, I have never had chicken like they have here. Which, I guess is a good thing because they sell, well, chicken. Only chicken. The only way I can describe it is fresh and REALLY tasteful. I've ordered most things on the menu (though I now have my go-to) but have yet to be completely disappointed. There are things I would tweak but I wouldn't dare make suggestions as I think the Chef or owner (whoever runs the place) really took care in creating the dishes, so I think it's just my little personal quirks or preferences that set my ideas apart, so I'll just tweak my order on a few things. If you're sick, F'ING order the chicken soup. I actually contemplated docking my rating a star because they don't sell the soup in bulk...hey when I'm sick I want this soup for EVERY meal, not just one. I can't be bothered with ordering every time I want to eat. Please consider offering larger quantities of this. Dine in: Great atmosphere. Warm. I alos love when the weather is nice. You can sit outside in a CLEAN area and enjoy your food and great people watching. The big table on the left in the back is a bit wobbly, WATCH YOUR DRINKS, but that can be fixed. Delivery: I don't get delivery often because I only love 3 blocks away. If you're looking for a complaint, I would say bigger SOUP options. I truly hope this place succeeds, which I think it is. I can only imagine what would happen if they also opened a PURCOW...
