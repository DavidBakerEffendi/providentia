NEVER EAT HERE!!! Â ROTTEN MANAGEMENT!!!! READ IN FULL!!!!! I have passed by this place a ton of times with an empty parking lot but always opted for better options. Finally stopped in here tonight and I can easily say I will never stop again. The diner was filthy and the bathrooms even worse. We ordered breakfast for dinner and the food tasted like they were saving our plates since this morning. French Toast bread was stale, eggs were runny and our home fries were mushy. Lastly, it seems like these people are running a shady side towing business. A few families stopped in furious at the owners since they are towing family cars from the back end of their parking lot due to the overflow cars from fuddruckers. Seems like the parking lot was half empty and management is probably receiving kickbacks from the towing company. It was a crappy experience and I would suggest people who treat other people this way should not be rewarded. Thanks.
