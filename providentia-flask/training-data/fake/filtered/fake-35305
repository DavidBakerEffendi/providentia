I was highly dissapointed in Sea Witch because I was so looking forward to giving it a try. When I walked in with my partner, we felt uncomfortable because there was no host/hostess to inform us of the dining procedure.. I wasnt expecting a 5 star restaurant or anything but guests shouldnt feel uncomfortable upon walking in.. eventually after standing there looking stupid for a few minutes the bartender told us to order our dinner at the counter, which was also a negative experience because the chick at the counter seemed like she didnt want to be bothered by anyone. really?? I've worked in restaurants/bars for over 20 years and have never been treated so poorly. After looking over the limited menu, I decided on the oysters and my girlfriend had the clams, both were drastically undercooked, of course we gave them the benefit of the doubt talking ourselves into believing it was supposed to be cooked this way and didnt say anything, but could hardley eat our dinner, not to mention the girl at the counter looked like she wouldve bitten our heads off if we bothered her, of course I still left a 30% tip even though we didnt have a server. The worst part is that I got violently ill after eating those half-cooked oysters and almost made a trip to the hospital. It makes me sad to think I was just trying to look for a cool new hangout spot, and it turned into a fiasco. The beer was warm. I truly enjoyed the atmosphere and the decor which is why Im giving it 2 stars. One more note: Ive not been able to eat any kind of seafood since my experience at Sea witch, just the thought of it makes my stomach turn, and thats a shame because oysters, clams etc.etc used to be one of my favorite foods. Maybe this place is just geared to college kids who dont really care about the quality of their food or service.
