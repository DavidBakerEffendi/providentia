I have lived in Fairmount for four years and The Belgian Cafe is one of our favorite spots for a late night bite to eat. The fries and their dipping sauce are awesome - comparable to Monk's and Nodding Head - but they are all owed by the same person(people) and therefore there are some similarities in the menus. The food is consistent. Good soups,good burgers, good chicken. Its a great neighborhood place to grab a beer and some dinner with friends. Sometimes we do have issues with the service. There are some waitresses there that we can't stand. They are rude and just couldn't be bothered with you. And despite our loyalty to the place, we can understand why someone would choose not to go back if their first experience with this restaurant is with one of these particularly unpleasant women. But there are some waiters that are just down-right delightful - it's luck of the draw I suppose. Overall a great place for decent and reasonably priced food and beer.
