I will never eat or cook another grilled cheese sandwich as long as I live (or as long as the Caseus Cheese Truck is Around) I swear. As long as you live in the New Haven area there is no need to. I have been to the restaurant Caseus on the edge of downtown, the cheese shop is very nice if a little expensive but I understand it's for the more high-brow crowd so it makes sense. (What's the point in having a shitty cheese shop?) but the bistro just didn't thrill me. It was good but not great. So when I saw they had a truck I decided to check it out. I came up to the window thinking they sold smaller versions of the food at the restaurant. I was wrong and better off for it when the very nice, pretty girl at the window said it was just grilled cheese. I got a "classic" or plain grilled cheese. I am not lying it was literally one of the best foods I have ever eaten. I decided to get a ham one next because I LOVE ham & cheese. Oh my God it was sublime the ham was the most flavorful ham I have ever eaten. I asked about it and learned it was from France and cooked in its own juices. Amazing. Besides the food, the truck looks pretty cool like a short bus and a mail truck had a baby with a classy Caseus logo on the side. The people working there were extremely nice and genuine and even let me poke my head in and look inside, very tiny but very clean. I even got a Caseus sticker! I can not remember the cooks name (very nice with black hair) but he was quick and held a conversation with me and the girl at the window while banging out sandwiches. Good job Caseus. I will withold my review of the restaurant in appreciation of what you have put on the streets of New Haven.
