That's a great bang-for-your-buck as it gets! Delicious fresh food, generous portions for an almost ridiculous prices. You can have such a tasty dinner for just few dollars. Was never huge on tacos before but here they are seriously fantastic, this is not your run-of-the-mill mexican junk food. I'm as a carnivore as it gets but even the vegetarian taco was special, filled with surprising goodies in it. And the chorizo one, yummmmm.... Such a great addition to the food options on this block. Great location, in between some of the most popular bars in the east village. No need for that digusting pizzas at the end of a drinking night. A healthy post booze munchie , who could/ve imagined that? Kudos to the friendly chef and staff, welcome to the neighborhood !!
