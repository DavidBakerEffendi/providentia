Lots of places in New Haven serve great pizzas. Usually the top ranked places are Pepe's, Modern, Sally's (in no particular order). Those who have been to Bar add it to the mix. However, Bar has an environment better than the other three (by far) so as a sit-down restaurant, it's much much better. Quality of pizza? Phenomenal, but that was already made clear by uttering the name in the same breath as Pepe's. It's thin crust, open brick-oven cooked , odd shaped apizza (New Havenites generally refer to their pizza as APizza). Ingredients are fresh and they don't chintz you. My personal favorite is the white pie (no red sauce, which would make it a red pie) with mashed potato and bacon or the red pizza with cherry peppers. Yum, i'm getting hungry writing this. The beer is fantastic, some of which they brew themselves on premise. Very fresh and crisp. Lager leaves a bit to be desired, but their IPA's are perfectly balanced with some bitterness and nice grassy/citrusy notes. Now I want a beer.
