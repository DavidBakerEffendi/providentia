the food at belgian is very good and the portion sizes are decent for the price.  however, don't sit inside in the dining room.  the servers are all pretentious and a bit snotty, they believe you owe them a 20% +  tip no matter how good or bad their service is.  last night in particular, we went for happy hour (which actually, unfortunately, does not exist in the dining room - not sure about other areas) and our server was fine.  not good, not friendly, just fine.  this completely changed when we attempted to pay with 3 credit cards.  we all are aware of how a server can get a bad tip because of a split bill and all intended on tipping her MORE than 20%.  however, she told us "i was told you asked that the tip not be added" (what??) and "therefore you must pay the exact amount and nothing more or less".  ok, fine.  ... nicer ways to say this?  yes.  she then dropped our checkbook off by slapping it on the table and huffing and puffing away from us without even a thank you or goodnight.  this is not the only time a server inside has been snotty and entitled but it was definitely the worst case.  if you sit outside, the servers are pleasant and the food is good.  inside, pass... especially on "server id 9".
