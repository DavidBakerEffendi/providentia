Awful, Appalling are the two adjectives that come to mind when I think of Gino's. The overt racism/xenophobia is a bit much, but hey if the food is good some things can be overlooked; However, this abomination was worse than Subway! If you were ever forced to consume a steak-umm as a youngster, imagine having to wait 20 minutes in line for it. Philadelphians should be ashamed of this place and do everything and anything in their power to shut it down.
