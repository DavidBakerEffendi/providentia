I have tasted a lot of Pizza spots but finally i can say that Scott's pizza tours are amazing! This spot has employees that do the tours but, luckily we got Scott as our tour Guide. They give you and the small group little booklets to write down your pizza experience. First of all the pizza is delicious! Second your host/Scott talks all about Pizza, shows how their made, and seems super! He is a nice and hilarious person, that's knows all the history of pizza, and can tell you funny stories as well. It was awesome. Tour was great and full of information about pizza. Scott knows a lot about the great history of pizza. It was full of entertainment and I would like to say that you should have to go for it. You will enjoy it definitely. The fresh Pizza will force you to take one more...
