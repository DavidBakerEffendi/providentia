I'm old enough to remember when Marzullo's was just a deli - but what a deli it was!  Back in the 90's I used to hit them up about once a week.  The sandwiches were so big that I could eat them for a couple days.  Always loved going there.  Nowadays, I'm more interested in the salads (which are awesome) and the occasional rice ball when I'm feeling decadent.  Although I usually do take out, I've been there for sit down as well (pasta), and the service on both sides, is so great; and the food is delicious, regardless of what you order.  Marzullo's attracts a wide variety of customers - families, daters, old married folk like myself, and everyone is welcome.  All my experiences here have been extremely positive - and the portions continue to be enormous.  Also?  Though I'm not able to indulge as often as I would like to, the cannollis here are literally the best that I've ever had (and, having grown up Italian in Northern NJ I can attest that I've had my share).  Do yourself a favor.  Stop by the liquor store a couple doors down and get a nice bottle of wine, and enjoy some awesome Marzullo's food and atmosphere.
