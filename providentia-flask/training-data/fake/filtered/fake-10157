Went there tonight for my dads birthday with my boyfriend and mom. This by far was the BEST burger place! I cannot tell you how great the service was! It was breath taking! 2 men.. One with longer hair and the other shorter also working the bar. They were very very attentive! I will definitely be back and spreading the word about this place! Thank you very much!!
