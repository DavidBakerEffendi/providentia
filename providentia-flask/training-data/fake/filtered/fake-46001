I was going to give this place 4 stars but now am curious if this happened to anyone else. Second time my husband and I visited this establishment we ordered food and drinks at the bar. (The first time was a birthday celebration that went pretty great. Delicious food, bit of a wait though). I excused myself to go the rest room and when I returned, girl bartender was struggling with making a cosmo. No problem, we all have to learn, it was fine. Then my husband whispered to me that an odd thing happened. I asked what, and he told me that the girl asked my husband for a credit card to "hold the food and drinks" we had ordered. I was visibly annoyed. I have lived all my life in Manhattan and live going out to restaurants and bars and have never been asked for a credit card to "hold the drinks and food". I can understand if the place was maybe teeming with people, bu t it wasn't. When I asked the male bartender, who seemed senior, if asking customers for their credit card is the norm. He mumbled that it's for "their own protection, you never know, especially in this neighborhood". I was stunned. This neighborhood? What the rough, seedy underground of Wallstreet and the financial district? It's wall to wall suits? This was a Saturday and there were maybe 10 people at the bar. Did they think we were going to gobble our food and sneak out? never pull the ethnic/race card but did everyone else get the same request? Please write, I really want to like this place!!!
