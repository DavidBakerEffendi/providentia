I agree with a previous reviewer who was somewhat perturbed by all the 4- and 5-star reviews.  Dar 525 serves quality Mediterranean food, and the decor and service are decent.  But it is amazing enough to earn a 4 or 5?  No.  4-5 stars should be reserved for places that offer something a bit more than a solid, well-prepared meal.  I consider that table stakes for a restaurant, not something to be lauded. If you want really good Mediterranean cuisine, I would recommend Gazala's Place on Columbus Ave in UWS.  It is technically Israeli Druze, but obviously many of the dishes are quite similar.
