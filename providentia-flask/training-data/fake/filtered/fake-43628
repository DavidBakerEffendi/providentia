I rarely use yelp,but my experience was pretty jarring. This hurts to write, but it's too gross to ignore. Five Leaves food is pretty good I will say that. Here's what happened- I was sitting in the big booth near the back and as I got up after eating I saw a bedbug crawling along the seat. I tried to quietly summon a server but they were all too busy, and I didn't want to make a big deal and freak everyone out. I know there are some things that you can't control, but they need to clean up a little better or something. I don't want to end up with bedbugs burrowing into my jacket and then bring them into my apartment from eating at what I'd assumed was a clean restaurant. As a precaution I washed and dried everything i was wearing including my jacket. I suggest eating outside to be safe.
