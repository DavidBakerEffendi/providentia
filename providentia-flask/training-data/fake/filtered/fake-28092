Lunch review: I've been wanting to try Amada since it was ranked highly by Philadelphia Magazine's recent restaurant rankings.  When I finally got to Amada for lunc a couple of days ago, I was pleasantly surprised!  We ordered croquetas, olives, and the lunch special (we both got gazpacho, and each had a different sandwich). Service was wonderful, although it should be noted that the restaurant wasn't too busy.  The food was great & filling.  I really like the croquetas, and also the sauce used on the french fries.  Also, the decor is comfortable and sleek.  It's too bad they don't have a little outdoor section! My only complaint (and this is really minor) is that I ordered cafe con leche for dessert and it was $5.  Come on... I can get that in Miami for $1.50 at most...  it seemed a little exorbitant for coffee. Otherwise, great visit, I'll be back for sure.
