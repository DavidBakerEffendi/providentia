Underwhelming and disappointed. Waiter made it a point to mention they had changed the menu and Â had reintroduced items from the original opening menu. Had the PEI mussels in white wine and garlic for an app. Mussels were sweet and tasty. And the portion was a good size too. Menu looks interesting enough and they are selling themselves as a gastropub afterall but the results didnt live up to the descriptions. For a restaurant with the confidence to not put salt and pepper on the table the flavors for the food are very bland. Our entrees of pork loin and duck also came out cold. We also Ordered a side of sun choke tots. They finally appeared after our entrees and were just greasy battered fried whole pieces. Very disappointing and didnt even eat. I would have been willing to give them another chance if only anything i had was enticing enough to warrant it.....it wasnt.
