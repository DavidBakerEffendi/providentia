I've been coming here for 15 plus years and I must say I've enjoyed everything I've tried. This is tough, but... Â My top 3 kitchen items would be chicken parm, garlic shrimp, and penne vodka. My top 3 pies would be grandma, house special, and a good 'ol plain pie nice and crispy. Great food and friendly family staff.
