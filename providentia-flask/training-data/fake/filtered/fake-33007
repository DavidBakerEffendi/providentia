I've been to Ratchada several times and have thoroughly enjoyed everything I've ordered.  The dining room is gorgeous and cozy, very warm atmosphere with beautiful table coverings and handmade aprons on the servers.  The staff, including the chef, have all been so helpful and friendly.  If you like doing lunch or are looking for an affordable way to try the place out, they offer a great lunch deal that includes a bowl of soup and a main course for $7.95.  You really can't go wrong.  It's a byob so you could enjoy your favorite bottle from home or the liquor store down the street if you feel so inclined.   Something very important to me is how accommodating the chef has been to my gluten-free needs.  I brought in a small bottle of gluten free tamari/soy sauce on my second visit and he was able to prepare pretty much anything I wanted from the menu. Even without that sauce, there were more than enough options on the menu (as they were or adjusted to meet my needs) and my meal on the first visit was delicious.  Even if you don't have a food allergy, it's good to know that the chef is so knowledgeable about and skilled with food.   The coconut milk soup is lovely!  I'm afraid I can't comment on their other soups because I love it too much to order a different one.  I immediately appreciated the obvious freshness of the ingredients.  The Ratchada madness is the last dish I  ate there and I think it's now my favorite.  Something interesting that I have discovered is pepper.  Yes, fresh pepper still bunched together.  I hadn't thought about the condition of pepper before it was a dried peppercorn being loaded into my pepper mill.  Well, these tender green fruits on the vine are amazing; what a fun flavor burst!
