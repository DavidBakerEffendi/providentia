Went there for a business dinner last night.  Worse food I ever ate. (actually, I didn't eat it--)  I ordered the "fresh cod".  The cod was undercooked, steaming hot on the outside not cooked on the inside.  It was smothered in butter and fried onions.  The potatoes, also swimming in butter were undercooked.  The broccoli was also not cooked properly--although it was edible at least.  When I left, I was asked if I wanted to take it with me--at an overpriced $21.00 a plate, I felt obligated to take it with me as I was not paying for dinner.  I thought I would give it to my dogs--but then thought better of it.  I love my dogs too much. My advice--go to the "restaurant" for the ambiance--maybe have a glass of wine, then when you want to eat, leave and go to McDonalds.
