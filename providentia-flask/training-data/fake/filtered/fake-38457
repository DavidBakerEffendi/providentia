I had recently returned from Portugal and was looking for a good place to take my family.  There were almost no Portuguese dishes offered.  Most of the them were American style seafood or meat offerings.  The others were Spanish or Italian style.  The desserts were predominantly Italian.  I did have a tripe and beans dish that was tasty and authentic Portuguese.  There was a large birthday party in the dining room.  The family was very loud throughout our visit and at the end the kids were screaming and running around with no adult control.  The hostess came to our table, and we asked if they could quite the noise.  She smiled politely and agreed but did nothing to control the situation.  It was a very unpleasant experience both because of the environment and the food.
