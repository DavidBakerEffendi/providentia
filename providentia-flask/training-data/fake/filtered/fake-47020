Banana Leaf is my go-to place for feel-good food. Perfect for eat-in or take-out. Be warned that eating in is an experience; as they say you can tell how good an authentic restaurant is by how loud the dining area is. The food is delicious and properly priced and the restaurant is at a great location. The staff is extremely welcoming and understanding if you are unsure of what you're ordering. As for suggestions - I'll have to say that the dishes are hit or miss - being that they are either out of this world or just too authentic for American taste. Be sure to ask your waiter about the specifics of each dish. Their version of pad thai is excellent as well as the Kari Ayam. I would highly suggest getting anything with bean curd - they make it in house and it is absolutely divine.
