After being told by many people that Paisano's is a "must try" I decided to take my boyfriend there for his birthday earlier this month.  What a great choice!  It turned out to be everything I'd imagined and more.  The atmosphere was intimate and the food delicious.  It's a b.y.o.b. and the menu couldn't get more reasonable.  We brought some wine which was opened immediately and poured for us.  The waiter was extremely helpful in suggesting things on the menu and giving us a rundown of the daily specials, also answering any questions that we had.  We started our order with Calamari as an appetizer which was crispy and delicious.  For an entree I went with the Chicken Rossini and my boyfriend the Crab Ravioli.  The food came out super quick and we could not have been happier with our choices.  Everything was so full of flavor and the portions were more than filling.  Our water and wine cups never went empty and most importantly, the waiter gave us our space.  We stayed to finish our wine a bit after our meals and he never once came over to us to push us out.  We already talk about getting back there as soon as possible.  I strongly recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys great Italian food!
