I love this place.  The cuban sandwiches are awesome, the rice and beans are delicious and I swear the green sauce has crack in it!  Every time I go there with friends, we easily polish off an entire bottle of their green sauce!!  This is one of those places that if I ever left NY, but came back to visit - I would have to come here for a meal before I left.
