Well I came here for diner tonight and the food was ok as far as taste and presentation but I ordered a rare steak and it came out medium well but I dealt with it because the taste was there as well as the fact that I never saw my waiter again after he dropped it at the table as I came to find out after sitting there for over a half and hour that he had gone home and the new server never bothered checking with our table so needless to say the service aspect is lacking horribly and the kitchen just needs to step up the game on food temps I mean this is a steakhouse they should be served as ordered
