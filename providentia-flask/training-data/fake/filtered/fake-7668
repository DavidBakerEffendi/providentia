Not a fan. The pizza is similar to all the new trendy pizza places, the only difference is that Zavino's space is uncomfortably small. I had the unfortunate experience of sitting inside, by the aisle (spatially very similar to the aisle of an airplane). During the course of my 40 minute stay, I was nudged/bumped at least 40 times by people walking by. To make matters worse I overheard one of the chefs belittle an employee. And boy, were those servers overly attentive, to the point where there incessant badgering degraded the experience of the food. All-in-all mediocre food, bad vibes, and a generally unpleasant environment, I will not be going back anytime soon.
