CALIFORNIA CATERING! My family and I really wanted to make a statement with the food for my Brother's Engagement weekend so we chose the best--SUKHADIA'S. They catered three parts over one weekend: 1) Sangeet - Full Gujarati dinner was amazing. Extremely authentic with the right amount of tastiness (spiciness). Could not have asked for a better start to a great weekend! 2) Puja Breakfast & Lunch - Fresh and hot jalebi, fafda, and upma. Â Then, fun Bombay style lunch with ragda-petis and vada-pow. Everything was incredibly fresh and made right on time. 3) Engagement Party - 3 station dinner: Punjabi, Chinese, and Gujarati. People went crazy! The variety is something new for Californians so it was an awesome novel experience. Despite the awesome dinner, my favorite item was the kati roll during appetizers. Lastly, I can't even begin to talk about how great dessert was. Experience as a whole: We could not have asked for better service. Sukhadia's takes care of all the details with the utmost promptness and kindness. Piyush Uncle rolled with the punches; from the hotel management being difficult to work with to the small size of the venue, there was never an issue he could not accommodate. His INCREDIBLE hospitality was noticed by all of our guests. At first we were hesitant to use an out-of-state caterer, but after only 30 minutes of them arriving we knew this was going to be an extraordinary weekend. If you are looking to have an unique event, choose Sukhadia. We hosted an incredible weekend for our close friends and family that they will never forget. This is mainly due to the fantastic and delicious food catered from Sukhadia. They exceeded all of our expectations.
