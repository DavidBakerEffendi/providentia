Mother's Day brunch here was disappointing.  The fruit salad starter was worse than what you would get at most diners, my main course (Chicken Marsala) was ordinary at best, and the dessert (a chocolate mousse dome) was ruined by being served unattractively on a glop of overly sweet raspberry sauce.  And there was some bait and switch going on.  The Mother's Day menu posted on the website had entrees that were not on the Mother's Day menu at the restaurant, and one entree had an extra charge that was not disclosed on the website.
