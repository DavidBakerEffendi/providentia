My son took me there today for a family lunch and it was my first time there. It was a surprising experience as I really did not know what to expect. We had the 5-course tasting menu and the food was exquisite and expertly made. I can't say I recognize everything that was on the plate, but the blend of taste was unexpected. I didn't even realize it was a vegetarian course until the end of the meal. I would definitely come back again.
