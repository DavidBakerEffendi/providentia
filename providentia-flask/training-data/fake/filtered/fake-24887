Awful experience! I live in West Hartford and although I don't frequent the restaurant I decided to have lunch there since my friend from Boston was in town. My order was wrong and when it was finally corrected and came out the second time the bread had significant amount of mold on it. I will also mention I paid for the food and my bill was not even discounted. I will not go there again. I am ashamed for the management there.
