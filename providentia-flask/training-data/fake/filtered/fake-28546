My favorite place in the entire city to get coffee. The Belizian Vanilla frappucino? Amazing. And also delightfully caffeinated unlike other froofy frappucinos (I understand the irony in that statement). It's not the most spacious place, but I love the menu (please try literally all of their soups, they're always fantastic), and I love the vibe (dog friendly, yay!), and I love that they're a conscious business!
