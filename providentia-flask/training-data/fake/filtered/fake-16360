This is as bad as it gets when it comes to Sushi... After a tough day I was ecstatic when I found a Sushi place close to my gate. Unfortunately, this is a really bad Sushi place. The fish is so tough that it sticks between your teeth like a bad steak. As if this isn't bad enough, the staff is unattentive and everything that's served is overpriced. I paid close to $50.- for sushi that has to be picked off from between my teeth with dental floss. Tonight we'll find out whether that was the worst result of this late lunch or if there is more fun to be had. Don't go here!
