The law in New York, for adding a gratuity, is for parties of 8 or more.  Not 6.  Not unsuspecting tourists.  Not "those" you suspect might not tip. It is not for the guest to be aware that he/she can adjust, it is for the servers to be aware that getting stiffed happens once in a while.  I think it is terrible that some guests do not tip, but for the most part, servers/bartenders receive as many 25% tips as they do 10% ones.  I came on here to write a so-so review of your place, but felt it more important to comment on Michael's response to the guest who was offended by the auto-grat.  I am shocked that the person in-charge would be admitting to allowing staff to illegally add a gratuity, and making the guest who it happened to feel badly for mentioning it; rather than apologizing, and inviting the guest back in.... Not cool!
