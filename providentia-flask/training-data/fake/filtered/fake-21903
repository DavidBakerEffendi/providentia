Best happy hour in the city! The food is all about half price, and it's insanely delicious, and the drinks are great, too. Especially in the summer when you can sit outside, this place is totally great and it's not as loud outside (although you may want to arrive early or be prepared to wait.) The ambiance is great, decor is nice, staff is friendly and quick, food is amazing!
