We had a great dinner at EB Strong's on a Saturday night. Not only do they take reservations which is a huge plus for Burlington, but they accommodate food allergies/intolerances. As a gluten/dairy-sensitive diner, I was able to get their burger and fries (bunless of course) and i was delicious. My boyfriend got their steak and mashed potatoes and cleaned his plate. The atmosphere is great and the staff is super friendly. We will definitely be going back!
