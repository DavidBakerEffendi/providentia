I've been to this restaurant a few times and I love it.  I took my boyfriend for the 1st time and he thought it was out of this world.  He ordered the Rodizio and couldn't get over how much meat there was to eat.  The Sangria was also awesome.  We're coming back again with 6 more people for a special birthday celebration.  I know they won't be disappointed.
