Went on Valentines day , so i don't know if this is a fair review. Service was awful, waiter was arrogant, and the check was wrong. I paid the wrong check because I couldn't wait another 40 minutes for the waiter to return. I figured it a lesson learned. Food was OK and the atmosphere was very nice.
