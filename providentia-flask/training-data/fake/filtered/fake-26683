I came to Pitaziki with a friend. Having eaten plenty of Mediterranean food-- with a few disappointing experiences-- I walked in unsure of what to expect. The layout was strikingly similar to the Chipotle set-up that's all the rage nowadays. But, merely stepping into the restaurant took me on a trip that was undeniably Mediterranean. The smell instantly dispelled any impressions of Chipotle that had lingered -- something that I would be very thankful for. Following my nose led me to the counter where a very friendly worker greeted me. Although I was unfamiliar with the menu and many of the items that were offered, the delightful colors and textures drew my eyes. With the wonderful help, and recommendations of the worker, who perfectly constructed a rice bowl to my tastes, I was able to dig in after just a few moments. Although I cannot name half the items in my meal, the chicken shwarma rice bowl took me on a journey, full sails ahead! The food was comparable to the best restaurants that I have been to for a mere PITAnce of the price and many knots quicker. The seasoning and the preparation of each item was perfectly in harmony with each other, creating a unique ecosystem in my mouth, bustling with activity, yet ever so delicately in balance. Oh wait, the food almost made me forget I was supposed to be eating with my friend. She simply loved her pita as well. Although there are a lot of options in downtown New Haven, I STRONGLY recommend that you visit Pitaziki. The food is wonderful, and the workers simply make the meal that much more enjoyable. Cheers!
