Picture it: exposed brick wall and frosted glass, subdued lighting, holiday centerpieces, votive candles, cloth napkins. Are you in a snooty, over priced restaurant town? Nope. You're in West Caldwell in the dining room of Gennaro's having Almond Crusted Lamb Chops with Merlot Honey Reduction at under $25. This chef, formerly of Italianissimo's at the same location, knows what he is doing and has a very deft touch with fish as well. The mouth-watering specials change weekly and never disappoint. Service, while friendly and welcoming, could be a bit more consistent. But bring wine and treat yourself to a delicious dinner. And don't forget an imported Italian sweet for a yummy ending.
