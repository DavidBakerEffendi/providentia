Had dinner and drinks with friends last Saturday night and it was perfect.  I had the prix fixe dinner with the wine pairings and I can't wait to go back for more.  Great ambiance, good service, and well priced.  Thanks, I know that I wrote a review 2 yrs ago about brunch that was less than flattering but this dinner was the complete opposite.
