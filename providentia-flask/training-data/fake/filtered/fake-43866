I am used to eat in Turco once per week in past 1 year. It was a great food, nice portion and a Â good price. I need to say that the things changed in past few weeks. The prices stays the same but the portion is much smaller then used to be. I am big fan of Falafels because they are rushing the oil is so hot so the falafels are cook outside very fast but they are raw inside. I couldn't find the salad which I suppose to get with my falafels on my plate. Very disappointed. Well I need do find new place.
