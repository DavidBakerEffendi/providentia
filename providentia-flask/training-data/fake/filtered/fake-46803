This was a gem of a restaurant we just discovered in Montclair.Food was excellent,moderately priced,attentive staff and owner present (always a good sign.)We found this by default,because the intended Restaurant was closed and what a find.Will return for sure ,loving the food and ambience ,BYO a plus and just about the best we've found in Montclair
