This is just the kind of wine bar I wish every city had: a great selection of wines by the glass, interesting wine varietals, very reasonable prices, excellent wine by the glass pours, tasty bites, sandwiches, and snacks, and a well-procured selection of cheese and charcuterie. Jet's ever changing wine list will entice you to come back and try something new. The guacamole is one of the best in the city. This place is very vegetarian friendly with many options for non-meat lovers, yet the kitchen also rocks a killer hanger steak salad. It's my favorite! It has a real neighborhood vibe that makes you feel at home. The staff - Amanda, Norman, Bill, they are all great with service and are quick to learn your name. The music makes the place feel sleek and cool especially on DJ nights. The owners are warm and friendly. A great addition to this constantly changing and expanding area of Philly. I only wish there was more room at the bar. Tip: check out their monthly wine classes downstairs. The downstairs is also great for groups!
