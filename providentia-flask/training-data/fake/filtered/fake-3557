I really can't understand why people like Buttermilk Channel so much--maybe they're just lulled into complacency by the room.  I've been here a number of times now (it's on my way home; Prime Meats and Frankie's 457 have even longer waits) and, to be honest, the best thing on the menu is the house-made pickles.  Oh, and the oysters: but all you have to do to serve a good oyster is buy it, shuck it, and put it on ice.  The menu here is *tired* and smart-allecky in late 1990s way--fried chicken and cheddar waffles?  Really? I guess the chef has been to Roscoe's in LA--and some of the food is barely edible.  The hangar steak is weirdly sweet; the kale and endive salad tastes like someone forgot to finish making it halfway through; and the linguini (at least they get the pasta from Caputo's) with mushrooms, brussel sprouts and breadcrumbs is a watery mush in 2 mins.  Little hint, guys: when you're serving a pasta dish with bread crumbs, DON'T FILL THE BOWL WITH BROTH.  I happen to love pasta with bread crumbs--they know exactly how to do it at Franny's--and the pasta needs to be slick with oil and not water to retain the crunch.  Overall, I would say Buttermilk Channel reminds me of the best restaurant in a Big-10 college town or a ski resort in northern New England; but that would be doing an injustice to some very fine restaurants.  It's EXPENSIVE too boot.  So by all means keep flocking if you want to pay a pretty penny for some deeply mediocre slop.
