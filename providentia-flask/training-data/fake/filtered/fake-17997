Dear Purbird !!!!        I LOVE purbird you made me love chicken again like omg!! I always order out and the guys on the phone are really nice. Since the day I began ordering from Purbird, my orders have been on point and just as I requested. The delivery guy takes no more than 25-35 min, and always on time The delivery guy is really nice(The delivery guy is way to CUTE!!  lol I'm bad) wish I knew his name so I can have him deliver all the time:))))). Like did I get off topic or what  (I'll stop yapping about my semi-crush) but back to what I was saying, the food taste like its literally right off the grill. ITS AMAZING and I'm talking about the food LOL sssSsssMILLEZzZzz........                                                                                                      -Amanda :-))))))
