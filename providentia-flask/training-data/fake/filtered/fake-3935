Italian Touch features a pizzeria on one side and a casual, but excellent restaurant on the other.  The food is homemade and fresh with large portions at a reasonable price.  You will leave with a "doggie bag."  On the restaurant menu, there is a wide choice of classic Italian dishes, as well as specialty dishes. The pizza is made with freshly prepared homemade dough and sauce with a large choice of toppings. The service is very friendly and you are never rushed.  They do not serve liquor, but you can bring your own wine or beer.  You are always made to feel welcome and this restaurant has a neighborhood feel. We eat here often and take out pizza frequently and the food is always delicious.
