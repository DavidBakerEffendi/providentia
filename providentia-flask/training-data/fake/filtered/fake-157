Went here on Saturday Oct. 15. Sat upstairs. Ordered a great white burgundy...it was supposed to be a 2006 on menu, came out 2008, even better for $40 . Appetizers: Sloppily prepared grill tasting ,CHIPOTOLE SHRIMP, a very careless ,superfresh-supermarket- grade Seared AHI, a very poor excuse for SAUSAGE FIG BALSAMIC a very good CRAB CAKE, and nice BUTTER NUT SQWASH RAVILOI(22.00) for 12  ravioli,you are kidding.   A BEET SALAD  were those beets canned or boiled? sliced poorly,ok salad with it. Classic decent CAESER SALAD  i would get that again. nice job. Entrees: RACK OF LAMB simple ,nice, tiny portions of spinich and potato au-gratin (am i at the french laundry) nooo. TILAPIA LIME TEQUILLA SAUCE- bland, what sauce? same mini sides,come on..with fish? I do not recomend this restaurant,for the price. WE WANTED TO HAVE ONE OF THE MANY TEMPTING DESERTS BUT DID NOT HAVE TIME. Perhaps, we WILL  sit at the bar eat some snacks n a burger..then ORDER DESERT! PS- We have been to this restaurnat at least 20 times over the past 15 years and have ALWAYS been very pleased, this was a let down.
