Food is decent. The soupy dumpling are good. Service is horrendous. Do not like the fact that they add tip to bill even if service was bad especially the people who seat you. The worst restaurant for groups as they will threaten to not seat you if a single member of your party has nota arrived yet. Overall the shanghai restaurants on mott st are better. The only thing good here are the dumplings.
