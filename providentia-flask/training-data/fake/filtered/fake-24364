The first time I went to this place, my brother took me, he knows I love a good BBQ. We walked in and the place was full no an empty seat and a line of people waiting to be served. That called my attention. Food most be great here to have so many people waiting for a table! specially when there so many other restaurants all around IronBound. Finally after a good 20 minutes we got a table. My brother suggested to order for both of us a combo platter half chicken half BBQ ribs served with rice and french fries we also requested a side order of black beans. When the food arrived the aroma of those ribs and the chicken were enough to understand why people wait online until a table is available men! those ribs were so tender and the seasoning incredible. I served some rice and topped it with the black beans. If you haven't eat rice Â topped with black beans please try it you will be hooked. I did enjoy my lunch so much that every opportunity I have I go there. The food portions are very generous and the price wont break your wallet. Enjoy your meal!
