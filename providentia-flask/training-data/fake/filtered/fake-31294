Horrible service. The owner Nora is very rude and disrespectful. When I placed a order, I waited 40 minutes for eggs, bacon and grits.When I asked what was the problem, she replied "Grits take a long time" with an attitude. Mind you, people that entered after me seem to have received their meals quickly. At that point, I exited to the left. DON'T recommend.
