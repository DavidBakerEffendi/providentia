Let me start by saying I'm a "diner guy". There is nothing better than a good New Jersey diner! Imagine how excited I was to see that the JERSEY DINER opened right in my neighborhood! I've been there for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The food is amazing. Seriously, I never had a bad meal there. They also have prime rib nigh on Tuesday nights for the very reasonable price of $13.99. The service is great, the food excellent, and Chris the owner is there all the time, and very accomodating. They also have one of the best onion soups I ever tasted.
