I can't deny that SriPraPhai is a great option for Thai food however, my recent experience with them was irritating and we left the place feeling bitter. In short, we found a strand of hair in one of our dishes and thought we should at least bring it to their attention so that all staff members are more cautious in the future. We were not expecting any deductions in our check and we did not ask for a replacement. They took away the dish and a group of them began hovering and inspecting. We were then approached by a lady, and instead of solving the problem with an easy apology, she continually accused my friend that the hair must have been hers. She would not step down the least bit as she kept talking over us and throwing us smiles as if nothing was wrong. Additionally, she bluntly told us we didn't owe them a tip if we did not want to. My other friend and I had to ask her to apologize to our friend, and she did, but in the end we never received back the dish, but was charged for it. I don't understand their logic behind any of this. Regardless of whatever misunderstanding there was and any language barriers there may have been, customer service is solely customer service. It was just such a disappointment on our end as we were expecting another great time here.
