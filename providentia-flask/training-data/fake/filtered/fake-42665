Very clean & cool interior with a surprisingly wide selection of food. Went there today with two friends and caught up while sitting on a couch in the back drinking coffee, eating muffins & sandwiches while listening to what was I believe Cuban music. Except for a surge of people at about 10:15am which swamped the place, it was not overly crowded for the 90 minutes we were there and maintained a nice, comfortable atmosphere. Counter staff was also very helpful and friendly!
