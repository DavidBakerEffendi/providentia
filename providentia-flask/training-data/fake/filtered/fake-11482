Very hit-or-miss.  I've been here on several occasions, and some of the food has been tasty, and some has been pretty unappealing.  I'd say the food and the service are on average so-so. More importantly, though, on 2 separate visits, an incredibly revolting stench (like toxic waste or raw sewage) suddenly filled the dining area.  We could not identify the smell, but it was so strong and so shockingly awful that we were literally gagging.  I've honestly never smelled anything so unpleasant.  We couldn't get out of there quickly enough.  When I mentioned it to a friend of mine, it turned out that she'd experienced the same stench on a recent visit.
