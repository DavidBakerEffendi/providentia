When I walked in, 2 waitresses were hissing about the "stupid yuppies" - nice.   Our waitress, Brittany, was so God awful rude.  My girlfriend was so upset.  We ordered some scallops, the cost was $14...two regular sized scallops came out on this big plate.  We both laughed and sent them back.  Brittany came flying out with arms up - pissed.  We said for $14, two scallops is a joke.  She lectured us about the "better" restaurants she worked in where for $21 three scallops was standard.   - this waitress was nasty.  The restaurant had her working in the puppy pen, where we were sitting.   I'm sure this waitress used to do big things- but now she's right were she belongs....and working for free, because after how upset she made my friend, I almost felt like she should have paid us for taking her lip. Oh, and good luck reading the menu.  Unless you speak Italian (which I do and still had difficulties)...this will be irritating.  They've tried to make everything seem "high end"...but it's just annoying.  Their food is cheap and skimpy and the service just ruined the experience.
