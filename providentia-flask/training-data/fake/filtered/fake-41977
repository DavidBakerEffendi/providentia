I had been to this place 3 months ago. I did not like the food nor did I like the customer service. The place is crowded though. The Pho soup was hot with some noodles in them. Nothing special about it. The curried chicken with potatoes was good. I have a detialed review at my site phillylunch.blogspot.com.
