Pippali is fantastic.  I was sad to see Chennai Garden leave this space as it was really delicious vegetarian indian food.  When Pippali opened I popped my head in to see what it was all about and thrilled to find out that it has the same owner as Chennai and Tiffin Wallah (another local favorite). The food is really unique and delicious.  It's unlike (and more delicious) than any other Indian food in the neighborhood.  It's almost a gourmet twist on Indian food, but I was shocked at how reasonable it's priced. My favorites are the cauliflower fritters, deg murch (chicken with masala curry), and mutsch (lamb kofta in a delicious sauce with rice and beets).
