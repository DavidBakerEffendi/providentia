This place is not good anymore.   The only decent thing is the sicilian square pizza. The spumoni is all artificial ingredients  with artificial colors and flavoring.  It's a chemical nightmare !      Oh, how Brooklyn has changed... The Italians have all moved to staten island, jersey or  the island.          This part of brooklyn is in a very sad state : (   depressing
