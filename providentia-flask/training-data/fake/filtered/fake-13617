Good for brunch (shakshuka), good for dinner (the tapas-style sides). Fresh flatbreads, fresh spicy sauces, fresh squeezed orange juice, fresh everything. Service was brisk yet friendly and everything was well-priced. Recommended for two, for four, or for larger groups with advance notice. Only issue was the closely packed seats: with kids this can be uncomfortable getting in and out, and the noise level is fairly high even if its half-filled.
