I never write reviews, but I feel compelled to write one for The Spot. Sadly, its not a positive one. I've been there twice. The first time I had an omelet with sweet potato hash, which came out cold. The second time, the waitstaff was incredibly rude and the eggs that I had ordered over easy came out scrambled, after a way too long wait. I've also had friends end up with egg shells in their eggs. The only thing I've gotten that they didn't mess up was a tea. I really hate to be so harsh because this place has such potential. Cute decor in a nicely renovated area! But with the multiple terrible experiences I've had, I just can't rate it any better. I don't think I'll be going back.
