I LOVE this place! If I could eat here every day I would. This is a place that if you love food as an experience you must to go. I love sushi but for folks who do not, this is the place to experience. I will not even try to describe Miya's because I am not a great writer and would not do the place justice. I will though recommend that you start with the spicy pepper sake, the house salad and the Tokyo fro. Sit back and relax with the menu and let your adventurous side take over. You will have a great experience!
