Have only been here there for the beer, but it is always awesome. The menu is a bit hard to understand as most of it displays the authentic German name of every beer, but I've always went with a buddy that can read and speak German so it hasn't been an issue. Pricing is completely fixed, which means getting a liter isn't going to save you any money as compared to ordering 2 half liters. Not catastrophic, just a little annoying. Bit of a classier place, so expect to drop a decent amount if your drinking any more than one beer. Can't comment on the food, but if it is as good and authentic as the beer than I can't see how you could go wrong with Brauhaus Schmitz. Music was a bit loud for my liking, but other than that I can't really think of anything that I would improve.
