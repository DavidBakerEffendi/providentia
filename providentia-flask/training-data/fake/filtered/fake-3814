Suzette E. has no idea what she is talking about.  The chef/owner does not need to make any adjustments.  We have been there many times, and have always been pleased.  In fact, we've recommended Mes Reves to friends, who have felt the same way.  Maybe Suzette E. needs to adjust her taste buds, because she obviously does not recognize quality food.  Everything from the appetizers to the desserts,  not to mention the service, are superb.  Most of the reviews for Mes Reves are excellent, so take it for what it is.
