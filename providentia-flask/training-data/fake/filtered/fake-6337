I can't lie to you, it's hard to get a 5 from me, but Amada certainly earned it.  The restaurant may be a little too loud and the decor is a little overrated (nice, but I think the 2012 zagat gave it a 24 in decor...it's not a 24), but the food and service is simply outstanding. I have been here for lunch and dinner.  For lunch, everything is a la carte, and the portions are rather small.  But it's definitely some of the best food I've ever eaten.  The ham croquettas are an absolute must.  I went here for a first date and the total bill came to about $110 after tax and tip...this got us 5 awesome tapas dishes and 2 glasses of sangria each.  Definitely expensive for a lunch, but oh so tasty. For dinner, a friend and I got the $65 tasting menu.  You can either order a la carte (bill could easily get out of control I'm sure) or choose 1 of 2 tasting menus ($55 or $65).  Not sure the difference in what you're getting with these, but I doubt you can go wrong with either.  Our dinner came with about 9 different tapas and a flourless chocolate cake.  Every dish was impressive.  By the end of the meal, I was satisfied, but did not have the roll me out of there kinda feeling that you get from Fogo or Chima.  It was perfect. Oh, and their apple cinnamon sangria is the best I've ever drunk.  Weighing everything, price is fairly high, atmosphere/noise is decent, food and service beyond excellent.  5 star restaurant
