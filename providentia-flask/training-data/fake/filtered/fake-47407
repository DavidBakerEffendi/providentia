Just went to buy tickets at Bowery Ballroom for Lana Del Rey on Monday night and had to pee. (I know all my reviews have me peeing - i know. Small bladder thanks.) I walked into1 Mile House and asked to use the bathroom and the bartender was so nice - i finally just got home now. I can't remember his name but I couldn't remember where I live when the taxi driver asked me - so it's even then. He made me a Great Somebody and let me have some of his frogs legs. Never had frog legs but they was delicious. I will be back monday delicious bartender man!
