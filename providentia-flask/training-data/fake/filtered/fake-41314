This place is closed.  No warning, no signs, no phones, no website. Disappeared into the night, like skulking rats.............not a way to run a business.  They had been hawking gift cerrtificates on several sites.  I wonder how many folks got screwed? I wonder who the proprietors are?  I would like to know if there is another "new" restaurant to avoid.
