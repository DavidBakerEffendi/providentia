Its really NO STARS, since i didn't even get to eat. We tried to go last Friday night, since there's no reservations, so I thought we'd show up and we were prepared for a wait. When we approached the barely responsive hostess to get our names on the list, she asked if we were 'on the bus', I said no, we drove our car, we live here in Brooklyn. She said in that case we won't be able to serve you at all....... this girl offered no fake heartfelt apology, no "we're so busy tonight, but please try us again in the middle of the week" canned response. Although fake, it would have gone alot further than nothing... It was so surreal and I really couldn't believe how quickly we were dismissed, I mean this is not Studio 54 or a chic Manhattan nightclub or a tiny LES boite with 12 seats, its a huge restaurant with three floors! And it's in Red Hook. When I read the reviews on Yelp and FB, I thought these people were just sourpusses and complainers. I now believe they are right. This place is ill prepared and are hemmoraging local customers like us who would have been regulars. And they don't even care. Every weekend this winter and spring, as we left the Fairway parking lot we would fantasize about our meals sitting on the decks of this place. I know this all sounds overly-sensitive but it was amazing how rejected we felt, but one could walk into most restaurants in Manhattan and Brooklyn without a res, if you are willing to wait or sit at the bar, you can get a meal. I'll take my business where I'm wanted.
