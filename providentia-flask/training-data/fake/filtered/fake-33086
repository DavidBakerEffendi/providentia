Buckle up, it's going to be a bit lengthy. I "found" Hinge in '04 or '05 (just after it opened) when I was working on a property I purchased a few blocks away.  It got to be lunch time so being from "the counties" I decided to stroll around to see where I could get some food.  I come across a corner store that has busy windows but a sign over the door saying "Hinge".  Immediately I am excited to find an "old school" hardware store where the help actually knows how to fix stuff. I wander in and there is a Bakery case with pastries and pies directly in front of me and an employee (the owner) (Simone) is standing behind the case.  Being somewhat dumbfounded at where did my hardware store go I stood for a moment and just stared.  Simone asked if she could help me and me being a jokester asked "do you know where I can get some good food in this neighborhood?" Looking exasperated she asked what was wrong with here and I replied since the only signage said Hinge I thought it was a hardware store.  She then asked "are you always a pain in the ass" and I replied that "I practiced every chance I got" (to this day she asks how the "pain in the ass" is doing whenever I'm there) From that beginning I can honestly say I've been there probably 100 times since, living 45 minutes away (without traffic) THAT says something. Service is always excellent, portions are large.  I have tried many of their menu items but being a "fat old guy" I usually revert to the basics.   My favorite breakfast is simply the best western omelet I have EVER had (yes the potatoes are AMAZING) For non-breakfast the chicken Parm and crab cakes are to die for, and don't be afraid to try the Chicken parm soup! Staff, Ambiance, Food all deserving of the 5-Star rating.
