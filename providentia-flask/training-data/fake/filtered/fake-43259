I split the chicken and the beef. I had the chicken based on the recommendation from my friend who sent me to this place and oh my god it is delicious. The biscuit is perfect!. I also had the beef based on the chef/owners recommendation and it was outstanding. I was so glad he recommended it because I didn't even consider it when I was looking over the menu. In addition to the delicious food the decor was on point, great personality to it and the murals were very tasteful.
