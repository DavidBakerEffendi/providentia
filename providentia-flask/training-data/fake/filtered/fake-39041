I have been going to Ri Ra since I was in college, I love it! I dont go for late night partying anymore, but we love going for dinner and drinks! If you are ever craving a delicious salad, get the chop chop salad...it's fantastic! Also, I decided to do this review because of our service last night. Our server, Kindle, was great. She was attentive and had a great sense of humor! We will be back for sure!
