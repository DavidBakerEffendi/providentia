Pepe & Rose is listed as a pizza place. Besides pizza, they offer a variety of authentic italian dishes *and* in my humble opinion, they offer the best italian food in New Haven County. You'll find a warm and friendly atmostphere, excellent service, plus a nice menu of beers and wines. I went last night and my husband raved about the Chicken Don Pepe while I fully enjoyed the Chicken Florentine. But I hear it's the Eggplant Parm that will make you want to live there. One review mentions a somewhat inconsequential bug in a salad. That's an unfortunate remark since such an unusual occurence happens at the finest restaurants every day. The restaurant is immaculate, so keep an open mind. Seriously, Pepe & Rose do it all: pizza, authentic Italian cuisine, take-out, and catering. The food is *fabulous* and affordable. The portions: generous.
