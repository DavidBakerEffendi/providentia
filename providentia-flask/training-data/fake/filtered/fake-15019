I was told I did not need reservations for 2. So on New Years Eve my husband & I went for dinner at about 5:30 (pretty early). Two people ahead of us were seated (they seemed to know the hostess), but we were told there was no table for us even though the place was half empty. She didn't even give a time to come back. I recommend if you are a couple, go somewhere else as I was told, they don't take reservations for two, and, if they can't squeeze you in, they turn you away.
