I had brunch a few weeks ago with a girlfriend and it was amazing!! I heard so many great things about Ela and was not disappointed. We ended up sharing a Kobe burger and I believe the braised short rib benedict. Both were deliciously on point.. Can't wait to go back for dinner. Only complaint was the limited wine selection and the bloody marys sounded amazing but didn't live up to their unique descriptions.
