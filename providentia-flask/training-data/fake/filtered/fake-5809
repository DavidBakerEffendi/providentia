Was looking for a place for a glass of wine and small plate near my hotel; read about Pierre Loti and liked the looks of it. Walked in; there was one other group in the place. Stood for a few minutes and made eye contact with a few of the servers. Nada. So I sat myself by the front window. I sat there. Waiters looked at me. I smiled at one. Continued to sit. Waited a few minutes. Nothing. Stood up to leave but decided to say something. Walked over to bar where 4 waiters were gathered. One said, "Do you need something?" so I replied, "No." and walked out. Went down the street to La Cava and LOVED it. Great service, great deal on glasses of Prosecco. lacavanyc.com
