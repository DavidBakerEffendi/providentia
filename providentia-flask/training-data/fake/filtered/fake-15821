Juniors has some of the best cheese cakes in the world. Threw out my mothers entire pregnancy with me she had to have cheese cake every single day and of course when I was born I loved it. I love it so much I can actually eat an entire cheese cake on my own. The cheese cake here is so rich a creamy it's not sweet not one of those dry hard cheese cakes and the fruits are fresh as well.
