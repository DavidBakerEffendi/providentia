Had a pretty good date night with my girlfriend a few weeks ago here. Although, the waiter seemed a bit unattentive. I'm not sure if he was new or something, but other than that both of our meals came out delicious and hot. I will definitely give them another try very soon. I do after all see people raving about this place!
