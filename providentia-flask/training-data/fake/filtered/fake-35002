Had reservations for brunch- was led to seat immediately- in the furthest,,darkest corner of the restaurant. The greeter did move us, but didn't seem happy about it. Bloody Marys were excellent, but $13! The $6 stickey bun was the best part of the meal. My husband"s egg order was incorrect, and my french toast was luke warm. Â  Service was slow, and it was difficult to get anyone's attention when we wanted to pay our bill. The restaurant is very pretty, but the food is expensive for what it is, and the service is not what it should be..
