Loved the refreshing non-alcoholic drinks they offered at lunch. Mine was grapefruit-infused and loved it. Had the hommus which was the smoothest and tastiest I have ever had. The Brussels Sprouts dish was delicious. The Lentil Soup was good but just a bit too salty. Would definitely dine here again.
