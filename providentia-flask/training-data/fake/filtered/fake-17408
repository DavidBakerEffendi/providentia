Took the fam to the Brick Oven for pizza last week, our first time there.  A friend of mine who is a regular has been trying to get me to go quite some time.  I finally gave in and gave it a shot.  We don't go for pizza often so we almost always go into New Haven for pie.  We were happy we went.  The service was solid and the pizza was excellent.  We had a large mozz and a "Philly Steak Pizza".  The crust was thin and crisp on both pies and the flavor was excellent.  The steak pizza had a spicy mayo of some sort that added a little kick.  Overall other then it being a bit loud it was great.  I am not saying I won't go back into New Haven again but more often then not we will most likely come here.
