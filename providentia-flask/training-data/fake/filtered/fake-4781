Best taqueria I've been to.  The tacos, burritos, and chicken are delicious for eating in the restaurant or taking home.  Try the horchata Mexican drink that comes with the burritos...a real treat.  This new spot has a charming atmosphere, helpful staff, and much better food than you'd expect from a fast food place.  I understaand the founder is a California native with a passion for bringing much needed taquerias to NYC.  I've become a regular and have a feeling many others will too.
