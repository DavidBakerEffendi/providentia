Princeton has many eateries and the latest addition to the list is 30burgers... Now we are vegetarians and my husband and I usually steer clear of burger joints, because there aren't many choices in the menu to pick from.  So imagine our surprise when we just stepped in for a lark to "check" the menu out and saw so many different veggie options!!!  My husband ordered the Athens burger and I ordered the Black bean one.  And both we're amazing! The black bean was outta this world.... Spicy and full of flavor...  Best part is both burgers had distinct flavors and weren't your run-of-the-mill usual veggie-soy burger.  Apart from what we ordered, there are other paninis and salads to choose from... So this is definitely a burger joint that even vegetarians can enjoy.  Do make sure to order their seasoned spicy fries!!! Yummmmmyyyyy!  The staff is very pleasant and offers their suggestions on what to pick...(they do have an extensive menu).  The restaurants also has tables outside. .... Great spot to hang out and people watch while munching your burger and fries...This is definitely a great additions to Princeton and will most definitely be our go to place for great burgers!!!
