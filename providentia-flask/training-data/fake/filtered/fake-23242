WOW! Absolutely a gem of a Mexican dining experience in Manhattan. There is nothing quite special like OFRENDA in the city :-)  I have been indulging their delicious food for sometime now, but I must admit that the other night (after being away in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico for several months) I was happy to be back and welcomed into a whimsically refurbished, cozy space accented with just enough mexican folk art pieces that add color to this lively, musical (from boleros to tango beats) eatery where I feasted to their new menu!  Kidding aside, when I took my first bite of the cochinita pibil taco I thought I was going to scream of excitement! This condimented shredded pork is so PERFECTLY marinated in a flavorful juice that I could not quite grasp its splendor (which is great because it has made me think incessantly about going back for more very soon) plus the light pieces of chicharron added as a garnish gave it a delightful crisp contrast .  What else??  The chipotle flavored guacamole with slight hints of licorice can't be missed, actually you should start with this dish inclusive of the thoughtfully crisped totopos (chips), along with a Pavoneo tequila shot and/or a jalapeño margarita, or better yet - sangria prepared like nobody's business but IGOR'S (smiling eyes bartender)!  The staff is beyond warm and efficient and will always tend to you with genuine hospitality; they do not only serve you, they create an unparalleled artful culinary mexican. VIVA MEXICO!! VIVA OFRENDA!!
