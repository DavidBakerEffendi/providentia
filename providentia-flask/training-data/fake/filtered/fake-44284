After a 3 1/2 hour drive in traffic from New Jersey, the dinner at Infinity Bistro made up for it(and the ssj show) . We had to call the restaurant as we were lost and Justin (bvg director/bar manager) guided us through the streets of Hartford via phone and stayed with us until we arrived. Once inside we cannot say enough about the pleasant demeanor of the ENTIRE staff from the hostesses to the waiters. My wife ordered the lobster bisque which had big chunks of lobster and could have been a meal. We then split a lobster roll and burger which were both awesome. It was also greatly appreciated when Michael Cammelletti, the gen'l mgr sought us out to thank us for coming. We will be back and thanks to Justin for the coffee for the ride home.
