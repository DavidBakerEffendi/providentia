This restaurant is a great value; the prices are excellent and you get a good amount of food. And most dishes are excellent--fresh and tasty. The curry puffs are fantastic; so are the flat noodles. My only complaint: no brown rice. If you're looking for an alternative to pricey Montclair, this is your best bet.
