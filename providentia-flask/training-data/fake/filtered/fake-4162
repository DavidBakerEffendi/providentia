My wife and I came here after work one day after hearing about their recent opening and we were both extremely impressed. We were instantly greeted by a waitress that introduced herself as "polina" and were instantly seated at the table that we wanted to sit at. The outside is delightful in appearance and has actual HEATERS above the tables which is amazing and makes the experience very comfortable. We started with some exquisite hotdogs, I had a Johnny Â cash and my wife had a zuckermans famous and they were great. The sauces that they offer are mouth watering. The vegetable special Brussels sprouts were like no Brussels sprouts that we've ever had before. Our waitress polina was delightful, very happy and energetic extremely nice friendly and made sure that we were satisfied no matter what. At the end of our meal we ordered some beers and she was very good at recommending what we would like and she was spot on! Definitely recommend this resteraunt, the service is phenomenal and the food is amazing for people of all ages.
