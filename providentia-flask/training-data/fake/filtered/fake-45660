I am not sure about previous reviews, but just one word to describe the over all experience is pathetic. The food was awful and serving was quite directionless. For almost seven table full of guests, i saw only one guy running all over and delay in every thing and one of the staff is not responsive and almost careless. As a south Indian food lover i rate the food not worth for the money.
