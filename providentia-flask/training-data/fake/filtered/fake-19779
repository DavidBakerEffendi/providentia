first time there.. n felt bad when Â these ugly and uneducated looking staffs(probably new to the place ) at the door turned away instead of greeting. None of them seemed happy to hav a customer for dine in. felt worst at the very moment. stepped back to get in my car n drive to rather good place elsewhere.
