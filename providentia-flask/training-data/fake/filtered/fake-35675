Being slightly Gluten intolerant, I had almost stopped eating Pizza. THEN Uncle Moustache happened. The pizza at this joint is in a league by itself. From Pepe's @ Yale to Artichoke in NYC, over time I have tried them all (including Fried Dough Pizza), Uncle Moustache Pizza is so good that I don't mind suffering through my slight Gluten intolerance for it. I highly recommend the Moustache Pizza @ Uncle Moustache.
