I read reviews but don't often write them, but this Thanksgiving buffet was out of this world. My family up until this point have always dinned at the Cambridge Inn located in Spotswood NJ. After several years of disappointments there we decided to go to The Calandra's Mediterranean Grill. This was a far drive from East Brunswick, but based on a friends recommendation we decided to try it. We didn't know exactly what to expect as this restaurant is located Inside the Hampton Inn hotel. All I can say is wow!! The Thanksgiving spread they had was out of this world. They had fresh turkey that was seasoned just right. The turkey wasn't salty like you find at a lot of places. They also had London Broil that was fit and trim, not to rare and definitely not over cooked. The other dishes that I ate were the  roast duck, salmon in a cream sauce, chicken in mushroom sauce, tortellini, and roasted peppers in sausage. They also had assorted salads and seafood stuffed avocados. They had a  cook to order pasta station that made my dad  bow tie pasta with ham and mozzarella  in a vodka sauce.  I did not get to try the pasta station because I already had eaten too much.  The deserts were numerous and very tasty. My favorites were the cannoli's, pumpkin pie, and the cherry pie. The service staff were always on hand picking up our empty plates and refilling our refreshments. If this establishment keeps up the good work they have our business for life.
