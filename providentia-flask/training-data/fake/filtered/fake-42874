Natraj is a hidden gem in bloomfield. I was suggested by my roommate when i was craving for indian food. I went with my girlfriend .we ordered chicken tikka masala, panir makhani  with naan & mango lassi. .Everything was fresh & hot..I'll say Natraj's chicken tikka masala is the best. I have to give credit to the service at the restaurant.  Customer on next table also told waiter great food  when waiter asked them how is everything. we will deffinately go back .
