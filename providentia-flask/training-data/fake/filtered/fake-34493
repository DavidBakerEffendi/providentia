Ok, read the reviews in some of the NJ mags citing the Star Tavern as having the best NJ thin crust pizza. Well, we went here tonight for a quick, cheap and good meal. Paper plates? Ok, I don't need the amenities if I know what to expect once inside. I was pefectly ok with the informaility; it's a bar. I don't know what possesed us to skip the pizza and explore other offerings. Ordered the fried calamari - absolutely tasteless, could have been fried cardboard as well as it could have been fried calamari. Eggplant parmigiana was ok - heavy on the cheese, but ok. My linginuine with white clam sauce was probably the worst I have ever tasted; not a notch above what they might ever serve in  midwest high school cafeteria. The bread was soft the first minute on the table, but was hard as a tastless rock after that; obviously been sitting around since am and just reheated in the oven or microwave. We went here because of the pizza reviews, and thought that the other items would at least be above average; there are those small hidden neighborhood gems out there, while absent of  the fancy amenities, that offer high quality, tasty food at a great price - this place isn't one of them. Service wasn't horrible, just wasn't great. We will try the Star Tavern for pizza; one day, just not soon.
