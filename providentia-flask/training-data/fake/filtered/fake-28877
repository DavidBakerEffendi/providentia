The food is ok & our waitress, Christy, was pretty good... however, when I received an iced tea with a used half & half packet/ container in it, I lost my appetite.  The girl at the register rang us up with a mouth full of food and grease stains on her shirt.  It's nice to see this diner up and running, but it needs a bit of help.  I'm definitely not impressed.
