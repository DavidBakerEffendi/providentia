OK. I've dined at all of the Marathon establishments, no fireworks here. It held up to the standards of the others in the group. I do compliment the location being as it is only a stone's throw from Rittenhouse Park. My guest and I were in the mood for a cocktail, midday snack, and a new spot. When we arrived we chose to sit at the bar with the attractive bar tender. We went with the special Margarita on the drink list. Amount of alcohol was on point but the ingredients were off. Still didn't make for a bad drink. For first course we had the sweet potato fries. They were tasty, but needed something other then ketchup to accompany. Any type of Aili would have worked. For second course I had the chicken salad on whole wheat. It was good, but needed salt and pepper to bring out the flavor. My guest had the corned beef press. He enjoyed it but took the roasted red peppers off that he asked for on his Caesar salad which he had originally intended on. Just a server error. Both sandwiches came served with Caesar salad. Pretty bad salad. The dressing was disappointing and the lettuce was on its way out the door. Croutons were weak as well. Desserts did not seem appealing so we ended with a SINGLE espresso. The bartender gave us two double espressos only using one shot of espresso. This produced no crema and was overall not enjoyable. To finish, somewhere around the second course a couple entered the establishment and was told by a group of staff members to "sit anywhere" when the couple proceeded the girls all mumbled "Yeah if you can find a clean table ha ha." That is just bad service. Instead of worrying about who Johnny kissed at the rollerskating rink last night is not the hot topic during lunch rush. In my opinion. If you want a decent sandwich and don't mind the off service, then hit up Marathon on the Square.
