Quick service and exceptional middle eastern cuisine!  My husband ordered their falafel, and I had the tabouleh with a side of hummus.  Tabouleh struck the right chord with just the right mix of parsley and tomatoes, and the hummus, served at room temperature was perfectly crafted.  We had traveled to Israel a few years back, and this felt like being back there all over again.  Definitely worth a trip back!
