My boyfriend was so eager to go here, saying it was just like Chipotle but better. I had to try it to believe it and he was definitely correct. More meat options, very friendly owner, very beautiful inside and also seating outside. The food was delicious and prices are not bad at all. Their freshly squeezed lemonade was better than any lemonade you would buy. They even have smoothie options. Also served tres leches cake. This is definitely a place to go back to. Hoping for a success in their business because this is so close for me to go to!
