I went here on a Groupon, it came with free salad and bread. The free bread was delicious with excellent texture. The lamb shank was moist, falling off the bone delicious. The mash potatoes were disappointing, it was powered mash mixed with a few chunks of real potatoes. The beans were from a can with pickled pepper from a can, which although very tasty, I was disappointed that it wasn't homemade. My friend said the salmon was a tail end and not a good cut. The apple pie, especially the crust tasted stale and the tiramisu was a disappointment. The tiramisu is not made with marscapone cheese but rather with some fake oil substance, it had a strange oily artificial aftertaste. My friend enjoyed her beer and I enjoyed my white sangria. It was strong, not bitter, and fruity. Overall I was disappointed in the food (especially the mash potatoes and dessert) and I would not come here again even with the groupon. Total cost of that meal for 2 Â including tip and taxes was $50. I could have had all you can eat sushi with an alcoholic drink for that price.
