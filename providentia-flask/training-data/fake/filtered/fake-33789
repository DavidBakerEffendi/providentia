My wife and I (and our kids) have been going to Jose's since it opened in 1988 or 1989 (I think).   Anyway, we've been going there a LONG time, and its simply a favorite of ours. First and foremost you all need to understand Jose's isn't a Mexican or a Tex-Mex restaurant.  Its modeled on the hole in the wall mesquite grills on the outskirts of Houston, TX.  Those places are far more eclectic than the traditional Mexican or Tex-Mex places you'll find in more Mex-centric places like San Antonio, El Paso and even Denver.   So, the menu at Jose's reflects that Houston eccentricity and influence.  They have a bit of Mexican, but they also have a bit of southern Louisiana Cajun and good ol' Houston mesquite as the centerpiece.   So, stop comparing it to Mexican restaurants, because Jose's isn't trying to be one! As for the food, sometimes they can be a little heavy handed with the cayenne, but overall it never disappoints.   If your dish is too spicy, tell the waiter and they will fix it.   This place is CONSISTANTLY accommodating.   Yes, the crowds can be huge, and I have walked away at the prospect of a 90 minute wait.  But there's a reason why people wait that long for this place.  Its that good!   Fyi, Jose's sister restaurants up in Wayne, NJ and down in Christiana, DE are just as good.
