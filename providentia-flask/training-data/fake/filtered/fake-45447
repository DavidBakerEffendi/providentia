My boyfriend and I just went out for drinks and snacks.  First of all they were very understaffed and had their bartenders waiting the tables which is ridiculous they were all out of the sunday special and waited until we ordered it to tell us otherwise,  we had to ask for lemons 3 times and the food wasn't that good, after we finished our first pitcher it took 15 minutes and I had to go up to the bar to get another, that was def the turning point for me and I was def dissapointed, after that I again had to go to the bar to get the check and she still seemed so bitchy, couldn't pay me to go back there again wish I got her name I would def post it so she will get FIRED!!!!! Truly, Dissapointed customer
