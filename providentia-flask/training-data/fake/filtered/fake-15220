We just had brunch there and what a terrible experience - not the way I would like to start my weekend.  The place is just not run professionally.   - The hostess is not efficient with seating.  When there are parties of 4 or more, they seat parties of two at tables that can seat 4 despite the fact that bigger parties have been waiting longer and two people tables are available.  It just makes the wait longer for everyone.   -The staff is very rude.  They are not dilligent with orders, and when pointed out to them, the responses they give are along the lines of "Well, that's what I heard you say, so here's what I though your order was."   -Plus, we were also asked to pay for a dish that arrived very late as we were finishing off.  And they added gratuity on top. Too bad really, the food is good, but their staff needs a lot of training.
