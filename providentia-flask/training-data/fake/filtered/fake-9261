The restaurant is by far the worst that Manhattan has to offer! Terrible service. Food was average at best. The manager was very unhelpful. The seating situation was terrible and we were not able to enjoy the dinner. Waste of time and money. Expensive for the quality of service and food. If you want real Italian, there are so many better options. For the money I spent I would prefer Da silvano!! Will never go back!
