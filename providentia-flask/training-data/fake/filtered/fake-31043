First off, I honestly never write reviews for places, but I felt compelled after my last visit to Prime 16. I frequent this place often and I have to say it's got to be the best burger around. Throw in a vast beer selection and great ambience and you have a recipe for success. I got "The Smoker" on my last visit and it was fantastic, but I can honestly say I've never had a less than amazing burger at any visit. The staff is always super friendly and knowledgeable, especially our server Angela. She made it an absolute pleasure to be there. I strongly encourage anyone to visit this restaurant.
