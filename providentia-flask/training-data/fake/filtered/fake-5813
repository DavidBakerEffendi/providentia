Member of the miditto Sunset Wine & Dine Meetup which took place there midweek.  Lively group that was friendly, conversational and well-traveled.  Sampled several wine and prosecco, all of which were terrific, in particular the house red wines, which were full-bodied and pleasant.  I tried the Taramasalata spread, a red caviar with olive oil and lemon that was strong on its own, but nice as a spread with the various breads provided.  Two raves near me for the grilled octopus.  Service was excellent; never a need for waitstaff.  Cozy interior with a nice ambiance.
