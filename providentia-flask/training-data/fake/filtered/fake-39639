This place I know since it was a little hole in the wall that I used to flock to from Manhattan like a ritual every week. The food is better than I have had in many places in Thailand. The heat can be dialed up - sometimes you do need to speak firmly to the staff to do so as they do not believe you can eat things that hot :-) There are a few special dishes you will not find better anywhere. I think today I would share with you my suggestion of the Massaman with Beef. few know but this dish is cooked for 48 hours before it ever reaches your plate. All the complex flavors mold together and create a dance over your taste buds. I have this dish all over Thailand and this is better. I love bringing friends here but I do so with the caution that they will be ruined. Once you eat here having properly ordered off the menu. No Thai place in NYC will ever live up to this standard. My suggestions.. get there early- or avoid dinner rush. People congregate outside and have to wait sometimes an hour to get in. I used to grab a drink at the bar on the corner to kill some time
