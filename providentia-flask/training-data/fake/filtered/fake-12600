Yum!  Did the price-fixe Eastern State Pent deal and I was not disappointed.   We had a bit of everything -- memorable dishes include the Beet Salad, the Salmon, and the Crispy Tuna Roll.  They even accommodated my request to have the sauces/glazes on the side.  Definitely will be returning to check out brunch.
