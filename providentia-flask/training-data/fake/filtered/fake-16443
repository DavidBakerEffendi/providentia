The best beef burgers!!! I've been here a few times and every time I order the same thing "cheeseburger well done please" it is so delicious! I wouldn't recommend ordering fries just because the burger is so big, but if you're like me and need fries too, the steak fries and onion rings combo are great. The service is wonderful. The parking lot is a tight squeeze, but it's worth it. So if Â you like BIG juicy burgers you should go to Jackson Hole in Astoria. I can't wait to go back.
