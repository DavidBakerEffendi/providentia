Great little market/deli, tend to have a decent selection of dry and fresh goods. They have a good selection of spices, sauces, and other items if you need something asap. Cashiers are friendly and a lot of the shoppers live close by. Produce can be hit or miss, but everything I've gotten here has been ok. Hours are convenient and it's easy to stop by from Suburban Station or 30th St Station.
