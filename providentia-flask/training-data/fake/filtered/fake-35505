Who would have thought that you could have gotten this type of meal in an office building in downtown hartford ? The food is something I would have expected in the some of the finest places in NYC. The manager Marwan is fantastic, very attentive his wine recommendations were on piont. We started off lunch with a Bordeaux Blanc, and nice duck confee and acorn soup it was very light and fresh. Next was a light hand made tortellini with smoked goat cheese and ch√¢teau Michelle Chardonnay. For the main course was a venison lion cooked perfect medium rare with a wonderful shiraz. This has become one of my favorate places in the state and when they start offering dinners on firday I will be back. Highly reccomended. !!!!!!!
