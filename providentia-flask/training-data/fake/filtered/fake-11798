A friend introduced me to GO!GO!CURRY!  I went back a couple weeks later... and then again the next day.  Pretty much any time I was anywhere near the place, I stopped in.  It's a hefty heaping of fried breading and savory brown sludge which probably knocked several years off my lifespan, but it's so worth it.  Oh my god.
