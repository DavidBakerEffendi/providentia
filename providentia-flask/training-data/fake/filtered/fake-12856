"Fat Sandwiches" are nothing more then 2 chicken tenders, 2 mozzarella sticks, and a piece of bread. This would be bad for around 5 dollars, but when it's costing you around 7-10 dollars a sandwich I think they can give a little more for your money. Another awesome feature to this restaurant is that the menu online is inaccurate, as I ordered a "fat night" which online states nothing about having sauce, but to my surprised after arriving home, I found that there was sauce on it. Wonderful.
