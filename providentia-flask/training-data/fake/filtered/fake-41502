I wasn't sure what to make of this place from the street, but I was very pleasantly surprised.  I had the cob salad, but next time I'll be back for the burger and fries.  Everything was very good including the service. Parking is very close by and it's easy to walk to.  The place is small so be sure to get there early or you could be waiting. If you have a chance to visit this place - be sure to do so! **Please do the rest of us a favor and don't bring your kids here.  Thank you!**
