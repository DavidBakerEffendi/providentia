What a great place! I went with a friend for the first time last weekend and we enjoyed it very much. The menu has something for everyone. The lovely woman who greeted us and brought us our food is a delight, so welcoming and friendly. We live in Bucks County but will be returning without a doubt! Can't wait to try the soup!
