I used to love coming to the place for food and great beer selection.  I'm a huge foodie and constantly entertain friends around the city.  In the last few years as great as i find the food to be at this place, its just not worth coming in for the service.   It seems the management could care less about the customers or any requests or questions they might have.  I came in a few times on a sat night and we sat at the upstairs bar due to the down stairs being way too crowded.   The bartender managed to ignore us till we called out probably 3 times to try to get a drink.  My boy friend asked the female bartender a few questions regarding the food where she managed to roll her eyes and completely blow off the question to cut him off any other questions.  We ate out meal and the food was great but not once were we asked if we needed a refill or another drink, if the meal was ok, or if there was anything else we might want to order.   I have no problem spending money and this place wasn't expensive at all but when i go out to eat, i do not expect to be treated so poorly by someone who is supposed to be servicing us and getting a tip from us.  Don't think i'd want to come back to be treated in such a manner ever again.
