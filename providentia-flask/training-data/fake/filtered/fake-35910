Dig the atmosphere , everything else just bad . Long waits can be bearable just not when the host is rude , server is rude and the food is over priced and mediocre at best . Not worth the effort of a 2nd chance , really don't think we encountered some unusual circumstances , there just not Â good . . . . and a terrible neighbor as well ! !
