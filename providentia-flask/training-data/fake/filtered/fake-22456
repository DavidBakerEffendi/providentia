Overall, great food, friendly service, fun atmosphere! (and BYOB!) Shared the grilled corn with parmesan and sriracha and also fried brussel sprouts with bacon and a fried egg on top. both so yummy! Then I had the chicken casserole which was like chicken pot pie with butternut squash and pears. My friend had pulled pork sandwich with apple cole slaw on top. Both were really tasty too. The servers were friendly and offered suggestions for the menu. Since it's BYOB it's a great place for a group of people to go and hang out. There was a big group there and the servers stayed open late for them so they could hang out and enjoy themselves. Food was reasonably priced, I think-for NYC :) When we got up to leave I told the chefs thanks and how much we enjoyed the food. They said they were about to bring us out some free desserts so they sent them with us to go. A huuuge pumpkin whoopie pie with cream cheese filling. Yum! I will definitely be back to try something else. Very small and cozy place I would absolutely recommend to anyone.
