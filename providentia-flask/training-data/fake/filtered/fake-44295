I LOVE local eateries and diner type places but I have to say my experience here was a mix of good and bad.  The food was delicious but the wait staff was cold and unwelcoming.  It would have been a 4 rating otherwise.  Maybe it was a bad day? (Very possible since it is a Monday after all).  To sum it up- if you are going for the food, I would recommend it.  If you are the type of person that likes to go to an establishment that appreciates your business, I would avoid this place.
