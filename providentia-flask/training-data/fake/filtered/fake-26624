I had a somewhat pleasant experience.  The food was actually pretty good but the service was lacking, the wait was long and the food portions were very small for a brunch and very much overpriced. The decor is nice but atmosphere is a bit lacking............it was incredibly noisy, which is to be expected at a weekend brunch but when mixed with music that was playing way to loud it does not leave a pleasant memory!  if I am in the area I will try stop by but I will not go out of my way to do so.
