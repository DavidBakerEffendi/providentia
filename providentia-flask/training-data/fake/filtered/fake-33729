Have been coming here for years. Although I am sure it doesnt taste like true Tex-Mex, being from NJ who cares? I never was in Texas so I dont know the difference. The portions are big, the salsa on the table with chips is awesome and the service is good. However be advised this place is NOISY and has a lot of screaming kids at any given time. The prices are great and almost every dish is great, although I am dissapointed by the recent dissaparence of the fried mozzarella(bring it back!!). If you havent been here it is worth the trip.
