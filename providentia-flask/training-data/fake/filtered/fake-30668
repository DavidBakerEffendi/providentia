Brought my family their for dinner last and the food was amazing. I had the Stuffed Shrimp that was fantastic... Think I tasted scallops in their stuffing. My wife had their Veal Parm and that was out of this world. Â The kids had chicken fingers, and it was nice it came with ice cream (which was my dessert). This has been my breakfast spot for the past few months, and now adding my dinner spot.
