If there were an option to give no stars I would!!!! The food quality over the years has gone down sooo much. Maybe because of new owners? Also the staff,, I have been treated poorly several times there not just from the drivers but from the managers,, they don't seem to care,,, only out for a buck. I wouldn't waste my time going here. There are plenty of authentic pizzarias around NY and Staten Island to get a great experience from. Trust me and they are over priced as well. Things keep going up quality keeps going down.
