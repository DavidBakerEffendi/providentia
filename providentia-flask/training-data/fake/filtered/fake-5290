Really good.. everything was delicious. The drinks were fantastic! One word of warning the jalapeno lime margarita is more jalapeno than lime and will test your spice limits! We had the guac, which was really good, but a little pricey and then chicken and fish tacos which were excellent. Â Great serving sizes and the rest of the food in the restaurant also looked very good. One thing I loved about this restaurant was the chips. A lot of Mexican restaurants in the city let you down with their poor quality of chips. Barrio Chino's chips were fantastic.
