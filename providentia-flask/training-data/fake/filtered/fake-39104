I was there few times for lunch time. (I think I almost taste all the lunch menu...) The foods is great and looks really beautiful. Lunch special is very reasonable and you can get appetizer, main course, dessert and coffee. Bread and olive come first and that is also delicious!!! I believe I will be there soon!!!
