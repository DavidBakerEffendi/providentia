The food was over priced!! And not that great. The service was on and off had to call the waitress over several time, there was only about a dozen people in the place. The floor is a skating rink. The stupid iPad billing sucked they ran my card 6 times and got it shut off, ended up paying twice. And being on the phone with the card company for an hour trying to get it straightened out. All the waitress had to say was " sorry you will have to figure it out with the bank. And we need up doing this to someone else the other day. They got charged 3 times." I'm all about local and supporting non chain restaurants and I know the place is new. But they have some work to do. Don't think ill be going there again, anytime soon.
