i have been passing by this small coffee shop for months and finally i got the time to walk in. When i eat in a restaurant im looking for few things... Neatness, prices, and the taste of the food and the service.. when i walk in on a thursday morning the girl greeted me Â with a smile and as soon as i told her that its my frist time so she asked me if im looking for something sweet or savory, and i said both, so since its breakfast she offered me few options like the traditonal belgian waffle topped with pwdered sugar with syrup on the side and i can order variety of sides like bacon egg saus etc, then she offered me the savory stuffed waffle that they have i can stuffed it with veggies meats cheeses eggs etc and then the liege sugar waffles thay have cinammon or vanilla that i can stuffed it with fruits and chocolate, looking at the menu itself makes u wanna get everything.. so i got the savory stuffed with ham havarti cheese and onions and eggs and for dessert i had cinammon sugar waffle stuffed with banana and pecans.. and not even 10 mins the order came out, and it TASTE so good, i mean i never had a waffle like those..... and the waitress got back at me after few minutes and i was just speechless coz its so good... And for drink she offered me their special i think its called hazelnut cream mocha, its sinfully good.. So heres my verdict neatness- well its morning so everythi ng is neat so 4 stars service - polite. nice smile, food came out fast, attentive 5 stars food quality- VERY TASTY, it makes u wanna try a lot different waffles, i will comback for lunch for paninis and sandwhiches prices- its a little bit pricey but its worth it! i will recommend this place for a nice waffle experience.
