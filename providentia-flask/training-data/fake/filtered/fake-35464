Prior to its closing, I'd been to Christy's three times and thought it was great. Great atmosphere, decent prices, live music. Unfortunately, it closed. I hadn't been there since it reopened but decided to pitch the idea of going there to my friends this weekend. I've never been so embarrassed about making a suggestion before. It seems as though the staff has gotten snarky upon reopening -- they blatantly made fun of us while we were there! It's a shame because I liked it there, and it's not too far from where I live. Luckily, New Haven has a decent amount of Irish Pubs that are excellent in price, quality, AND CUSTOMER SERVICE (Dempsey's, Richter's - they reopened from what I know, O'Tooles)...from now on, I'll put in a good word for places that do right by its patrons.
