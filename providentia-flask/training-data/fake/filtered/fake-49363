Absolutely great indian food. While it is a small restaurant hidden in a small shopping center, it is definitely worth a visit. We order their Chicken 65 appetizer every single time we go, as well as an order of their naan, which is just fantastic. The service is good, especially since it seems they do more take-out than sit down orders. The restaurant was also recently redone so the dining room looks really, really great. Highly recommended!
