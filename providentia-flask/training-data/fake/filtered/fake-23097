Not a fan... Let's start with the apps, our table order 3 apps to share, the nachos were soggy and unedible. The fried mooz was basic, not hot or gooey the way melted cheese is supposed to be, these were more like blocks of breaded cheese, and finally the softies, which are pretzels and mustard. Basically, the are the super pretzels that are sold in the frozen food section at your local grocery store. I took two bites and was done with it. My dinner was a ceaser salad. Well again I took two bites and was done. The lettuce was soggy and not fresh, tasted like it was at least two days old, I can't blame the dressing for the sogginess because I has it on the side and added it myself. I can get a fresher salad at Wendy's! We waited in hour to be seated, was not worth the wait and money.
