Alright, dont get me wrong, the food is great. I have never had a bad experience with that, but the service is a different story. My wife and I had our very first date night in many, many months. We decided to go to kotos. Ordered up our drinks, and the waiter proceeded to deliver our salads. Thats where it went down hill fast. The waiter was setting my salad down when it slipped out of his hands, and smashed down in front of me, sending pieces of glass flying in every direction. One piece actually cut my arm enough to bleed. the waiter uttered something I didnt understand, gave the table a swipe with a stinky wet dish cloth, and left. Are you kidding me? I actually had to get the waiters attention again. to come back over, where I told him I needed a few bandaids for my cut that was bleeding. He got me a few bandaids, and left again. didnt see him until our food was ready. We were not reseated, nor were we given new drinks or soups (whos to say glass wasnt in there).10mins into eating our meal a hostess came by and asked us how our meal was. Where I told her the food wasnt my problem. She asked what I meant, an I told her the story. She apologized, and said she was going to go and speak with the owner. Long story short she returned shortly (without the owner) and said they were going to give us 20% off our meal.Oh good 9.78 off our meal. Made me feel better. Are you kidding me?! Talk about an insult! I was prepared to have a free meal, with some vouchers for another free meal, or something worth my wild. Instead, 20%, and 2 bandaids. I could of cut out a %20 coupon from a newspaper. Thanks a lot, I really felt over appreciated!
