When we came here a few weeks ago at about 6pm, we were told the wait time was 1.5 hours.... and we walked out since we had other plans later that night. Yesterday we got here around 4pm, the wait was about 30 mins, not too bad. The service was adequate and the ramen broth is as good as it could be. We ordered chicken Hirata buns, Shiromaru Hakata Classic with egg, Karaka-men (spicy version). We were told the chicken Hirata buns are spicy and we asked for sauce on the side.
