Me and my wife visited this restaurant yesterday afternoon and were blown away. The staff was the best I've been served by in New York in particular Chris, who helped us navigate the menu and led us to the outstanding chicken and waffle taco which was the best I've had in a while. my wife had the short rib burrito which she downed in about 5mins. Lol we most defiantly will be back to this place not only because of the food but because they make it a worth while experience. if you swing by make sure u ask for Chris the big Texan u can't miss him lol he'll take care of you.
