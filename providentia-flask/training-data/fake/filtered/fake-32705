if there were 10 stars I would give it to the lasagna! Â It is best I ever had! We have also tried the meatballs, other pasta dishes and the pork tenderloin and all were delicious. Also of note is a nice beer selection and wines on tap. My only complaint is that the tables are too close together, and the restaurant gets quite loud.
