Whats wrong with you guys!!! 1. Vegetable Biryani is made of Butter alone and no veggies. No taste at all, just lame and dumb. 2. Besibellabath taste is same as the Ready-To-Eat of the shelf food, Not made fresh at the place. 3. Dosa is made so hard and big that eating one dosa is end of the week, Cant eat anything else for atleast two days!!! Soo sick of the hardness. Had a great respect to you all for giving authentic taste and cleanliness in the place. Lately, the taste is just going junk and most of the veggies are frozen that is making the taste low quality. Seeing negligence growing in giving tasty food. Though the customers are treated good with nice and sober attitude, lack of taste in food is repelling away from coming to the place.
