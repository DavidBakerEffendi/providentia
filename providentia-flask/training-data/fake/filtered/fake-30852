I am not overrating Sea Witch. I've been frequenting their Xanadu-like backyard almost every Sunday for the past couple months. The hand-crafted and lacquered wood tables are a nice touch, as is the running stream. Â Fish in a South Slope bar? Seriously? Done. For the mouth, they make a super spicy Bloody Mary, their sandwiches are cheap and delicious, and they have a respectable craft beer selection. I would be happy if this place stayed under the RADAR, though I also want them to flourish. I'm torn.
