I WISH I COULD GIVE THIS PLACE 0 STARS :((( HORRIBLE! I have been to this diner twice with my boyfriend and both times we have been treated horribly! They manager is an old grumpy man and the waitress that served us (before I walked out) was so rude! The worst diner I have ever been to! DISGUSTING FOOD! ALL TOGETHER A DUMP! THERE ARE SO MANY DINERS AROUND HERE WHY GO TO A DUMP LIKE THIS :(
