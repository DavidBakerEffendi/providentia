Definitely not the best cheese steak in the area, but it's a fun touristy place to stop. Just bring gobs of cash. Basically, you walk up to one window where you order your steak (my fave is whiz with onions). You fork over $8.50 - then you wait on line at the next window and order fries and a drink - and fork over another 8 bucks or so. Then you try and hold the steak, cup of fries and soda while wandering around looking for a free table or loitering in front of people that appear to be finishing up. It is a bit of a juggling act. There is no indoor seating or bathroom to speak of. They do take credit cards, but it takes longer to process and you get lots of dirty looks from the cashier and people in line behind you. Tip: Have your cash out and ready for when you step to the window.
