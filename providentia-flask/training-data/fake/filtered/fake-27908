Corner Bistro is played out. Has been for a loooooonggg time. Royale has joined the ranks of the Burgerati, providing a dense, flavorful slab of sirloin on a sturdy yet pillowy bun, complimented by crispy bacon and mondo onion rings. Order it with a Molson on tap and settle in. One caveat: get ready to deal with some serious seersuckers from the upper east side, for Royale, for better or for worse, has been discovered. Makes for a Roadhouse meets American Psycho vibe when it gets crowded, but if you're there for Burgers and Beers, you won't be disappointed.
