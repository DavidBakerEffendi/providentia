This place is killin' it, right off the bat.  I've been there a few times, and it never disappoints.  Mushroom burger and fries, lovable servers.  Steph is a serving machine. She took great care of me and my friends in what looked like a rockin' crowd,  Chris and Madison hold it down,too.  The Bartenders are funny as hell and have fun at their work.  Meagan and Kim kept a smile on my face and a beer in my hand. No doubt, I will return
