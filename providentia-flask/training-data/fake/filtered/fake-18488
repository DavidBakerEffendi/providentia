Much remains superb.  Tasting menu well thought out and 3 of the 7 items were excellent, I.e., not quite 50%.  Specifically, warm lobster salad, duck and the deserts were sublime.  The halibut was dry, over-cooked really.  Service was not very good - unusual for a Danny Meyer restaurant.  The most offensive moment was that the first course was plunked down in front of us just BEFORE the cocktails arrived which did not bode well for a leisurely celebratory dinner.  We spoke to the waiter and things did get on course but patrons should not need to train wait staff at $$$$ restaurants.  The room is beautiful and the atmosphere is festive.
