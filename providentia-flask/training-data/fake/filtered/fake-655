As I read about this new burger joint on Thrillist I was anxiously anticipating it's debut on the East coast...and it was an Umami let down! My girlfriend and I arrived on Columbus Day, a Monday to a 20 minute wait which I figured was a great sign, however the hostess failed to direct us to two open seats at the bar when I asked about availability.  Fortunately I scoped out the seats prior to any vultures swooping in and we plopped down for a burger craving completion. Our bar tender was a SOFT spoken young man...almost to the point of leaning in and saying WHAT! at every interaction.  My girlfriend ordered the Upstater which was pronounced by it's sweetness rather than the tequila or cucumber and I a Club Soda.  Without advising the bar tender kindly poured me a bottle of club soda which ended up costing 3.50$!  Now I am not cheap and customarily would have been drinking, day four of antibiotics, but when pouring bottled club soda that's 3.50 please advise the bar patron of such. We ordered the Truffled beet salad, Man Fries, Man Burger, & Original Umami Burger.   Truffled Beet Salad tasted as though the arugula had been tossed with salt followed by a light dusting of salt and finished with a touch of salt!   Well, I will cut to the chase...all of the food tasted like it had bathed in a Sea Salt bath for a week or month!  Understanding the definition of Umami...that briny savory taste; MSG; I get it!  But there should be other flavors that are pervasive when eating my burger, fries and salad.  Let the meat stand out a bit, or the truffle oil, or even the bacon!!!   This was a disappointing burger escape!  Waste of a cheat meal this week!
