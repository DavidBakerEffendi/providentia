Good wine and a nice atmosphere but the food is very overpriced: tiny portions and more than half of each dish consists of bland, unsalted bread. I feel like this is one of those places people fall over themselves praising and convincing themselves they love because it's a nice space in a cute location and you might find yourself seated next to Julianne Moore or someone like that but if you break the food down, you're really getting almost nothing and it's either not that tasty (the steak tartare had no seasoning at all) or something you could make at home in less than a minute for about 35 cents (the $10 anchovy tartine). Our dessert (the chocolate mousse) was the only tasty thing we had, out of eight dishes (and, funnily enough, the only one with any salt). In any case, I'm not trying to scare anyone away. It's a cute spot and nothing was terrible. But I'd recommend it for drinks and one plate at the most and not for dinner.
