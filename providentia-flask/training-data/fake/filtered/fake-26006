after three years of coming to this cafe with my family for early breakfast, lunch and dinner, and numerous friends that i had met at this cafe we were refused service today with no explanation by a waiter. the staff was rude, on the edge and they seemed dissatisfied with their own work and work conditions. the cooks that i was allowed to talk were miserable too and seemed overworked. what happened to this formerly great place?
