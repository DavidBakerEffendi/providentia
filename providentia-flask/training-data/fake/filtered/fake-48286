If I could rate it lower I would.  This was my first time there.  I ordered a pizza steak (which means they added pizza sauce) with American cheese, onions and mushrooms.  Steak was very low quality and too thickly cut and it wasn't even warm enough to melt the cheese.  The sauce was runny and tasteless - so runny, in fact that the juice ran everywhere over the paper they give you and spilled out all over my shirt.  Roll, too, was tasteless.   I will say their service was very efficient.   I will never eat there again and would not recommend anyone do so, either.  There are far better Philly cheesesteaks elsewhere!
