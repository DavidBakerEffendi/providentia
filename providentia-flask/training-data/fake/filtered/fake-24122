Crappy seating, tight. We got bumped from our seats in the middle of our dinner and put in another. The noodles were rubbery, while the pork was good. The broth was subpar. Service was only alright, and it was just too dang cramped to be a worthwhile let enjoyable experience. By the way, I also got food poisoning from this place, and was up all night in the bathroom, as a result. This should be a factor, though I'm not going to say this happens all the time, but it surely is indicative of something.
