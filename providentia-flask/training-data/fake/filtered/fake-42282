I ordered the beef ball noodle soup and it was the worst decision ever...besides stepping in the restaurant. basically, it cost me around $7 for a bowl that is the size of a CD diameter, with a scoop of yellow thin egg noodles, 4 beef balls, tossed green onions of top, and MSG soup. i shouldve just bought a box of ramen and added some creativity. maybe i just ordered the wrong thing...but their picture on the menu was deceiving...
