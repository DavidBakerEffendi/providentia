Amazing food.  We had a pretty big group, and we ordered a lot of variety.  Everyone was impressed.  Downstairs got a little too loud at times, we almost couldn't talk to each other.  We had to yell.  Upstairs is more spacious and quieter it seems.  I tried octopus for the first time and loved it.  They seem to use a real charcoal grill so that really adds flavor to the grilled dishes.  Sangria was also very tasty.  No one was disappointed with anything.  My wife fell in love with the ice cream.  It was heavenly.
