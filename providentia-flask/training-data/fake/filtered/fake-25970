This place is totally not worth the money and hassle just to get a sub!  First off, they charge a $.50 "service" fee for using a debit card and post the tiniest little sign at the register; they blame it on the economy.  Secondly, a 6" is $7.45!!!  What?!?! Its not like you're getting a gourmet sandwich here.  Lastly, and what makes me the most annoyed with this place, is if you don't order "the right way" they yell at you and get very irritated with you and as the customer you become scared to tell them what you want!   The same people have been working there for years which is nice to see but can they get anymore miserable!   And yes, they use fresh deli meats and fresh bread but honestly this sub I'm eating right now is flavorless, messy and overpriced! Sorry, extremely disappointed.
