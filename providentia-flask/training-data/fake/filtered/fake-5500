Met a few friends up in Astoria for drinks. I hate Astoria ..and Queens in general, but this place is definitely a diamond in the rough! Hipsters in Astoria?? I had no idea. Drinks were awesome -I'm typically a scotch drinker, but couldn't resist the amazing cocktail menu. Bartender was a cool dude and the atmosphere was the perfect date spot- If you even want to bring one with so many good looking guys around. Just sayin ;)
