I love this place. The dumplings are amazing. Venessa's dumplings (just next door) cannot compare. After trying prosperity dumplings, I went out on a dumpling expedition- trying to find all dumplings that tasted just as good. I even went as far to buy frozen dumplings from multiple locations. These dumplings which i cooked at home taste much better than Vanessa's, which I have tried at the location and also bought frozen. Although this place does not have much of an exterior, it is a must-to-try.
