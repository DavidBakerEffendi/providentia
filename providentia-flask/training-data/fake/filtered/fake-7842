I ate at Sweetwaters on a recent trip to Burlington with my mother and we both found this place to be really great!  We chose Sweetwaters based on reviews in our travel book and online (not by "menu hopping" down Church St.).  I thought their menu was pretty creative and reasonably priced compared to some other restaurants in the area so I'm disappointed that some folks have said their menu/food is unoriginal, etc.   We were seated right away on a Monday night--it wasn't crazy busy, but not dead either.  Our waiter was very friendly and personable.  I liked the layout of the place--cool old building.  My mom ordered the haddock, which she liked, and I tried--it was pretty good.  But for me, the standout was what I ordered--the Thai Shrimp Pasta.  This was seriously one of the best dishes I've eaten in a while.  It was spicy, but so good, I didn't want to give my mouth a break to cool down!  I washed it down with an Allagash White beer and all was good, though.  Overall, very impressed with the taste and quality of my dish.  Huge serving, lots of shrimp, pasta, red curry, veggies--very tasty.  My only beef with this dish is that it was pretty hot--and I was fine with this because I've had curries before and I knew what to expect.  But there was no note on the menu declaring this dish as spicy, so for anyone who's never had such food before, it may come as a shock. Lastly--second beef with this place, which folks with disabilities should note, is that the bathroom is down in the basement and there's a good amount of stairs to get down there, so not totally handicapped friendly.  My mom uses a walker to get around and other than that, they were able to accommodate her just fine.
