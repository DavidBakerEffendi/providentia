This is the WORST Chinese restaurant I have ever experienced.  I am from out of town and after a long, hard day at work was looking forward to getting take out and relaxing in my hotel.  After picking it up, I discovered that the tofu bean curd soup I ordered consisted of about 4 cups of broth and 2 teaspoons of vegetables.  Since the only other thing I ordered was the dumplings, I clearly did not have enough food for dinner.  When I called to complain, they just kept asking "Are you sure? Are you sure??"  I guess they thought that I was just making this up and made no offer to rectify the situation.  I hung up and called another Chinese Restaurant and ordered the same thing since I was still hungry.
