Honestly, I eat sushi all the time and have gone to many restaurants, but Yamada is my favorite. Charlie, the owner is soooo friendly. He always greets me on first name basis, so it makes me feel great that not o my does he remember my name, but also some of my favorite rolls. The sushi is fresh and before we leave, he always gives us a complimentary taste of some new rolls he is making for tomorrow's special. I HIGHLY recommend coming here and it's also BYOB!!
