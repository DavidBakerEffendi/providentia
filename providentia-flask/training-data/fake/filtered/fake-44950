My first experience here was delicious. However had take out tonight. Advertised baby spinach and grilled chicken wrap with a side salad. They put the cold salad in with the hot wrap so the lettuce was hot and disgusting and then inside of the wrap was not baby spinach but some nasty looked liked canned spinach with a terrible taste. They should remove this item from the menu.
