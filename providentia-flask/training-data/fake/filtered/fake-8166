This place has hands down the best chicken Parmesan I have ever had! The portions are huge and I was able to eat leftovers twice. I only gave them a 4 because our server was a bit rude. He was very short with us and walked away after only half our table had ordered drinks. We had to call him back several times which was annoying. He also messed up one of our pizza orders and it had to be sent back to the kitchen for a while to correct. Other than that I will most defiantly be back! Delicious!
