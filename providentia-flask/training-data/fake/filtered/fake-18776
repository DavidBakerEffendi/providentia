I've been to Vietnamese restaurants from coast to coast and this has to be the worst one. I ordered the pho special for take out and the broth was so cold that the oil congealed. I've ordered noodles from countless restaurants and have never been served cold broth. It's an insult. I took the meal back to the restaurant and the lady insisted that this was how Vietnamese noodles were made to go. She was trying to fool me but I'm not stupid. I'm a Southeast Asian-American who grew up among Vietnamese Americans. Apparently, they'll microwave old broth for you if you eat in. Good luck. On the bright side, the bubble tea was good. If you're in Hartford, head out to Pho Boston or if you're in Springfield, MA go to Vinh Chau.
