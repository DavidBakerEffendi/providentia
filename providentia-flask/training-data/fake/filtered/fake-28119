This is absolutely our go-to place in the East Village.  The staff including our favorite "quasi-goth girl" are the sweetest people you are likely to meet, and are much nicer in fact than me and most of the people I know. The list of wines is well edited, and you can absolutely trust the staff to find you something to your liking if you've got no clue of what you want.   Let me say that the beer list on the Against the Grain side is one of the most extensive in the hood...definitely worth a gander, and let's not forget those oyster shooters.  Yum!
