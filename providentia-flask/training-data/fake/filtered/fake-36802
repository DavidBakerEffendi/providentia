My son and I visited on a weekday evening when there was no line (there usually is). I had one of their pasta dishes and he had a quesadilla. I was quite surprised at how good they tasted. The pasta was on a par with finer restaurants. However, where PJ's falls down is on service and price. My pasta was under the heating lamps for eight minutes because the quesadilla was not prepared promptly. The waiter noticed I was watching my plate being warmed and wisely took it back to the kitchen. He said they re-cooked it. I feel the prices they charge for all their dishes are several dollars above where they should be. While the food is excellent, the atmosphere and service are not, making their prices unreasonable.
