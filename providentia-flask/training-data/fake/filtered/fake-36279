I've only been here for the karaoke and haven't eaten here so not sure how the food is.  This place gets SUPER crowded for karaoke, so if you're really into signing (I'm not), I recommend getting a private room or getting there early!  Definitely get there early any way, just because you won't have to wait in a lame line outside.   The joint is pretty fun and serves your standard asian beers on tap, which is cool.  I would be down for a return trip to YB.
