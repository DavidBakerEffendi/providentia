The only reason this is a two and not a one was our pleasant hostess and server. Otherwise, the best way sum this place up is OVERRATED. Moderate priced 'Italian' with high expectations. Apparently these expectations were raised due to a previous head chef who left to pursue other prospects. I had the prosciutto stuffed pork chop, and my fiancee had the tuna steak after we had our greasy appetizer of some mushroom dish. The first thing I noticed about our entrees was the portion size. In my experience, when you pay a premium for a meal, the portions reflect that. Quality meats and prep cost more. Cheap meats and prep or lack thereof typically indicates the ability to give more for less. My two over sized pork chops were both dry with prosciutto that was flavorless. Her tuna steaks were also dry, flavorless with the exception of the three handfuls of pepper they were bathed in. The attempt to mask their poor quality ingredients with larger portions failed terribly. Oh, but it gets better. Within three hours my GI tract also agreed that the meal was underwhelming; lets just say it came out the way it went in. When we followed up the next morning with a phone call, we were met an attitude from gentlemen on the other end of the phone who 'prooooooommmmised' the manager will return our call later in the afternoon as he was busy. Apparently he must be in the same meeting over two weeks and two additional calls later. Return trip? Never. Dont waste your time, there are too many quality Italian restaurants in New Haven to waste your time. Try Tony & Lucille's or Skappo, but if you enjoy a good meal, avoid Tre Scalini.
