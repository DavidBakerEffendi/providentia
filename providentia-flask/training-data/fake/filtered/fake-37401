Went for dinner last night and I have to write this review. The food was surprisingly very balanced with spices and flavor. I was worried that for me the food would be too spicy but well done chef. Their tandoori jumbo shrimp was just too good paired which I paired a white Pinot Grigio with. We also had their famous tandoori chicken which was amazing as well. The chicken was soft and tender. Overall, the meal was just excellent paired with some great ice creams. The decor is quite welcoming with a flair for a little middle eastern touch. Very comfortable seating arrangements and quite a large space for a restaurant. It's clean and beautiful. The staff is quite friendly but I would say that my reason for a 4 star review and not a 5 star is that some of the staff is not well trained. The manager, i think her name was Versha, was excellent. She made sure our needs were well taken care of and attended to us nicely. I would recommend this place for sure.
