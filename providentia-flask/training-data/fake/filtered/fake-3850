I keep forgetting that I haven't reviewed Sakagura on Yelp yet.  I've been going there since 2007 and it has stayed consistently at the top of my favorite restaurants in NYC.  I've tried about everything on their menu, including the natto.  While there are definitely dishes that I'm not fond of, it's only because the dish isn't to my taste and not because of any deficiency in the quality/prep/presentation.  The space is also excellent.  As their specialty, the sake selection is exhaustive and they definitely satisfy my preference for junmai-ginjo sakes.  Really, everything here is delicious.  And I always end with the black sesame creme brulee. Drooling a bit here as I'm writing this.
