I found this pizza shop to have a very friendly staff.  I ordered the meat lovers pizza and it was very tasty.  The prices are also very fair.  My sister loves the chicken parm grinder and her husband loves their Greek salads.  I will be ordering here on a regular basis.  Keep up the good food and friendly service.
