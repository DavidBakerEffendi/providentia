Best acai bowl in New York! I stumbled into Two Hands off the street looking for a quick coffee and ended up staying a couple of hours. I'm not sure if it was the big smile on the barrister's face or if the coffee actually tasted like heaven in a cup. Either way, I now have a new coffee spot in lower manhattan. Definitely worth a visit. If the chilled atmosphere doesn't take you away then the food will.
