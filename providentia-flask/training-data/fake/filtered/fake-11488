We went here on St Paddys Day for a dinner to get off the streets. The service was great - server couldn't be nicer. The chicken was really good and my hubsand enjoyed the 'ace-in-the-sleeve" but seriously. STAY AWAY from the pork. I got the side "pork & beans" and my friend got pulled pork and she was up all night getting sick. I didn't throw up but I my stomach was upset all the next day. The sides were AMAZING. The chicken AMAZING. but wouldn't get the work again.
