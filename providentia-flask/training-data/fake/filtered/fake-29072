This was my first time trying a cambodian sandwich. I went for the Tiger Coconut Shrimp and all i can say is yummmmmmmmm yummmmmm. Delicious!!! Its spicy but not overwhelmingly spicy, just enough kick to wake up your taste buds. The Shrimp were cooked to perfection, the cucumber added that crunch, the coconut was subtle sweetnes and the cilantro added great flavor. I cant wait to try thier other sandwiches. A MUST TRY!! Â ---- I do agree that the sandwiches are rather small for $8.50 and all you get is a sandwich no side orders nothing. But i was satisfied with taste and quality, so I guess i'll chuck it up to this being NYC....where everything seems to be overpriced.
