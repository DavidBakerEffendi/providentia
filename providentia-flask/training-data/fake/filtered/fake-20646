I waited 5 weeks for  a reservation. Then arrived and still waited for a talbe.  Great Hemmingway Daq at the bar, really nice staff.  I finally sat, expectations so high -- and I have to say it was pretty phenomenal.  A beautiful wine list, bone marrow small plate was incredible and the black label burger was amazing.   The hype is well deserved.
