Well worth the drive from manhattan!!! The clams so great ,  the  spaghetti with shrimp sauce to die for! The house red yum yum yum!  We were so full by the veal don peppa arrived we could have stopped at pasta course.  We gorged and ate most of it!!,!  This is a definite destination restaurant!! Don't miss this place ! The Texas Girls gone to NYC !!!
