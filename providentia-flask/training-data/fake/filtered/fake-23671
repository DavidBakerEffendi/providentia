Am I the only one who doesn't think it's all that? Ordered a burger medium (it's ground beef, not a filet mignon), and it came out rare. Yuck. The fries were tasty (loved the rosemary and slivered garlic) but alas, shredded so small they were difficult to eat. Deviled eggs...nice but not worth a one-hour wait for a table. I would say this place was average; not spectacular.
