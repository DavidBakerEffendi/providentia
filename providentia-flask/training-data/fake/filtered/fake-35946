The only reason why I'm even giving this place two stars is because the pizza is tasty. That is about all that's worth your dollar here. Otherwise it's just an overpriced, pretentious hole in the wall. I went there for brunch this morning and was greeted by the same emaciated, unfriendly host as my previous dinner visit.     She sat us promptly and I ordered the soft scramble with toast, price: $12. THIRTY minutes later I got the equivalent of two eggs scrambled with maybe half a mushroom and an over buttered slice of toast no bigger than a poptart. (which might have been better...) after downing my two bites of food I left my 16 DOLLARS after tax and tip and went down the street to tinas where I got three times the amount of food for a third of the price. Long story short, don't come here for brunch or if you're in a hurry or looking for friendly service. You'll be terribly disappointed.
