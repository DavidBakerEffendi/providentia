Pat's steaks are good only when there is a long line waiting to be served. Provided there was a long line then the food remains good even after you take it home so you can sit down to your favorite show on tv. If you go during a time when there is a very short line (about 5 people in line) the cheese steak is kind of dry and not very good. Go to Geno's for better cheese fries. Their steaks are better than Pat's when the press is watching (they have some sort of promotion going on like raising money for our troops or something like that) but the rest of the time Pat's takes the cake.
