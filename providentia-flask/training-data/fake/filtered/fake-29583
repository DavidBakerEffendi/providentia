No no no!!! Â Lunch was horrific ... Not worth traveling for... Cheese grits was good, but thick as hell... Biscuit was hard, butter taste like equal and mayonnaise, Sangria tasted like it had Seltzer in it, tea, wasn't sweet enough to be a soul food restaurant, lemonade was bitter, Arnold Palmer was nasty.....*Two thumbs down*
