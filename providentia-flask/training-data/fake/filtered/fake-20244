I have been there several times on Friday for Karaoke.  I love the atmosphere.  It's like sitting in your own living room.  The staff and the customers are friendly and mingle with one another.  The food is excellent.  The crabcakes are to die for.  I found myself going back for a takeout order on Saturdays.  The fried fish sandwiches are great.  The asian wings are finger licking good.  The turkey sliders are fresh not frozen and juicy.
