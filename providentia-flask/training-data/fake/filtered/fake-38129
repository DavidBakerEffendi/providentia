My favorite restaurant in the city with out a doubt. Kip is an exceptional bartender, and Sherry is a master in the kitchen. it is priced appropriate with the local meats and vegetables, an amazing rye Manhattan, and great clientele. The service is impeccable, whether you are at a table or at the beautiful bar. They have an amazing staff from the back of the house to the front. I highly recommend this place for a relaxing night, or a perfect location for a date. If you want to impress a date, take them here, whether it is in the begging of your relationship, or you have been together for ever. If you have yet to go there you are missing out on the best restaurant in the city in my opinion.
