This was our second visit and we brought family with us. Good considering the portion sizes. food was good, chicken Marsala, baked ziti, and sausage and meatballs. Although the sausage Â was a bit sweet for my taste, being from Chicago. One suggestion is that they need non skid strips on the stair down to the restrooms. I slid off the top stair and slid to the landing. Very dangerous.
