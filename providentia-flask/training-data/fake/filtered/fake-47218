The restaurant's claim to be open until 11:00 is misleading at best, a blatant falsehood at worst. I went last night (a Wednesday) and was told by the waitress that they had stopped serving "a little while ago." It was not even 9:30. I had double checked the hours of operation on their website before going out of my way to have dinner there. Very unprofessional, and I won't be giving them a second chance.
