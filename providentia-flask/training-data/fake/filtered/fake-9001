I cannot even begin to put into words about how much I adore this place. The staff is beyond great, always very friendly, quick, and attentive. The bartenders are all so sweet and are great to watch when they're making your drinks. Employees Only attracts a varied fun-loving crowd. I have never seen this bar empty, which probably demonstrates the loyalty a lot of regulars have towards this place. Make sure to order the Amelia and the West Sider...both are very memorable.
