If you like Mac And Cheese... YOU WILL LOVE it at Box 63!  No joke, close your eyes good!  The whole menu is a comfort food journey around America, not just New Haven. The atmosphere is ole school Yale/ New Haven style.  Beautiful distressed wood, comfy booths, no crap on the walls!  Great open space and large bar/ banquet area up stairs... couldn't help but think "this would be a great space for a rehearsal dinner..."  a good place to chill before a big day, or a great place to relax with a beer at the end of a good day.
