Try the Braised Rib Tamales. A little different in presentation than the tamale you're used to but boy, the flavor is outstanding. Margaritas are served how you like them - not made from a mix so they can tweak them for you. Fabulous service, the price reflects the overall quality. I've got to say I think this is my favorite place.
