My best friend brought me here the other day and I fell in love with the store! The store's atmosphere is the best~ It's incredibly small so there's only bar seating but I think that adds to the atmosphere! Their coffee filters are super retro and the decor behind the bar is really cool! The store has coat hangers behind the seats which is a huge plus for me since my coats are extremely heavy and inconvenient (especially in the winter)! I've only tried the Omurice but I'll definitely be back to try everything else on their menu!
