We arrived ten minutes earlier for our reservation. The hostess politely told us that our private tatami room would be ready shortly because the previous party was just over. It is a very clean and pretty room. Whenever there is a party of ten people, I always reserve the tatami room which can keep our children safe and our privacy. Since we don't eat shell fish, they always do something special for us. We really appreciate their consideration to make our rolls without shrimp or crab even though sometimes we forget to mention it to the waitress. The owner knows our names and she welcomes every customer with a smile. Super boat for 3 is a good portion for us. You can pick your own five special rolls. It is a piece of art and so yummy too. Love this place and we feel lucky that Nori is so close to us!
