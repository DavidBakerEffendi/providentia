I went on a Sunday with my family; we waited an hour to be seated. Â The waiter took our order and we order have entrees and he said he could not take any orders to go. We stated we wanted the food to eat there and what we didn't finish we would take home. He said ok and the rude manager named Courtney returned extremely uncaring and uncouth person said she could not serve us more than three entrees due to it only being three people. It will cost her, her job and it isn't worth it. I was so embarrassed I had to call back today and speak to the general manger Maria who states they do not serve any type of food knowing you will take your food home and the owner knows he is losing customers over this and there is nothing she can do. So since the owner would rather lose customers then serve them properly. I WILL NEVER RETURN TO THIS PLACE. I WILL NEVER RECCOMMEND this spot to a friend or an enemy.
