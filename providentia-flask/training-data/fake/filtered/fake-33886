Good was good- but a rip- off: the scallop app was $12, for 2 scallops. medium sized. my steak was a special, it was 12oz, so it was smaller than the reg menu steak that was 14-16oz, but it cost more, which i didnt realize until after when i received the bill. prior to the meal, i gave them a $25 restaurant.com card. when we received the bill, the waitress had forgotten to take it off the bill. so she takes the check back, then she comes back and says their policy is to add 20% gratuity to the bill prior to the discount, then apply the $25 discount. i get it, you want people tipping on the full amount not the discounted amount, but 20%? since when is that standard tip for 2 people? coupled with the fact that we had a waitress that we didn't see again after she pulled our "appetizer" plates, and then came to drop the check.
