CUBAN FOOD DOESNT GET ANY BETTER THAN AT CUBAN PETES' Dominick the owner is awesome! Their steamed Pollo with garlic is TO DIE For! Too bad is BYOB so you know your Sangria is watered down- bring your own bottle of wine and they will be more than happy to stir that into your Sangria. Great place for Bdays:-) they do this loco spanish bday song complete with drums and tamborines!!! Oh man, if it is not your bday, fake it! You will be entertained:-) Flan is great here, and they have probably one of the best outdoor seating in town! Cuban Pete's is a must, will recommend this place to everyoneeeeeeeeeeeeee!
