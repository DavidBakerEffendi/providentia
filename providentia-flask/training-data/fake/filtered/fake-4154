Fantastic addition to the neighborhood--everything I personally need, from good bread to good coffee to creative and satisfying but healthy food. And a uniquely good space and vibe--pretty and elegant without being uptight. I don't think I've had anything bad here: the butternut squash and pumpkin seed salad has a great balance of sweet flavor and savory tang, the warm chicken breast with pesto on fresh, crusty ciabatta was satisfying, the curried parsnip was just luscious, and the quinoa-date-spinach salad made an amazing lunch. The place feels welcoming, in a low-key way, so you can either interact or do your own thing. And if you look closely you can see that the tables are made of old bowling-alley flooring, sanded down to be smooth and unobtrusive. Kind of like the place as a whole--a lot of creativity, but not acting like it's trying too hard. That makes it special.
