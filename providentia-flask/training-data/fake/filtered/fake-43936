I don't understand how this place is still in business, everytime I walk pass this place it's always empty. As for my review when I went here with my GF I was here for Sunday brunch. The scrabbled eggs and tacos were very good, the toast was buttered and warm and gooey. The tuna melt was a bit pricy but passable. The lamb soup was a little stringy but hot and spicy. Overall I enjoyed by experience and it was definately worth it. With that being said it's beyond me why this place gets no business gets no business. Maybe it is the location, it sits right in the middle of a low density street and surrounded by housing projects where this type of food would be beyond most people's price range. If this spot had been on Canal or Soho it would be selling out.
