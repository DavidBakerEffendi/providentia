Overall summary:  Prices have jumped significantly, rude take out service, small portions, and average quality. I ordered take out from Topaz thai, an average Thai place, compared to the one in Montclair, simply because I live nearby. The woman on the phone was in a hurry to take my order, and hung up without giving me a total.  Upon reaching the counter, she notified me that the bill was $6 higher than I anticipated, because "coconut milk has quadrupled in price" - yet the seafood dish was higher as well, due to what?  Moreover, the amount of food that I got was simply not worth the amount that I paid - $12 for a chicken curry dish, and $18 for the seafood...I felt ripped off based on price/performance ratio.  Additionally, the girl behind the counter was commenting to another waitress in her native Thai language, in a hushed tone that I felt was condescending and directed towards me.  I will never go there again.
