I've been to Acacia a couple times for dinner and have also attended an anniversary party with 50 guests there.  The food was great and the service was even better!  Whether it was a dinner for 2 or a party of 50 people, Acacia was able to make my dining experience a pleasurable one.  I've also dined out on their patio which is beautiful during the spring/summer/fall months.  The atmosphere, both inside and outside, is perfect.  Great service, great food, great atmosphere!!!
