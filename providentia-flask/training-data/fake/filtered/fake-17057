I have been here two times now for. The bartenders were not attentive & very trashy. The time I actually did have a sit down dinner was most enjoyable. The entrees offered large portions, and the food was pretty good. The plantains with avocado were not as fresh as I would have liked. It is nice inside, but a lot smaller than I expected.
