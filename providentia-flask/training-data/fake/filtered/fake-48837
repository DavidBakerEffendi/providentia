I lived down the street from here for years but never went in even though hearing how wonderful it was. Well I finally went and I have to say it was amazing. A friend and I shared the large jerk chicken dish and split some mac & cheese. It filled us up and it only cost us $19 combined. It's easy to say and I will be frequenting this spot again.
