Overpriced, spent around $80.00 tip included and delivery fee from GrubHub for 2 entrees a few appetizers (no pun intended) they weren't! and 2 cans of soda, what was supposed to be a nice end the weekend with a nice dinner turned out pretty badly. Calamari was almost burnt, very dark brown, tasteless and soggy, turns out they put it in the box with shredded lettuce to make sure it got soggy. Shrimp and eggplant was pretty tasteless and way overcooked. Another eggplant dish with garlic was chosen to be steamed but they served me just the steamed eggplant with no sauce. I did get some sauce in a container but was unsure if it was supposed to go to the apps or the steamed eggplant because it tasted nothing like the sauce in my shrimp/eggplant dish. Plus it was very weird tasting on the NOT good side of things. Had some meat wontons that were pretty nasty tasting. Scallions pancakes were soaked in oil and over fried and then sliced into little wedges. All in all, do I have to say anything else? The delivery guy was very nice and smiling! Probably cause no one else is dumb enough to order that much food from them! Oh, so I only wish good things to all of you who write phony reviews for whatever reason compels you to do so. Thanks!
