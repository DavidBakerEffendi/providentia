I am a big sushi fan, and there are tons of sushi spots all over the city. I really dig Momo's sushi. There lunch special rocks, and the service is spot on. There entrees could use a lil work. The tempora dishes taste too much like frying oil. The deserts are awesome! Gotta try any of the Mochi!!!! SUSHI AND DESSERT YES!!!
