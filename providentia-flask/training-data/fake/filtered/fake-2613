Luv, luv, luv this wine bar. The service is uber-accommodating, especially if you have a large group. Â Excellent Italian wines and wonderful cheese. Normally, I won't cross 14th Street, but it is worth it for pretty good Italian fare, a very romantic environment, and being treated like the Princessa I am.
