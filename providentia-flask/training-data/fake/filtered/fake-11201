Completely, 110% overrated. two stars is generous. My boyfriend was so hyped for this place, as we live right down the street and he's a complete foodie. I am less of a foodie, still a food lover and was wholly unimpressed. We went on opening day and have gone back several times, to try again. But, I'm done trying. The place is a zoo, the food is utterly pedestrian, completely overpriced and remarkably unremarkable. My butternut squash lasagna cost 16 dollars, the portion was better suited to my cat, and we required a second dinner an hour later.  It was cold, overcooked and bland. Their gelato was disgusting, and they had literally 2 flavors left. My dessert (tiramisu) was quite good, but again, tiny and overpriced. I give them 2 stars because I like their grapefruit salad with the mint on top.  Take a stroll down Arthur Avenue and enjoy real italian.
