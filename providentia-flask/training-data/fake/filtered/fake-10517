Stopped in for lunch during the middle of the week and the restaurant fairly empty. The service was attentive but their was a co worker at that bar as well and that took up most of my servers attention. The Revolution margarita was great! Tortilla chips were great! Caso Funidito, however was awful. The beef tacos were good and flavorful, however the rice had clearly been sitting under a heat lamp for quiet some time as it was not only dry but crunchy throughout. I had to add sour cream to the rice to eat it. The flan was good but the portion size was tiny. I would return but that is mostly due to the limited options of hispanic food. As someone that grew up on hispanic and Mediterranean food Revolution Cantina was "ok".
