I've ordered from Tuk Tuk over the past two years and the food is very tasty. However, after my experience with them last night, I will never eat there again. I called in an order that THEY got wrong. When I went back to the restaurant to exchange the food for what I did order, I was met with hostility from the manager. She claimed it was MY mistake, because she didn't understand what I was saying on the phone. Excuse me, but we speak ENGLISH in this country, and if you can't speak the language of your clientele, then maybe you shouldn't be answering the phone and taking orders. They refunded my money, and refused to give me what I ordered. So goodbye, Tuk Tuk...you Suk Suk. From now on I'll take my business to Spice, that just opened up one block away.
