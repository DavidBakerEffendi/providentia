my daughter and me had our birthday dinner here our server was the best chef came out and said hello our appetizers were delish the grit cake was awsome i have never tasted anything so good but the ribs and mac and cheese were the worst ever mac and cheese was dry and tasted like box but not as good the collards greens are terrible..... but the drinks were great music was so loud we couldn't talk but once the band ended WE  enjoyed ourSELVES ... i will go back  especially for drinks and grits and shrimp had a nice time overall
