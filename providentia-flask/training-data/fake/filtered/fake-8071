Wife and I have been customers for almost four years beginning with a graduation party for a son. The food back them was very good, now it is excellent. We eat here at least twice each month, often more frequently and have NEVER gotten a bad dish. I was telling a friend in the food industry about it and how we always have enough to eat; I get full but never bloated. He said it was due to the food being fresh and cooked correctly. Not being a 'drinker' per se, we will order a small pitcher of sangria at a decent price and never have to raise the pitcher to refill our glasses, the wait-staff is always so attentive that it is taken care of for us. They do not wear name tags because ...they don't need them, they are that personable. Nothing is forced on the customer..if you don't want it- you don't get it! DIshes are modified to your liking if needed. I couldn't decide on anything and so they accomodated me with something I made up and was surpised at how well it was done. This past July I had a party for my wife with 40 guests attending in the lower dinning room. Afterward EVERYONE raved about the food and service. The atmosphere is what we like, calm, music playing low in the background (usuall Italiam Cosmopolitan tunes or light opera), dimmed lights, and best of all a GOOD price for a GREAT dinner. Yes, it has a TV at either end of the bar but the sound is always off! Does NOT bother us in the least. We're not talking a sports bar here...we're dining at a classy restaurant. For out of towners it is easy to get to from Exit 15W on the Turnpike or Rt. 280. Both exits empty on to Harrison Avenue where the restuarant is located about half of the length of the roadway. My guess is that you'll like it.
