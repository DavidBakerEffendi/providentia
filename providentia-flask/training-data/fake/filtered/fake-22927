I was very excited to try this place but sadly the food was pretty mediocre and non impressive. I ordered out so I can't comment on the atmosphere of the place but instead the take out service. First they said the order would be ready in 20 minutes so I figured I'd give them 10 extra minutes so I wouldn't have to wait around for it to be done. I get there and the order still isn't ready so I ended up waiting an extra 15 minutes for the order. Once I received the order they forgot to give me part of the order, which I didn't realize until I got home. I called them to let them know and they were very apologetic/nice about it. Once I finally got back home to eat (I'd placed an order for 4 people) all of the dishes were just ok and the salmon was over salted. It was very disappointing. I'll try it again some other time and just chalk this one time up as part of the growing pains of being a new restaurant.
