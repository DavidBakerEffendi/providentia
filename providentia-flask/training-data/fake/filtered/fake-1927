Place has not changed in the 15 years I've been going.  Hamburgers are great and  both the Calamari and the sauce are exceptional.  The Service was always shotty  and the place is GROSS DIRTY (I am getting old never bothered me in past) Here is why I am done with the place.  The music was so loud at lunch I couldn't think Straight. I mean BLARING. I ask for them to lower it 3 times and think maybe they did a little once. I mean I get it if its a GO GO Bar Or a night club. But, I need to have my ear drums blasted inside out while eating a hamburger for lunch? Wow I really am getting old.  It did not seem to bother anyone else however 90% of them looked like fall down drunks.
