We'll be back! The food was excellent and the portions are large and priced resonably. Â Yes, the food takes some time to come out, but everything and I mean everything was freshly made, including the guacamole and chips. My burrito was huge, so I took home the leftovers and I think it might have been even better for lunch the next day. The wait staff was very friendly and anticipated our needs. We had refills of our sodas, before the first one was empty and he stopped by often to check on us. As I said, we will be back. We had 2 dinners and appetizer and beverages for less than $30 for 2 which I feel is more than reasonable, as you can tell everything is so fresh. I hope they stick around for a long time. Hopefully, they will as a specials board.
