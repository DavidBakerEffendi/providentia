Not as good as its sister restaurant Feng in Canton, but still very yummy! I was a little disappointed when we realized they didn't have Hibashi tables, which was probably mentionned somewhere...Went for my in-laws anniversary and they knew that so as a surprise they served them a fried ice cream dessert! I didn't even ask for it, just mentionned the occasion. The waiter was excellent! Very attentive to everything we asked for. We'll go again soon.
