I am so glad I found this place.  Passed it a few times and didn't realize what it was until I saw a line of people waiting to get in on the weekend. So I went straight to the bar and watched some Aussie rules rugby with a "schooner" of Coopers Pale Ale. The vibe is relaxed. Great music and crowd. The lamb lollies and pumpkin are as delicious as so many here have said. I really liked the fried calamari app too, really light and crispy and tender too. The kick is that it's gluten free!  who knew?  Definitely recommend and I will be back with friends next time.
