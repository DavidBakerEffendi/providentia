I often eat here for lunch and the food and service are always great. The prices are comparable to other restaurants in the area. Definitely not too expensive for what you get. Â I love their pizza, salads and pasta dishes. I have eaten here for dinner twice and it was a good experience both times. It is nice that you can BYOB and the atmosphere is typical of an Italian restaurant - nice music, clean and inviting. The owners and wait staff are always friendly and welcoming too!
