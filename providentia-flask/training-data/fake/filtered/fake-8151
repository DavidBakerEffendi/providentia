One of my favorite go to places in NYC if your looking for casual and fun atmosphere.  I have been here numerous times over the years.  Always great food and good Mojitos!  Anyone who comes to visit me in NYC always takes the trip down to the LES to experience this place.  Tuesday night - half price apps till 8pm - can't beat this deal!
