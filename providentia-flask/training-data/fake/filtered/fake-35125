Great place! We saw a comedy show last weekend for a girls' night out and had a great time. We purchased the Groupon, which was 3 admissions for $5, so practically free admission. Drinks were reasonably priced (I think only $6 each--2 drink min.) so it only ended up costing about $15 each for the night out. You can't beat this, especially in NYC. When you walk into the bar the staff is super friendly. The comedians were hilarious and the show was almost 2 hours. A lot of the comedians got the audience involved, which makes the show even more fun. I'd definitely recommend Dark Horse for a girl's night out or a date night.
