As a Middletown, CT, resident, I have the opportunity to enjoy two great Thai restaurants in my home town.  And being fairly well travelled, I've also had broader exposure. A few weeks ago, I had lunch at The Blue Elephant Trail.   Subsequently, this past weekend, I went back with my wife for dinner.  The ingredients were fresh and the food superbly prepared. This place is now my #1 choice for Thai.  The wait staff were attentive, but the key differentiator was the warm greeting and sincere interest the owner, Soho, expressed toward assuring our satisfaction as customers.  It was as though we'd been friends for some time.
