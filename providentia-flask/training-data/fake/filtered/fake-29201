Worst Pizza ever, The grinders suck as well. They advertise " Tom and Pat's Subs are filled with what you order not filled with lettuce and tomato's etc as a filler like other places! We won't say who. Tom and Pat's is where the beef is." Totally false claim!!! Tom and Pat's use as little meat and cheese as possible, no idea who they compaired their grinders to! I got a grinder there, the server's seem stuck up, hardly any meat and cheese, loaded with brown, wilted lettuce and thinly sliced moldy, rotten tomato's, not fit for human consumption! Stay away!!! Want a really great sub or sandwhich? Try Food Fair right next door, their subs are LOADED with meats etc, they are now serving hot foods as well!!! I would give them no stars!
