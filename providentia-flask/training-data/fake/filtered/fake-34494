My friend and I decided to find a pizza place to frequent in the New Jersey area as we were traveling back home to North Carolina. After researching reviews on yelp, my friend found this establishment.   We walked into Star Tavern not to be greeted or acknowledged by any of the staff.  We took a seat at one of the booths where we continued to be ignored.  After a few moments, and after witnessing a couple enter the "restaurant" and be seated by one of the waiters, my friend got up to get a menu.  That is when we were eventually noticed by the waiter who sat the people behind us.  We ordered our food from what seemed to be a decent selection.  The diet soda I ordered was low grade Diet Rite and they charged for refills.  This would be perfectly understandable if: A) They noted that on the menu. B) The soda didn't come from a fountain where it probably cost them 0.00004 cents to fill. The mozzarella bread was fine. My friends pizza came out and it looked like a totino's pizza. It was incredibly oily/greasy and it looked burnt.  My friend was halfway through his pizza when, after waiting 15 mins more, I asked the waiter if he forgot my pizza.  He said he didn't and that it would be out in a moment.  Note: I ordered a whole wheat crust and while it takes longer to bake I was not told about that, nor was it possible for it take that much longer.  I informed the waiter that my friend was halfway done with his pizza and that i didn't want it anymore.  He apathetically smiled and said "okay". I was abhorred by the extremely poor service and overall low quality of this "restaurant". I could not recommend this place to anyone. It was a complete waste of time and I am completely baffled as to why it has such high ratings with such cheap, oily pizza and sub-human service.
