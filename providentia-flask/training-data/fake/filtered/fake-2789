I'd been a couple times before and always enjoyed my food well enough, but after my last visit, I will definitely not be going back.   First of all, the place is VERY cramped and super loud - it's just not a comfortable environment on a Saturday night. The major issue: The customer service is extremely poor.  I was told the wait would be one hour.  So, after waiting for over an hour, I checked on the status of our table and was told it would be at least another hour.  Had we known it was actually a 2+ hour wait, we'd certainly have gone elsewhere.  What I still can't get over is how extremely rude the manager was to us!  He was insulting and unprofessional.  After this second bad experience with their service, we won't be returning.
