The best chicken i've ever had period. I walked in and was greeted by a very friendly staff that helped me make the best selection that fit my tastes. I had a half chicken, the macaroni/cheese and spinach. The chicken was so juicy and tender I could not believe it. I really never liked macaroni/cheese till now, you can actually taste the quality in the pasta and cheeses they use. The spinach was extremely light and full of flavor. In terms of the pricing, being a Brooklynite all my life and knowing good food when I eat it, quality doesn't come cheap. As for that, the pricing in my opinion is on the money for the quality of food . Best of luck to this establishment, and for sure, I will be back!!
