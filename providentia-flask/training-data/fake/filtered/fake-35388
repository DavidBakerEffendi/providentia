The service was good.  Our waiter was very attentive.  The food however was edible but sup par.  They show really nice photos here as if they really care about presentation but our food was a little sloppily served.  That would have been ok if the food tasted good.  Well it was OK, but I wouldn't go again unless I was invited by a friend.
