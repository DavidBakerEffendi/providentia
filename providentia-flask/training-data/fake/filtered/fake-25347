I signed up for Yelp because I felt so strongly about how bad the service was here that I had to post. When I walked in at 11:55, the place was virtually empty. As I was meeting someone at noon, I asked if I could sit at a table to wait. The waitress said she wouldn't seat me and that I had to wait at the bar - and not nicely. If the place was packed, that makes sense, but it was empty. There was one table with customers. Five minutes later, as we're being seated at a table with one chair and one bench along the wall, I set my bags (I had an iPad, a camera bag and a bag from shopping at B&H) next to me, and they tell me I can't do that either. The place is still virtually empty. They point to a chair next to where they pour all of the drinks to store my items. No thanks - I tell them I'll move my items as soon as they need the space. I didn't want to place my items on the floor because the floor was FILTHY. After about a half hour or so, it turns out they do need the space, so I moved my items to the chair they pointed out earlier. My items proceeded to get wet as the waitresses carelessly filled pitchers of water above them. Then ten minutes later they tell me they need that chair too - are you kidding me? They were really rude about it too. I squeezed the items on the bench next to my friend and stashed my bag behind me back. Which is what I wanted to do in the first place but that they didn't want to seem to let me. I'll never be back here after service this rude. They never bothered with drink refills or checking on how we were doing either. The food was mediocre. The grilled corn was not bad, but the chicken quesadillas were flavorless and filled with tough meat and not enough sauce or cheese. If you want Cuban food, try Havana Central.
