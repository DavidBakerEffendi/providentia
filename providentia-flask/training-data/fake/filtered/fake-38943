For 10 Years, it's been 2-3 stars. Food is Good. However, recent brunch experience @Tartine,,,3 Adults and a 21/2 yr old toddler immediately became full 4 people-must-order-status and charged $60 and Tax + Automatic Gratuity for over 4 people adding additional $15. We ask for the breakdown but both employees were rude and one guy was busy talking to girls. Service was bad but demanding 20% Tips no matter what??? NOT Recommend. OH...Cash Only. Â IRS
