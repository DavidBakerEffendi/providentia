The owner of Buttermilk channel has brought a great restaurant and experience to this neighborhood. He is really kind and great with guests.  For the most part the staff have been really great except for tonight. Our server (one of the more 'mature' women servers) was particularly rude and over-the-top attentive to my husband - to the point where she filled his water glass and not mine, despite the fact that I was extremely thirsty from my salty scallop dish. After an entire evening of being overly gracious to my husband, I asked for the check (women do pay the bills as well) and her eye balls popped out of her head.  She handed the bill back to my husband and not me. Very rude and lacking class. I wish the food could have made up for the lack of service. Not sure I will go back unless I am hung over and in desperate need of brunch.
