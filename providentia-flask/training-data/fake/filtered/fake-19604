We've ordered from here a number of times.  We're big fans of their brunch menu.  Though the brunch menu is short, their food is amazing.  We've also been here for sit down meals and their wait staff are all so very friendly.  The french toast is delicious as well as the eggs benedict.  They also have candied ham which is a must try.   I gave it 4 out of 5 stars because I wasn't crazy about the few times we've had dinner here.  The food was ok and I didn't think it was as great as their brunch.  I had the salmon and it was a little on the bland side. Also, I've walked by on weekend afternoons and found a jazz band playing inside which is pretty cool.   Despite my mediocre dinner experience, I will still come back and try other things on their menu.
