We entered with a party of 8, only to be told "no", and that we would not be allowed to dine. After the waitress informed us that 4 was the maximum party size, we volunteered to enter in two groups of 4, only to be denied service again. Four of us then volunteered to eat at another restaurant, so that only four people would remain. However, the waitress denied us service yet again, thus contradicting herself. Customer service is terrible, unreasonable, and unfriendly. We will never go here to dine again, and I suggest anyone reading this to not dine at Ajihei.
