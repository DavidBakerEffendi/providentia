Went there with some friend on a Sunday. 1. Calamari was old, rubbery and fried to death 2. Tuna club $9 turned out to be three slices of brown bread with tuna salad (from a can) 3. Omelettes were tasteless $63 bucks for lunch, food awful. Â Don't bother, Smith street has much better to offer than this place. $9 bucks for three slices of brown bread with canned tuna salad - disgusting
