I've been here twice now, having had such a good experience I came back a second time with a friend. Both times I walked in, I was greeted with a warm welcome from the hostess at the front, and we were seated promptly and the service was quick. The food is delicious. It's a little pricey but the portions are nice (seriously, one risotto and I was stuffed!), and the staff is very attentive -- my water glass was always promptly refilled and they're always ready to help you out from the table whenever you're ready. Cannot recommend this place highly enough.
