Oh Richard A.! i had the same exact experience with the rude owner/manager/needs a reality check asked me to get ride off my water bottle. Come on lady, it was the hottest day of the summer and I was saving my water bottle after the meal when I will be back walking in the dry heat on the street...., I haven't been back since because of your rudeness. No thanks.
