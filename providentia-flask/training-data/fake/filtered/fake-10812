First of all, I love fast casual joints. And I love burgers. This place is about as good as it gets. The burgers are a little pricey, around $7.50 for most of them. you can also get the burger salad, which is literally any burger form the menu, minus the bun, plopped on a bowl of fresh greens (real greens, not iceburg lettuce). However, the burgers are delicious and creative, and the onion rings are out of this world. We had a Bobby Blue Burger salad and a Dallas burger. Both were delicious, solid choices. We also had the vanilla bourbon milkshake and an order of onion rings. Both of those were also delicious. Total for two people? Just $30. and that's including an alcoholic milkshake (that we split). Atmosphere was nice, the great service really stood out as well. Everyone was friendly and our food was ready in less than ten minutes.
