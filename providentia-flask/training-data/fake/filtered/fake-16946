I've been reading review about this place and majority of them seem very right to me - wonderful food, very euro style, not expensive, but do not take credit cards.... BUT the lines there are incredible - i don't know when you have to come there to get in... Last few month i tried to have food there and the wait was over an hour each time ( brunch, weekday lunch, late night dinner ).... So in theory it's great , in practice - impossible to get in....
