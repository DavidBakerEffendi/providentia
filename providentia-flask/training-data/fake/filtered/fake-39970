I'm a huge fan of Mexican food, and this may be my favorite Mexican restaurant in NJ. Â (it's pretty close with El Meson in Freehold) It is what it is, which is definitely not perfect. The place is in a so-so neighborhood and the decor is pretty much non-existent, but there's a certain charm to that. They don't take credit cards, and the place is usually pretty chaotic on weekends, when the service can become excruciatingly slow. But all of that aside, the main reason to come here is THE FOOD. The quality of menu items is generally excellent, but a bit inconsistent, so you have to know what to get. They have their own take on many of the dishes, which may not be considerd "authentic" to some, but that's one of the things I love about Tortuga's. The chile relleno is fantastic, as are the guacamole nachos and enchiladas. Anything with guacamole is a safe bet, as their guacamole is extremely fresh and probably homemade. Their salsa is unconventional, but good. It's very watery with bits of tomato and onion, which sounds a lot worse than it is. There are a lot of excellent restaurants in Princeton, but in my book, Tortuga's is one of the top three. My advice would be to go on a week day or just after opening (4pm) when they are less crowded.
