Wanted to really like this place. Went on New Yrs Eve and had to wait an hour and a half after our reservation. Because of the pre-fixe menu they wouldn't let us order drinks- we had to have their punch (it was ok, but what a really bizzare way to do business). The food was uninspired, and some of the courses were frankly inedible. These folks really need to get their act together. Charging $95 for a sub-par meal was not the best way to start the new year.
