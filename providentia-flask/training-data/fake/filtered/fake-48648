Empanada Mama frustrates me.  The food is excellent.  I've tried about a dozen different empanadas and all of them have been outstanding.  The sangria is great as is are the desserts.  The problem is the service.  It's very hit or miss.  Sometimes it's great.  Other times, it can be awful especially when the restaurant gets busy.  Delivery is very sketchy too.  I've had instances where I've seen the delivery person simply pull up to my building just to turn around and leave without so much as a phone call or buzz to let me know he has arrived.  The inside part of the restaurant is small too which can make for a somewhat clastrophobic dining experience. All in all, not a bad place.  My advice is not to order delivery but to dine in and hope you get good service.
