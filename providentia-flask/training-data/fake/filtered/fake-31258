The large square pizza is an amazing deal. The crust is crispy to the touch and taste, and the cheese and sauce are a delightful combination. There was also a mozzarella salad and arugula salad. Both salads were delicious. Â me enjoy the food more, but It was DELICIOUS!!! The food has always been delicious, but in our experience, service had been spotty and rude. But the last three times we have been in services has been fabulous - friendly, warm.
