my wife and I celebrated our 50th anniversary here.  It was great from start to finish.  You can't beat the quality and quantity.  The chef owner Joe was very accommodating with our special rquests and dietary restrictions.  The steak was fork tender, you don't even need a knife.  I recommend the calamari and pear salad, and of course the steak.  We have ourselves a winner!
