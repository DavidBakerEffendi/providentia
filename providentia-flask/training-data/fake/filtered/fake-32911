Intimate space with a sleek modern decor. Perhaps a bit too dark. I'm a big fan of Jean Georges other restaurants and finally decided to give Perry St. a try. Went with the crab salad and the snapper. Both were fresh, simple and delicious. The desserts were mediocre, but all in all an excellent experience.
