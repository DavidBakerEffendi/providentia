Sunday jazz brunch Jazz good but too loud, bad acoustics Service pretty good Food terrible, do not order chicken paillard more bread than chicken or the French toast too doughy and how about more fresh berries on the plate? Coffee good... Bad form- NY Times gave an excellent review to this place? Me smells a rat!...a PR rat! Also notice the pattern of positive and negative yelp reviews, I think there is a little B. S. with those positive reviews, stop pumping those reviews up roia! Fix the food !!! and your price point is too high...
