The food quality here is superb. I had the classic burger, which was juicy and perfectly cooked, and the brussel sprouts, which were probably the greatest I have ever tasted. I didn't try the cocktails but they looked like they tasted great. Food is a decent deal, but the alcohol prices are a little too steep for someone of my booze tolerance level. Will definitely return!
