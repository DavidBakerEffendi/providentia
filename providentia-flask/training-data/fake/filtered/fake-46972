I had dinner Friday night at Maialino for the first time. I loved the look of the restaurant. It reminded me of an upscale country kitchen. I liked the openness of the restaurant including the bread station and the salumeria station. My companion and I were greeted by the host from the moment we walked through the doors till we left. Service was very attentive, and our water glasses were always full. We started with the chef's selection of salumeria. The prosciutto was delicious. The soppresata was good, but we both preferred Espositio's from Court Street in Brooklyn. The tonnarelli pasta made with pecorino and black pepper was creamy with a bite from the pepper,albeit a little heavy on the salt. Delicious. We had the   roast suckling pig. I've read some of the other reviews, and I have to say the pig was devine. The skin was very crisp as it should be, and the meat was succulent and juicy. It is definitely for 3 people, so if you are a duo, you will have leftovers. The dining room was a bit noisy. but  I would go back.
