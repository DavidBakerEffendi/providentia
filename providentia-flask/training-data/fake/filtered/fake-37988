The 'snacks' and small plates are enough to make a meal if you're intimidated by the price of the entrees. The servers are always attentive and polite. The dining room clean and uncrowded (actual space between tables!) Â We have children 10 & 12 and they love the food, admittedly they are adventurous eaters. Highly recommend for dinner and brunch on weekends.
