Ordered a simple Sausage and Cheese pizza and it was a big hot mess.  The cheese looked curdled, the pizza was barely cut into pieces and you certainly couldn't pick it up and eat it.  I asked the waitress to check and make sure it was cooked and/or in general that I felt it was uneatable. She brought it back to the cooks who said a new pizza would take them over 30 minutes to cook (even though the first came out in half the time) but there was nothing they could do. There was no offer of discounts or something else to eat.  I would never order a full sized pizza from there again. I will say some of the individual slices i saw people eating didn't look that bad...
