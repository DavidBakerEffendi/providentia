Costanera is excellent Peruvian cuisine in the heart of Montclair. I was impressed by every dish I ate from the potato chips with homemade sauces to my chicken dish for lunch. The ceviche was nothing less than amazing, not too spicy but balanced out by the sweet potato. The lucuma ice cream is a must-have especially with these hot summer days. You are making a mistake if you don't dine at Costanera.
