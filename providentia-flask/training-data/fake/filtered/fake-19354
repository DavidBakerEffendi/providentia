My entree was an underwelming experience. I ordered the sweet potato enchilada and I expected something baked in flavorful sauce, covered in cheese, beans and sasla. I received three dry tortillas layered on top of each other. Between the first layer was an unflavored sweet potato mush and some baby spinach greens. The next layer was goat cheese. On top of the third tortilla was a spoonfull of black beens. On the side was a cold red salsa and warm green salsa. Just looking at it, the dish was poorly conceived and physically uncohesive. Eating it - the dish was bland and dry. Not very enchilada-like at all, and it came to $17.00! I've never actually complained about the food in a restaurant, but I approached the front-end guy and asked if I could give some feedback. He acted pretty shocked, and said this was one of the owner's classics. He offered us free dessert and 10% off our next visit. Can't say I will ever go back. That was a huge price tag for something I could have been dissappointed by at home - probably for under $2.00.
