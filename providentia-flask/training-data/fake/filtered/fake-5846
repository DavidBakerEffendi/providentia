have eaten in restaurant and in the bar. great effort in design and ambiance. the food is very tasty and really brings the "local" ingredient concept to life. waitstaff very patient and knowledgeable about the food they serve. however, this place is expensive and, like so many Princeton locales, feels very mature...perhaps a broader price range would attract a broader range of Princetonians.
