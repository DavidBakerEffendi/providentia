This is my favorite spot to get lunch in Downtown Trenton. Easy walking distance for all the State workers in the area. My co-workers and I usually order for pick-up, however, there is seating available. The tables usually fill up during the lunch hour. My co-workers and I really enjoy this place because the food is very fresh with just the right Â healthy proportions. They offer soups, sandwiches, wraps, paninis, quesadillas, and breakfast items. Their soups are made from scratch. My personal favorite is the spicy lasagna soup. They also offer delicious coffee and smoothies. The service at East Front Cafe is very friendly and they really go above and beyond. Check them out!
