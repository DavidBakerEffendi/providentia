Our first trip to Philly, and it was recommended we try one of Marc Vetri's restaurants.  We liked Amis, but I would say only some courses were stellar.  We loved the oxtail ragu and the roasted kale. Great pasta.  The polenta had more of a grits consistency.  We also really liked the Belgian waffle dessert.  Overall, we liked, not loved, it.
