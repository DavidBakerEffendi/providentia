Great little spot with natural, organic food (they said its all organic and it really tastes like it is), from the local farms, fresh and delicious. One of the cooks/counter people, Kay Kay made my steak avocado sandwich so tasty I felt like eating the wrapping paper it was wrapped in ;) Give this place a try. Other food that was served on the day I was there included a variety of Southern Style cuisine. The other guys had it and they were really enjoying every bite. Great to have a place like this in town!
