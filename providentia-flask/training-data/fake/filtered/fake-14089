Grand Apizza has my favorite pizza in New Haven, hands down. I work right down the street from them and frequently order take out. I have sang their praises for their pizza, but now it is time to do so for their service and their generosity. I manage the library branch that is near their location and I asked if they could make a donation for a end of the summer party we were having for local kids who participated in our summer reading program. George, the owner was so nice and donated 5 pizzas for our program. The pizzas were delicious (of course), ready on time, and they even helped me to my car! I highly recommend Grand Apizza for fantastic pizza and wonderful, kind service.
