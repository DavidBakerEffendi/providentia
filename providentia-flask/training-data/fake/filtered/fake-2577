I came Monday night and usually most of the restaurant or wine bars do not have the right vibe. This did not happened to me at Uva! Wonderful place, very nice decor and authentic "finally" italian food and wines!! I was welcomed by i believe the hostess and i believe her name was Patrizia. She treated my friends and i Â like kings. Perfect music. It is the perfect pick for dates and big party. I will go back very soon when back from the Bay area. Good job Uva
