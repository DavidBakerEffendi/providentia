We just stopped at the Milford, CT rest stop thinking that subway was the only option for something "healthy". We were pleasantly surprised to find this little gem of a restaurant that offers organic, healthy meal options of veggies, uncured meats, feta-goat and other cheese options as well as gluten free choices including delicious wraps, rolls and hot dog buns!  The gentleman behind the counter was hand selected for this job as he knew what I was looking for and offered great options.  We loved our sandwiches and will tell many friends to stop there if hungry!  Way to go Mr. McDonnell. You've got the right idea and I hope to see you in airports too!
