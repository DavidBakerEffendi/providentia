Best pizza in New York.  Great ambiance and super friendly staff.  Paulie likes to walk around and see how everyone is doing, which is great. [EDIT] OK, been back here like 5 times since my last review and all I can say is that this place continues to rock.  If I lived next to there I'd probably hit it every day.  But now that winter is company I'm probably not getting on the G Train as much so my beautiful Paulie Gee's will have to wait until Spring.
