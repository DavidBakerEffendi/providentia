First time to Philly, was looking for a good place to experience an authentic cheese steak. Was extremely satisfied with our decision. Food was fantastic, staff were down to earth and fun. Made us feel really welcome to their establishment and the city in general. Nice outside seating in a good area. Would def go back!
