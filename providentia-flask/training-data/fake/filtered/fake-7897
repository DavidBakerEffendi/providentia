CUSTOMER SERVICE IS SO DISAPPOINTING! Let me begin by saying I work around the corner from Govindas and have been coming for years. I always call ahead (although, my order is never ready when I arrive..) and order the chimichanga with the salsa on the side. Ordering the salsa on the side has never been a problem and my order is usually correct. After waiting in a busy line for about 10 minutes I told the cashier (the owner, I believe) what my order was. I paid and then he handed me the sandwich while mentioning that he didn't see the salsa on the side. I politely said that I did not want that particular sandwich with salsa as it was not what I ordered. The man who took my phone order then jumped in and said he didn't write down that I said salsa on the side. The cashier then proceeded to reprimand the man who took my order for not taking an accurate order. Frustrated, he looked at me and said "well, I just decided that there is a new rule and you can no longer get salsa on the side, it comes with salsa, so you need to get salsa." All would be well and good (I guess?? I mean, you can even go to McDonald's and ask for something in the side!) except that I had already ORDERED and PAID! A little late for a new rule. Anyway, I probably would have waited around for a new wrap, but I received no apology or offer to make me a new sandwich. I explained how disappointed I was that I did not receive so much as a "sorry we made a mistake" and that he would rather lose a loyal customer than fix THEIR mistake. I would think the owner of the business would demonstrate better customer service. Needless to say, I will not be back.
