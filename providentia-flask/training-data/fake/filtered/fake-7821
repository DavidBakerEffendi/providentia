Two words.... Asian Noodles! Great take out place for food for the entire family. Super fresh, homemade and healthy. Â While running kds around to sports and events after school, it's the perfect place to stop and grab food to feed everyone for dinner. They will not be disappointed. The owner is very knowledgable and super nice too, which never hurts. Great environment... Great food.... Signed, A Return Customer!
