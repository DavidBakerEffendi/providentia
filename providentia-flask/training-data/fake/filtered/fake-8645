Dino's TREATS MINORITIES VERY DISTRESPECTFULLY.  Food is not that great and come on guy.  Its 2009.  Were all equal.   It's such a nice area why do people go to bigot to get a bland pizza.  He spoke negatively about a customer to other customers and then told him, he can do whatever he wants because  "this is my house."  Well I'm boycotting and I hope he closes down and then he might find out that this is our town and we don't want his horrendous food and service in our town.
