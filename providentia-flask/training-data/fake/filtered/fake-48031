Visited the Three monkeys. Straight away a warm welcome by an Irish bar tender. Being new to city he recommended places to see and things to do. I ordered the chicken wings which were a decent portions and pleasantly tasty. there was a fantastic menu of beers on draught and bottled. Sports on the TVs and young trendy couples at the bar. All n all a well rounded bar. I would totally recommend a visit.
