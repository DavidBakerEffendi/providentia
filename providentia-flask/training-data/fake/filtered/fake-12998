I have been TWICE to this restaurant. Food is very good but service is terrible, and I mean terrible!!!  I am not a fancy guy loaded with $, but a grad student looking for a decent meal. First time I was there they refused to charge my cellphone, not even behind the bar area --  all in a very arrogant tome. Just yesterday same thing happened. Lady at the entrance was awful, who turned out to be the owner. I tried to ask her about the gluten free menu and she immediately called the waiter and almost yelled at him: "didn't you tell them about the menu?" (in a very demeaning way). I felt bad for the waiter who was quite a nice guy. She apparently cares only about turnover and $$ - guest satisfaction is very low on her priority.
