I've eaten there twice, both times with groups of 4 or more people. Everybody said that they had great food. The staff was really nice and we had no complaints. Â Nice, romantic atmosphere and the location is only a minute off of the West Shore Expressway. Prices were average for a nice restaurant on Staten Island. I would recommend getting a reservation for a Saturday night, because they were really busy both times we went.
