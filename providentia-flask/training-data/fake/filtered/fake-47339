I dont even want to give this place 1 star but i guess i will for the drinks i had here that encouraged me to pierce my nose, right after, after 8 yrs of wanting it. The place has no Light, u feel ur walking into a no tresspass zone. They always say ( heard from others as well) the waitress isnt here yet and then the bartender serves u with an attitude. The food was GROSS.. the rice hard. lettuce socked, cheese was american, the taco shells HARD not authentic and broke apart sogged becuz of the oils in the meat. The enchiladas missing flavor and filling. I think we jus enjoyed the chips and salsa if that.. Not worth a penny, unless ur drunk then everything tastes good, we left our full plates of food and went to get pierced.. So disappointed.****You want real authentic mexican drive to new haven Chapel st --Guadalupe's thats authentic MEXICAN Food, same every time....even El amigo felix is tasty on whalley ave...
