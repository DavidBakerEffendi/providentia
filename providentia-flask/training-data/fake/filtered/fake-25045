In theory, this place should be amazing. I want to like it SO much but it's just impossible. I've been a handful of times (maybe 5 or 6) and I'm glad that the lines have finalyl gone down. Waiting 30 minutes for mediocre stirfry is not fun. Here are my opinions about this place. 1) It's inconsistent. Sometimes there is a lot of sauce with the stir-fry, sometimes theres not enough at all. Sometimes the sauce is thick, sometimes its watery. Sometimes it's spciy other times it's not. It's never what I actually want or expect. 2) I like to make my own stir fry.. It's $8 to start and you get a sauce, a starch and 3 veggies then they add on from there. But seriously, $8 for bbq sauce rice and 3 veggies?! For $8 I could make this for a family of 8! 3) Stop pushing the smoothies on me. Dear lord, if I want one I'll order one. Put more effort into the stirfry and less with the smoothies, please. Maybe fire some smoothie people and lower the cost of a veggie only stir fry, how about that? 4) The salads are ridiculously expensive. I could never justify spending more than $7 on a salad from a 'fast food' place nevermind $11. That lettuce better have healing powers if I'm going pay that much to eat it..
