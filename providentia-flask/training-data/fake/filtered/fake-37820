Just returned from another great dinner at Roberto Cafe. We have been to this cozy byo over a dozen times and it never disappoints. Whenever we want real Italian food, we know brothers Roberto and Fernando serve the best. Food is always fresh and the service attentive and friendly. I've had their branzino many times and it is still by far the best of any byo in town. The smoked mozzarella is sublime! I've taken many friends from out of town there and they are always taken by the authenticity of the place and the excellent food. The amatriciana is one of my favorites pastas but the lobster ravioli in the pink sauce is always a hit. And that stuffed pepper appetizer with risotto is out of this world. Can't go wrong here with any of the veal or seafood dishes. My friend had the salmon tonight and suffice it to say she refused to share. Roberto is by far the best Italian byo in town! Keep it up guys!
