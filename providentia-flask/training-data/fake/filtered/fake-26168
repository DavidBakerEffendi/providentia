The owner gave me a pizza about 30 minutes after I ordered, which is normal. But, when I opened the box and looked inside, the pizza had NO crust on 3/4 of the pizza, the cheese was falling off the sides and the chicken was cold. I went to the owner and told him about it and he said that I must have tipped it over myself hence the cheese falling off. I was astonished that an OWNER would treat their customers so poorly If I wanted pizza, Three Brothers is where I would go. BUT, now since i was accused, I would not recommend this place. Good luck boys!
