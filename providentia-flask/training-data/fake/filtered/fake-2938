Upon walking into Cuban Pete's, one can easily take note of the lively, upbeat ambience of the restaurant.  From the loud music being played by their very own band, to the attire of the waiters, Cuban Pete's creates an environment that cannot be duplicated.  One cannot wait to be seated and partake in the festivities. Sadly, the food did not live up to my first impressions of the place.  I ordered the flounder with garlic sauce.  It comes with rice and beans and plantains.  The rice tasted good.  The beans that accompany the rice are served community-style in their own separate bowl.  The plantains and the fish were bland.  The garlic sauce helped to offset this though.  The portions were very generous.  If you are not starving when you arrive, you will most definitely be upon leaving. In closing, I am a very picky eater with strict taste standards.  I have no doubt that most people would have enjoyed the very exact meal that I had (evidenced by sharing a portion with my mother).  Furthermore, Cuban Pete's delivers a vibrant dining experience.  I would not recommend this place for myself but I know many people who would love it.
