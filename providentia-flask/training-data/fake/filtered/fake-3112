Love this place. Food is great. The vibe reminds me a little of Miami. My second home. You must try the suckling pig - it melts in your mouth. Bring your own for margarits or beers cause it's BYOB which is amazing in terms of savings. I would go there before the summer is over. Outside seating and cuban food - so cool!
