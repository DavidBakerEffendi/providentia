oh my. the vibe of this place is beyond obnoxious- it's like a symbol for everything that's wrong with this neighborhood. i figured this would be the most effective way to communicate this to these hipster-dweebs from minnesota. GTFO. and take the line of pukes practically waiting around the block for your faggy brunch with you.
