Ive been to taqueria diana 3 times. The first two times, I waited 15 minutes for a quesadilla even though I was the only customer. The third time I ordered the al pastor burrito *with* sour cream and cheese. Unfortunately I ordered to go, and only later found out that I had gotten the worst tasting pork burrito *without* sour cream or cheese. The food is ok, but the service is poop. I'm never going back.
