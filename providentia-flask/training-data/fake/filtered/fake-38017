I love to nibble at Jacob's Pickle. Finally, some southern style (as far as I can tell) brunch in Manhattan. The biscuits are crisp and crumbly and yet they are chewy as well, the grits are great (though I'd never had grits before) and their fried chicken was just right: neither soggy nor dry, but rather crisp and flavorful and lastly the gravy was creamy and savory.
