This place is GREAT!!!! I was on a trip with my children's social group and we needed a place to eat. We were about 25 people and must I add starving after a fun filled day in the city. This place catered to us, like I've never seen. The staff was very helpful and helped the children build their salads and falafel sandwiches in a timely manner. They even came around and asked if the kids wanted more fries. The food is insanely delish!!!! I had a salad bowl with falafel and my husband had a gyro. The food is so fresh and so tasty I actually was sad when it was all gone. One of the moms even took a sandwich to go ..she wanted her husband to taste it! And most importantly the place is spotless! Not to mention the decor is very inviting. I am going back next week for sure and bringing my family with me. If you are ever in the city or live there, you must try this place you will be HOOKED! I am!
