We love going  to Reading Terminal every time we visit Philly. My boys have their friend,  Mr. Watson at De Village Store. We start by tasting some delicious crepes, followed by a couple of gyrros,  some sausages and cheese for home, and we always stop by  Mr. Watson. My boys love his  hand made hats and bracelets, the tiny little giraffe statues and all the Jamaica  and Trinidad and Tobago souvenirs. Awesome place !!!!
