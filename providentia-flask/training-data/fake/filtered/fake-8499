After we moved here from California, this place saved my life. Get the goat tacos, only available on the weekend. Also, if you've never had a torta, get one al pastor (marinated pork) -- cheese, avocado, jalapenos and mayo on a kaiser role -- an amazing tasted sensation. And they deliver -- they're patient with your lack of spanish, so you be patient while they find the guy who can take your order, OK?
