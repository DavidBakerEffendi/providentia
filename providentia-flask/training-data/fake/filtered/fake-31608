Happy-Hour with an old friend and a perfect Restaurant. It all began with our lovely waitress Genesis who made us feel right at home.  Her recommendations for appetizers were amazing! Always came around to make sure we were good. Loved her! To top things off the manager Lance was a gentleman and very professional. He recommended a delicious Margarita and treated us to these Arepitas with Braised Short Rib that I'm still dreaming about. The music and the decor is elegant and modern. The views are beautiful and peaceful and the music was fantastic.  The one and only thing I would change is the music that got a bit loud towards the evening. Other than that, I can't wait to go back.
