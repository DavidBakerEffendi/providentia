Where can a girl go for a glass of wine, an awesome mexican dinner and sit at the bar and read and be not bothered?  Jose Pistola's!  Never is there a time I have been unhappy on my many, many visits here.  I can always sing along to the great music (last time Sublime's Scarlet Begonias played and I wanted to just die).  The food is always really great (and you can pick up some guac to go with your dinner on the way home for cheapies). I expecially recommend the veggie quesadilla, but only if you're down for some spiciness.  The beer selection is what they are most proud of, and rightly so.  While the bartenders are varying levels of friendly, the owner is absolutely awesome and the crowd is clearly a heap of regulars who all know the staff and each other, but not in a snooty way.  Decor is dark, dark, dark and somehow sporty without seeming to be so.  You can watch the game, but the whole damn place isn't hollering like they're at a pep rally.  This is my eat-alone place.  Sometimes I want to share it with friends but mostly... I like to keep it all to myself.
