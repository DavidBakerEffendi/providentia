I have been here twice.  Both times were extremely memorable.  My brother and I would def recommend the tasting menu.  We choose the tasting menu that was seven courses if I believe correctly.  There is also a five course tasting menu too.  I always enjoy tasting a bunch of different items from the menu.   The first time I went to Fond, I ordered a delicious piece of pork belly and my wife ordered the skate wing.  Unfortunately, I think both menus are no longer on the menu, because we were not able to order them the second time we went.  The escargot and the sweetbread apps were very good.  Love the escargot!
