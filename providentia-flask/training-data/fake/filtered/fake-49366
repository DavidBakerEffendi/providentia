These guys are the big bluffers I have ever seen in the market. I have been served by two people at King of Prussia, PA location. The guys names are Aaron Teter and Chris Wasson. I have got my iPhone 4S screen replaced by these people in the month of july 2014 and gave a 90 days warranty on the new screen, Today 09/14/2014 my iPhone screen is not working and took the same to the shop to get it fixed. I had been kept on waiting for 2.5 hrs and at last gave a lame excuse that they can't fix it and as there is no warranty given. After lot of arguments, I asked why did you give a warranty of 90 days then?? the f***king guys were not even paying attention to me at all and were attending other customers. These guys are real bluffers and rediculous. Be aware of these people and save your money.
