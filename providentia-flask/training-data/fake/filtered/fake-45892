Nice date atmosphere. Not the cheapest place in town, but I feel it was a good deal given the quality of service and food. The meal was insane-good. I usually don't get excited about food, good or bad, and I've never written a review for any restaurant, but the meal I had last night was out of this world. Chef Wil made what has to be the perfect lasagna - at least that I've ever had. I'm sure I don't have the same taste as everyone out there, but for me, the whole thing was a home run.
