Ignore the few negative reviews here which seem to focus on Standard Tap as a bar. They all seem to be written by dudes who didn't get laid at the bar and are venting their loserdom here, and have no clue as to what Standard Tap is all about. Which is simply: one of the best, and possibly the most underrated, restaurants in Philly, hands down. I've eaten here several times since it opened with friends who are used to very fine dining in NYC, LA, Europe and CC Philly, and we've never had a less than wonderful meal at Standard Tap. There's a serious chef at work in the kitchen, whipping up imaginative food with exotic seasonal ingredients. Â The portions are huge, but it's really about the quality, which always surprises new visitors, who are expecting tap room food. The menu is one of the most varied you'll find anywhere, with something for everyone in your party. I've had seafood, pulled pork, venison, boar, burgers--all of it superb--but my favorite is the tuna tartare, incredibly delicious and big enough to share. The atmosphere is lively and casual and slightly boho. It reminded me of Van Gogh's Ear in Venice, CA, but with higher class food, and slightly less funky. The happy murmuring of the crowd echoes off heavy dark wood panelling. I'm not sure how old the place is, but it has a 19th Century feel. The beer menu is large. If you're a beer lover you're sure to find something to tickle your fancy. Otherwise, ask your waiter. They all seem very knowledgable and are always helpful in describing the types of beers and what might go good with your dish. There is also wine or cocktails. Best of all is the price. Considering the quality and quantity of the food, it's a bargain. A better dining experience than many places charging much more.
