Yes, parking stinks. Yes, it's a dive neighborhood bar (my favorite type.) Yes, the hand carved right in front of you roast beef rocks, especially wet. But the gravy fries with roast beef bits are a ridiculous flavor bomb. They are Stupid good and yes, you better get all way to the bottom if you really want to see what I'm talking about. My mouth is watering now just thinking about them and I rarely, EVER lust after fries. The cool gray haired bartender was awesome service wise. Silly side note: while everything is paper plate style, they do NOT skimp on the plastic cutlery. It is stout, thick and unbendable for digging in without getting messy. Not the cheap flimsy stuff 99% of the other places use. Oh yeah, John's (on Snyder Ave.) newly added roast beef doesn't hold a candle to Nick's Old Original. John's tastes like boiled, deli meat. Ok but not enough to crave like Nick's
