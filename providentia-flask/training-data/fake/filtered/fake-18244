Food was good ,delicious and excellently prepared, however my husband found his dish lacking in quantity and was still hungry after an appetizer and his entr√©e. He ordered a special and it was more the size of an appetizer portion. Even I was a little shocked when they put it in front of him. He ate another basket of bread afterwards.
