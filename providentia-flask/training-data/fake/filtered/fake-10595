We looked at the yelp reviews and decided to try this place out. Great decision! We ordered the 2 entrees that come with 4 sides. For the entree we had fried chicken and ribs and sides of mac and cheese , potato salad, fried okra and beans. Delicious. We finished with pudding cake dessert which was absolutely must try. Service was courteous and the cook came out to talk to us. We were surprised that there were so many empty tables as for this kind of food and price they really should get a lot more customers. Try this place if you pass by. We plan to be back for sure.
