My boyfriend is a chef and an aspiring restaurant entrepreneur. It was his birthday and I really wanted to impress him. I did a lot of searching and when I came across this place, I knew it was the one! We have gone back sooo many times after for several other occasions and even just for brunch on the weekends. Outdoor seating is very cute during the warm weather. We are so happy to have found this place and it is one of our favorites in the city!! (Oh, and service is excellent!)
