Don't bother. This dingy place happened to be convenient for a quick sandwich lunch. We ordered a chicken cutlet with mozz and roasted peppers. No big deal, right? Well, it took two people to figure out what to charge us like it was the first time they ever rang up an order. $9.95...WHAT??? Turns out the mediocre result wasn't worth half of that. Just saying, this is NJ. You can find a good Italian sandwich on every corner except this one.
