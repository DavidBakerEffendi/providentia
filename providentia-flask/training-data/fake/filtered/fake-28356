EXCELLENT FOOD!!!!!!Just moved to neighborhood and came across this taverna and what a line to get into the place.The food was awesome.My wife had grilled calamari with beets and I had chicken kabab with lemon potatoes WOW it was delicious and we got our food very fast .The place is so cozy .Cant wait to go back again.Keep up the good work!!!Everybody talks about this place in Astoria but they are right.It was worth the wait
