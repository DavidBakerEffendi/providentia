I ordered take out and hands-down it was THE BEST sushi I've had...ever. The fish is fresh and melts in your mouth and the flavor lingers. The pieces are generous without using too much rice. Very satisfying meal. My husband even enjoyed it and he's not crazy about maki rolls.I ordered the spicy tuna crunch roll, dragonfly roll (replaced the eel on top with fresh salmon for only $1 extra) and the kai roll. They were all so very delicious. My faves though were dragonfly and tuna crunch. Also, the hostess (I don't recall her name anymore as I went there 2 weeks ago) was kind and helpful in answering my questions and accommodating my requests. Am looking forward to actually dining there, enjoyed the nice relaxing atmosphere as I waited on my rolls which were being crafted fresh to order and in a very timely manner.
