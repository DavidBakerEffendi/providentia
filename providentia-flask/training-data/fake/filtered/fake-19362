Very professional, from the owner/hostess to the wait staff to the food.  Soothing brick interior,  nice lighting.  The food, omg, is stellar.  Greek goddess salad is one of the beat salads i have ever eaten...great dressing and the toasted pumpkin seeds...my face almost fell off.   I had the brothy rice noodle dish w/ veggies and mushrooms.  Finely crafted.  wife had the ravioli of the day.  Roasted garlic, artichokes, mushrooms, walnuts.  Very flavorful...well thought out. Dessert: banana cream pie with a SERIOUSLY chocolaty graham cracker crust.  To die for...better than  any I have had.  And nor too sweet or rich.  Matter of fact, the entire meal was not over kill in richness. Kudos to  an exceptional restaurant. PS, noting Jonathan L's comment about skimpy portions, we could not finish either of our entrees and the soup and salad were also generously portioned.
