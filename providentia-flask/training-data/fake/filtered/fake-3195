It is a very good place to come with family to shop for BBQ dinner. Fresh fish all the time, they even wash and clean it for some tips. If you go there pretty often, you may make some connections so you know what's coming next days. My favorite blue tail comes on Thursdays mostly, I am very glad we can enjoy this place.
