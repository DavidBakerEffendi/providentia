My friend and I took our daughters , we were not sure about the place . I am glad we went. food was delicious , very large portions . My daughter ordered spaghetti with meat balls ( 3 meatballs were huge , she could not finish it - she said they were good) I ordered mix sea food with black pasta , I loved the pasta) It was bit loud but very nice atmosfera. I will come back with my family ..
