We had heard nice things about this restaurant from neighborhood friends. Unfortunately, the food and service were extremely disappointing. I went with my husband and mom, who is visiting from out of town. The service was completely uneven--our waiter took our orders quickly, but then it took ten minutes for my husband's beer to arrive. My mom ordered the pork chop and it arrived rare, and my husband's steak was cold. We then had to wait for their entrees to be recooked, while I ate my entree alone. The entire wait staff appeared harried the whole time we were there. In order to make up for the snafus, they offered us free dessert, but we chose to leave and go to pinkberry on seventh avenue...it was the highlight of the night! I would not recommend this restaurant, especially because there are so many great spots in Park Slope.
