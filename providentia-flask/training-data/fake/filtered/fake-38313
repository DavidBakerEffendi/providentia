The staff couldn't have been nicer. From the minute we walked in the service was outstanding. The food was a slice of "Cajun Heaven". Everything from the bisque to the salad and the entree. The desert on the other hand should be considered it's own food group!! I/ We totally and completely HIGHLY RECOMMEND this place. Also the bartender Scott is a very creative cat. Bloody Mary's are incredible!! Joy's smile and positive personality brighten our dining experience. We Will definitely be returning SOON!!!!! Chalie & Monica Hatboro PA
