We have been to Rosa Blanca 4-5 times because, as Latinos, we wanted to truly give this restaurant a chance. Although the appetizers are good (Yuca frita--very good!), each visit became increasing disappointing regarding the meals. The piccadillo was not well seasoned, the pork chunks were largely fatty pieces, portions are small and very overpriced. We had a coconut flan which tasted like plain yogurt. Overall, the food is bland and not authentic. I am Puerto Rican and my husband is Cuban so we know what authentic Latino food should taste like. This is not it! We will not be trying Rosa Blanca again.
