I hate to be harsh, but 1) this place wasn't really necessary... there are plenty of places to get the SAME German and Czech beers.  If they wanted to be a beer destination, they could get a bit more creative.  2) the staff (some to be fair) were absolutely clueless and there was no plan at all to manage the table service.  3) the woman that helped me at the bar was terribly grumpy and never received training on how to pour a draught beer correctly.   BUT, the food was pretty good.. Hope it turns around.  They just need some management.
