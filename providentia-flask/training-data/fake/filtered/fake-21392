Was really psyched when I found out the guys from Bar Etats Unis were back in action at Heidi's House.  Even better, they have some of the staples like the crab dip and the guacamole.  They have an excellent beer menu and it's wine list is also pretty good. Has a great vibe you don't normally get on the UES (worth coming from Brooklyn for).
