I finally got to hear what the hype was all about on my first trip to Philly last week.  I've had cheese steaks before, but not Philly-style! This place is authentic!  It was sooo good! Service is fast, but that means you better know what you want to order too.  Parking is a bit on the crazy side since the place is so popular.
