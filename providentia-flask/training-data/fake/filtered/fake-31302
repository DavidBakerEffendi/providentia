This place disgusted me. I went to have dinner with my family and while we were eating, one of the woman employee was cleaning the carpet and the floor with a spoon from the kitchen that customers use. She had one of the jars that they use to serve drinking water and a spoon, then she was spot cleaning and scrubbing the dry food on the carpet with the spoon and water, then she brought the spoon back to the kitchen. I called her over to my table and told her that was disgusting and she told me Â the other woman does the same thing with the spoon and water, the other answer that she gave me that her manager saw her and said it was okay. On the way out we spoke to the manager and he didn't even apologize........ I felt like throwing up after seeing this.
