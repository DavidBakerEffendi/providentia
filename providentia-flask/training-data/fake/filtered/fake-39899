I love crepes and the menu here looks fantastic, but the experience was absolutely abysmal.  My wife and I were vacationing in Burlington and spotted the Skinny Pancake on a Saturday night, making a note to have breakfast there the next morning. On Sunday, we arrived and found a line out the door, which is not surprising for a crepe place on a Sunday morning.  We weren't in a hurry, so we decided to wait.  Poor choice.  30 minutes later, we had only reached the outer door.  Another 20 until we were at the counter.  This is purely because of highly inefficient waitstaff.  The woman taking orders, also took the time to get all the drinks, meaning it took several minutes for each order to complete.  Meanwhile, two servers sat next to the service window, waiting for orders to come out.  Also, you had to self serve your own coffee, which is fine, but you went to the right side of the line to get coffee, and then had to walk across the restaurant, back through the line, for cream and sugar. People who were waiting in line had friends save tables, leaving no available tables for people who had ordered and were waiting for food.  One of the customers brought this up to one of the servers and she just shrugged and said, "Sorry." After ordering, it took another 25 minutes to receive our food.  The food was good, but not great and my crepe was cold.  It certainly wasn't worth and hour and a half of standing in line & waiting for service.
