They changed the menu , which was terrible , the fish was rancid /rotten I couldn't even finish my meal and then they had the nerve to charge 5.00 for the salad that came with the meal which I couldn't even finish. The sodas were flat,every flavor. Besides that there now charging 18.00 for chicken parmigiana , which there gravy taste worst then canned store bought , were do they think they are New York , sorry your on 1&9 in Avenel. Do your self a favor just keep driving. Nothing on the menu from entres is less then 18.00. Gordon Ramsey needs to pay them a visit , they same fresh fish, YEAH RIGHT
