Had an excellent night out with my family! The place is stunning, the staff was friendly and most importantly... THE FOOD! Is amazing. Drinks were flowing and unique. Coming from a middle eastern background I am very picky when it comes to middle eastern cuisine. I felt as if I was eating a home cooked meal only with a better presentation of course. Thank you Labebe Â for the excellent experience! I will certainly be back and recommending this restaurant.
