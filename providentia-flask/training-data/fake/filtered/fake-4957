Don't order the filet mignon.    It tasted old (maybe defrosted) and beyond it's expiration date.    Two bites was all I could manage.   The baked potato tasted like it was a reheated leftover from the prior day.    None of the wait staff asked about the food or why I was sending back my plate uneaten.   Then with a smile they gave me the check.   I've been to Brazil and dozens of churrascaria's.    How can they claim to be a purveyor of Brazilian food with this very low quality of materials and service?   Nunca outré vez.....
