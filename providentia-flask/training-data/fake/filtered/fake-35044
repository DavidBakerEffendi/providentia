Came with some friends for dinner one night, it was packed to the brim and we couldn't come inside but they insisted we would have a table in 2 minutes. 10 minutes later we still werent seated. i't s obvious that most people come here for the bahn mi however we ordered some pho, duck and several appetisers. Shrimp summer rolls tasted like vinegar and although they had shrimp in them you really couldn't taste it Vietnamese spring rolls were nice enough. they were perfectly crispy on the outside and fine on the inside the pork dumplings were good and very tasty the duck was delicious, crispy on the outside and tender on the inside the pho was not bad a bit overrated but very filling. I would probably come here at lunch and try their bahn mi instead but otherwise the meal was good
