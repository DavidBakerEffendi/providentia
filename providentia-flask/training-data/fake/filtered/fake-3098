I will give this place 5 stars bc I think overall its an awesome place. I will start with telling you that its always packed with a nice older crowd. BYOB!!! have been there several times and have always enjoyed myself. The food I give a 4 out of 5 stars. They have some great appitizers and its not too pricey. Nice atomosphere. I have always gone for dinner so has always been really busy about 30-45 min wait. They dont make reservations. Nice place to take your friends and family or your date. Not very kid friendly.
