We went for our office holiday lunch, sight unseen. The ambience was quite comfortable but elegant. Our waiter was generally quite competent and polite, but we had one minor slipup. It was loud and he heard 'medium well' instead of 'rare' or else slipped when entering it. Either way, I didn't need to make a fuss or even find out what happened, I just mentioned it and he whisked it away, brought me a fresh plate in a matter of moments with a perfectly done rare steak in time for me to finish with everyone else, and it was all completely fabulous. That grace and quick action would have warranted 5 stars in itself. If I could give 6 stars I would, because in keeping with the best of the most expensive restaurants I've been to, the manager came the moment he saw I didn't have a plate in front of me, apologized profusely and quite sincerely to my ear, gave us a sizeable cut from our bill, and everyone involved was as polite as could be. And I assure you this was far from expensive in comparison to the service I received. I have absolutely no complaints, a minor and very reasonable hiccup showed us just how amazing this place's service really is.
