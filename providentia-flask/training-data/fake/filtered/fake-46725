We didn't have a great experience at all.  Food was too greasy,  the Chicharon Bulaklak, lumpia and Bangus were all drenching in oil that seemed to have been used a million times.  The Pinakbet, Bicol Express and Bone Marrow were just OK.  We were quite excited to pick the place up among the other restaurants to have lunch on our rare occasion to get together, it was quite a trip too (we were in Roosevelt Island), should have gone to Woodside instead. Coupled with the hefty price, it was a disappointment. The only redeeming factor is the niceness of "Dave" our Server. We had to wait tho, even if there weren't a lot of people but we were really very patient and probably were just excited to eat. Will not recommend and there will be no second time.
