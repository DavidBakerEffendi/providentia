I tried this restaurant out around 7pm one evening after reading favorable reviews here on Yelp.  The restaurant is pretty small, and from the outside it's pretty easy to drive right by without noticing it.  Inside, the food area is tiny, like the size of my foyer.  The grill was out of several of the meats I requested, perhaps due to it being 7pm.  Every single meat I tried was WAY too salty!  WAY SALTY.  I then noticed the person manning the grill kept putting sauce/seasoning on the meats on the grill.  In my opinion, I've had much better.  Though this is based on one single visit of mine, at 7pm in the evening.
