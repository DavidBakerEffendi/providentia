This Should Probably be the Only Review with Less than FIVE STARS... WHY YOU MAY ASK? While the Party Bomb is Awesome, their Sushi both Amazing AND Affordable, and they have 3 different levels of wasabi pain in their soy sauce... WHY CHARGE $2.00 FOR PICKUP MOMO? I came out in the freezing cold to get you...
