I was turned on to this place by a coworker and I've had two wraps there since. First one I had was chicken taco and the second Philly jalepino (my mouth is watering just thinking about them). At first glance it looks like a regular little bar but first bite into one of those wraps and I was sold! The prices aren't too bad considering one wrap is super filling. I haven't gotten the chance to try anything else there yet but I will definitely be going back.
