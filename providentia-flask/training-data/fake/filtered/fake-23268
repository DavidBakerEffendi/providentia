Not worth the wait.  Food was good, but nothing to write home about.  Hostess kept saying tables were about to leave, but that took 45 minutes.  Five minutes after I complained (and I was the third in our party to do so) we were finally seated.  Hostess didn't even know where we were in bar to seat us.  Manager never introduced herself, apologized, or even offered dessert.  She barely asked how the food was as she grabbed the check off the table.  Go elsewhere for a better dining experience.
