Look, the nachos with vegan pork are incredible. They're really, really good. If you come for just the nachos, you'll be fine. But when I ask for the remaining half of my sandwich and fries (big, friendly portions!) to go, I really, really, really don't want to open my box up at home to discover that you tossed out all my fries. That's my midnight snack you just screwed up. Thanks, Khyber. Jerks.
