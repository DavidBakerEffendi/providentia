The food is nothing special, horrible service, and weird atmosphere make Gusanoz's a sub par restaurant. I avoid the place at all costs. MY friends and I use to eat there regularly until i had some issues with the quality and service that I recieved. Avoid this place at all costs. Go to Margaritas!!
