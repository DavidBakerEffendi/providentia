Hands down, my favorite falafel place in New York.  Especially for the price!  $2.50 for a falafel and $3 for a falafel with hummus.  I was reminded of it again over the holidays after I paid (what I considered) an exorbitant $8 (!!!) for an (admittedly decent) falafel in Las Vegas.   I should qualify this statement to add that I really like Taim's too - the green falafel - in particular - which simply serves up a bigger and better falafel than Mamoun's.  The chickpea balls are tastier, and, I'd venture to say, healthier too.  But for someone who eats falafels on a fairly regular basis, the question comes down to a philosophical one at the end: Would you rather pay twice the price for a better falafel at Taim's or half the price for a really good falafel at Mamoun's?   In the end, it really comes down to what neighborhood I'm in, but  more often than not, I will go to Mamoun's over Taim's.  (Fyi, I do know that Mamoun's is perennially shut down by the Health Dept for health violations...and, as someone concerned about health, that certainly does give me pause...but hell, anyone who has also read Kitchen Confidential will shudder even when entering the doors of NY's finest 5-star restaurants.)  All in all, for $2.50 you certainly get your money's worth.
