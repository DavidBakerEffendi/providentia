Went in last night. I was surprised at how empty it was considering the fact that my friend who recommended Stella Rossa told me to make a reservation. We didn't make one and we were sat right away. In fact, the place was half empty. I hope they get more business because we loved everything. The waitress (Jackie) was friendly but she was a little quirky. And not as attentive as we had hoped. She gave us a 5 minute story about the menu that was a little awkward. She also was a little unprofessional when we asked for recommendations- her response was "I can tell you what other customers like, but we aren't allowed to eat here, so it's hard to give a solid recommendation". Other than that, we loved everything. The food was almost too good. Not a good place to go if you are on a diet!! We practically licked our plates. The desserts were very nicely presented but I don't know how anyone would have room for dessert after the pasta over-indulgence!! The prices are VERY reasonable for the city. We even had 2 managers stop by our table. Perhaps the one gentleman was the manager and the other the hostess. Nevertheless, it seemed like everyone really wanted to make sure we had a good experience. The music is all Sinatra which got a little annoying. And I will make a reservation next time because the manager told us any night there is a show at Walnut Street Theater, they are packed to the gills. I think we would prefer to have another server next time, but all things considered, we had a great experience and will definitely be back!!
