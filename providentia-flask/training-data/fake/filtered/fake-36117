I was appalled by this restaurant. The line was ridiculous. At a good place, Â this wouldn't even cross my mind; if it's worth it, I will wait. They do not know how to seat people, which again, I could potentially deal with. What I could not deal with was the service. I have never been treated so disrespectfully in my life. Bad doesn't begin to describe it. Piss poor is getting there. Don't be fooled. Go to Menu one block up on State St...or anywhere else but here.
