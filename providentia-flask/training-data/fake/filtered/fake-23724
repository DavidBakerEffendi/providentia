I work pretty close and always were told about this place. Since it was my 7th year anniversary and I had 30 min break for lunch, I decided to try. The vibe, deco, ambience are very nice. However, lunch menu does not offer a lot of options. It was pretty hard to choose my plate. Prices are a little high for a fast lunch as well. I ordered this ricotta pasta with pesto sauce and it was surprisingly super good. My husband ordered the burger and was very good as well. French fries are a must try, specially with the sliced garlic they add. I was in a little rush and check took a while to be dropped. Service is very fine. Definitely I'll try dinner and brunch!!!
