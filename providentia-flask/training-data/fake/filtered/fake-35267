I LOVE THIS PLACE!!! I have been coming to Gaia Italian Cafe since the first day it opened! I am the pickiest person when it comes to my coffee being done right, and let me tell you that they did it right! I was like WOW YOU DID IT RIGHT, AND SHE WAS LIKE OF COURSE I DID, THIS ISNT AMERICAN COFFEE!  I love the owner Gaia and Josh,they are so friendly and fun to talk to, Not only are they great people they have GREAT food here too, I love the Gnoochi, the risotto. They get all their cheeses and meats imported from Italy, every Thursday night they receive fresh Mozzarella and Ricotta di buffula  straight form Italy. She also makes all the pastries fresh everyday, and she even does specials of the days, each day is a different special! never the same. this is my my favorite place in New York to come! it is the bomb!
