Perfect for St. Marks and quick eats! Great sliders at great prices and even better beer selection on tap. Fries are seasoned great and the service is attentive. You can't beat the prices and speediness. If you are looking to get some good food, quickly, you can't beat this spot. Kinda small, but that adds to the feel of the place. Not flooded with tourists, yet...big plus.
