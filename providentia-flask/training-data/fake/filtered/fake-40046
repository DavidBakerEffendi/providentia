Ever hear of Di Fara's pizzeria in Midwood on Ave. J and E. 15 St?  It's been reviewed extensively by the N.Y. Times and written up both in print and online. People rave about Di Fara's and the joint definitely has a following. I've been meaning to go there for years and today was the day. The pizza is definitely hand made, with fresh chunky sauce, Polly-o mozz, lots of grated cheese, olive oil and fresh basil. But the pizza just didn't work for me.  The sum wasn't greater than its parts. The slices are smallish. The sauce and cheese slid right off onto the plate. And each slice cost $5.00!! ($30 per pie). This is the most expensive pizza that I've ever had. Not to mention, the place is a dirty dump. After Di Fara's I drove straight to L&B for a real slice (only $2.25) to chase down Di Fara's lest I return home to Long Island completely disappointed. Many may like Di Fara's. I just don't see it. Personally, I'd rather have pizza at Totonno's, Grimaldi's, Patsy's, Lombardi's or L&B Spumoni Gardens.
