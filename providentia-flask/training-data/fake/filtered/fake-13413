The menu was very interesting. Mussels and fries were fabulous. Hostess was welcoming. Emily did a terrific job of pacing our food delivery so everything was hot and delicious. Marko the Magician was there on Monday (5/12/14) and was extremely entertaining!! Location was easy to find. Will go back in a heartbeat! Jim - Cape Cod
