Very cool and unexpected place near the commercial Steinway Broadway area.  I like that they used what appears to be a lot of reclaimed wood in their construction and it is a rather unique looking place.     The Coffee is amazing as well as the Grilled Cheese  (but please offer lower carb whole wheat or spelt options!)  Mac and cheese is bar far the best in Astoria.  They also have Kombucha ale on tap which is incredible.
