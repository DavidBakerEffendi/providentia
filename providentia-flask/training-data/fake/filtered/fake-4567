amazing is all I can say. Had Breakfast with my Daughter and Son-in-law (both are chefs) my husband and 18 year old son. We all agreed this is the best breakfast we ever had!!! we had steak and eggs (steak cooked perfectly), chicken n waffles eggs benedict (my 18 year old told all his friends, they are going this week-end) grits wow, scrapple n eggs with those amazing potatoes and beef short rib eggs benedict. Outstanding - a must for anyone looking for a great breakfast.
