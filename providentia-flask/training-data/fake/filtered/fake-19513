Was in Philly for some culture decided to try the Standard tap . My son had told me they have different foods like antelope chops and good beer I was impressed with the unique building and the front door. walked in and took a seat in which i could see the kitchen and the bar. My server told me about the days specials. I ask for a menu my server told me they are on a chalk board my gal and I surveyed the menu as our drinks were being severed . I'm a meat and potatoes guy and just settled for some comfort food she ordered chicken croquettes and we ordered fish chowder . We split the large portion of chowder it was excellant have never tasted broth quit like that before. I was eating the generious seafood portions with a fork. I had noticed a few people going upstairs and wondered and ask whats up stairs my server told me another bar after dinner went up stairs grabbed a table and veiwed 2nd st from the windows Viewed the fire place and said to myself truly a unique experience. I would like to go back again and try another dish sometime
