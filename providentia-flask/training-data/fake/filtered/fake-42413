Oh wonderful fresh Mexican food in New York, how happy I am to have found you. My husband and I discovered this place over a year ago and it has become a regular favorite. Super affordable, great ingredients, kind and excellent service. Their enchiladas verdes are so good, and if you like Mexican breakfast, come here for their inexpensive huevos, spicy sauces and fresh squeezed juices. Yumm!
