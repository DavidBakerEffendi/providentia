Waited over 40 minutes for our table, which is normally fine as long as you have good food and service after the wait. Unfortunately, that was not the case.  Once we were seated, we waited 10 minutes for our service who literally rushed us through our drink and food orders. We waited another 10 minutes for our drinks and when we inquired with a different server, we were given a rude answer of "they'll be coming".  5 minutes later all but one of our drinks came. We patiently waited and then had to ask again to see where it was and were again given a rude response. In the meantime, we 1 of our 2 appetizers before the drinks  and when the calamari came, part of it was cold and it literally had no flavoring whatsoever. Fortunately, the side of chili sauce masked the incredibly bland appetizer.  Our main course was delivered at separate times as well, 10 minutes from the first entree to the last. 3 of my friends asked for sides of peanut sauce when they ordered their meals and had to ask twice after they received their food until they got it.  I ordered the spicy noodles and it was less spicy than their pad Thai which was extremely mild and  had no flavoring or spice whatsoever.  The only thing our server was quick at was dropping off our check (which unfortunately had a 20% gratuity already built in bc we had 5 people) and to take our money.   Also it is extremely loud and if you're a large table, you cannot hear each other speak. Truly disappointing meal.
