Cool spot for a quick bite to eat or with a large group of friends.. Â Decor was nice on the inside and in the warmer months there is seating in the back. As for the food. its more for those who like quantity over quality. Food was fresh But bland and tasteless. Definitely not over priced at all and very inexpensive.
