I could give you many, many anecdotes that would illuminate how bad this place is,but I'll just talk about the last time I was there. I walked in Saturday night and was told that I couldn't order because "our printer is down." When I asked if they'd ever heard of pencil and paper, the girl at the counter gave me a blank look. Food that varies from sublime to ridiculously bad. That's the only "positive" thing I have to say about this location. Service ranges from indifferent to bad to surly to monumentally incompetent. I really rooted for this place, but it's so horrible that I wish it would just go out of business and let an actual restaurant come in and take its place. My only regret is that I can't give this place zero stars.
