At best the food was ok. Service people were nice but untrained. I can't stand waiters asking who has the octopus and who has the salad? At those prices, they better know. This place is nowhere near what Passionne was when Chef Carrino had that place humming over on Walnut Street. Bigger isn't always better that's for sure.
