Authentic, spicy food. After a long Â got to eat real Indian Food. My kids enjoyed Chicken Tikka Masala. Me and my wife started off with Chicken seekh kabab. Very moist, well blended spices and decent portion. Also tried Lamb Boti. But it was OK. My friend tried the grilled fish Tandoori Pompfret (or something) he just loved it. I am not too much into fish so stayed away. Dessert we picked up a pound from their huge selection of ethnic Indian sweets. Mango Lassi was a hit with my kids.... What I enjoyed most is that I could feel and taste different spices. Being a botanist, I know and have tasted raw spices. Most restaurants skimp on the spices and just make it greasy with heavy cream. I could taste turmeric, cardamom, ginger and other spices. I feel I got a full money's worth.
