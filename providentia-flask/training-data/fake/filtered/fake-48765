What a wonderful place. Outstanding innovative cocktails, the Lily of the Valley comes in a beautiful antique tea cup and is a must!  The menus is well thought out and masterfully executed.  Among my favorites were the gnocchi which have a wonderful surprise in the center! Hint hint...ricotta, and the rib eye which can only be described as butter! Dessert is not to be missed. From start to finish The Eddy delivers!
