I haven't been to this buffet in, I don't know how many years (5+). I remembered it being one of the best around. So, when I recently went there, I expected it to be the same, if not better. To my surprise, it was the worst experience I've ever had at any restaurant. The food looked like it was leftovers from the day before. Nothing looked fresh and it wasn't even HOT!! How can you serve food that's not hot?! My family and I left feeling really disappointed and frustrated. We vowed to never step foot in this restaurant again. I don't ever write dining reviews, but I felt that I needed to let people know to not waste their money here! I guess the only nice thing I can say about this place was that their soft serve ice cream was good. Paying $15 to eat ice cream - not the best choice.
