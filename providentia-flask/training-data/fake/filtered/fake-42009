Went to a party there. First Party ws not even set up when we arrived, employees scrambling to set up tables and place settings. Cups and plates were dirty, two table has tablecloths, others didnt. Because cups were dirty we were given disposable plastic cups, sme people had real silverware, others had plastic knifes.. very unorganized. Party was for close to 60 people yet Max occupancy on certificate said 42, they should not book parties they cannot accomodate =, was very cramped.  Agree with other reviewerm eggplant parm was undercooked, tough and could not eat. At least two people from the party were sick next day.  Overall very unorganized, not place to book a party...  would NEVER return.
