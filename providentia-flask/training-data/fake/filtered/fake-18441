I don't often write reviews--this is my second. Our experience at this place for our 11-year anniversary, was exceptional. The food was just as good if not better than we've had on our trips to Miami South Beach. EVERYTHING we ordered was absolutely delicious, and the service was second to non. They even brought out a complimentary desert with "Happy Anniversary" written beautifully in chocolate on the plate (all I did was mention it was for our anniversary, when I booked the reservation, because they asked). It certainly wasn't a cheap meal, but we left feeling that we got what we paid for. As someone recently diagnosed with celiac, I was pleasantly impressed by their gluten free menu, and their full disclosure on any dishes that may have trace amounts of gluten. They were so understanding and they just got it. I'd give this place 6 stars, if I could! Well done!
