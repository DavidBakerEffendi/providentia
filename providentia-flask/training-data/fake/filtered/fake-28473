After a recent visit to Acacia on my birthday I was extremely underwhelmed. When we first read over the menu we thought "Wow, we're in for a great meal!  Everything sounds delicious!"  Then they brought out the cold bread and olive oil (not EXTRA virgin...almost clear and tasteless olive oil and no butter) and we began thinking "Well, the first course has to be good!"  We were wrong. After what seemed like an eternity our appetizers arrived.  The "Chilled Jumbo Shrimp and Lobster Cocktail" should be called "3 Room Temperature Medium Shrimp and Minced Lobster Salad".  The cocktail sauce was squeezed on top of the shrimp with what looked like a tube of toothpaste.  YUMMY!  The "Thai Vegetable Spring Rolls" were greasy and flavorless.  The peanut sauce was OK but I've had better out of a jar. Next up was the "Duck Breast and Confit"  Average at best and overcooked...also no duck confit..just a sliced breast and duck leg with mushy risotto! "Spice Rubbed Tuna" was obviously frozen and not fresh.  The color was light pink at best and the presentation was extremely sloppy.  Needless to say we will never return to this overpriced faux fine dining establishment. If you still want to try it out after reading this review I suggest you bring A LOT OF WINE.
