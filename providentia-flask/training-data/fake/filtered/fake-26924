The food is amazing!  I must say we eat out alot and Butcher Bar has the best pulled pork and ribs I've had in my life.  If you like spicy, Try the spicy habanero sauce.   I am so glad they expanded their location.  The new ambiance has a very cool vibe.  The friendly staff and service really puts this restaurant at 5 stars.  I highyly reccomend you try it out.  It is an easy walk from the 30th avenue subway.
