I have enjoy Ofrenda numerous times in the past, but this last Sunday Sep 21, I did a Birthday party for my wife and 45 People. All different backgrounds, Manhasset LI represented the USA, Germans, Colombians, Mexicans, Italians, and one Japanese The food was excellent authentic Mexican food. Fabiola was our waitresses delivering an outstanding level of service. Let's not forget the drinks from Orlando and Enrique where the hit of the night. William the GM allowed me to bring a Mariachi Band and we play music in till 2 AM. The venue turned to be more like El Tenampa in Plaza Garibaldi Mexico. And that is not easy to accomplish. Thank you berry much to the Ofrenda Team
