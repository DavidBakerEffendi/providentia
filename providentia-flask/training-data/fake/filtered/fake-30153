I have never read so many picky &^%$#@^'w writing negative reviews in my life ~ seriously: "The waiter spilled water on me".. "I asked for no ice and got ice." "They don't speak English.".. Do such things (if really true) actually effect your dining experience so much? Thank God I'm not YOUR waiter! I've been going to Royal palace for TWENTY years and found none of this true. In fact, the owners, 'Tommy' & 'Tony', are ALWAYS there & speak English quite well. They'll make anything from the various dinner menus for a lunch special portion on request also.... I've never had ANYTHING spilled on me or anyone with me, have found both the food and service excellent, which is a rather high compliment from me, a Chinese chef of 30 years & frequent visitor to New York's Chinatown.
