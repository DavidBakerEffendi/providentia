Damn !!! Me and some friends tried catching a drink at the " Outpost " this past Sat after hanging out in Prospect Park for most of the late afternoon early eve.  I swear to god I thought I had walked into the second scene from " The Fast and the Furious pt III " It  was so jammed with bodies that people were just lounging out in the street and on the perimeter, residents who lived in the surroundng apt buildings were on top of their roof tops having a beer toasting in celebration of the first official warm day of the spring. I really thought that I had been transported to some exoctic locale, reggae and cuban music playing, beautiful people everywhere, a couple of motorcycle clubs had their wheels parked out front displaying their custom bikes, which was cool. Everybody was vibing and having a chill time.... I predict that this summer is going to be very lucrative for alot of outdoor venues more so this yr than they ever have before in BKLN .  Nobody is exempt from feeling  the grip of the tight economy and nobody is going to want to burn $$$$ that they really don't have just to say they partied in Manhattan.
