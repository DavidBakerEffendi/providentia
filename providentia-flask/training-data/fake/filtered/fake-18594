Loved this spot! I went for lunch and got the kitchen sink salad with their veggie balls and the classic tomato sauce.  If you are health nut like me this is the way to go.  It was filling, tasty and had loads of flavor and textures.  The atmosphere was fun, friendly, and the place was packed.  It is great for lunch with friends or for a first date!
