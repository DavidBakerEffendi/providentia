Go for the lunch special! The food is so tasty and the lunch is such a good deal. Though the menu is limited, you will not miss out. The dolmas (grape leaves) are even better than you expect. We were a party of two and we order 4 items. The portions were perfect. I have also been for dinner and it was delicious! Highly recommended.
