I'm not one to write reviews but I have been visiting this establishment since I was a little girl and today was the last straw, my last three visits where meet with staff arguing with each other, the other was sitting a my table for ten minutes before our waitress decides to acknowledge we are even there let alone what we would have liked to drink and then the last one was the oh I'm sorry the printer is not working so it's okay to sit for fifteen minutes watching everyone else eat. Then since renovations people are literally sitting on top of each other, instead of making sure their customer is comfy and attended to, they rather put in as many chairs and tables and turn over tables as quickly as possible, so disappointed.So on all occasions I just left, me and my husband. It's just been horrid going there. I am so over it. Oh and instead of apologizing or to try to make someone feel better for their lack thereof, they shrug their shoulders like oh well. So long to you IHOP in Bloomfield! By the way I went to the IHOP in another town and the service, location, sitting and the people were excellent!!!
