Let me start by saying the hostess was not very friendly, although our server was very pleasant and professional. It was very noisy and a bit sterile at the same time. The staff didn't seem happy to be there at all. It was all a bit pretentious. A Lot of people doing nothing. The drinks were horrible watered down, I was served courvoisier in a shot glass, shame on you! Not to mention the sangria take it off the menu, or go back to the conception board. The food was just okay at best, the skirt steak was cooked uneven and the ribs were tough. There was only one person in our party pleased with there food. Will I Â give them another shot at it I think not. I would much rather stick to my tried and true restaurants where I can get the full Monty.
