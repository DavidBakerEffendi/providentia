Like Indian food? Then DON'T RUIN your experience by going to Guru Palace in Somerset, NJ. The staff is so rude, the waitress has a bad attitude and should take a bitch control pill. The food arrives cold and they ignore your requests. They can't season the rice properly. The service is horrible. Most of the female customers look like prostitutes, so men enjoy your experience. Guru Palace, I hope you sink. P.S. thanks for spoiling the special occasions of many people who came to your restaurant. And the owner has issues and acts like a jerk.
