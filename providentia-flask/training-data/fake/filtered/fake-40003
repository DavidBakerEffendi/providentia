I've passed by this place almost everyday for the past two years on my way to work and finally decided to try it. Went in for lunch on Thursday with a friend, the food was great, but the service really made it awesome. Our server (red headed girl) was so nice and incredibly friendly, and actually honest with her suggestions. The Â zucchini fries that came with my friends wrap...insane. 4 stars only because it is a tad pricey for what you get, but otherwise I definitely reccomended.
