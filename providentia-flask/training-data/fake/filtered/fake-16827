ABC kitchen is huge with two different doors in which you can enter. It also backs onto a shop can't remember the name though.. During lunch time there can be a wait. They said to us the wait would be 45 mins but we waited on the bench and it was probably approx 20 mins. The interior is decked out really cool. We had an amazing veggie burger and salmon salad which was also great. Probably set us back around 70 with a drink or two. Good hidden secret off the Main hustle and bustle
