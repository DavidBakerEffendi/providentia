While driving through Philly Chinatown in search of a restaurant, we noticed Rangoon. We have had just about every single type of Asian cuisine but had never had Burmese food. The restaurant turned out excellent. I had the Basil Tofu from their lunch menu and it was delicious. Just the right balance of spice and a great portion at a fantastically affordable price. The decor is very cozy and and the place looks well kept. The lady who I think it the owner is extremely courteous. The food game out in record speed as well! Great place!
