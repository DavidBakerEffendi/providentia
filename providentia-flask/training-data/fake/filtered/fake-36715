Made a special trip out here to try and get a straight answer on the food and the service following the dozens of BS reviews recently (both pro and con -- grow up, people)! The Firebird Chicken Sriracha was amazing. This is going to be a new haunt for me whenever I'm in Philly. Service was good, not great, but certainly not like it's being made out to be on here. The kid who waited on me was a bit slow but very courteous and I never felt like I was being kept waiting.
