Not the best place in the world. The food is average at best. The price in the ads and online state the lunch buffet is $6.95 for adults and $3.99/$4.99 for kids. Then when you pay they charge you the dinner price. They told me the lower prices are for holidays only. They then offered to take off 10%. I had to argue to get the correct price. This place is not worth the hassle. There are much better buffets in NJ.
