AMAZING. Must call for reservations if they allow you to make them because its always packed. So worth going too. I have been twice now and both times were amazing. This particular time we went for Saturday lunch, I had the lamb sandwich which was like a pulled pork sandwich but with lamb, it was delicious and was served with chickpea french fries, I still don't know how I felt about the fries but the sandwich was delicious...heavy but delicious. My mom had the Trofie pasta and OMG it was SO good. Both these items are off their weekend Brunch menu so they might not be on their regular weekday lunch or dinner menus. BUT the lamb meatball sliders which are on the non-brunch menu are OUT OF THIS WORLD. Also, they are known for this cookie they make, the Nero cookie, have to get one, its delicious too! I will for sure go back here. Enjoy!
