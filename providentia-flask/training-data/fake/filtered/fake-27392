This family has been ripping people off for 65 years!  There should be a big sign stating "if anyone expected to get any visible mozzerella cheese on their Sicilian pizza, they went to the wrong place!"  This "family" charges $35 for a box of dough and sauce!  This place doesn't put any significant amount of mozzerella cheese on their Sicilian pizza and have been getting away with it for 65 years!  Yes, you have the right to make your pizza any way you wish, but you should state there will be no visible mozzerella cheese!  In all the reviews I've read about your place, NONE stated that the amount of mozzerella cheese used is so infinitesimal, that it becomes invisible by getting "absorbed into the dough."  Now I wonder whether your Rainbow Spumoni is actually made with real Pistaccio nuts or fake imitations such as peanuts. No wonder why so many FAT people eat at Spumoni Gardens... they're eating pizza without cheese to lose weight.  Your place is a dieter's delight!  Also no wonder why it's difficult to eat only one slice:  There's no SUBSTANCE to the damn stuff! Won't be going back, and neither will the pizza loving friends of Tony. "If I wanted a Foccaccia, I wouldn't have ordered a Pizza!"  Avoid the Sicilian IF you expect any cheese on it.  The dough and sauce are tasty.  Napolitan Pizza has expected amount of cheese.
