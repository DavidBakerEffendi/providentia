You'll probably think this is crazy, but I actually make a point to stop at the diner even when I'm just driving in the area.... No actual business at hospital. Best hamburger in town hands down! Great bang for your buck too. The lady cooking and waitresses are friendly and funny. You can tell they enjoy their customers. TIP BIG! Good People.
