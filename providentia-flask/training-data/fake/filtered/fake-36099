Charming, romantic, comfortable atmosphere. Good pasta selections, generous portions (we could both only eat half of our entres). I had the porchini rigatoni with a cream sauce-delish!  And great prices!   The staff was very helpful, and was observant without hovering. Our Server was very funny and knowlegeable about ingredients. I would recommend this for a sweet date night.
