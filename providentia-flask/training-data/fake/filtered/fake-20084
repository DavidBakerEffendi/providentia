My new favorite place.  I admit, I used to go to Starbucks to get my iced vanilla lattes.  I would pass this place many times and always thought it was cute.  I finally stopped in and to my nonsurprise, the coffee was just as good as Starbucks and cheaper.  As I was returning to work thinking "my, this is yummy and it's cheaper than Starbucks and I think I found my new place to get coffee," I dropped my coffee a block away from work and it went everywhere.  Instead of getting all pissed off, I marched right back and got another one fully expecting to pay again.  But after I told the girl who helped me before what happened, she made me another one for free.  Bonus points right there.  I plan on trying the tea next time since I've heard such good things and I definitely want to try the food too.  That hummus plate looks awesome!
