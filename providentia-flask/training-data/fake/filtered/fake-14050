I was at Bonnie's Grill last night because I read that the wings were one of the Top 10 in NYC and they kept their promise. I had 20 medium wings and a small green salad. The salad was actually larger than a regular salad in many other restaurants. The wings (medium) were crispy and absolutely delicious. They came with a large amount of carrots, celery and blue cheese dressing. Only 3.50 for a tall boy beer made that experience even better. The servants were very fast and very nice. The spot is just great. The bathroom was clean and everything else felt good. The place is not the place to take your girl on a first date but definitely good to go any other time. I will be back
