LOVE the food here.  The waffles are so delicious and different from ones I can get anywhere else.  I prefer the vanilla sugar waffle to the original one, but both are great --the vanilla sugar is a bit more buttery tasting which I love.  The biscuit waffles are also wonderful, just eating one filled me up when I had it stuffed with eggs and sausage.  I have also had a panini here before and it was very satisfying. This all being said, I don't like coming here for a number of reasons.  It is way overpriced and you also have to get the waiter/waittress service --why am I paying someone to walk a couple feet over to me and bring my food?  The old system was just ordering the food and getting it at the counter, which seemed quicker to me, and also made mistakes less likely.  On a number of occasions, my order had been incorrect, both when I've gotten the waffles as take-out and when I've sat down to eat, and I feel that it is that "middle man" of the waittress/waiter that messes it up.  Also, this place when it was Bonte used to have a rewards system; you would get a "waffle card" and with each waffle you would get a hole punched in your card.  I think after 8 punches you would get a free waffle.  Considering my view of the place being overpriced, this card made me at least feel a little better.  My friends and I used to be loyal customers back when we ordered at the counter and got our cards punched.  Now, we hardly go --it's just not worth it.
