Met a friend for a late lunch. The restaurant was very clean and very friendly.  A young man Ernesty helped me decipher all the different combinations available and  took the time to explain  all the food choices and there were many! Great place if you're a vegetarian or just want to go meatless. Definitely plan to go again. Prices were reasonable too.
