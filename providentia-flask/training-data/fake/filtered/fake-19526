Had a really great dining experience here. First, It is BYOB. The bread was warm and served with a great roasted garlic olive oil for dipping. Â We had the coconut shrimp app which was delish! The arugula salad was fresh ingredients but a little on the bland side. For my entree I had the pappardelle funghi and split the pignoli crusted salmon with my mommy. Both were flavorful and delicious. You can taste the truffle in the pappardelle funghi which is also crucial. Definitely recommend this place for a nice dinner date or group outing.
