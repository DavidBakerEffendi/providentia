I live around the block from Chapin, which oddly enough means I almost never walk by it, and hence rarely think to go there, but I tried it again a couple months ago and was pretty pleased.  I got something like beef fajitas.  It was really good, and the place has been spruced up quite a bit since my last visit a couple years ago.  (Still not a place to take a place to take a date, though.) My impression is that it used to be primarily Guatemalan, and now is more Mexican, which suits me, since Guatemalan food tends to be bland compared to Mexican.
