Oak Haven Table and Bar is a welcome addition to the New Haven bar and restaurant scene. My first time there I tried the Pork Belly and it was exquisite, definitely on my repeat list for the future. A week later I came back and tried the short ribs which were equally delicious. Not knowing much about bourbon I decided to ask the staff for some recommendations. They were extremely knowledgeable and what I received was a delicious custom bourbon cocktail from one of their oak aged barrels. Â I will definitely be making this my new weekend dining/start off point when I am in New Haven.
