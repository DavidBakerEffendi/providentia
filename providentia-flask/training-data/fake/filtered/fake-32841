This is my first review, but my birthday dinner was so good I just couldn't resist! Especially because I looked at yelp reviews to pick out this restaurant. I have been disappointed before by many of the tourist traps on ferry in the past, and didn't want to be disappointed again. I found Sol-Mar on yelp and decided to trust the reviews. Yelpers, you haven't let me down! Like someone said before, this place is the real deal. The staff was attentive and friendly, and the food was unbelievable. We ordered a variety of dishes, and ate family style. For dessert, we couldn't resist ordering a variety to share again, and although I wasn't too thrilled when my brother in law ordered the flan for one of the picks, I have to say I was again blown away by how freakin good it was. I don't even like flan, but this one was on AMAZING. Â I couldn't get over how good it was, esp because I usually don't like it. And to to off the experience, they now offer a free shuttle service to and from the arena, njpac, anywhere in town! I had family visiting from outside state, and I felt like a visitor to my own city being shuttled to the game. This place rocks! So glad we decided to try some place new :)
