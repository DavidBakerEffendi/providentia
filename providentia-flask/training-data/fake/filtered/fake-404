After seeing several shows about the rivalry between Pat's Cheese Steak's and Geno's, we decided to go to Philadelphia and try them both (along with two others). The result was the conclusion that Geno's was much better. Geno's cheese steak (order it with wiz and onions, the best and most popular style) had a lot more wiz on it. The bread was better, and the steak was ok. Do Not, however, come here if you're sensitive to any prejudice. I read one review on here that talked about xenophobic propaganda, and I thought the reviewer was just exaggerating. They weren't. The windows you order from were filled with bumper stickers that stated "press 1 for English, 2 for deportation," "thank your teachers only if they taught you English," and several signs showing Muslim men who had killed a police officer. The food was great and if you have to choose between the two, choose this place. It turns out that ignorance is bliss and so are their cheese steaks.
