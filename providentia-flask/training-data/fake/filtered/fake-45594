Good food, and good service at the bar.  An excellent alternative to the other Somerset sports bar - Freddies at Pierce.  Stick with Stage House.  Only slight drawback, no Anheiser Busch on tap. Overall though, and again - a decent place to go relax and not have a manager or owner bring confrontation to you as with Freddies at Pierce.
