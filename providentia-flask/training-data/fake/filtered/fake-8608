Was walking down the street looking for a bite when I found this gem. A quaint Thai restaurant that isn't too noisy or touristy. I started off with the steamed pork dumplings which were delicious and fresh, then the crispy vegetable spring rolls. Perfectly crunchy, but not greasy, wonderful. The entree was just as delicious. I had the noodies duck curry which was just spicy enough, the duck was also perfectly moist and crispy, the best I've had in a long time. Definitely recommend you try this place if you haven't already
