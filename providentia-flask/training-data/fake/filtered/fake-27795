I used to frequent Denny's quite a bit with my family.  Then one day I was seated at a table where you can see into the kitchen.  I saw a waitress eat nachos from a nacho platter and then bring it to a table....mine.  I didn't say anything as to not cause a scene.  We obviously didn't eat the nachos and we paid the bill but left no tip.  We didn't return to that restaurant again.   Saturday, three years later, we decided to try Denny's again.  We figured there was sure to be a different wait staff and service might be better.    We walked in and waited patiently while the host seated the couple in front of us.  We were grateful for the fact that we had to wait because in that brief 2 minutes we waited, we realized the odor we started smelling wasn't food cooking .. it was mold and mildew.  And the longer we stood there the worse the smell seemed to get.     I am asthmatic and started wheezing. We walked out immediately.  Now for me to start wheezing after only about 2 minutes in the restaurant, the mold spores must have been very big and very old.   This place needs to be reviewed by the HEALTH DEPARTMENT. Do not eat at the Avenel, NJ Denny's on St. Georges Ave.
