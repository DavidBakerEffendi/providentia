Fantastic find. The food was incredibly flavorful - try the eggplant! - and the service was the perfect combination of laid-back, knowledgeable, and competent. Had a simple margherita pizza, and it quickly vaulted to the top five or so pizzas I've ever had. We arrived early on a Monday (6pm-ish) and were seated instantly in the garden area in front of the DJ booth. This place is the real deal, and I will absolutely be back.
