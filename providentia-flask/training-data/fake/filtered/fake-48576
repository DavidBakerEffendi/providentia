I agree with one of the other reviewers here, this place is really like Olive Vine on steroids. Delicious, delicious Middle Eastern fare! If you're trying to locate that out-of-this-world pita, then Bedouin Tent is your destination. Lamb, hummus, falafels - everything is finger-licking good. Home to a meal you won't forget quickly. Home to a meal you'll keep on coming back to.
