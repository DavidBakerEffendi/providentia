Visited three times now.  First with my wife for an impromptu lunch, second time we met some friends for an  early dinner, and now with my family for dinner.  The food has Bern fantastic each time.  Excellent selection of local beer and a waitstaff equipped to make the right recommendation.   Kelli is outstanding, has great suggestions and we will be asking for her next time.  Try the cowboy burger and the stuffed mushroom burger, but be prepared for the flood!  These burgers are JUICY!
