I've been coming to this diner for a while now and the food is always on point and the service is usually good. At first we had this one waitress who was awesome. She made me love to come to the diner. She was quick and nice and always had good conversation. But recently me and my friends have been going to this diner and the waitress we always get now sucks soo much. I don't mean to be rude but she is slow and forgetful, never checks up on us for more water ect. She took forever to bring us out our side orders after we got our meals. My one friend ate his whole meal before his side order came out. Even when we tried to sit somewhere we think isn't her section it always seems like she's our waitress. I love this diner but I am seriously considering never coming here again because the service it just so shitty. This waitress has yet to get a single dollar for tip out of me and she will never get it. Sorry for being rube but she needs to be fired or else you'll risk good paying customers to never return. She is short with short brown hair.
