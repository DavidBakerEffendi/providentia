I've been to this place a number of times and, having read the other reviews, can see where everyone is coming from in terms of the praise and the gripes. Yes it's weird that they don't serve lunch until 4pm on Saturdays, yes it's loud and you have to wait on weekends for what seems like an eternity, but on the plus side...the fries are great!! The brunch menu with mimosa is also great value. I have never had a disappointing meal here, it's a great place to meet someone for an informal bite and the breakfast/brunch menu never disappoints. I recently had the chicken meatball sandwich which was divine, and i'm also a fan of the pumpkin waffles, the salmon wrapped poached egg and...well, ok everything on the menu. The cakes are also a treat, I recommend the red velvet layer cake if you're going to indulge. My only two complaints are that the filter coffee isn't great (but then it is free as you wait) - and that the service could sometimes be friendlier depending on who you get. Other than that, this is a real find in NYC.
