I was very excited when Da Legna reopened on State Street.  I love the menu- gourmet style pizza, not just the usual choices.  I ordered 3 pies for take out, and was extremely disappointed that the pizza was so salty it was nearly inedible.  It must be the dough, becuase all 3 pizzas were very salty.  We ate the pizza anyway, and I immediately had to drink 4 glasses of water.  The staff is very nice and attentive, the menu is great, and its right in the neighborhood, so I'm hoping it was a bad batch of salty dough, and will give it one more try.
