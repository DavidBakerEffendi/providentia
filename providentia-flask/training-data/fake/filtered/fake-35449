I can't say enough how AMAZING this place is!  I hosted a bridal shower for my best friend this past weekend and everything from the ambiance, to the impeccable service and beyond delicious food made the event as wonderful as I hoped and prayed that it would be.  If you want something classy & elegant but not at all pretentious or stuffy, this is is the place for you.  I would love to have another event here and can't wait to go in for dinner just to enjoy some more of their yummy food!
