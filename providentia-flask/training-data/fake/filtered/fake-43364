TERRIBLE just about sums up both the service and the food here. First of all, expect to wait to be seated even if you have a reservation. Secondly, the waiter didn't seem like he cared at all about us. But most importantly, the steaks were awful; we ordered the NY Strip and even the premium bone in Porterhouse & Rib-Eye. I've never had steak that tasted so awful and Â you can just tell that they were of low-quality and improper preparation. My advice is to AVOID THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION. Waste of money.
