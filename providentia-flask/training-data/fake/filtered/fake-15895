Not your average slice but not a plain ol' grandma slice either.. This is great pizza with a very natural, homemade taste.  The buffalo is the best but the mushroom w truffle oil and dry italian sausage are favs as well.  Also a great deal as these are more filling than they look!  Don't pass it by!
