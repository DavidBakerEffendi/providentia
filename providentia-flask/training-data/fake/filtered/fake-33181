Went here for a quick bite to eat before an off off broadway play downtown. I didn't want the classic plate, so they were kind enough to make me a plate of what I wanted: the classic green falafel, babaganoush, cabbage, and Israeli salad. There were three sauces which accompanied my dish: tahini, a hot sauce, and a yellow sauce. The hot sauce was the best. There's room to eat, but not that much. There are also seats outside, but I'd recommend take out if you need space. Service was speedy and friendly!
