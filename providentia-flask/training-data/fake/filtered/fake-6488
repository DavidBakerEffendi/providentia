It's 5-Stars in my book...appealing on all counts. Simple, delicious, original and reliable, and a good value. Have tried a few "pho's" in New Haven, but this is the gold standard for me.  Previous reviews have said it all, so here are a few pictures of the food, the menu and their cool neon sign!  Be sure to look for the GIANT kettle they cook their wonderful broth in...when that runs dry, they're sold out and close the shop...don't be late.
