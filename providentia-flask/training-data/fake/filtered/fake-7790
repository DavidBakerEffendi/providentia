I tried this place out for the first time last week because I've heard they make a really good burger. I had the blt and it was the best one I've ever had!. However, my server, a very tall, thin, and tan male was not very pleasant to begin with and he literally just took the order and picked up the bill when I needed change and that was the most I seen of him, no smile, no friendliness, nothing. The hostess ran our food over, wrapped up my food, and brought me the bill. My sandwich was great but my server was not. Not sure if I will be back to dine in, maybe take-out.
