Trinity Restaurant is located across Trinity College on Zion Street. It s the best restaurant in Connecticut. I ve been there many times and I still cant wait to go again and have this wonderful experience. My favourite dishes are Fillet Mignon and of course the Swordfish (even if I dont like fish this place made me change my mind). Not to forget to mention that pasta dishes are the most delicious meal I ve ever had. Menu is a mixed of Italian and Mediterrean influenced dishes. Using fresh and not prepared ingredients has as a result to make all the food even better and incredibly tasty. All the desserts are homemade and delicious (by the way my favourite one is the tiramisu). Dont hesitate to visit this hommie restaurant. You wont regret about your choice!!!!!
