Just went to Ducks for the first time.  This place is awesome.  I am a professional athlete and have traveled all over the world to some of the best restaurants.  I am happy that now I don't have to travel so far.  The food is excellent.  The atmosphere is great.  Order the ribs.  You'll be glad you did.  My top three places to eat in manhattan are Mesa Grill, Otto's and now Ducks.  Ducks is defiantly different.  Try one of the shakes also.  If you don't like the food in this place, I don't know what to tell you.  People have been telling me how good it is and I finally got there today.  Well worth it.  I give it 5 stars.  My name is Tahl by the way.  I am a pro athlete. You can look me up on google if you don't believe it.  I don' t think I have ever written a review for a restaurant but, had to do it for this place.   Really enjoyed my night there. Awesome place!
