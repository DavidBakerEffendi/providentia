Very nice experience!!! Excellent food(timballo warm octopus salad,gnocchi and pizza served with their homemade spicy oil...A MUST) service attentive and a very pleasant atmosphere. Nice outdoor seating as well.,Missing the Italian classic apperitifs and digestifs(Campari grappa limoncello amaro etc)Maybe in the future.
