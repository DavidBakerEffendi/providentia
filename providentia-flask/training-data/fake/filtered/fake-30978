Great food and great staff. Whoever manages the beer selection does a poor job. I've been here a dozen times since they opened. They almost never have anything on from New England Brewing and only occasionally have a seasonal from Two Roads. Why are there 6 Clown Shoes beers on tap every time I'm there? Why serve expensive imports in 4oz snifters? This place needs to distinguish itself from Plan B, Wood-N-Tap and Buffalo Wild Wings, all of which are in the same area and have most of the same beers on tap. Offering a list of taps for their customers so they can read it would also help. The rotating board in the front of the bar is a nice decoration, but hard to read and not helpful. Go here for the burgers and fries.
