The Continental offers a chic atmosphere and excellent martinis. Dim lighting spills out from the martini olive lamps that hang over diner-style booths packed with a large age range of hip patrons. The back room has more room to move around, so don't be put off by a crowd in the front window. The global tapas-style menu is great if you're going out with friends and want to sample a lot of dishes by sharing plates (also good so you can just split the bill without argument). The grilled tofu with spicy bean sprout salad and peanut dipping sauce is cooked perfectly and has delighted even my non-vegetarian friends who typically despise such things. The crab pad Thai is delicious and the lobster-mashed potatoes will leave you scraping the plate. The sweeter drinks, such as the chocolate martini or the espresso martini, are usually served to perfection here. This is a great place to go for drinks in the summer when they fill the sidewalks with tables. The Second and Market is perfect to watch the throngs of trendy bar-hoppers pass by.
