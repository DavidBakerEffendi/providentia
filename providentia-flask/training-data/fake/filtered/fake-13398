I'd eat breakfast here everyday if I could. Inside is super intimate, like being in someone's really beautiful kitchen. The food was fresh, so many great flavors and the staff is so friendly and sweet. Just the right amount of food, looks like little servings but I walked out of there stuffed and happy. It's hard to find a place in Williamsburg that serves fresh seafood that isn't overpriced and pretentious! For what you're getting in a meal this place is insanely affordable.
