Been here a few times now so I feel comfortable posting a review. One of the BEST happy hours in the city. The food is delicious and the atmosphere is great. I decided to go in for the Wednesday SIPS special and wasn't disappointed. This was the first time sitting at the bar for some snacks and drinks with friends. The upstairs bar is where you wanna be. Not only is it more comfortable than the crammed, smaller bar downstairs, but the bartenders were amazing. Aleena and Mike seem to have their stuff together. Keep in mind, this place was packed and the two of them were as calm and cool as could be. They know what they're serving and can direct you to the perfect cocktail for your taste buds. My girlfriends and I also had a hard time keeping our eyes off them. Let's face it girls, the boy is a cutie and the girl adorable. If you are looking for great food, fun atmosphere and a hot staff that actually knows their stuff, check this place out !!
