Their bar is amazing. Came here with some of my girlfriends last night. We started at the bar with Grapefruit soju, apple soju, seoul lemonade and Georgia on my mind. There were two bartenders working and one of the girls recognized me from couple weeks ago. They checked on us if we were doing ok. ohh and they use fresh apple juice to make the drinks and its only $7 for happy hour. Their drinks are soooooo delicious!!! Â  I'm giving them a four star because: I came here couple times before and I always got annoyed at frequent changes. A lot of times food came out really slowly and seems like some of the staff didn't know what they were doing. I get this is a new restaurant and they want to try out things but they should really calm down with the changes. Oh and they play these music from 90's sometimes.. Like mambo number 5 and crap..Really? Totally does not fit with the ambiance. Also they can improve on their service for the dining little bit. When I came here before, often the chubby manager took our order or the other well dressed guy did which i thought it was odd and confusing. But overall, Food is alright Ambiance is great Music is awkward Drinks are amazing Service is excellent at the bar Management may need some improvement with stopping with the frequent changes first. Its worth a visit!
