I went here for the first time just the other day. I only had the egg drop soup and meatless fried rice, but it was pretty good. There was a lot of egg in the soup, and it was delicious. The fried rice was ok, but I didn't realize ordering the meatless fried rice meant it was mostly plain--just rice and onions. That was my mistake though, so next time I'll order the vegetable fried rice. They have hot tea available for anyone at a table in the dining area, which I thought was great, but the tea tasted kind of strange to me. Overall pretty decent. I'd go back to try more of their food--which they had a pretty good selection of.
