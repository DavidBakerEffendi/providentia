Great new experience! The actual restaurant is small, has uneven wood paneling, the quintessential images of Everest, Buddhist temples and Tibetan peace flags.   The meal was surprisingly good and cheap.  The Sha Momo, a pan-fried dumpling stuffed with beef and herbs was crispy, greasy, fatty and delicious.  Sha Thukpa is a traditional noodle dish that comes with brilliant greens, but was a little bland.  The best dish of the night was the Chili Chicken.  The Chili Chicken is a spicy fried chicken cooked in onions, garlic, tomato and bell peppers served with basmati rice.  It is like a Tibetan boneless buffalo wing in vegetables, but better.   This is a good place to try new cheap food.  Make sure to bring your own beer.
