I absolutely love this place. The staff is very friendly, and they always have something fun and exciting going on.  There are always good food specials during the week, and they have awesome trivia on Friday nights along with really good bands on Saturdays.  There aren't many places with good trivia around, and I always look forward to going on Friday. I've gone to other trivia nights, but none are as organized and as easy to participate in.  Not to mention, their prizes are good too. I have to disagree with Robert S.  and say that in all my years of going there, I have never had a bad experience .
