Visiting Philadelphia with some old colleges friends, we wound up at the Piazza looking for a fun place to drink and grab a bite to eat. PYT was such a BLAST! Our server, Iesha, was so nice and made sure we had a great time. The place wasn't normally our type of scene but everyone was so inviting. And what made the whole experience complete was the food! This place is not your average burger spot! From the Adult Milkshakes ( Cookie Monster was AMAZING) to the Pickleback Burger with the Pickleback Whiskey Shot, the food was different but lit up my tastebuds! I WILL DEFINITELY BE BACK NEXT TIME I AM IN PHILADELPHIA!
