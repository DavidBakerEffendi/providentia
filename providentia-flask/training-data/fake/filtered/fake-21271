My review is based on the food and the chipotle table sauce, which is sold by the bottle. The food is the 2 stars. The food used to be good here a few years back. Not all things get better with time. On the other hand the Chipotle table sauce is great. I buy and my husband uses it on almost everything. It's has a nice little kick to it.
