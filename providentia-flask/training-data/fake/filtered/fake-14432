No joking, no harm with words but last night 10/11/13 first time at restaurant. Now prior to going I asked my son who lives in the area has he ever visit this restaurant, he replied yes, but food is so so, mom do not buy too much or go to another restaurant. I think he was being nice, he should have told me I was not going to like it. I made a $35.28 purchase, wanted to try a little bit of this and that. EVERYTHING, except for the candied yams I have a complaint. I truly do not know the folks who write on these blogs - either family and staff and/or folks who grew up on eating slop... THE CHICKEN WINGS NOT CLEAN (FEATHERS) AND TOO MUCH SALT, I TRULY MEAN TOO MUCH SALT. FISH WAS OKAY, BUT NOT ENOUGH FOR THE PRICE and compared to other restaurants in the area Â - THEY PUT TWO SMALL PIECES WITH A MEDIUM PIECE. I need to come and show them how to make tender beef ribs. THE POTATO SALAD AND COLLARDS WERE JUST AWFUL. Lastly, the coconut cake - part of the slice was missing, and NO the cake, at least the frosting not homemade. It was a too sweet can based frosting and they threw coconut on top. I cook and cook very well. And when you cook good southern food, you can tell most of these so-called southern restaurants will not last long or just need to stay at home and feed that slop to their family members who are used to eating it and think it is good. Either I caught them on a bad night or Mary T, Jensen L. and Lynn J. are family and friends or never had truly good southern food...NO WAY IN THE WORLD SOMEONE WOULD EAT THE SIDES (I PURCHASED MAC AND CHEESE - AWFUL, POTATO SALAD MADE WITH SOME WATERED DOWN MAYO - AWFUL, I DO NOT KNOW WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH THE COLLARDS - AWFUL)... Candied yams were very good. You kept me from eating too much, because I still have most of that slop in the container... VERY DISAPPOINTED.
