I have only gotten delivery from here, but every time I am shocked at how good it is.  This is the best pizza in the area by far and the fact I don't have leave my house makes it a no brainer.  I recommend ordering small pizzas, they are thinner, but all are good.  Even the fried dough was excellent.  All the people I have dealt with are extremely friendly and when they made one mistake on a pizza we ordered they were apologetic and gave us the mistake pizza for free after fixing the order.
