Great place! I had the Breakfast Burrito , which was really delicious and filling. To I drink I had a Green Face juice, also very good and fresh. The service was good and not much waiting time. The girls working there are very friendly and atmosphere and decor good. I had to wait 7 minutes to be seated. But it was worth the wait. Also, Champs has chairs outside, so you can sit down while you wait. I really really recommend this place. Great food, great service and pretty big portions.
