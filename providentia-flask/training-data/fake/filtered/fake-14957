I saw an employee spit into the food preparation area. There was a counter that blocked my view from seeing exactly what he spat into but I 100% saw him spit a big wad of saliva somewhere in the food preparation area. Â What is another terrible fact is that I've been coming here for years and it was an employee that has been there for a long time. I used to like the pizza here. i wish there was a minus stars option.
