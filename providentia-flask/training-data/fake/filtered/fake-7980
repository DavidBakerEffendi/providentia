Your trip to the great apple is incomplete without eating from this particular cart. Most probably you will be eating standing on the side of the road with no proper utensils to eat but still this is one of the best foods NYC has to offer. I never had so much food in just 4 dollars. No matter what you order you will get plenty of food. The lines can become quite long but worry not it moves pretty fast. These guys are super fast and very friendly. They already have so many reviews and I really don't have anything unique to add. I can just share one short story that once I had a small fight with my wife. I bought food from this cart and she couldn't resist the sight and the olfactory stimulation and took a fork and started eating her meal. She smiled and then didn't look at me until finished her meal...
