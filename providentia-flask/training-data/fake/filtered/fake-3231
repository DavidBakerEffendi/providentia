I visited this Red Lobster on Saturday.  First the 'unlimited' cheese biscuits were definitely limited.  After the first basket, the waitress never came back to offer more which is not what Red Lobster advertises on T.V.  I ordered flounder and I found it to be very small with no taste.  The grilled vegs and broccoli were also tasteless.  The ultimate feast was satisfactory according to my son.  My husband's chicken was also very small.  Within 20 minutes of leaving Red Lobster my lips were tingling and I had to use a restroom.  I immediately went home and was sick the rest of the night.  I am allergic to shellfish so I ordered the flounder.  Either my reaction was from cross-contamination of flounder with shrimp or the food was not tainted. I have eaten flounder in other restaurants with no reaction whatsoever.  I do not recommend this restaurant to people who are allergic to shellfish because their procedures need to be revised.  I also am not sure whether my reaction was from the bad fiounder.
