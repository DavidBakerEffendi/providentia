Had great high hopes for this place. It was one big let down after the salad after the hard sell to upgrade it. I don't like pushy service people at all. Onto the classic Margherita...it was just bland and flavorless. The crust isn't a traditional NYC crust with that nice crunch and snap. Needless to say the minute you're done they take the plates away and drop the check down. The server could have at least offer me a desert or coffee.
