Reliable and tasty neighborhood spot. Nice variety of antipasti, especially the roasted vegetables, served properly at room temp. Kinda cozy in chilly weather, lovely garden for sunny days. Gets pretty busy so go early if you're picky about eating promptly. Cash only. Annoying. Brooklyn really needs to get over it's apparent fear of credit cards.
