The entire experience was delightful. We arrived a tad early and enjoyed relaxing in comfy chairs on the front porch, sipping our drinks until our table was ready. The yellowtail appetizer was delicious, the salmon was absolute perfection, and the cheeseboard... well it was the ideal way to end the meal. Everything was timed perfectly. And our server (Manny), made the evening that much more entertaining. Looking forward to our next trip to Princeton.
