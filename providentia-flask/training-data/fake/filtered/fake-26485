Its some mighty fine gourmet dining with some mighty fine people. The ambiance is welcoming but vibrant; as if you were actually in Spain or Portugal. This is the next best thing than going to Newark and probably better. I've tried them all and I must say the steaks and the seafood is exquisite. I will be there this Friday night and I`m bringing all my friends with me. Hope to see you there.
