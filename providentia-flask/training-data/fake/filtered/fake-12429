I have always been curious about these delightful little gems. But when a friend of mine, (who is French) told me stories of going to Laduree as a child, and describing how incredible their Macrons are. I knew I had to make a trip to the city. All I have to say is every dessert in the world is now ruined. Nothing will ever reach the standard of a Laduree Macaron for me. The texture, is magic. The flavors are so divine. I have to eat each one slowly in order to enjoy not only the taste, but almost an aromatherapy like experience. Rose, orange blossom, and pistachio are my favorites. Hazelnut, violet black currant, and almond are amazing as well. I've also tried blood orange ginger around Christmas time. Really yummy! The decor of the shop is very posh and almost regal. It's like stepping back in time, to an old fashioned patisserie. I love it! I do hope that someday they will expand to allow space for a full tea room, just like the one in Paris. I can't wait to go back, there are still some flavors I haven't tried! And don't get discouraged if there is a line out the door. Believe me, it is worth the wait!
