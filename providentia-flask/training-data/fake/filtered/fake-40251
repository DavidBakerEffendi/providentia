This is the best pizza you can get in NYC. You will wait a long time to get your pizza.  The place will be dirty, hot, and smoky.  The staff will not feel sorry for you.  If you cannot accept those things, you will be much happier going elsewhere.  Hopefully the line will be that much shorter next time I go. You will get a pizza made by a man who has perfected the art of making pizza over the last fifty years.  Each pizza is crafted from imported tomatoes, three different types of imported mozzarella cheeses, and imported olive oil. I've been to every big pizza place in NYC you can name.  Grimaldi's, Patsy's, Lombardy's, Totonno's, John's, Joe's, and all the new guys you've seen on Food Network and read about in the Times.  They all share a fine tradition of NYC pizza and all are on about the same level on any given night.  Di Fara is a step above them all.  Once you take that first bite you know that.  The crazy part is all those other guys are using a brick oven of some kind or another.  Dom does it with the traditional NYC gas fired pizza oven.  Incredible. He won't be doing it much longer, so if you truly love good pizza you should go sooner than later.  If you judge pizza by how long you wait in line and how dirty the store is, then you don't need to hurry.
