My husband and I have heard good things about Republic from some friends and we decided to give it a go. The restaurant was very beautiful inside and gave off a friendly vibe. We got seated upstairs in a corner area -- which I liked because I got to look down and see all the action happening at the bar. Our waitress Maya came over to us with the biggest smile on her face -- it was very pleasant and refreshing to see someone so happy. Since we have never been there before we asked the waitress to tell us some of her favorite dishes on the menu -- she sold us on the ribs and mussels to start. Maya did not disappoint -- the appetizers were excellent! We ordered a bottle of wine to go with our dinner. We have never tried the 337 Cabernet before -- sure enough it was very good, another thumbs up for Maya's suggestion. I ordered the Peruvian chicken and my husband ordered the Pork Confit. To put it simply, we were both extremely pleased and satisfied, the food was delicious. Dessert time came and we both treated ourselves to some cappuccinos and banana bread pudding -- the bread pudding was to die for. Our experience was definitely one to always remember. From start to finish our service was immaculate and the food was spectacular! Maya told us to ask for her again and sure enough we will. -- Thank you Maya! This charming restaurant holds plenty of potential and I am hopeful that they stick around because I cannot remember the last time I had this much of an amazing time eating out.
