Looking for a low key, casual dining experience, I chose this place due to the overwhelmingly positive reviews it received from pretty much anywhere I looked. Food-wise, I was not disappointed. The pepito arepa was outstanding and the reina peblado patacone was hearty and filling. With that said, its dark atmosphere, while providing for an intimate ambiance, is an advantage only to the restaurant when it comes time to pay the bill. If you aren't careful, you'll have no idea what you're paying for. There are three suggested tip increments on the receipt: 10%, 15%, and 20%. I chose to pay the 15% tip in cash (it's about right for just 3 people), putting a line through the tip line to indicate this. But while checking my bill this morning, I realized that they chose to charge me 20% tip on the card, while already having taken the cash tip given that night. Although the food experience was fantastic, I can't help but feel robbed blind (literally). I still recommend this place, but bring a flashlight and shine it directly at your bill at the end of the night.
