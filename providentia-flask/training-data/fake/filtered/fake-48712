Empanada Mama is a great find! The place itself is a bit cramped so make sure you go early to you can grab a seat. They are also great for take-out. There are many different empanadas to choose from and they range from 2.50-3.00 per empanada. They are really inexpensive and you will get a great dinner. Enjoy!
