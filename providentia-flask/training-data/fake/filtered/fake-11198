My husband is somewhat unique...he actually wanted to go to Eataly for his birthday with two other couples...what a mistake !!! the experience was awful !!! the MANAGER was extremely rude and actually mentioned the that she was concerned about the waiter's tip !!! BTW the waiter actually said "take it or leave it" A bit confused? well all this simply because we needed two extra chairs to accommodate the last couple that arrived late to this Italian mega supermarket with restaurants. Trust them when they state at the entrance hallway "the customer is NOT always right"
