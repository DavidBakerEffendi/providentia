Two weeks ago I had my first Argentinean sandwich and it was delicious! Somewhat hesitant to head to this restaurant, place is a bit tight but in a good way. Intimate atmosphere. Went there again on Monday for lunch with my boss. Food was great as always, although salads are too small. The service is excellent,helpfull, and friendly.
