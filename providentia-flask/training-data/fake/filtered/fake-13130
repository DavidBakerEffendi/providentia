After living on the CT Shoreline for over thirty years, and seeing countless episodes of TV food shows featuring this place, I finally decided to give it a try yesterday since I was in New Haven anyway. What, may I ask, is the big deal here ? I waited about 24 minutes to get a cheeseburger from a totally disinterested young woman behind the counter. I found it boring, and without a lot of flavor, and seven bucks for a soda and this burger was not a good value at all. But I did it, ate a burger at America's birthplace of the hamburger, risking a parking ticket in the process, and walked out of this so called icon after a poor burger lunch, vowing " never again ". And I won't, others can have mine.
