Horrible experience. I live in the neighborhood, and I really wanted to like this place because it looked really interesting (especially compared to the sketchy chinese place that used to be there). Tried it out last weekend with my girlfriend and we got the shrimp steam pot and the mussels. The shrimp was alright, but mussels were ridiculously gritty. And not just one mussel, but first three in a row. She thought the first one was a fluke and that the rest would be fine, but boy were we wrong. The sound of sand crunching between her teeth from the third one was so loud that I thought that she had cracked a tooth. We had to just throw away the rest of them because they were completely inedible. Its a shame because the staff was friendly enough. I don't know if it was because it was right before they were closing, but its not really an excuse to sell sand in a bag. You shouldn't have to spit food out. The experience was bad enough to motivate me to post my first yelp review.
