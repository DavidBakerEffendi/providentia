everyone when you sit at sushi bar Â you should tell sushi chef good or no good, Because once at last week I eat not fresh fish at sushi bar, I try to explain it to him, I do not know if he understood,He just stood there say ye ye ye ye ye Finally I angry with my few word "fish no good no good" At that time, I think he knows what I'm talking about. i will not going back for sushi anymore unless one day i learned his language. good luck everyone
