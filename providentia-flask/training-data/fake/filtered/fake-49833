We recently had dinner at Adriana's.  Some things were good. Ceasar salad was good dispite cut romaine. Lamb was good. Veal shank was a little tough and crispy dry on top. Polinta was very dry.  Polinta served with mashed potatoes, silly quantity. Server was rude and meals served by the auction method, reaching over people as well. They were also rude over the phone. This restaurant is not good enough to have rude service.
