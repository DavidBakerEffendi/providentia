Have been there before and enjoyed the food and drinks but service has always been a nightmare that detracts from the overall experience. Went in on a Saturday afternoon for brunch. Not many people there. Waited to be approached and never was. Finally asked the bartender if we could just seat ourselves. When we saw the waitress she ignored us to chat with her friends. Couldn't get eye-contact at all. We left before even getting our menus because it felt like unless we were friends with an employee they didn't want to be bothered with helping us.
