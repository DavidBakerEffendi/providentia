This restaurant was disgusting!  My boyfriend and I were craving sushi and I wish we hadn't gone.  We ordered edamame and after eating the first couple we realized that they were definitely not fresh.  In addition, my boyfriend found that one of them had a bug inside it.  Why we continued eating, I can't really tell you but we did continue.  The rolls were poorly rolled and did not taste fresh.  I wouldn't go back to this restaurant even if someone paid me.  Do yourself a favor and go to the city for sushi.  You will regret it if you eat here!
