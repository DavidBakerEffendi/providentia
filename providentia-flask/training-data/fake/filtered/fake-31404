Decor/appearance: Nicely appointed but too dark. I get the hip, trendy low light thing but this was ridiculous. Service: was acceptable, waited a bit too long to order drinks but the rest of meal timing and service was OK. Prices: too high, even for "steakhouse" standards. Wine list: limited, way overpriced, not impressive. Food: comp bread was average at best. Apps: Garlic/stilton fondue app was decent but actually too much. Crabcake was a little too cooked on outside. Entrees: Sesame tuna entree was perfectly cooked, very tasty but sat in a puddle of sauce. 12 oz filet, ordered medium rare came out medium. Seasoned with too much salt. Was OK, but did not justify the absurd price ?$44.... Interesting crowd. Many couples, old to mid-20's, some families with adolescent kids and 2 guys at a table next to us in t-shirts, basketball shorts and sandals. Guess that is what you can expect in the burbs. Overall, not horrible but would not return or recommend.
