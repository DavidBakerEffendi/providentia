It was my first time coming to doma and me and my boyfriend were excited to try our first sushi rolls in Philadelphia. We moved down from new york just recently and a friend recommended that we try out the sushi rolls like the rock n roll and the pachinko roll at doma. With much excitement, my boyfriend and I went in and was amazed with the atmosphere and how cute it all looked. The staff all looked very professional and were very knowledgeable with everything on the menu. We did end up ordering the two rolls that were recommended to us and of course some other rolls like the spider roll and the medusa roll. The food was definitely more of like 4 stars. The only complaint I ended up having was the issues the hostess had with the staff members. If there is one thing I cannot stand for it is when the staff members bring up their personal issues with one another onto the restaurant floor. My boyfriend and I tried to block everything out that the hostess was saying as she was stomping all around the floor but we just couldn't carry on a very calm relaxing conversation with her around. We ended up hearing her yell curse words to the servers and talk about the doma owners and how she hated working there. I would definitely love to come and eat here again but with more professional and mature staff members around to help costumers have a relaxing and enjoyable experience.
