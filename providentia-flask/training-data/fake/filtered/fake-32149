food was very good here but prices weren't too good, $26 for chicken with balsamic , $14 for 4 pieces of shrimp ?? and when we weren't allowed to use a gift card Along with a groupon we were very confused as to why because a gift card isn't another "coupon" it's been purchased. Â service was ok, probably won't be going back
