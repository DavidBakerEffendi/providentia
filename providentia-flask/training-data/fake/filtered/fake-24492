This rating is not for the food because I have not tasted their food. This rating is for service.. If you have a group of at least 4 or 5, then its good becoz if you are only two looking for a table, then you will be disappointed. I went there with a friend and they asked me to share a round table with 3 other strangers. I am not sure about others but for me, taste is not only the requirement, seriously how can you eat with strangers on a same table facing each other.
