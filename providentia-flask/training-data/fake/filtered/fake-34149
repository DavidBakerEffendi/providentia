This place is wonderful. Claudio is adorable. What great service, tapas, drinks and food :). I am super picky but this place sold me. I am the way from LA and I begged them to open a location closer to me (yes, in California). Please visit them and spread the love! This place is reasonably priced, has tons of parking and it is a great place to socialize and have some fun with friends :)
