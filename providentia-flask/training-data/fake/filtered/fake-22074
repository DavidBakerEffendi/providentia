I found the office on the internet and went there from Maryland, because I liked the price for the implants. Even it took some time  to get 3  implants I'm very happy with the quality.  All  specialists are  good  skilled and very kind  and responsible  people. Especially  I'm thankful to the doctor Eric Friedman. He is a dentist from the God, I feel  very comfortable  with my new  implants like they are my own teeth. I will recommend Absolute smile to  my friends and I'm sure they will be pleased with  the quality, price and attitude.
