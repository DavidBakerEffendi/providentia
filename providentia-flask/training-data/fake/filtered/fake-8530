Got take out tonight, meatballs are frozen not homemade. Not really impressed with anything else we had. Sauce was bland like from a can and spaghetti was way over cooked. One bright spot was the soup, it looked to be homemade. Would not recommend eating here when there are much better Italian restaurants in the area.
