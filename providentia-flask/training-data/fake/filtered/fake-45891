We have been eating at Brothers for years,  Love it.  Lots of fresh ingredients well prepared.  attentive staff,  attractive setting. relaxing, reasonable prices. range of dishes to please both my meat eating friends and me.  I truly don't understand the snarky reviews,   Not a relative...a local who cares
