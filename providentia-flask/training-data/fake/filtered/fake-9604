Between all the places in Bayonne to eat in, this place is one of my favorite! Prices are reasonable and the menu is great. They usually have good appetizer choices on a specials menu. Launch boxes are pretty good. You should also try dragon rolls. The only complain is the service, not very professional for my taste, but overall, nice restaurant.
