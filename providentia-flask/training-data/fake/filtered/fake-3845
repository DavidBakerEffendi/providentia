It really hits the spot.  Portion was good, service was good.  The guy that was in charge of getting ppl in may seem mean or unfriendly.  However, when he was helping to serve me he was actually pretty nice.  I had to wait ONE HOUR AND 45 MINS, good thing is that they let you put your name in so you can go walk around and come back later.  I walkd around for an hour thinking it would be almost ready.  After I got back I still had to stand there for about 45 mins.  They charge of every little add-ons too, so my noodle soup ended up costing 16-18 bucks.  Not really worth the wait, I would go back again, IF I can find a time when there's no or little wait.
