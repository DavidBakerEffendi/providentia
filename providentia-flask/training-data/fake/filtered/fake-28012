The restaurant was beautiful, the atmosphere was wonderful, the staff was beyond professional, but the food was seriously lacking. For people to rate the food there anything higher than a 2 or 3 star is saying they don't know good spanish tapas. Nothing authentic about this food. I spent $100 on food about the same taste quality as TGIFridays or Ruby Tuesdays. The pumpkin soup was oily and tasteless with a a massive chunk of melted Buffalo mozzarella that just made it a chore to eat. The coca (flatbread) that was supposed to have manchego, artichokes, and truffled mushrooms was covered in greasy cheese and not much of anything else. The clams and chorizo was good and by far the best food we had while we dined. If your into authentic tapas don't believe the hype, this isn't the place for you.
