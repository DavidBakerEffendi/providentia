Terrible service here on Memorial Day during dinner time. First we were told that they were sold out of a lot of things, which is fine. We were told that the Elbow room food was available so we sat down. A waitress came over to take our order and halfway in the middle someone else came over and told us that we had to leave now and the kitchen was closed. There was no apology and no attempt to make us happy.
