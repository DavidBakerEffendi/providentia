I've been to this restaurant three times for lunch.  The first two times I was greeted by the host and had excellent meals.  However today was a completely different experience.  Today I was greeted by the owner.  Or should I say the owner barely acknowledged our existence as he mumbled "sit where you want".  After placing our order the food was brought out cold and tasteless.  When finished the owner placed our check on the table without a greeting no less a thank you.  It's as if we were in his way by eating at his establishment.  TOTAL DOUCHEBAG!..I mean seriously I could give a blank if I"m catered to but some sort of minimal service is the least one can expect.
