The karaoke people are nice but the bar service sucks it's slow and gives you attitude. I used to come on Sundays but NEVER AGAIN. One of the bartenders on Sundays (short blonde/ light hair) gave us attitude demanding for tip at the end (he didn't helped us) even after my friend had given cash to the actual bartender who had served us. He needs to learn how to talk and treat people.
