Just left this place after having dinner there with my family. Food was bad, staff were worse. Portions were small. Waiters were the rudest I've experienced in the Burlington area. I arrived hungry and happy. I left still hungry, but also angry. Just awful. How awful? Well, I signed up on yelp just to warn others not to go to this place. There are many good restaurants around here, such as Shalimar and Farah's, Pho Dang and Pho Hong. Avoid Tiny Thai because rather than good food, the waiters provide you with rude comments and pressure to leave immediately after you finish your meal.
