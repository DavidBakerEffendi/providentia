Is there any way to give 0 star??? Outrageous is my first and only impression to the way how this seemingly popular restaurant treated its customers. From the right beginning when we walked into this restaurant, the atmosphere didn't feel right. We were seen as 'invisible' by the staff there even though several tables were already cleaned up and ready to serve. The waitress skipped us anyway, and started serving the person who arrived after us. Hey, come on, are you blind??? We had to ask for being seated. However, you know what, we were even not allowed to choose where to seat. Funny, right?! During the entire stay, we were treated as 'invisible'. No staff served us water, or, even made an apology for not being attentative. We were just treated like third-class citizens. Finally, we raised our voice to get the attention from everyone who was dining there. This time the staff there was no longer DEAF and BLIND. But again, they just don't care about customers. Their attitude just really made people sick and pissed off! We didn't dine there at all, and left with disappointment!!! So, we cannot speak for the food quality there. But, if you want to have 'invisible' experience, we will definitely recommend this restaurant!!!
