One of the best places to eat in and around East Windsor. We have been picking up food from this place for a while and every time it is consistency the same. Glad to see some home style cooking for North Indian food as it is very hard to get such fresh food. There are other Indian places that have opened after Hot Peppers but none of them offer the same quality, freshness and exceptional customer service. My kids love their Butter Chicken and Saag Paneer (hard to believe they eat spinach this way) .
