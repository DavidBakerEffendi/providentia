Went there last night. Make a reservation!!! We made one on Urbanspoon and got seated right away. I saw others waiting at least 30 minutes. This was around 9pm. We started with the Rustico, which is a veggie, meats, and crostini platter. It was awesome. Great value on that appetizer, huge assortment of those items, well worth the $18. Then we each got a pasta dish. Tasted very fresh, homemade. I got the papardelle with wild boar ragu, it was delicious. My wife got the papardelle with fresh mushrooms which was also delicious. This is a BYOB which cuts down on the bill. Great service. Great tight little atmosphere in there. All around no complaints.
