I found Pinto on Delivery.com and after reading great reviews I wanted to order it. The food was amazing, considering how small and secluded the place was. I would have never though that the food was so good. The packaging was great and every part of the meal was separated. My lunch was so good I ended up coming there after work for dinner. I have since order lunch there at least once a week and will continue to do so. I recommend anyone wanting a Thai lunch or dinner try this place at least once, you won't regret it.
