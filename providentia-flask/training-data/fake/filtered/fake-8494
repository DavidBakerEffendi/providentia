Okay, I am as crunchy as the next Vermonter and certainly enjoy a good café sandwich, but The Boho Café is just gross! I stopped in with my mother on our way back to Burlington from Massachusetts after reading several positive reviews. I cannot imagine how this place would get any glowing reviews! The homemade potato chips that others raved about in their reviews were extremely stale and not at all tasty. I ordered the "Tree Hugger" which is the only vegetarian option. It was a measly little wrap that took over 20 mins to assemble. I also ordered coffee, and trust me, I like my coffee strong, but this was lukewarm sludge. My mother ordered the "Tin Man" which was also tiny and cold after a long wait. The worst part about this experience, however, was that the young man assembling our sandwiches with his bare hands kept pausing to take every coin and bill out of the cash register and handle it before returning to touching the sandwich ingredients--yuck! Also, the vegetables were clearly not fresh. I certainly won't be returning here, and if you like cleanliness and an edible meal, I recommend you skip this place!
