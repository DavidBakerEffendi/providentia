I was treated to my first trip to New York City by my daughter and son-in-law, and along with my youngest daughter.  Our last evening in New York, before attending our broadway show, we had the finest dinner at Al Fiori.  We each ordered something different and could not resist sharing, and all four meals were delicious.  The Sommelier was amazing!!  He actually found a wine that was perfect for me, which surprised me since I have not been a wine person my whole life.  For me to be able to explain to him why I do not care for wine and for him to found the right wine on the first try was so astounding.
