My wife and I went to Xochitl on a Saturday night, and we met quite a busy crowd.  Our first impression was the hostess, who worked some kind of magic and got us a table among the crowd.  She informed us about the build-your-own guacamole card on our table, and we got right to making an amazing custom build.  (Don't turn your nose up at the crab meat!  It's delicious!) Our waiter, Mike, promptly came over to talk about the specials and briefly went over the menu.  We got the Red Snapper Ceviche, at his suggestion, for an appetizer.  It was perfect with the plantain chips that they paired it with.  My wife ordered the Salmon and I ordered the Camarones con Caldo.  She was quite pleased with the dish and I had to admit that the vegetables that came with it were enough to make a meal out of, hearty and perfect for a winter meal.  My dish was slightly spicy and came with an avocado salad that helped cool down the spice on the shrimp.  Delicious! A word about their drinks....amazing.  The Perfect Margarita that the waiter suggested was strong and tasty.  He informed us that they didn't use mixes, and everything was fresh squeezed per drink. I must say, Mike was extremely knowledgeable about the dishes and made a point to visit our table several times during our visit, even though it was a VERY busy night.  My water glass was never empty.  He even spent a little time chatting with us about our evening, seeming to be genuinely interested in how we were spending the rest of it.  Quite pleasant and he made us feel comfortable and at home among the crowd. We will definitely be back, this time with friends!
