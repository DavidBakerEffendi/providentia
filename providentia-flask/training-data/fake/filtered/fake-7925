I LOVE this place, I was introduced to this place by a meat eater who knows that I am vegan, and suggested that I go here. If it can turn a meat and potatoes man into a believer, then it is worth a try, and when I tried it, I fell in LOVE. I love the fried scallops and the chicken cheesesteak. I thought that once I became vegan I was going to have to totally forget Â one of Philadelphia's staple foods. Never again!!! Thank you Govindas for creating great food that everyone wants to eat!!!!
