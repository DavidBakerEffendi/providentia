After stalking their website for weeks, I finally made it to Pure Fare. I'm blown away. I was a significantly low on protein for the day and so opted for the Grilled Chicken sandwich with carrots, cabbage and ginger edamame Â spread. Amazing! I can't wait to try the other menu items and, luckily, they're a 15 minute walk from my office. What a great lunch spot
