The littlest and newest cafe of the Green Line trio, the Powelton Village shop  is a great spot.  It's got a cleanly styled, yet cozy atmosphere and there's usually a table available, ready for your laptop or a newspaper.  Complete with two comfy chairs in the back, and a sunny outside sitting area, you're sure to find a spot that's just right for you to relax in or get your work done.  Great hot tea, coffee and some killer bagels with great toppings-- i recommend Bobbie's hummus or some fresh pesto.
