I went here recently and felt like I was in some horrible tourist trap, or perhaps the Olive Garden.  Our waiter looked like she hated her life, the decor was cheesy, and the management kept explaining to us that we couldn't share our food-- specifically the pasta.  When we explained we had no intention of sharing the pasta, just the entrees and a handful of appetizers (one appetizer of which was $35 by the way so we were already paying the equivalent of an entree each), they still kept pushing us to order additional food and told us that if we were caught sharing, our silverware would be taken away.  At the end of the day, it was obvious they were trying to shove extra food down our throats to make an extra buck, which I find quite tacky and something you would find at a down-scale Italian chain.  I guess we should have tipped off by the "all you can eat" pricing.   I also noticed that most of the more favorable reviews on here are from non-Manhattanites, so I would say this to all you tourists and Broadway show go-ers: you are in New York, where amazing Italian food abounds.  Please don't go to this establishment, because as someone who lives in NYC, I would be embarassed if you thought this was representative of what fabulous food this city has to offer.
