The food is good but whatever you do don't have your food delivered in. I order there quite frequently because the food is good but the order never comes delivered complete. Something is always missing from the order or is incorrect. I write this because it is the 5th time this has happened and I'm sad to say I will miss the food but the incompetence and inability to deliver a meal correctly is to much. Not to sure what goes on behind the scenes over there but they definitely have a major problem in how their system is set up.
