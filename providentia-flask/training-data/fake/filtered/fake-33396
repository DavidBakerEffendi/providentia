I've gone to this place a year ago an thought the food and service was awesome. A year later I returned and brought my family thinking this would be a great experience of different culture. They were weary because there were no cars in the lot and the place looked closed down after getting settling in, the cook warmed us with a nice show. the food was once again great and we were enjoying ourselves UNTIL WE SEE 2 ROACHES COME FROM UNDER THE GRILL. One person came and killed it with her hand and then to my surprise, they gave us a full bill, not a single discount no owner came to speak to us, NOTHING. Until this matter gets fixed (and we'll never know), I can't recommend this place to anyone.
