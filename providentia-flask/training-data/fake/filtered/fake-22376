After reading the reviews for Kefi Taverna my wife and I decided to go. We had a reservation Saturday night 4/26/14 at 7:30. We were greeted when we entered, and seated immediately. The first thing we noticed was the noise level. It was so loud we could barely hear each other. We had a very nice server (George), who took our order. We were thinking we would really enjoy the dinner. The reviews made me think the portions would be ample, the prices reasonable, and the food as good as it gets. The only thing we agreed with was the prices. They are very reasonable. As for the food it is average, and not ample. I ordered the mousaka, and when it came out it was not hot. I asked for it to be heated, and they took it back to the kitchen. When it was returned it was still not hot. I told the manager the mousaka was still not hot. He told me it just came out of the oven. I told him to feel it if he thinks I'm wrong. I asked him to take it away, I didn't want it. He did and apologized. He also did tell us he would take it off our bill, and offered us dessert. All good but we were very disappointed with our experience. We will not be going back again. There are other Greek restaurants in the area that are much better, Thavma $$, and Lithos $$$ both in Livingston. Michael S. Roseland N.J.
