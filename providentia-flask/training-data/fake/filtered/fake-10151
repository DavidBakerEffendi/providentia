WeI just recently went to Mcguinns for the first time a few weeks ago. My husband and I moved to the area a few months ago and Mcguinns is close to our house. We were pleasantly surprised when we finaly decided to go there! The bartender  was very friendly and the drinks were reasonably priced. It seemed that there were many "regulars" that were also very friendly.  When we went out onto the huge deck to smoke we felt welcomed into the conversations that were being tossd around by the "regulars". We took a look at the bar menu but did not order anything because we already had dinner. We will definitely go back soon and will probably try the food. Either way we are glad this bar is so close to our house. Maybe we will be the new "regulars"
