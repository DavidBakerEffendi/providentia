It's just ok for me, but the man puts alot of effort into each pie.  I think if he had an extra hand watching the pies in the oven, some of the pie crusts wouldn't come out charred.  The cheese combo on there is a little too much, and the dousing of olive oil at the end is one step too many.  A decent pie but I'm not jumping on the best ever band wagon.
