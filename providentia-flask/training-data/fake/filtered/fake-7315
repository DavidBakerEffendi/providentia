Food: EXCELLENT Service: Would never go back because of the service. The servers practically pulled the plate out from in front of me mid-meal. In fact at one point she came to take our appetizer, we were not finished and asked her to leave it. She stood at our table, watched us take another bite and said "now can I take it?" And, she did take the dessert before we were finished. Don't make me feel guilty for wanting to finish the meal I am paying a lot of money for!!!!!!!! TERRIBLE!!!!!!!
