The place looks pretty fancy and is nicely decorated, but it's all an act. Things started off fairly well with some tasty guacamole and chips, but it headed south quickly. The entrees (priced between $20-25) were just plain bad - tastier food can be had at Chipotle - or even Qdoba. The chicken in my dish was a far cry from fresh. In fact, it tasted as if someone had microwaved it about 3 times. The incredible salty rice accompanying it didn't help either. My wife ordered a bacon-wrapped shrimp dish. Despite the deliciousness of things wrapped in bacon, this too was rather gross - overly salted and slathered in some cheap white cheese. You'd do better microwaving the Costco version. Next up - the drinks. We were told of a wonderful IPA on tap - "Fishead IPA". After confirming the pronunciation a few times, I just assumed that it was really "Dogfish head" and ordered one. It wasn't Dogfish Head. And it either came out of a bottle or a very stale keg. And for $7, I was expecting more than a tulip-glass worth - it wasn't that strong. Figuring I'd try again - I asked what else was on tap. 'Mexican Cider'. Well okay, that sounded interesting. 'So that's a hard cider, right'...'Yes yes'. I ordered one. When it arrived a few minutes later, I quickly realized it was another IPA. Upon pointing this out to the waiter, I was heartily assured that it was indeed Cider and I was probably just unfamiliar with this new type of beverage. Well, anyone who has had a beer and a hard cider would be hard pressed to confuse the two. Next time your craving Mexican - try somewhere else. Even better, grab some Chipotle burritos and enjoy them at home with a Â few Yuenglings. Or with some Mexican Cider, if you can find any :)
