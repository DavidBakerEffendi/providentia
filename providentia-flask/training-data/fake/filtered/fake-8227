So, I would just like to start by saying that I have never had the privilege of eating at Savin Rock Roasting Company. I am a new resident of West Haven and am still making my rounds among the local businesses. After walking past Savin Rock Roasting I decided to pop in and grab a printed to-go menu. The waiter was extremely polite, the patrons at the bar all seemed to be enjoying their meals and the atmosphere was inviting. The environment was very clean and I loved that you can see the cooks preparing the meals. Not to mention the fully (maybe even over-supplied bar), which I can absolutely respect, as a bartender. After returning home my husband and I reviewed the menu and are sure that we will be attending this establishment soon. After our experience I will be sure to update my review. As for now, the wonderful scents, lengthy menu, and positive vibes will be what I leave you with as my first experience at Savin Rock Roasting Company.
