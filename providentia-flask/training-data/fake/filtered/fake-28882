This past Monday, 1/27/11, I had lunch at your Diner and was very pleased with the food, cleanliness and service provided.  Our waitress, Kristy, was very attentive, knowledgable of the menu and very customer friendly. It was a very pleasant experience, unlike some other diners that do not provide such great servers with their menus.  Keep up with the good food and especially the great service and I would recommend my friends/family to eat at Allwood! Regards, New Customer
