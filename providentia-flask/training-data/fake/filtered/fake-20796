oh how we miss you! My husband and I now live in Chicago, and are desperately trying to find a place that serves french cuisine like you do! Not only do we miss being able to bring in our bordeauxs, but your goat cheese tart, curried mussels, and creme brulee constantly have me searching for cheap flights back to the city. May you last for many many years to come, otherwise we might just have to bring you to Chicago.
