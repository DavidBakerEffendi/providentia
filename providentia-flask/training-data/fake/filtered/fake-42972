We had best indian dinner in this place . We were not sure what to order Â floor staff help us to choose our dinner . When food start comming from kitchen we got surprise . The way chef present food was far better then before so tasty chicken tikka masala , malai kabob , boti tikka , chicken vindaloo , goat , lamb pasanda . Fell like we are dining in Manhattan fine dining restaurant . Grate looks of food and taste very tasty . This place is must try indian restaurant in planesboro .
