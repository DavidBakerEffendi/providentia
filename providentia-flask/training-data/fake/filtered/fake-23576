Just left the spotted pig, where they should at least try to accommodate a new customer with a simple request  ... $21 for a burger with roquefort cheese and I'm asking them to substitute the cheese. Answer received? "It's been served like that for 10 years and it's never been a problem".  Mind you, there's a grilled cheese on the menu (so clearly another cheese is on hand) ... and they also offered to take the cheese off (I guess I should have my cheeseburger sans cheese). But apparently it disturbs the kitchen's flow to just throw a different cheese on a burger while it's grilling ... Unfortunately I cannot recommend this establishment (with seats so tight you might as well sit on your date's lap) ....so sad.
