bad food during non Phillies games days, they seem to bring in the top shelf food during the Phillies season, other teams (Eagles, Sixers and Flyers) fans suffer greatly.  Alcohol is pretty reasonable but the food prices are astronomical. Smoking is banned and the bartender gets really rude about it if you even have an unlit smoke in your mouth and gives you a tin cup to smoke on the sidewalk.  The place needs updating badly, the TVs for away games are a joke at best
