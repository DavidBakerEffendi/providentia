I've been here two years in a row for their Monster Bash Halloween party and both times the service was just abysmal. Last year we kind of gave them the benefit of the doubt because the place was SO packed you could barely move, but this time the bar Â was busy but by no means insane and it still took 15-20 minutes to get a simple beer. Most people appeared to be ordering shots or beers, which are the easiest drinks to pour, yet it still took forEVER to catch any bartender's eye (and there were three). They also limited how many beers you could order at a time, so we couldn't even stock up on the rare occasion we caught their attention. The last time we tried to get a beer we stood there at least 20 minutes and no one even looked at us, so we just left. No smiles or engagement from anyone who worked there. We came in awesome costumes wanting to have a good time, and left tired, bored and feeling very unwelcomed. Don't think we'll be returning for a third year.
