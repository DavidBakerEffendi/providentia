Caught up with an old roommate from home one night while visiting Philly and really enjoyed ourselves! We sat out by the fire pits and really enjoyed ourselves; it was a nice roof top escape in University City and gave us exactly what we were looking for after a long day. We split a couple of pizzas - the Pulpo Flatbread was our favorite as we'd never had grilled octopus as pizza topping and really liked it. The beer selection was just varied enough for us and we had fun sampling. Thought it was a great UC getaway spot!
