You will be hard pressed to find anyone that says this place isn't really good or the best for sushi in the city. For my taste at least, it's the best sushi on the island! Had a short conversation with Guy Vaknin, the owner, who was a contestant on Hell's Kitchen. He is super nice and explained everything. This place is vegan and even if you can't think of sushi without fish or crab or whatnot, you just have to try it out! He makes it feel like you aren't missing anything at all. This place is a must try, even if you are not vegan!
