Terrible service, pretentious place. Brooklyn Crab can't decide what it wants to be. What it wants you to think is that it's a casual, beach-side crab shack. If that were true, the stoner-slow service and chips of shell in the shucked oysters would be acceptable. No worries, bro, let's just look at the sunset and chill. But when they greet you with Tribeca-like attitude at the door and Midtown prices, any enthusiasm I might have mustered shriveled up fast. Want beautiful views and killer seafood without the drama and pretension? Go across the street to the Fairway Cafe.
