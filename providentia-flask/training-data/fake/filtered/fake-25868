Went for Mother's Day. They obviously overbooked. We sat at 6:40 for a 5:30 reservation. The host was so unorganized with the wait list written on the back of a ripped takeout menu. He was literally hiding from the front so he didn't have to deal from the multiple guests asking how long. We finally sat and ordered drinks/food. Our drinks,bread & salads came out fast, but then back to the wait. Our Entrees came out at 8:45. No apologies, no explanation. The waitress literally told my father that next year he can cook in the kitchen if he wanted the food faster. Our special day was ruined. The Host told us to just relax and have a nice day. I have never been treated so bad in any customer service situation. We were just another dollar sign. In no way did anyone care about our experience or if we ever come back. Obviously we won't be back.
