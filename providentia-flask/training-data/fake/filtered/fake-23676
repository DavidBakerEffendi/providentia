It's your classic small spot in NYC. There's a great bar scene upstairs and tables all around. It's good food-- the shoestring french fries are delicious! And a nice selection of appetizers and drinks. I thought it was too crowded on a Sunday-- so if you like crowds, you'll love this place. If you want to move around without hitting people, maybe go on weeknights or earlier than most crowds show up!
