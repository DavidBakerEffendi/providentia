Figs is a very nice BYOB restaurant to dine in before visiting the Philadelphia Museum of Art on one of those lazy Sunday mornings.  You can't beat the proximity - a half a block from the museum.  It's a small place but the food is excellent and reasonably priced.  The staff and owner are friendly and go out of their way to make you feel comfortable.  I recommend their crab benedict.
