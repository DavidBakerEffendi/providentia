What we had was average.  Had a chicken fajita wrap and mega fries.  This was a order placed in the establishment that took nearly 30 minutes to complete.  This was like 11:30pm at night and they were not busy at all.  There were no apologies nor did anybody offer to keep us abreast of the situation of what was going on.  This was our first time trying this place and more than likely last.  I was expecting a whole lot more saying that they were always busy.
