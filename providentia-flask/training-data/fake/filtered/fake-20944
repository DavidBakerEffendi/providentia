I heard good things about their fried chicken and was curious about their hot and extra hot chicken. I really enjoy hot and spicy foods but it also needs to be full of flavor. When it's only heat, it doesn't work nor satisfy. Â  Daring and willing to challenge my belly this day, I went with the Extra Hot and allowed them to kick it up. Danger Zone!!! So apparently extra hot is not the highest you can go but I went further...xxxxxxtra hot. Started with the drum, the spice immediately smacks me in the face, I drink my ginger beer, nibble on mac n' cheese and cornbread, then go back to polishing my drum and chopping up the breast piece to munch on. Things got easier after my tongue got used to the spice and I was able to take down the thigh (usually my fav chicken piece) with less suffering. All 3 pieces were cleaned off. Crispy and fried expertly well. I cautiously ate my chicken skins. The spice gets to be on the unbearable side (ghost chili is no laughing matter) but as you eat more and more, you will get used to it. Just like in life, DON'T GIVE UP and MOVE FORWARD. I was mainly afraid of ulcer or stomach problems since I foolishly didn't fill my gut with a hearty lunch earlier. Friendly service and delicious food. I wasn't too impressed by the gloppy mac n' cheese but that's only because I prefer it baked/ more solid rather than a pasta with cheese sauce. It definitely warrants a return trip!!
