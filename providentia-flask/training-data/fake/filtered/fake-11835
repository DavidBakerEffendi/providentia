So we decided to try this restaurant after learning our favorite west side Italian for delivery had closed... This restaurant is a perfect example of one that must engage in posting false reviews, because no one in their right mind would give this place a favorable review. I typically don't go out of my way to post reviews, especially negative ones, but this one deserves a few lines (or at least it will make me feel better after the gastronomic equivalent of being mugged). At nearly $100 for delivery for 2 persons, I would expect food quality at least better than my corner pizzeria. We ordered Veal Picatta and Fettucini Alfredo with a side of spinach. What arrived was a few pieces of shoe leather swimming in a soup [literally a trough of lemony broth] and a plate of wallpaper paste garnished with sad little frozen peas. The spinach was laden with burnt garlic, so it was bitter to the point of barely edible. All in all, it was one of those meals that you actually contemplate just pitching and reaching for the cereal box. Terrible and incredibly overpriced for the, eh hem, pleasure of enduring the experience.
