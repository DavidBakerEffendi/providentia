Ok,so i could not wait to try out Amis. this was everything I thought it would be. Its nothing less than what I would expect from one of Vetri's heavenly spots. I loved every part of my meal, especially Sal's meatballs ( sal is from what was told to me Vetri's dad and its his actual recipe). My pasta course was the Bucatini Amatriciana and it was to die for. Service was on key, and ambiance was perfect.
