My husband has been going to Villa since he was 9 and introduced me to this wonderful place back in 1996 and we have been regulars ever since!! Hands down the best Italian restaurant in the city. I have read these reviews and just want to add some of our absolute favorites that I have not heard mentioned and you absolutely must try: the shrimp scampi appetizer is to die for and make sure sure you dip your bread in the left over sauce-they'll give you more bread if you need it-it's so delicious!! Also the Baked Ziti Francis is my husband's favorite-baked ziti with chicken and veal-I honestly don't think he has ever tried any other entree,just delicious!! I have several favorites and you can't go wrong with any of them: Linguine w/clams in white sauce,chicken Lorraine(chicken with mushrooms-soo good), and of course you can't go wrong with the veal-any veal dish is great! Big portions, great atmosphere-the waitresses are so sweet,treat you like family,not an uptight kind of place. Go, relax,have a great meal,I promise once you try Villa di Roma,you will be going back again and again!!!! It's also a great place to go before or after a Phillie's or Eagles game-cheaper than buying food at the ballpark!!!
