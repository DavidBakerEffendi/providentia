One of best New York City restaurant experience. Meals are a-ma-zing! The service was great! Everything was so elegant, yummy and enjoy! I am living in Atlanta but if I do in NYC, probably it would be my fav place to get lunch and dinner. Food was always fresh, the waiters were great but the hostes. Anyway, this is was a great experience. So yes, yay! I'm a fan! Thank you Chef Michael Anthony!
