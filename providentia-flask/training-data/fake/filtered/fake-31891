On my first trip to "the Ocho" I was in and out, only staying long enough to down a refreshing cocktail in the stylish bar up front before continuing my quest of sophisticated Upper West Si-eed nightlife options -- places a little fancier that the typical Amsterdam Avenue draft beer dens thick with Jagermeisters and Jagermistresses. It seemed like a nice bar and I assumed the menu, heavy with ceviche options, was a hip, Latin take on bar food. On my second trip, the bar was packed and the hostess asked if I wanted to grab a table. Sure, I could go for a cocktail table tucked somewhere in the back of the bar. The only thing is the back of the smallish bar led to a smallish hallway which led to a cavernous dining room and there were even a couple of smaller dining rooms leading off the massive dining hall. It's so big and the front of the building seems so small, I felt like Alice in the Martini, er, Looking glass. Once settled I ordered two kinds of ceviche that were above average and a sampler platter. The only Spanish I know outside of the Spanglish lyrics to "Rico Suave" is what I have learned during my glorious career as a taco tester and Tex-Mex connoisseur. I never knew "sampler platter" is Spanish for a big-ass mountain of food. Or at least that's how it is translated at Calle Ocho. These weren't the best tacos on this planet, but far from the worst. All things considered, it's worth a trip for drinks or dining or both, unless of course, Lewis Carroll gives you nightmares.
