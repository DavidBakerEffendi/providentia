I came in during the lunch hour and i wanted some toppings on my chicken taboon laffa but the guy putting it together was so frustrated over the fact that i requested an extra ''fill it'' on my sandwich he actually sucked his teeth and went on to the next customer like I was nothing. Thank goodness the kind young man at cashier was attentive enough to quickly throw on gloves and easily complete my order as I requested. He even offered me a free freshly made desert as an apology for his coworker's miscue which I've buying everyday since. Despite the rude guy rushing people, My overall experience there gets a strong 4 stars due to that young man's customer first service and the food being delicious and fresh as advertised. However, I must say this place really needs to reconsider some of the people they have working in the front as they have either attitude and/or language barrier problems.
