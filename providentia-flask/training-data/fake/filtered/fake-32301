An excellent Italian BYOB in Morrisville.  Food, service, ambiance were all very good.  Waiting time was a little long, even after reservations, so this was the only drawback.  A nice place to go to get away from the Olive Garden, et al.  Good pizza and chicken parmesean, but I have yet to really delve into the menu.  Highly recommended!
