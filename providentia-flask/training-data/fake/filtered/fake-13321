I've been coming here for years and it has always been my town bar. I really thought I was going to need a new place after the new management took over, but I'm glad I stayed. I was there on New Year's Eve and it was the BEST time. It was like a high school reunion for me. I'm really excited for the next year, I was talking to the staff and they have so much planned for the place, never thought it would take that step. I would say give the place a chance. Btw yes they were the best blue balls I ever had. Â You will get the joke when you go.
