This is the way seafood used to be, back when it was always fresh. My first attempt to come here was foiled. They are closed on Mondays, word to the wise. But when I came back it was a different story. Good service, no wait, & fresh seafood. I like a place where they bring you a decent portion & you actually look forward to eating the leftovers. It's not a chore, it's a treat.
