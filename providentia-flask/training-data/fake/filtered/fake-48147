I was a Swift regular until last yr.  As can be seen from multiple reviews on the site, the service is rude and with no particular reason. (And I'm in my 40's so this was not due to prejudice against 'young' people or rowdy friends) While sitting at one of the booths nr the entrance, placards were very rudely placed by one of the extremely self important bartendresses(I know it's not a word) "reserving" our seats starting at  7PM.  We had ordered multiple drinks and I didn't appreciate her preemptive, pretentious power play.   Of course no one showed by 7 or 7:30. Plenty of great bars in the area with extensive beer selections.  If you need to get drunk near a pic of Jonathan Swift(author of Gulliver's Travels) then come here.  Otherwise go elsewhere
