I haven't been back to Melograno since it was located over at 22nd and Spruce.  But recently had a chance to revisit.  Enjoyed the food as we did when it was in previous location, but there was something about the old location we missed. I simply had the mussels and enjoyed it, and my husband ordered something that he always ordered in the old location (which was still on the menu), the bistecca fiorentina.  He enjoyed it, as he always did. Overall good dinner, but miss the old spot.
