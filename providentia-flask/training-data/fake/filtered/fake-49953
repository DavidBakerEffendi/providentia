In 1996 I was trucking in an 18 Wheeler and was at a warehouse just down the street from R.H. I ask the guy at the ware house while I was waiting to get loaded if I could find something to eat nearby. He recommended Rutt's Hutt. He said (The best burgers and Dogs you'll ever eat.) Now my wife had taken a week off to ride with me so we walked down a couple of blocks and there before my eyes was a parking lot full of Street Rods, Old Cars and a D.J. playing 50's music. I was in immediate Car heaven! So we went into the back side and a man behind the counter was yelling out (Hotdogs, Hamburgers Pepsi) so we ordered two burgers some Fry's and a couple of Pepsi's. The guy behind the counter said (Do you want gravy on those burgers) Now I had never had gravy on a burger so I thought what the heck, (sure I said.) That was the best burger I'd ever eaten and my wife agreed. We went out sat on the ground and ate with a smile on our faces. Then we strolled the entire parking lot checking out the cars. There were a lot of great people there, and it took me back to a time when I was a kid at the local A&W drive in back home, except the burgers were far better. I was so impressed I bought an R.H. T shirt.  A year later a friend was going to New York on business and I told him if he had some time to kill drive your rental car out to Clifton N.J. and find Rutt's Hutt. I told him the story, so he did and he called me on the phone and his words were ( Dude you were right about that place great burgers and dogs) Now I have not been back since, but in my younger days I was a touring Rock-N Roll musician and I have eaten in every kind of Restaurant and roadhouse you can think of. But Rutt's left me with a smile on my face and a place I would recommend for one of the best burgers or dogs on the planet. I hope the place is still the same. I hope to get back there one day. I would love to buy another medium sized T. Shirt   J.D. flint-n-quick@hotmail.com
