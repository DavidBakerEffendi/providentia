Ive been here many times and have had a great experience each time.  Staff is friendly, food is excellent, and the craft beer and liquor selection is very good.  I personally love that everybody knows everybody here which kinda reminds me of the Cheers atmosphere that you just don't find in all these pop up chain restaurants.  Prices are easy to swallow and plenty of TV's to watch so if your in the area or just looking for someplace new, check out Tavern on the lake and keep the mom and pop business going.    Last thing I will say is that they make great use of the outdoor patio come summertime.  There's always something fun going on whether it be a pig roast, beach party or live bands, Tavern is the place to be.
