I stopped in to Cake Over on a whim, having driven passed it on my way home.  I only discovered my gluten intolerance a few months ago, and being able to have rugelach (not to mention cupcakes!) is incredible!  My favorite food growing up was my grandma's rugelach, and the Cake Over rivals Bobi's!  Which is really saying something. And the low fat, gluten free red velvet cupcake tastes better than other bakery's full fat, gluteny versions!  The prices are standard bakery prices, nothing is overpriced to prey on those with food allergies.  The owner is really sweet as well, and very careful to make sure customers know every allergen in the food.  She has dairy free, nut free, and soy free options.  She also gave me and two other people shopping samples of red velvet cake while we decided what to buy.  After that taste, there was no way I was walking out of there without a red velvet cupcake! The chocolate chip cookies are fabulous, chewy and delicious, not too sweet and without that sandy aftertaste a lot of gluten free baked goods have.  The snicker doodles are crumbly and yummy, with the best snicker doodle flavor I've ever tasted. My gluten-eating Mom had a chocolate cupcake for dessert tonight, and she loved it.  So this bakery makes gluten free sweets just as good, or better, than the versions made with flour.  Add to that a wonderful owner and scrupulously clean, neat storefront and you have a really wonderful bakery.
