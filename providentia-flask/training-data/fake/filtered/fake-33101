This is a great place to hang out on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon. Friday and Saturday, forget about it unless you are into big obnoxious beer-bellied, testosterone-filled groups. Gets really packed. The wings used to be much better. Mine were soggy, cold and there was no carrots and celery to speak of.
