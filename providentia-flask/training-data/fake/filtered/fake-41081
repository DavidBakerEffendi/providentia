One of my favorite places in the city.  The pizza is so worth the hour long wait.  Take a seat at the bar or in the corner cubby with a drink and you'll be fine.  Lombardi's is also one of the few places willing to serve you a magnum of wine at a really decent price.  The perfect place for low key nights with good friends.  I would avoid delivery--I have been disappointed every single time.
