Now if you are a steak lover (like I am) then I highly suggest you check this place out the atmosphere is great the staff is well trained and professional and most important the food is GREAT! Prices are not that bad I would say average for a steak house but the variety of steaks they have is countless (well maybe 6-10) but you have the option of picking out a fresh hand cut piece of meat from the butcher and giving it right to the cook. Â Now that's fresh, I will defiantly go again
