If you've ever attended high school in Hamden, then you have been to Acropolis, known to everyone as "A-crop". Sure, the food isn't the best, but it is the best place to eat when it's two in the morning and there's nothing left to do. They serve everything at all hours, so you can get pancakes with a side of mashed potatoes or a steak with a side of bacon. There used to be a waitress there named Xue who was probably the favorite out of everyone I know, but they fired her. I will always miss her chant-like "NEED MOAR WATER?!". Some people may call it A-Crap, because the food isn't the best, but it certainly fills you up. if you need a place to go, GO TO ACROP.
