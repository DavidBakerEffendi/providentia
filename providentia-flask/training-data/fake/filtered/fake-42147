Looking for a great burger without the harsh lighting of the diners in the area I consulted Yelp and found Royale within walking distance. As stated earlier the menu is short and simple. My boyfriend and I both ordered the Royale with cheese. The burgers were cooked perfectly and served in plastic baskets with all the trimmings. I asked for extra pickles and agree with a previous review that they are pretty bland. The only other down side I saw was that 7.50 for a burger without fries or onion rings seemed a little steep for the neighboorhood. The music was great, and the server excellent. we will definately be back.
