Hero King has the BEST sandwiches both hot and cold in the state of New Jersey!!! While other footlong sandwiches aren't a full foot and include paperthin pre-cut processed meat, Hero King delivers AN ENTIRE footlong with the aesthetic of the fresh cold cuts being cut before your eyes. The service is timely and gloves are always worn when food is being prepared. If you are in Newark Hero King is a must!
