The fries were really great. The service was pretty cool. The environment was cool. I went new years day. The scene is definitely trendy, young, "hip". All kinds of people, diversity-wise. The food - Ok - WHY do people not know how to season beef? The patty was tasteless. Also, I asked for welldone and got medium well. I don't care if I don't have civilized taste. I dont like pink meat PERIOD! Also, my baby ordered a black and white and only got chocolate. There was clearly not any vanilla, and the person who made the drink claimed it was vanilla in there. So I dont know, she was dissappointed with that. But our waiter was really cool.
