On a snowy Saturday in December my friend and I randomly chose this place to meet up with some old pals from high school. This place was a warm and comfortable end to a freezing day of sightseeing. What a great night we had. The drinks were outstanding and the bartender was attentive and entertaining despite the fact that the placed was packed.  The cocktails were delightful. They were a fine mix of standard and inventive ingredients that would please almost anyone. The hostess found a table for our party of five at the exact time we asked for. The manager  chatted with us and discovered we shared the same hometown. He was a friendly and funny guy who proved himself beyond generous when he  presented us with a complimentary app at the bar and then further surprised our entire party with free dessert after a very tasty meal. The food was not tiny and beautiful, but rather, satisfyingly simple and pleasing to the eye.  Our only regret was that we could not come back for brunch on Sunday. If you are near Hell's Kitchen, go to Brickyard- you will not be disappointed!
