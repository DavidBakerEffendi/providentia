The fact that it's touristy doesn't mean that it's not good.  It's kind of how Skyline Chili in Cincinnati, Primanti Bros. in Pittsburgh, or Nathan's Famous in New York.  You do it right and you keep doing it right.  Someone else comes along and does it a bit differently and the locals like that as well - sometimes better.  It doesn't make the original a bad thing.  I still go to Pat's when I'm on the South Side, although I'll also hit up Tony Luke's or Jim's if I'm near there.
