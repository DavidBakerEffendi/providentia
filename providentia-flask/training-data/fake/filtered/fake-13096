invited to have lunch at mirchi. Initially with bit mixed thought I entered. But after taking few bited , i realized the difference. The starter with mouthwatering Â Chicken Tandoori was overwhelming..I enjoyed delicious Goat Curry and Biryani. . I was verymuch overwhelmed .A must place to go and try once, not get misguided by envious sarcastic critics.
