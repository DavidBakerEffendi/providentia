David was a superb host, and seated us within 5 minutes. There were 4 of us, just back from a photo shoot and walk through philly, on a Saturday night, and we just wanted a quite relaxing warm place to sit and catch up.. the tables were intimately woven together, 30-35 people max downstairs and 38 upstairs, but very comfotable. I had the Chicken/Lemon Capers and pasta, and Fiance had salad, our friends had the Raviolli and Gnocchi - excellent!.. was incredible! Ricotta in olive oil was refreshingly different.. BYOB .. service was quick and friendly.. David came by to check in, and kept our equipment and belongings securely stored away. Hour later we left thrilled and thought to have our Rehearsal dinner there.. 10/10
