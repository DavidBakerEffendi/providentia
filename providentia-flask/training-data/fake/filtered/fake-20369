My husband and I stopped in the Stone Arch to grab sandwiches for lunch to enjoy at a nearby orchard. He ordered a veggie sandwich with Swiss cheese and I ordered the egg and olive sandwich and asked that some lettuce be added to it. When we unwrapped our sandwiches 15 minutes later, we found that the cheese had been left off the veggie sandwich - which was now just some salad between two pieces of bread - and the lettuce was left off of the egg sandwich. Since we were no longer on the premises we could not have our sandwiches corrected and could only roll our eyes at the incompetence of a place that was not busy and could not get two simple sandwiches right. The bread was tasty.
