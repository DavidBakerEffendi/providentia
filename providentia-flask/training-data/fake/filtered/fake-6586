Love love love!  So glad that they're doing well, always packed, always delicious. I go at least once a month. Yes, the restaurant is small, yes parking is sometimes a challenge when they're busy (just park on the side street).  But the food is always good quality and creative.  They updated the menu late last year so there are a lot of new choices (if you haven't been in a while).  So definitely worth a visit any night of the week.
