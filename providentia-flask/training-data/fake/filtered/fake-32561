Everyday I go to Just Salad on 51st and Park  and pass Uncle Gussy's on the way.  The line is always at least 10 people deep.  Today while en route to Just Salad I decided to change course and try Uncle Gussys.  This was my first ever food truck experience.  I got the chicken over rice.  The chicken was all dark meat, very fatty and hard to chew.  I got grossed out after 1 bite.  I removed the chicken and just ate the rice with lettuce and tomato.  I will never go back to this food truck again.  The whole time while eating, I was thinking of what kind of food poisoning this meal is going to give me.  Not a good thought.
