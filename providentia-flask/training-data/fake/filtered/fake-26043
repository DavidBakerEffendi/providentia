As someone else mentioned, the sweet potatoe fries are great.   I loved the gumbo as it had great flavor.  The ribs were a hit but the bbq chicken was un-inspiring.  I really enjoyed the red rice and beans as it was hearty and flavorful.  My wife enjoyed the pulled pork platter and we both enjoyed the cole slaw with the red and green pepper.  Although, I enjoyed the food, I think that Black-eyed Sally's could be a little bolder with their spices and flavoring which I think would help them make a statement with their food.   Overall the waitstaff was helpful and attentive.  We saw Jeff Pitchell and the Texas Flood and they put on a great show.  Black-Eyed Sally's is a great music venue .
