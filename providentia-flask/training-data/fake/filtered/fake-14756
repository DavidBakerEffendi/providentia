I wanted to like it here and for the most part I did. The food was very good. Service was very good as well...almost to good / pushy. The waiter was very nice and very eager to please. To the owner.... Why are you serving Flip Flop as the house wine, why? The Benzinger, Beninger or Mondavi was just to much for you to buy. Please.....
