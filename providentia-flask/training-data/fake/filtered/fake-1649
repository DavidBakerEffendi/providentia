Service was absolutely horrible! ! ! ! ! Tried to give me a fake $10 bill. When I brought it to the attention of the older gentleman behind the counter he began to shout at me. I received my correct change in real money only after the man THREW it at me! Avoid at all costs. Horrible customer service! ! !
