This is one of the best family owned italian restaurants I have ever been to. The food is outstanding and the specials were so imaginative. Not only is the service excellent but the head chef came to our table to check on us which is always nice in such an intimate setting. With such great food and staff its no wonder why this place is packed with customers all the time. The poor reviews on this restaurant just go to show you that there are some people in this world that are impossible to please. If you are ever in the Caldwell area this place is a must to stop at for fine italian cooking.
