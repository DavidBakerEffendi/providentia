My date had won a $50 gift certificate here so we decided to try it out. He called in for reservations for two. He also asked about the dress code, to which they said they don't really turn people away. They just asked for no jeans, hats, etc. We got there about 5 minutes before our reservations and were seated right away. We're in our late teens so we were expecting not to get treated as seriously considering it's "fine dining," but the hostess was really nice. Shortly after, the waiter came by to order our drinks. My date got an iced tea and I got a shirley temple, both of which were no more than $4 each. I swear, we waited forever for the waiter to come back to order our food. He went to the table across from us with an older couple to take their order first even though they were seated after us. When he finally did, he told us that they were out of crab cake (which was what I wanted) so I asked him for recommendations. He went through almost the entire menu giving recommendations in each section (their menu doesn't have much of selection though). I finally decided on the rainbow trout. My date ordered the pork tenderloin. We also ordered a mac and cheese to share for $8. We finally got our food and I was actually pretty surprised at size of my dish. It was pretty good and filled me up. My date's dish was definitely smaller than mine and it didn't fill him up, but he thought it was really good. The mac and cheese came in a small bowl, but it was great. When we paid, they accepted the gift certificate without any issues and charged the remaining balance on a credit card. Overall, it was a good dining experience.
