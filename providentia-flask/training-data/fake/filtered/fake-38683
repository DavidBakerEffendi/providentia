Very small portions, but magnificent food.  Only one thing that I would advise against - the scallop appetizer.  It was flavorless and very expensive.  The wine recommendation was excellent.  Worth experiencing.  Excellent service.  Great for a romantic evening, especially if you ask to be seated upstairs.
