Went there today with two of my colleagues. Food was ok but please be beware the server cooks his own bill.There was a $4 charge on top of $40 for no reason.And then we left a $4 additional tip thinking the 4+4 is sufficient, the server chased us down the street asking for more tips saying if he doesnt get more tips he will quit the place and the place will shut down.Utter nonsense.My colleagues wanted to walk back and have a word with the owner but we were in a hurry.We surely will be paying him a visit soon.
