A bad experiEnce on the whole.  The chicken and corn soup was thin, with only  couple of small pieces of chicken.  The signature dish, highly recommended by the waiter, comprised, principally,  extra chewy chicken smothered in an orange-colored (??) unappetizing marinara sauce which no sailor would put in his mouth.   The signature dish was returned and replaced by a salad that contained tough steak strips and stems of dill among other greens. Dill stems are great in the curing of gravlax, but they had no place in a salad.  Some fennel  or onion or cherry tomatoes would have been welcomed, but . . . .  One star for the waiter and one for  the ambiance.  My wife, daughter and I will not darken Zinna's door again.
