I won a gift certificate for Fork through another wonderful place (Modern Eye in West Philly; they were holding a raffle for a benefit for animal health) and had the most wonderful dinner there on a recent evening.  Fork's vegetarian choices were absolutely superb.  The staff were wonderful.  Fork is a hidden gem on Market. It is a sophisticated, romantic, yet festive and relaxed place to dine.  I highly recommend it!
