Got cornbread to start which was nice, except for the bug in the butter, returned the butter never got new butter. Bathrooms were gross, my lady friend had no tissue in the ladies room, the men's room looked like it hadn't been cleaned in weeks. Ordered a chicken sandwich w/bacon and cheese, got no bacon or cheese, had to send it back. The waitress was like sorry just changed the menus, the cook didn't read it right.
