Easy 5 stars. I am astonished at some of the low ratings people give this place, I have witnessed none of the complaints they mention. Food: awesome. Great seafood, lots of interesting specials. They do everything well. Pricing: extremely reasonable. You can expect to pay in the low $20s for a really good entree with heaping portions. Probably 50% of what you'd pay in the city. Service: Hand-and-foot. Like an Old Europe style place where the minute you close your menu someone runs up to take the order. The person who begins her review "Service here is horrible!" was definitely in the wrong place. I might go so far as to say this was the best service I've ever gotten at any restaurant. Atmosphere: Old-world, very cool vibe. I'd give it 6 stars if I could. Note of caution: although very close to Newark Penn Station, not pedestrian-friendly as of this writing due to construction.
