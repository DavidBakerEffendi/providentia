We went to Belle gente last night and we will never go again . this is by far the filthiest dirtiest restaurant we have ever been to. We actually watched through an open kitchen door mind you, staff drop food off a plate pick it up and put it back and then serve it to a table. we have contacted the Verona health dept this place is sick !
