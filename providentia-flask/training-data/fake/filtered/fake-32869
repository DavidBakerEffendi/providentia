Very disappointing experience especially for a Jean-Georges restaurant!  There were  two in our party.  We had to ask the hostess if they had coat check.   She then directed us to the table closest to the front door.  It was the worst table in the restaurant.  We asked if they had something in the back and she said sure.  And we were led to a much nicer table. It took the waiter 30 minutes to take our wine order and open it.  The mushroom/avocado carpaccio was inedible.  The salads were fine and the sea bass was good, nothing special.  The service was my main complaint.  There was zero table management.  The waiter didn't seem tuned in at all.  Received more attention to detail from the water server. Would never go back to Perry St especially after a week of wonderful dining experience in other NYC restaurants.
