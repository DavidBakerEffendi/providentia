Their cheesestake had absolutely no taste WHATSOEVER!  I think the only seasoning they use is salt.  It sat in my stomach like a ball of steel.  The hole in the wall joints in Philly that barely even look like they are in business have the best cheesestakes by far!  Geno's only sells steak subs and they don't even provide a tasty product.   The other turn off for me was the fact they have posted "Let's take this country back" signs around the establishment.  "Speak English if you order at the window" signs are posted there.  They only sell steak subs there so it's not like the menu is complicated.  You only have one selection for God's sake!  What kind of bigot runs this dump? You will be more satisfied at McDonald's.
