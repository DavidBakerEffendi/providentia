Went into Bagels Plus today and was sooooo unimpressed. My friend and I walked in, asked for our bagels and we were really rushed while trying to order even though there was no line. My friend ordered her bagel and was not asked if she would like it toasted. When they handed it to her, she said, 'Did you toast it?" The 2 girls behind the counter looked obviously upset and said, "we're going to have to make you another one now." Then the one girl said to her co workers "does anyone want it?" When no one said anything she dumped it in the trash obviously pissed off. She was very rude about making the second bagel. You would think that it wouldn't kill her to OFFER toasting a customer's bagel since many people like their bagels toasted. We paid for our bagels and sat down at a table. My friend ordered a coffee, and when she went up to fill her cup, the coffee pot was EMPTY. My friend asked if there was any more coffee and the lady working there said, "Oh, do you want some?" OKAY DUH! SHE ORDERED COFFEE... obviously she wants some... After that it took forever for them to make a new pot, and when my friend got up to check on the coffee, they were very upset that she was asking for more. One of the workers clapped her hands loudly and said "ON THAT NOTE I"M OUT." All in all, the bagels were bagels. They were fine. But the service was HORRENDOUS. It was honestly disgusting how horrible the service was. While we were eating, the workers were talking and interacting with each other SO LOUDLY it was as if we weren't even there. It was a terrible experience thanks to the staff.
