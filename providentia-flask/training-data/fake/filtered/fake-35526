When we first arrived it seemed like a rough part of town, but the parking attendant made it more comfortable. When you first enter no one greets you or tells you where to sit down. It is dirty and not friendly service. We waited 15 minutes to get menus, and throughout the waitress barely gave us attention. Staff should have been dressed more professionally. Pizza came out fast, and was pretty delicious.     Modern is and hopefully always will be one of the best New Haven Ah-beetz. But a superior product deserves a more serious staff and attention to detail/cleanliness.
