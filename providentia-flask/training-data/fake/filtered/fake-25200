Bring back the old boneshakers!  We used to go to Boneshakers in the old location on Kingsland Avenue and were delighted with the delicious vegetarian sandwiches, laid back atmosphere, and down-to-earth feel.  When the location moved, little by little the changes started to become unbearable.  While the baked goods selection is better, the staff has become stuffy and rude.  We miss the place where we could sit down and drink our coffee without being shoved out the door to make room for the more pretentious williamsburg crowd.  Such a shame that we don't get to enjoy those stupendous S.A.G.'s (the amazingly invented vegetarian version of a sausage and egg sandwich) on Sunday mornings anymore, but we have found that it's just not worth it.  About the only perk of the new Champs is the more comfortable seating.  Some of the old staff is still around to remind us of how it used to be: the year-round Christmas lights,  board games and books about cycling, the elaborate sandwich menu modestly handwritten in pink chalk.  Now if you attempt to sit an extra second to read a book or do some work, you get kicked out (if we wanted a no computer policy on weekends, we would just go to manhattan!).  It used to be something special, a gem in an otherwise desolate area.  Now it has become just like everything else - hasty, impersonal, soulless.  Come back, Boneshakers, we miss you.
