My boyfriend and i live right next to Umai Umai, so we always go there for their incredible sushi and amazing atmosphere. We tried Domo tonight looking for another good sushi place in the neighborhood and were VERY disappointed! The food was no where near the same quality as Umai and the service was even worse! Nothing tasted fresh at all and the lights were so bright i felt like i was in a high school cafeteria. we showed up around 8:45 and the entire time we felt like the staff was trying to get us to leave so they could go home. We sat at the bar so we could watch the 2 guys make sushi, but not even halfway through our meal did they make us move to a table to they could "clean" the sushi bar at 10:30 pm. We did not have a good time and we will never go back. Umai is the best sushi north of ben franklin. period. Domo is no where near the quality and experience you will get at Umai Umai!!!
