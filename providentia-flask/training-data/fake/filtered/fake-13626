We couldn't wait for this place to open, and it did not disappoint. The atmosphere is very cozy with reclaimed wood featured throughout the space and a huge window at the front of the room. The music is set at a comfortable volume and the lighting is warm. Our first visit, we tried the beets appetizer (recommended by the neighborhood blog) and the prosciutto pizza. Both were excellent. The sea salt really brought out the flavor of the beets and the wood fired oven provided a tasty char to the pizza crust. Our second visit (in less than a week), we tried the leek pizza and the minestrone. Again, both were excellent. Notably the pizza was had the same perfect char as before. Like Costello Plan (same owners), the menu is concise, but every item is well planned and delicious. The chef also clearly tried to avoid cannibalizing business from Costello Plan (i.e. the menus have very different flavors and offerings). A new addition to our standard rotation of dining out, along with Purple Yam, The Farm on Adderley, Costello Plan, The Dogwood and  Oxcart.  We live in the area, but this place is worth a trip on the train.
