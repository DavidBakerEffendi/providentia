My girlfriend and I were taken to Wafa's by some friends while we were visiting queens. The thought of having some hummus made our mouths water. Once we arrived, we were greeted by a smile and my friends who seemed to be regulars were involved in casual conversation with the owner. She was extremely friendly and very helpful, allowing us to taste some dishes before ordering them. We had the hummus (which is heavenly), Chicken Shawerma and Mousabaha (heated for one minute only leaving it not hot or not cold). All three dishes were heavenly and adequately spicy. I definitely recommend this place for anyone visiting and will surely return if I am ever in queens...
