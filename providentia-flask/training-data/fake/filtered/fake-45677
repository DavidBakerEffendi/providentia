I am happy with the Jersey diner.   I have been there quite a few times. I like it as it is new,  They seem to be trying hard to please.This area needed a  diner. We have mostly chinese and Pizza here.  It is very close to home for us and we have found the food good. I enjoy  seeing so many local people  there.  It reminds me of a small town resturant as we  always meet people we  know there. Anyway it is clean , the food is good, and we will go often.
