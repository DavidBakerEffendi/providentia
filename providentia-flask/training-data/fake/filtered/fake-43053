Came with a medium sized group (8) to celebrate a friend's birthday.  The service was very slow.  Half of us were served, and it was 10 minutes before the remainder of our order's showed up.  Somewhat cold. Maybe it was an off-night, but how hard is it to serve 4 couples, ordering straight from the menu with no special requests.  Maybe we should have sat on the bar-side where a baseball game was playing a little too loud and ordered apps and beer.  It wouldn't surprise me if they made a decent burger. My thought: at $20 per entree, this restaurant comes up short..
