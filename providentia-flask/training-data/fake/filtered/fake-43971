So last night with a $20 bill in hand I tryed ordering a drink when I first sat down at the bar. 3 toolbag, trendy, doucher bartenders all looked at me, yet not one of them came over to ask what I wanted for at least 5 minutes, not 4 minutes 5. I would have walked out but it was 10 degrees outside. Finally the female bartender walked over and asked me what I wanted, you know the one with the tight pants on that were 3 sizes to small? She took my order for a vodka soda, and after asking for Stoli she went ahead and poured well vodka and it was the worste drink I ever had in my life. The service was horrendous, almost as bad as the tv show. Oh, and I would have sent the drink back, but why would I when I could just come home, grab my laptop, log in to yelp and tell other Philadelphians to never make the mistake I did by walking in to that terd hole.
