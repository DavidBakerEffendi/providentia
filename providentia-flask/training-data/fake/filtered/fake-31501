First off let me start by saying DONT GO HERE!!! The restaurant is pretty small, tables are right next to each other. You can literally hear the people next to you! UGH how annoying! The waitress was Rude, and VERY slow. We waited 20 mins for drinks, and 40+ mins for our food. LIke Really?! Then I mentioned to her how I didnt like the service and she just disappeared!!! All of a sudden we get a new waiter, who by the way was awesome, but how do they change waiters without informing us! how rude is that! then we get our silver wear and they're filthy! YUCK!! how is this "fancy" restaurant providing their customers with dirty silver wear... Â However, the food was decent. The drinks ok, nothing special. So after all this drama, I get to speak to the manager who was nice and provided us with 2 rounds of free shots, and free desserts. Our experience was horrible and we wont return here... You wont be missing out on anything special here!
