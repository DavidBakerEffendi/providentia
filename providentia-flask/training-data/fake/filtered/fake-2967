FOOD WAS EXCELLENT with a lot of flavor! had the mango chicken and ensalada Miami. delish! byob the only thing I did not like was the customer service. they rushed us out. were rude and annoyed that our party of 5, 2 people were late, did not take reservations, over packed, the manager did not care if you are a paying customer, manager and another customer got in a verbal fight which made it really uncomfortable. aside from that, food was amazing 5 stars for the food, 1 star for the other commotion
