My wife and I stopped into Mac Attack last week form dinner. She had the traditional 3 cheese grilled cheese and I had the Reuben Mac. I will have the agree with previous reviews. I was skeptical at first, but the Reuben Mac was unbelievable. I would come back just for this. My wife liked the mix of cheeses on the grilled cheese. The Parmesan added a new twist to a classic. We split the Nutella grilled cheese with mascarpone on brioche. A little sweet for me, but my wife loved it! Great new restaurant for Montclair.
