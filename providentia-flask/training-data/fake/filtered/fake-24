Bangkok Gardens is located right by 3 or 4 other Thai restaurants, but in my opinion, is the best one. Thai Taste, which is right around the corner, is probably the most popular and well-known, but I find their food to be inferior to Bangkok Gardens. The drunken noodles are Bangkok Gardens (with shrimp), are probably the best I've ever had anywhere. Their pad thai is far better as well. Their broth-y noodle soup specials (I forget the exact names) are bland and not very good, but everything else I've had, like their curries, are authentic and tasty.
