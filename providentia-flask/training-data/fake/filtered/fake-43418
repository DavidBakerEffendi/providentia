This place is terrible. I came back again to give it another shot and was let down once more. Servers are friendly but that's about it. The food was not that great for what I paid and took forever to reach my table. They nickel ad dime you for every little thing possible. Charged me an extra 3bucks for adding lettuce tomato and onion on a sandwich and didn't find out till the bill came. Small lady in the front who acts like she owns the join was very rude when I asked her what the extra charge was for. Will not be returning
