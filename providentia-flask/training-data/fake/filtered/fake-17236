Andros diner is my favorite diner in the tri-state area! As a NJ native, I ate there all the time with my family & friends! The disco fries with my friends late night are out of this world! I moved to NYC 19 years ago & Andros is STILL my GO TO Restaurant!!!! The service, specials & the feeling of "home" you get everytime you walk through its doors is something that I would DO just about anything to bottle!!!
