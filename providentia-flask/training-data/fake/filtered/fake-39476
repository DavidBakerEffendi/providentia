This Stephen Starr restaurant had to be his worst.  The food is pricey and not good.  There is a good German beer selection.  The condiments were good.  I will not return because of the food and the atmosphere alone.  I feel like I am at a music festival with bad food, annoying people and got ripped off.   The saurkrat wasn't sour and the red cabbage was soggy.   The giant pretzel was mediocre but it was drown in cheese.  I felt that the restaurant is out of place in the neighborhood.  We wanted to leave so badly that we refused the waitstaff's free round of beer because we couldn't wait to eat good food from across the street.  I expected better than this from Starr.
