I ordered pizza for delivery from this place about a week ago. I called and ordered one artichoke pizza, and they said ok and everything was fine- then they told me the total was around $50-60. I was shocked because I had looked at the menu and the prices ranged from $20-40, but maybe there is some weird $20+ delivery charge that they didn't explain to me. Before I could get in a "hey, wait-" they hung up. So, I called back to cancel my order before they started to make it, because I really could not afford ONE pizza that was THAT expensive. So I called the same number, which was in my phone under "recents" so I know it was the same number. I told them I had just called and gave my address and said I'd like to cancel because I could not afford it. The same guy (I recognized his voice) laughed, yes he laughed, and said "Ok buddy, I think you have the wrong number" and hung up on me. I called again and the same thing happened. They tried to deliver the pizza but I wouldn't have it. Very poor way to take a rejection or cancelation and a pizza made for nothing. Poor service and rudeness over the phone.
