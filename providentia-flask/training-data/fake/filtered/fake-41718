My girlfriend loves taking me here! At first I was quizzical as it wasn't one of the amazing places that I take her to eat. When I sat down I was explained the menu and everything on it changes WITH what is in season so everything is fresh...alwAys! Major point! The only reason why I cannot give a five star is because the paint is bigger than the canvas. They serve you everything on a small wood plank and for messy eaters like my girlfriend makes for a bit so awesome white dress sorry guys ;)
