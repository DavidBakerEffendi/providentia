I've been there 4 times in the first 2 months of it's inception. The menu is already being revamped which I always think is a mistake that quickly. I've always sat at the bar and had good service. I would like the 2 bartenders to decide if the are taking a side each or if they are both servicing EVERYBODY. Last time my friend and I DID have to wait a long time to place an order. The two girls were NOT busy- they just were confused on who was working where. No big deal. There will be growing pains and we will be back. GO Yankees!
