I know from seeing this hands on, behind the counter view. I have ties to all of these employees.Their bagels are usually hard, especially if the short Mexican is baking them. They never wash their hands, especially after using the bathroom. They do drugs while working. Everything always seems to Â be blamed on the "immature" workers, but the fault lies within the owner of the store..who on multiple on occasions has harasses his employees and clients (even sexually). He is a pervert and he has very bad anger issues and verbally abuses everyone in that store. Their are vomit from flies in your COFFEE. You don't see it because they scoop it out with a spoon. When you aren't looking, they shoo away the mice running behind the counter and all over the bagels and the bins. There is a mice in the flour that they use to bake the bagels. Not sure how he passes inspection every time, but its probably because the Mexican dude flirts with the health inspector. They mess up on orders all the time, especially the owner because he always thinks hes right. He will refuse to get on the phone with anyone who wishes to speak to him, even if you ask to speak to him in person. He does not care about his clients, his employees, or his hole in the wall business. Buyer beware. Do not go here. It's just not worth it. Good luck. I learned my lesson.
