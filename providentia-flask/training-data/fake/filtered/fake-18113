I have been to Estia on three separate occasions and I had consist meal with each visit.  The atmosphere encompasses that mediterranean feel that is works so well with the food.  If you catch a nice evening the accordion windows will be open allowing for a nice breeze to pass through.  The grilled octopus is fantastic as well as fish.  My only gripe is the sardines offered for the appetizers were way to salty and it masked the flavor of the fish.
