Best breakfast spot in essex county. Even though they have other food, the breakfast is my favorite. The food is great!!! I usually get the pancake platter but have had just about everything from here and I have never been disappointed. It can get pretty busy at times so it might be smart to call your order in. But I must say they handle a crowd pretty well and in a "reasonable" time if you see how many people come in. I enjoy dinning in because I enjoy my food hot and I'm too impatient to wait to drive back home. It is in the heart of Newark, but don't be scared of the "locals" they are just doing the same as you (Get A Great Meal). They also sell other health products like natural cleansing teas and pure honey, etc. Â And My Goodness, who dirty fingers posted the picture of that UpTown?!?!? That does not speak well for this place. It is pretty clean
