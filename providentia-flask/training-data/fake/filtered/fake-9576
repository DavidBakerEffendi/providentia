Although the food was quite well, i was very displeased by the wait. Not only were we lied to we had to wait outside. They told us it would be a 15 minute wait but we waited outside in the 30 degree weather for a minimum of a half hour. Then once we were inside they squeezed us at a table that was set for two but we had three. Space was very tight. On the plus side the breakfast we had was very good, especially the waffle. Overall, the experience was ok, about a C+.
