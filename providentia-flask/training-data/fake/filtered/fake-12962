I do not know what those people got when they grated this place with more than 1-star. The place is overbuilt. Quality of food and service are not even close to what you would expect out of places look like that. Prices are way too high for nothing special. Bread was supposed to be their specialty. When my wife and I Â sat down, a small basket with a very small section of dry bread was brought to us. We asked for fresh bread. Waiter brought back basically the same old & dry bread. We gave up on bread. Ordered a fish dish for $23. It came on a small plate with a piece of about 5"x2" fish. Worst of all, it tasted extremely un-fresh. Ordered some desserts. Nothing impressive but pricey. That was our first time visiting the place. No desire to go back for as long as we can remember it. NOT recommended.
