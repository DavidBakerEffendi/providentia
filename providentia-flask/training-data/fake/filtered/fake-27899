Ok i lived in Italy for a year..I was not particularly a fan of pizzas until i went there and when i left i vowed italian food would never taste the same again anywhere else. I came to lucali to test out the hype and was wary..but let me tell you..Lucali pizza is the closest thing i have ever tasted to that of the authentic italians...definitely a fan now!
