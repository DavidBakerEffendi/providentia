Bought their 'deal of the day' on the Vermontopia site last month knowing that their calzones are a great value.  Well tried to redeem my gift certificate valued at $25 and Ramunto's changed the terms. Not cool folks. We were told that we had to redeem the entire coupon in one visit. That is not listed as one of the restrictions on the coupon.  My husband and I can not eat $25 worth of calzones in a week!!! We were told that we can use the whole certificate on what was going to be a $16 tab...that's not the DEAL I paid for. Lousy service and POOR management.
