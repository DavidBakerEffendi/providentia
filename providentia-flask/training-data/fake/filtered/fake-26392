Extremely busy on a Monday night, which made it loud.  We sat in the back with several other parties.  The server came promptly to take drink orders.  I ordered a rose and she asked "still or sparkling".  I chose sparkling which was very nice.  Others had white wine by the glass, beer and a bottle of sparkling water.  I was undecided on an appetizer between the escargots and something else and she suggested the escargots in hazelnut butter sauce, which were somewhat reminiscent of my favorites from 'back in the day' at Blue Angel only they didn't come in a proper copper pot.  But they were delicious and the sauce was perfect for dipping.  Another chose the Salade Lyonnais typically made with frisee lettuce, lardons and a poached egg.  Tres French !!  I chose mussels in white sauce, another had the beef daube, 2 had seared scallops.  Once our entrees came, our server disappeared and never asked if we wanted another drink.  We ordered profiteroles with ice cream, some kind of nougat thing with figs and assorted ice creams.  Everyone was happy with their meal but not blown away.  The prices seemed reasonable but I didn't pay the bill so I'm not really sure.  In future, I would probably come for a drink outside and escargots to snack on, probably not a sit down dinner.
