It's amazing how a restaurant can regress after national exposure on Food Network's Restaurant Impossible.  Having a home in nearby West Windsor, Vermont, we thought it would be fun to try out a restaurant that had a makeover.  Were we ever surprised.  The decor was absolutely nothing to write home about since having compared the show to the real thing.  The owners brought back some tacky decorations that added absolutely nothing.  The young man that was our server was a delight telling us about his experience with RI.  The food was plain and bland.  As a regular traveler to Mexico (not the resort areas, I might add), this is no where near Mexican.  Save your money and go elsewhere.  There are many, many worthy choices in the Upper Valley.
