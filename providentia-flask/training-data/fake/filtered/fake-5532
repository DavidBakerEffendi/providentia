We love LIC Market and are so thankful that it's in the Court Square area.  They have a cozy and charming space, outstanding service that is friendly and knowledgeable, and the meals are always delicious and inspired.   For dinner, we found the portions to be a little small for us -- so we ended up splitting a few additional dishes amongst the table.  But for brunch the portions seemed larger and more filling which was nice. Whenever we have guests in Long Island City we always send them to LIC Market because you just can't go wrong there.  I may even go as far to say it's the best restaurant in Long Island City...
