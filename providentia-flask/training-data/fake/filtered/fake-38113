As a vegetarian I only get to enjoy the aromas of some of the city's best burger joints, here I get to enjoy my favorite veggie burger. The veggie cake sandwich, to be exact, is paired with a mound of sweet potato and regular french fries, it's glorious. Always good beers on draft, and the entire staff strive to keep it a low-key fun bar. "Don't Stop Believing" will get vetoed on the jukebox to keep the local popped collar crowd from taking over. Always recommend this place, but seating is limited so expect to wait at peak times. Lunch is my favorite time to go.
