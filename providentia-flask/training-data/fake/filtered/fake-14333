Customer service is key!!! Let me start by saying that I have been to this restaurant multiple times and the food is always great! Tonight my boyfriend and I decided to stop in for dinner. I ordered the Jamaican Jerk Chicken and he ordered the Buttermilk fried Chicken breast. When the food arrived at the table I was disappointed to see that the chef had changed my dish from two chicken breasts to a mixture of breasts and legs. Although it was not as appealing as before I continued on with my meal. Only a few bites in I discovered a piece of plastic mixed within the chicken. I was immediately turned off to my meal and lost my appetite. When the waiter arrived at the table I showed him the piece of plastic. He was very apologetic and offered me a new meal. Not even a minute after he left, the manager of the restaurant came to the table to apologize, and told us the dish will be taken off the bill. Although my meal was not as great as I had hoped, the customer service was wonderful and made up for it!
