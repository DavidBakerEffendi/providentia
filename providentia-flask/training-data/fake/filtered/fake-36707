I must say that I was a little nervous to try this place out after reading some of the negative reviews on here, but my experience was nothing but pleasant.  Went here for drinks on a Thursday night, and sat outside.  Although we didn't order any food, our waitress, Jessica, was attentive and kept the drinks flowing.  Many of the outside tables were full but we never felt rushed or pressured to give up our table.   I think it's important to keep an open mind about the crowd anywhere you go, as the whole point of living life is being open to new experiences.  The great thing about the piazza is that it's full of an eclectic mix of all different types of people.  How boring would it be to go somewhere and only see people that all look just like you!? Overall, great for drinks and I will definitely go back to sample the food!
