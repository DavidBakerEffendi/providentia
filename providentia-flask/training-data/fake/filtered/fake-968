Went here on a first date. Although a reservation was made, they seemed a bit unorganized in seating and kept asking for my date's last name when we were sitting down.  Great vodka margarita, very strong but didnt taste overbearing.  Guacamole was good, above average but nothing to write home about. The food was delicious, chicken tacos and pork enchiladas as well as a chicken appetizer. Biggest complaint of the whole night was the seating arrangement. had to move everytime a server walked by, and had we been not 2 normal sized people we would have been in trouble!
