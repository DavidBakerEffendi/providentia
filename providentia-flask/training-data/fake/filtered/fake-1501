I've only eaten here once... and it was amazing... i mostly go in to be entertained by kip or gorge the bartender, they make sure to make you feel that they are happy to serve you, very knowledgeable about everything they serve... i would be in there all the time if i could afford it... its just Little too pricey for my likes... i quote from another review that describes alot of places in this city... 5 based on the food.  3 based on the cocky.......  4 is the average.  If all you care about is food then go.... its high quality.  Expensive but high quality.  Great beer selection too.  A bit pricey for my likes
