The food is fantastic and the owners are so charming, you feel like you are at a friend's house for dinner.  Was there the other night (late August) and our salad was fresh-picked that day from their garden, as were many of the ingredients in the Hungarian Fish Chowder, Vegetarian Sarma and Chicken Paprikash.  The flavors are not entirely familiar but straightforward and hearty, I felt truly nourished when we left.  The chef and waitress are the owners and always are interested in their guests, they want to find out who you are and how you heard about their restaurant, but they have such a warm and casual spirit you never feel like they are intruding, in fact it was difficult not to ask them to sit down and join us (we certainly ordered enough food to feed a few more people... but we wanted to taste several things and take the leftovers home, which I highly recommend doing).  They are a very interesting couple, but back to the food.  The chicken was so tender and rich-tasting, probably because it's slow-cooked in a home made broth (or gravy - lighter than most gravies though full of flavor which saturated both chicken and accompanying potatoes).  The Hungarian Fish Stew broth was also light and delicious.  I feel that too many restaurants rely on butter and heavy cream to make their dishes rich and flavorful, this place doesn't need those crutches - I don't think there was heavy cream in anything we ate.  My favorite was the Sarma (stuffed cabbage), made with home-cured sauerkraut leaves stuffed with a mouth-watering combo of vegetables (you can get it with beef as well, but I thought the vegetable version was scrumptious).  We were too full for desert but they brought us complimentary candy from Serbia. Going to the Balkan Restaurant is a guaranteed pleasure - for your taste buds, your stomach and your mind.
