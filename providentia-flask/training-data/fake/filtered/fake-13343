We love Kimchi Grill/Taco! We recently used their food truck for our wedding reception and we were super pleased with this business. Tina helped us w designing a menu, sampling the food and setting everything up.  Every question and concern was attended to.   Our reception was the weekend after Hurricane sandy and needless to say, our guest list changed at the last minute.  Tina was able to accommodate to these changes. The service on the reception day was impeccable. The staff was organized, efficient and friendly. The food was great and our vegan guests had their culinary needs met too - There was a separate batch of vegan kimchi set aside for them. A week after our reception, Tina emailed us to inform us that we overpaid and sent the extra money back...unbelievable!   Recommended dishes: rice gnocchi, beef nachos, and the edamame pancakes. We wish we had a chance to eat more of these dishes :) Please stop by their store front or their truck stand and support this great business.
