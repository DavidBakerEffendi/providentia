We went to the Cookshop this Sunday to celebrate a *big* birthday for my husband.  We were a party of 6, and the waitress was outstanding!  (I wish I had gotten her name, so that I could give her a shout-out here.)  The food was fantastic from the appetizers to the entrees to the desserts.  We were treated like royalty the whole time even though they didn't know it was a special occasion until we left.  We had to wait just a bit for our main course, but we were busy in conversation and really weren't upset about it, but our waitress apologized profusely and made up for it in spades.  I highly recommend the Cookshop for a special occasion or any occasion.
