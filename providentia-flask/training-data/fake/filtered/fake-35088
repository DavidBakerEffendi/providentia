It was my family first time to eat here. We did enjoy their food. We ordered Â bento-box for my daughter. She so likes it. My wife and me ordered 4 rolls. I can't forget about black bear roll and coco shrimp lobster roll. We just moved from California .. My wife made good idea to come here. Nori will be our sushi place. .
