Having heard great things about this place I was very excited to try it out. However everytime I have gone there the hostess seems to take pleasure in informing me of a 2 hour wait. I understand if there is a wait however a bit of empathy goes a long way. The food IS excellent and the service is good. Loved the bleu cheese iceberg salad and the ribeye steak. Wasn't crazy about the truffle mash though, a little too salty. When is this fascination with truffle oil going to end, when you put truffle oil on food thats all you end up tasting.
