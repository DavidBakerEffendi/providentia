Cozy little place. The artwork on the outside was tastefully done and very interesting. We ordered two appetizer's . The first order was Coconut Shrimp, nice size shrimp lightly breaded with this amazing creamy coconut sauce. I will be getting these again! The second Â appetizer was Peanut Butter Dumplings. Yes, you did hear that right. Completely worth a try if you are a peanut butter fan, as I am. I really enjoyed the Newark specialty roll. Nice and fresh, crunchy large roll. I really wish I lived closer to this place. Staff was very kind and attentive. I just wish they had soda on the tap. Not a big fan of drinking soda out of the can.
