This place is beautiful, intimate, and the service is great. They truly captured the warm beautiful feeling of Italy. Â DO NOT LISTEN TO VELMA. G SHE SOUNDS LIKE A PERSON WHOM LIKES TO DINE FOR FREE BY MAKING FALSE COMPLAINTS. I went there twice now and both times it was amazing. Great place to impress that special someone. The hospitality and the was topnotch they really made your feel like a VIP. The owner went to every table to ensure satisfaction. The presentation and plating of the food was pleasing to the eye and tasted as good as it looked, full of flavors to drive your senses crazy. I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone with whom loves great food and atmosphere. Must spread the word. I wish them many long years of success.
