Loved this place as soon as I walked in! The d√©cor is far beyond what I expect from a strip mall sushi spot. The wait staff is fast and friendly and know the menu well (which is good for me because I always ask for recommendations). Food at this establishment tops almost every other place in the greater Trenton area. The all-you-can-eat lunch menu is a phenomenal deal ($18 per guest) and the food comes out fresh to order. I have been to Masa perhaps ten times now, and I have never needed to complain about the freshness of the fish/eel in my rolls. And the thing that finally sold me in was the price! I have never been billed more than 20 dollars at this place, and it never ceases to amaze me. For the quality of food/service that I get here, I would easily be happy to throw away thirty. (Of course, if that were to happen, I would have to give them four stars)
