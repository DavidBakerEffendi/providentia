I've been here several times since the ownership change can't stay away! Incredibly peaceful atmosphere. Clean and beautifully decorated. The food is bursting with flavor and is expertly presented. Our servers were very friendly and attentive. The prices are reasonable and Ratchada is also a BYOB. Try the Laab Tuna, Laos Sausage, Tulip dumplings, Crispy Catfish, any of the curries, Catfish Stuffed Eggplant among others. Seriously, anyone we've invited to this place has fallen in love with it. I don't think there is a nicer dining experience in the area, especially considering the prices. Also, we usually can find free parking within a block.
