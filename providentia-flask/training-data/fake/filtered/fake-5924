Me and my date left so full. First we started with the Red Sangria. It was really strong so I think it was worth the dime. At first we were disappointed that there were no pitchers of Sangria but I can understand why. One is all you need! Then we were told to order several per person. It made sense because when the dishes came out they were on the smaller size (tapas size) so you needed /could have a variety of options in one dinner. We love trying new things so it was nice to be able to order the Paella, Short Ribs, Soft Shell Crabs, Foie Gras, Scallops, Fried Goat Cheese, the Risotto and also believe it or not Brussel Sprouts. I heard the sprouts were good but I didn't think I'd be raving over sprouts. Definitely returning soon.
