We went the Blue Elephant again.  I just love this place.  Just when I thought there's no way a restaurant could get any better, they surprised me with their seasonal special.  I love that they have seasonal specials and that the produce they get are locally grown..which tells me that not only are their foods delicious...but they are socially responsible.    Anyway...I tried the Thai beef stew...WOWSER!!  first it was very nicely presented...and the aromatic beef stew was slowly cooked with cinnamon, clove, and thai spices.  So much pleasant things going on my tastebuds!!  My friend tried the curry pumpkin..and she was very happy. I just introduced her to Thai food...and I think she is going to be a regular at the Blue Elephant Trail.  Again, thanks for the great meal, and a great time!  Keep up the good work!!
