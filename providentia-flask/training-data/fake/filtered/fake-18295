So glad there's more food choices in Princeton and an Italian market is well needed.  Reminds me of those great food stalls in the Italian markets in South Philadelphia.  Loved the breaded and pounded oh so thin chicken cutlets.  Was a hit with the whole family. Anyway, welcome D'Angelo's along with the new food offerings on Palmer Square - especially the cheese shop - Olsson's Fine Foods.
