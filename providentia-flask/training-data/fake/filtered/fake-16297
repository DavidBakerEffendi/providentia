I ordered a buffalo chicken sandwich. Waited a solid 15 min to find out they made a bbq chicken sandwich. After the cashier asked which i ordered, it took them another 10 minutes. No "sorry about the wait." Nothing. Wanted a beer while I waited also. $5 minimum credit card charge. They couldn't even waive $4.50 for my wait.
