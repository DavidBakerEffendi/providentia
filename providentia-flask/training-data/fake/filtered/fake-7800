Ah Geronimos. My all time favorite restaurant/bar in New Haven. The Spicy Blood Orange Margaritas? Absolutely to die for. The frybread? Hands down the best thing that I have ever eaten. But awesome food aside, I have to say that my favorite part about Geronimos is the staff. If you ever have the pleasure of having Hugo as your waiter, trust me...you will be back. I ask for him exclusively whenever I go. Nobody makes you feel more like family than this guy. He is honestly the happiest, nicest person I hve ever met in my life. I actually take my picture with him and send it to my friend who loves Hugo as much as I do. Anyway, food is awesome, atmosphere is awesome, drinks are awesome. The only thing that's a bummer is sometimes there are super long wait times to get a table, which is totally understable. If you're reading this Hugo, we love you!
