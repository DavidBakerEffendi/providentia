I was excited to see a Thai place in SO and I will say it wasn't bad but it wasnt' great. I feel the menu is too sushi based and doesn't offer many thai options. The portions are small too and can be bigger. The price point is okay. I wouldn't say I won't go again but I feel they can offer more selections on the thai food side, I felt the menu was all sushi etc. The atmosphere was nice, they did a nice job decoration
