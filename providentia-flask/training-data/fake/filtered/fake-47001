I frequent Agno once or twice a week for lunch. Everything I've gotten has always been pretty delicious. However, they now seem to be experimenting with the menu. Â I prefer Agno over their sister store Pure Fare because Agno offers more hot food items. But with their experimenting, things have changed a bit with a lack of notice. While the rice and protein options are still warm, all of Agno's topping are now served cold. This pretty much leads to a cold lunch (since you get three toppings in a bowl), which I'm not a fan of except when I'm craving a salad. I wish I realized this before I ordered my meal. I probably won't be returning.
