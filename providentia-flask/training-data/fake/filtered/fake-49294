I just go for the bubble (tea) coffee...the iced vietnamese coffee with extra bubbles is amazing! If I'm spending $4.50 I'd take this over a frappuchino anyday. Bubbles are usually pretty good, but on the oversweetened side, so you might want to tell them to hold the sugar until you taste it. My only complaint? They don't have splenda or artificial sweetner, so if you're not a sugar fan there are no options. Small cute place, better for takeout than hangout.
