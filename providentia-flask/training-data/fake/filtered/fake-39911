Great tasting freshly brewed beers... Food was good for "Pub Food". I would not recommend going there for a meal. But a great place to stop before or after a night on the town. Be sure to check out the Burly Irish Ale and the Irish Stout, 2 of my favorites. Any "out of towners", definitely a place to check out. The staff there are great and very friendly.
