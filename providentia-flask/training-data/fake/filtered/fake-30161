The Eddy is fully deserving of all these good reviews. The food and service is exceptional. Ordered one plate of oysters for starters. They were so good we ordered a second. Scallops were delicious too. For mains I ordered the gnocchi and my gf ordered the ribeye - seriously good - and perfectly matched with the Brunello di Montalcino. Our waiter Bill was really knowledgeable and pleasant. Just what you want in a waiter.
