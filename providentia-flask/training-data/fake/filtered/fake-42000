Montclair's central thoroughfare,  Bloomfield Avenue, has no fewer than four (count 'em) Thai restaurants spaced along its four blocks. Three are pretty darned good, but owner Sheree Sarabhayavanija's Spice II is in a class by itself. One can simply only say good things about this restaurant: a delightfully friendly and helpful staff, completely authentic Thai cuisine, lovingly prepared, beautifully served, very (very!) reasonably priced, and conveniently located.  So conveniently located, in fact, that it seems I eat there, watched over by portraits of the Thai royal family, as often as I eat at home! I've dined at a very large number of Thai restaurants around the world and haven't had anything as good as this. I simply love eating here.  Give it a try and you'll know just what I'm talking about! Prices are a steal by Montclair standards. Most of the usual Thai dishes run in the $10 to $12. category, about 25% less for lunch. Personal favorites include the amazing Chicken  Rama (also beef Rama, fish Rama, vegetarian Rama and so forth), served in a delightful peanut-garlic-pepper sauce (heat can be toned up or down to personal preference), and the hearty yet subtle symphony of sweet-savory contrasts known as  Massaman Curry. The soups are all excellent, bursting with freshness and flavor, but the exquisite Tom Kha is tasty beyond description!  Pad Thai, always the very first dish that I order in any new Thai restaurant, is superlative - easily the best in town! Sheree's appetizers (especially the curry puffs) and the desserts (especially the Thai custard and the sticky rice with ice-cream) and her uniquely Thai lemon grass beverage (I don't know its proper name) are all delightful. Freshness and attention to detail, authenticity and affordability, coupled with excellent service and Sheree's welcoming, graceful presence conspire to make Spice II a "must" for any foodie or lover of all things Thai.
