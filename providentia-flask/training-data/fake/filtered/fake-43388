I ate here for brunch on a Sunday recently. The service was very good and our server was friendly. The coffee service was excellent (too many places fail to re-fill enough- not this place!) but unfortunately my dish was sub par. I ordered an egg white omelette and a side salad instead of home fries. The omelette was SOAKED in grease which was a) gross and b) kind of defeats the purpose of ordering an egg white omelette. The side salad must have had about a cup of dressing on it so that was also not good, though the dressing itself was tasty. It should have just been served on the side. I did not say anything until the very end when we were paying, at which time they said i should have said something sooner and they would have done something to correct my meal. I probably should have, and based upon the people working there I am sure they would have tried to make things right. So i will give them credit for this, even though I failed to exercise this option. The pancakes i saw being served to other tables looked amazing so i will come back to try those, but for those people looking for a lighter option, this is clearly not the place to go. There were also an extraordinarily high number of young kids there, which i've never seen before. So if young kids are not your thing, i would stay away from early sunday brunch.
