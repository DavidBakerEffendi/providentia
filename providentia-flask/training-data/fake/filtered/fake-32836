NEVER AGIAN!! My family of four ordered the paella.  It was a disaster.  The only seasoning was SALT.  The clams were gritty and the lobsters were tasteless.  The rubbery shrimps were plentiful. I guess we should have been grateful for the ample serving of over salted rice. The service was impersonal and brisk.   Upon being seated the waiter asked if we would like to try the breads and cheeses. We accepted and were served cold dry breads with a tasteless cottage cheese like item. When the bill came we were charged for the bread and cheese.   When I questioned the waiter he stated "I put that on all my customers' bill". After several rounds of this practice being both unprofessional and deceiving, the charge was taken off the bill. Save yourself the drama...eat elsewhere.
