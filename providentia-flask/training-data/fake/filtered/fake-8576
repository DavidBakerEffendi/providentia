I was here over the weekend with a friend for a bite. I ordered the crispy Brussels & miso ramen. Both were super yummy. My friend ordered the pork bone ramen & she said it was flavorful. She ate every morsel from her plate. The service was friendly and I'll most likely make sure to come here again when I'm on Vanderbilt.
