Finally, I made it to this place today after living in NYC over 10yrs. As a Tokyo-born Japanese, unfortunately I have to say their soba was very disappointing... The soba sauce didn't have enough saltiness/sweetness at all, no flavor of Bonito/Niboshi(dried fish) either. Addition to that, my cold soba was way too cold (icy cold) which is not the right way. (Never had that cold soba/any noodle in my life) And, soba itself didn't have an aroma of buckwheat at all... Even though I was starving and was so excited to have soba that day, I couldn't finish a 2/3 of the mid-small bowl of it. I wanted to take my parents to this place whenever they visit me next time, but it seems like that's not gonna happen... ;(
