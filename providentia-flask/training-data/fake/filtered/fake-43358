I went there tonight and everything was a nightmare! The staff didn't speak or understand English very well and ignored you when you called them. I had some Chicken wings, TERRIBLE! Tasted like it was dipped in salt water!!! I threw it out. I saw a dish, made with cucumbers but with some kind of "mystery meat" I thought was squid. I asked a staff member "Excuse me, what kind of meat is this", and they pointed to the same sign for the name, which wasn't what I asked. I asked about 4 different people, they did the same. SO, I finally asked  the manager, she  told me it was chicken. OK, now that is what I wanted to know. Sat down to eat, it was like small chicken wings but mostly bone! I was here with 15 friends and we ALL decided that we will NEVER go here again. They have lost some new customers.
