You wouldn't know it, but this tiny little shop is a must visit in NYC.  Perfectly done fries (the Belgian way) with way too many dipping sauces to try.  Everything comes with european mayo, pretty difficult to find in the US.  Seating might be limited, but its just fries so people come and go quickly.   Next time I gotta try the poutine, but I was a big fan of the horseradish sauce.
