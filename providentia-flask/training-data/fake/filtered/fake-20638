Awesome food here. One of my favorite places in the city and great place to go for Lobster and fish. The oysters are fresh and the specials are very good. The Lobster dinner special is a real bargain as well. The place is always packed every time I go. The waits are always very long and the service is usually slow. This would be a 5 star review is not for the service and wait. The food is well worth it.
