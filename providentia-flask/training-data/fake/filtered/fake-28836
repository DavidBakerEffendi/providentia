Let me just say that I've been waiting for this place to open for several months and it was well worth the wait. This place reminds me of Brooklyn and places I've eaten in Barcelona and Paris with great music and ambience. This past Saturday for breakfast I had the bacon, egg and cheese which tasted like a party in my mouth. For lunch I've had the " truth" which is undeniably the best burger my taste buds have ever known. I finally shared this place with my wife and now we re both addicted. The Korean short rib tacos are my favorite and my wife's favorite is the Hylton. The flavor combinations are ridiculously delightful and surprising. Brunch gets pretty crowded so I suggest going on the earlier or later side. Obviously the space is small but it's well worth sucking it up and waiting for a seat. If you appreciate good food made to order, you'll be in heaven.
