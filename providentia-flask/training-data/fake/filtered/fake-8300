Overrated...Great drinks. Friendly wait staff and bartenders. Food is ok, but overpriced. I used to work for Chickie's & Pete's at Parx Casino as a restroom attendant. I worked under the table for them for over a year and got terminated by the COO, Roger Falloon because I did not have business insurance and I was not incorporated. Wonders if bathroom attendants at other establishments are incorporated or have business insurance while working under the table.
