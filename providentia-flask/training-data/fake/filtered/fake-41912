I went out yesterday heading to another Italian restaurant that was so crowded the waiting was up to 45 minutes. So I checked yelp! for a nearby option. This one came out between others, but this one was similar to the one I was headed. I came accross with such a wonderfoul-warm-quiet place! As every other italian everything was clean, service was very kind with waitress that speak diferent languages beside English. The place wasn't really crowded by 9:30pm and we got a table inmediately. They have a nice bar to wait or have a drink or you can order at the table. Most of drinks are $10 in a very descent size. I got such a nice beefeater dirty martini made at perfection. As appettizer the antipasti Trecolori, good enough for 2 was great with different kinds of cheese, prosciutto, salami and olives. They got a menu plenty of choices, from pastas, seafood, chicken and veal. I got the speacial of the day. Filet mignon in Barolo sauce with portobello mushrooms, medium rear, with nice mashed potato. The meat was so soft that you didn't need a knife. Perfect. My wife had the fish of the day, grilled with salad. Delicious! As a dessert, we had strawberries with fresh, soft, light whipped cream and an undescriptable home made tiramisu. Weigthless, soft, delicious ! Overall a great and recomendable experience. With prices on the sane average of most restaurant in the area or even better. I definetly will be back to try their pasta and mojitos.
