I've lived in Cranbury my whole life and at least once a week after school, me and all my friends walk to Cranbury Pizza then either go to Jack's Candy Shack or Gil and Berts. Cranbury Pizza is great! The most me and my friends (4 of us) have ever spent is $15.00. And all we got was 4 slices of pizza ($2 each), fries ($3), and 4 drinks ($1 each). So, for everyone its about $3. Great prices, great food, great music, great everything!
