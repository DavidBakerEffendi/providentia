I went for lunch to celebrate my birthday on August 30th. The place was charming, the menu fantastic and the wait staff very helpful.  I gave this restaurant only four stars because the tuna nicoise salad I ordered was, well, terrible.  When I ordered it the waiter was quite helpful in choosing a wine that would compliment the tuna in the salad.   The tuna was not rare and the salad came drenched in dressing. I'm not a big fan of an overload of dressing because I want to taste the flavors of my food.  I asked if I could send it back if the dressing was too overpowering, and was told of course.  The anchovies used to make the dressing overpowered the rest of the salad.  I did wind up sending the salad back, yet when it returned, much of the original dressing remained and the saltiness of the anchovies made me stop eating the salad. It looked the kitchen had not made a fresh salad but had, instead, attempted to weed out the lettuce that had the most dressing, add some fresh and cooked the same pieces of tuna again.  It was quite an unfortunate experience. The waiter asked if I wanted anything else but at that point I was actually full because I had eaten the ahi. On the upside, my father had the trout almondine, which was out of this world. We started with the charcute rie plate.  I highly recommend the chicken liver moose and pate - both delicious.  The other meats on the plate were nothing special and I would've liked more of the mousse and pate - but too each his own. The brown country bread overwhelmed both the mousse and pate and I opted to use the small pieces of french bread that came out earlier with Rat's delicious herbed butter. We ended with the blueberry tart, which came wrapped in phyllo dough along side a generous helping of lemon spoom. It was to die for. I'd go back to Rat's again in a heart beat - it has a wonderful ambiance, a delicious menu and helpful waitstaff. I simply would not order the tuna nicoise salad!
