Love Love Love Kenji.  Best rolls ever.  I love their special rolls.  Big fresh and delicious.  I have tried many Japanese restaurants and I always come back to Kenji, because other sushi just doesn't compare.  They also offer brown rice.  ;)  I had some proplems with service, but they are so friendly it makes up for it.
