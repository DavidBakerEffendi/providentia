The food was loaded with salt and sugar. My wife and I felt the effect of the dishes loaded with MSG. We both are concerned about the health risk of eating food loaded with that amount of salt. Considering the price and the health aspects, I would not recommend this restaurant. My past memories were very good. Very disappointed.
