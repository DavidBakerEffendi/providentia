NEVER MORE! We called for a reservation and they informed that reservations are not necessary for lunch! We went in a group and we couldn't enter because it needs a reservation! the service was TERRIBLE! The woman that spoke with us, treat us like a dog!!! She said she would respect us if we respect her...but, I'm really sure we respected her! We just would like to sit and have a lunch! And we'd PAY for it! I've never been so mistreated in my life!! Maybe the food is good, but I dont want to stay in a place that the owner make me feel like an animal! Avoid this place, this kind of situation is unacceptable!!!
