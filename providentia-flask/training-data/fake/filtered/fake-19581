Okay, so I'll start with the positive. I am pretty much addicted to the food, I have been ordering from this place for two years, and so have my room mates. It isn't the most amazing Mexican food you will ever have, but it is def. delicious. However, just about EVERY time I order chips and salsa, or guacamole from this place, they only send one part of it. I'll get chips without dip, or dip without chips. Either way it is useless for me to be paying $5.75 for something to just be disappointed. Isn't that a common part of the mexican experience? The worst part is when I call to tell them, I always hear silence. Not, "I'm sorry, we'll send you something right over." Just a pause as though I should just hear, "what do you expect me to do about it?" The last time I called, he told me I didn't get chips with my guac b/c there weren't any made. Like that should appease me. Oh, ooookay. It totally makes sense that you wouldn't have called to explain and taken the charge off of my credit card, but instead just charge me and not send it. WTF? I also tried to use the online method which ONLY took an hour and a half. Which was placed the day after the guac thing happened, and I never got my complimentary chips and guac that was promised. I guess my point is that the food is pretty good, but with this poor quality of customer service for someone who orders from the place two or three times a week... well... I am pretty close to finding a new Mexican place to go to.
