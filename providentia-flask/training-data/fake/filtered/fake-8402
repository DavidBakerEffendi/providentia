My colleague and I heard great things and were seriously disappointed. We arrived at 12:15, ordered right away and never received our food. The waitress only came by to give us water. I approached her at 12:40 that we had to leave and we wanted the check - which we also never got. She asked if we wanted the food and we said to go only if ready. It wasn't and she just stood in the back. I approached her again that we had to go now and couldn't wait and she said she's get a manager and none came over. At 12:50 she brought us plates which was ridiculous since I had made it clear I had to leave. So she left to wrap them and at 12:55 she hadn't come back. We left $30 on the table to cover our food. I'm disappointed and this experience has not made me want to come back. I definitely wasted $30 on food (& a tip) that I never even saw!!!
