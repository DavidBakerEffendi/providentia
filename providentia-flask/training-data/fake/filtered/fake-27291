their brunch is the best ever...steak and eggs were cooked exactly as ordered, and the french toast melts in your mouth w/ the perfect amount of sweetness and crisp... we also went there for dinner once, and both entrees were superb...the duck confit was so good i wanted a second plate... i have ordered delivery from them twice, a chicken sandwich and a burger...both were ok...
