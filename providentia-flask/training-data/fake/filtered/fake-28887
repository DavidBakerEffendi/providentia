I think some people need to get a life that post on this site. People overly exaggerate things to a new level @ times. I patronize The Allwood Diner 3-4 times a week with my family and co-workers, i rarely have anything bad to say about the The Allwood Diner.  The quality of food they give you and especially the price, you CAN NOT find it anywhere in this area. They have one of the more friendlier staffs. I know the 2 brothers that own the place and they are really great people. They care alot about their customers and are always there. Ps,  i have had the bagel lox platter many times and capers never came with it. Any how, The Allwood Diner is one of better, cleaner and nicer diners in this area.
