Food is great.  Drinks are great.  Sadly, however, my wallet was stolen while eating at the restaurant.  I believe it was taken by one of the wait staff although I cannot prove it.  Just be careful if you are eating here to keep your wallet on your person.  Someone on the staff has sticky fingers. :(
