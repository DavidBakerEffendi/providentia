This place is awesome! I don't live in the area but my friends do, and it is really one of the coolest places there.  We went to grab drinks by the bar, which was fun because it seemed like a lot of other people had the same idea.  I haven't eaten there yet but the food looked really good.  I will definitely be back!  I've heard great things about their backyard too.
