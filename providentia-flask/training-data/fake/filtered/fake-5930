Stopped by Cookshop on a Saturday for lunch (2pm).  The place was packed so I was glad I had made reservations.   The restaurant is bright and airy with a good-sized outdoor seating in one of my fav neighborhoods. My table split the Huevos Rancheros, Shrimp Salad and a biscuit.  I also had the Arnold Palmer's - virgin. Huevos Racheros was a big size and glad I had it split with a salad because it would have def been a bit too heavy -- And I like to eat.  The dish was delicious and def worth getting again. I wasn't too impressed with the shrimp salad but it was light and refreshing.  Would have preferred a different dressing -- maybe more lemon-y with more variety (maybe some grilled artichokes, jicama, granny smith apple and/or manchego cheese).  But the shrimp was huge and perfectly poached. The biscuit... I know, it's just biscuit... But this was the best part of the meal!  High-class KFC biscuit but with much better ingredients.  The jam was delicious and not too sweet.  Def get the biscuit. Would highly recommend making reservations. Overall, I would def go back for brunch and would like to try what they have for dinner.  Like the typical hot spots in NYC, the atmosphere is filled with beautiful people. Think they might deliver because there were some dope bikes outside the restaurant.
