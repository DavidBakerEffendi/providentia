LOVED this place! Had a great meal in the beautiful garden area. Felt like a world away from the city, in a secret garden. Got there a little early for our reservation, and sat at the bar to wait for a seat in the garden. The bartender made awesome drinks, and she was very friendly. Our server (believe his name was Harrison) was so sweet and knowledgeable of the menu, he genuinely seemed to have a love for food. Most definitely will be back here.
