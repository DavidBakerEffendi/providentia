It's a great little place Â to enjoy an evening out for dinner. We were lucky enough to be there the night they opened and even if it was their night opened, We had wonderful service and great food. I LOVE the atmosphere and we WILL be back. Anyone that doesn't appreciate a place like Candela's in the Upper Valley doesn't understand what upscale fine dining is.
