We will never be coming back to Manu's after what happened during our last trip.  I bit into a piece of sushi and felt something weird in my mouth.  I then pulled out a long, black hair that was inside the sushi roll. What made matters worse was the complete unresponsiveness and indifference by the staff and management.  One waiter came and took the plate of sushi back, but did not even apologize or offer to replace the sushi roll.  Several minutes passed before we had to call our waitress over and, after explaining the situation to her, all she offered us was a bottle of water.  It then took ten minutes for her to actually get the water, and then she just dumped it on the table and walked away. At that point, we had enough and decided to leave.  But before we did, we asked to speak to the manager.  The manager also did not apologize for the situation and only tried to assure us that their kitchen was sanitary (his solution was to offer to take us to see their kitchen). The service at Manu's has always been slow and unresponsive, but we kept coming back because it was near our apartment in the Ironbound and it was a comfortable place to have a quiet dinner.  The food was also pretty good, even though it was a bit overpriced. But, we will never come back after tonight.  As if it wasn't gross enough biting into sushi with hair in it, it was inexcusable the way the restaurant (both the staff and the management) handled the situation.  The fact that they never offered us anything to make up for the situation demonstrates how little they care about their customers. Disgusting, overpriced, and indifference towards customers...no thanks, Manu's.
