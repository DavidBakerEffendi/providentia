I had the pleasure of meeting Angelo and dining at his restaurant last week. My daughter was in town for a class at Rutgers and we both wanted some top notch Italian food. We were not disappointed. We started out with tomato salad with fresh basil and mozzerella cheese. We enjoyed a glass of the house Merlot along with fresh bread which we could dip in olive oil. D had lobster ravioli while I had the special chicken marsala. Dessert was homemade chocolate cake, tiramisu and coffee. Service was terrific and the price with a tip was less that $90! The atmosphere was upscale casual and the booth was very comfortable. Angelo is a great host and if I am in the area again, I will be sure to go to La Fiamma! Try it....you will leave wanting to come back again.
