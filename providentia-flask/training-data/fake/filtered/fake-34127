I loved this restaurant!! A friend and I tried it out on a Friday night a couple of weeks ago and were truly impressed. We sat in the bar area at a high-top table and ordered tapas and wine followed by dinner and dessert. The food was fantastic. We savored every bite and left nothing on the plate!! The service was "just right," attentive and friendly but not intrusive. There was a family feel to the place. There were single diners sitting along the bar, eating and talking.Young couples and older folks (like me!) filled the tables both in the bar area and in the restaurant area. We spent three (that's 3!!) hours, dining and talking in a relaxed and friendly atmosphere. We never felt rushed and never felt neglected. I will definitely return to this piece of NYC on the Shoreline!!!
