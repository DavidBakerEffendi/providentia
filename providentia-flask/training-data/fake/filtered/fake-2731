The North Star is fantastic.  It is a cross between dive bar and just nice corner bar.  The music is not always to my taste, but you can bet on catching something you like if you pay attention to the upcoming shows. As for the staff... As far as I can tell it is basically been the same for years.  Everyone is always really nice to me when I go there.  There is only one regular doorman that i recognize and he seems really nice in a silly way. Talks really loud and laffs at everything.   The food is ok.  No salads.  Pretty typical bar food.  My veggie burger was under cooked, but that was quickly fixed and I wasn't charged for it. :) Great beer selection that seems to change pretty often. The North Star is 4 or 5 blocks from the Art Museum 4 for sure if you go from the new annex of the Art Museum (Just the facts, Ms. -- Check google maps for yourself).  Whoever said 15 blocks is just being rude.  Of course the same person feels as though it is ok to turn lights up and down in a place of business that is not their own.  I am surprised they did asked to leave! I guess the staff / doormen or ok after all.    ;)
