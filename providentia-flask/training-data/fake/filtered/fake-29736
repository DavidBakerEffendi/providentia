Bibou is a wonderful, cozy place to spend the night.  The restaurant has a very homey feel to it.  The executive chef came out during the night to greet every table.  The service was wonderful.  And of course, the food was terrific. Definitely another one of my favorite spots in Philadelphia. This place really reminds me of the wonderful food and times I've had in Paris. It's amazing.The food at  Bibou is technically flawless.  If I had to nit pick maybe the escargot was on the fence of not being seasoned well enough, but, I still loved the dish.  Chef Yves takes familiar French dishes such as Coq Au Vin and makes them better.  The plates may look familiar but the taste is out of this world.  Everything was perfect, literally executed with no error.  One of the best meals I have ever had.
