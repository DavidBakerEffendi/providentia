I love BBQ and was excited to try this place.  Left really disappointed.  We had the pulled pork, brisket and ribs.  All were VERY salty and not the least bit smokey, sweet or tangy.  And what kind of self-respecting BBQ joint doesn't even offer mac n cheese or greens?  Mighty Quinn's sucks!  Will never go back.  Dinosaur, Hill Country and Fletcher's in Brooklyn are all way better.
