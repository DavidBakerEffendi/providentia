I didn't think I would like Parc - not big on French cuisine, but it wasn't bad. Three of us went here for dinner.  We had the Salmon, Scallops and Trout Amandine.  All good, but not sure about the portion size for the scallops. We also had a cheese plate (not great) and something else I can't really remember.  Must have been delicious. The manager was a nice guy - came over a chatted with us for a bit. Nothing incredibly special, but a nice place overall.  No real complaints.
