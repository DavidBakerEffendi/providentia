This place has a great vibe to it with a great menu to match. Their beer selection is awesome (I love grabbing a Sweet Action) and they have a lot of delicious things to eat. Big shoutout to the French Onion Soup, Parmesan Chicken wrap, and Wings. The 3 stars are for the service. I very rarely have an experience where I am not frustrated with the wait staff. They are very friendly, but incredibly slow. It may be a kitchen/bar issue but this unfortunately comes down on them. I would recommend the place, but expect to spend awhile there.
