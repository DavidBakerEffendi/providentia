Loved this place! My friend and I were looking for a place to have dinner she mentioned Yuca bar and it disappointing at all. Food is delicious we had the plantain with pork tapa, the guacamole and chips, then the tuna ceviche in coconut milk (AWESOME) we also had the mahi mahi with cononut rice... I can't wait to go back to Yucca Bar :) Red Sangria wasnt the best I have tried but it was good... with such Â great dinner who needs more.
