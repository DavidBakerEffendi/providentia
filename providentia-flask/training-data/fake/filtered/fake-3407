I've been visiting Lovers and Madmen for about a year now and I continue to go back because each time I leave happy. Â They have really delicious coffee at reasonable prices and a friendly, helpful staff to go along with it. A lot of hipsters, though, so if that's your thing - you'll feel right at home.
