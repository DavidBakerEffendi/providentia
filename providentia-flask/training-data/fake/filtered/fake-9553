I was open minded with a restaurant that I heard tried very hard to come off Chi Chi in the middle of nowheresville, NJ...But I was pleasantly surprised the wait staff was excellent the wine was decent, however a bit overpriced even by NY standards and my girlfriends and couldn't stop laughing at the manager that had toilet paper sticking out of his pants it was a total hoot except he didn't know what was going on and seem to become embarrassed. The food was semi ok and the ambience was cramped and the desert was just basic and I found a hair in my food...The bill was HUGE!!!! and totally not worth it. I could have gone to top NYC restaurant for that kind of money. Even my friends couldn't believe the bill. Insane for what we really got. I would say they are trying to create top quality with total mediocrity but I guess you have to eat somewhere in nowheresville, NJ..We should have gone Chinese..that's all I have to say.
