This has to be the worst and most expensive cheesesteak I have ever had my entire life, I can make a better one without even trying. I do not recommend this location to any tourist or anyone who has been told they are "good". You can go to any local corner store (papi store) and get a cheesesteak and fries (that taste 10x better) for literally half the price of one cheesesteak without Cheez Whiz at Geno's. This place is waaay tooo pricey.
