Arrived last night after a movie at Angelika.  The females hostess informed our party of three that we could not sit at a table as she was trying to close the kitchen.  She 'invited' us to 'mozy' (her word) up to the bar and order wine.  There were no spots available at the bar, and every table was open.  The wine bar was to be open another hour or more.  She was extremely rude; therefore, we went to Vyne on 3 St near NYU.  All we wanted was a bottle of wine.  Geez.
