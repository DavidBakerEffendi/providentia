We recently ate here on a Saturday night. We had reservations but had to wait a few minutes to be seated as the restaurant was very busy. I had the octopus appetizer which was very good and the Sashimi dinner which was a very generous portion of raw fish and was excellent. My only complaint was that they play their background music too loud otherwise I might have given them 5 stars.
