The service was great. Our waiter was prompt & we never felt rushed to eat and leave, even though it was a busy place. All of the food was fresh and delicious. I got the Salmon BLT and it was cooked to perfection. Also had the mac & cheese spring rolls which were cheesy & delicious. Highly recommend if you are in the area!
