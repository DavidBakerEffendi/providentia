Ear Inn is a great place to have a couple drinks and a quick bite! Even though it's chock-full of the after-work Hudson Square crowd, it still feels like a secret somehow- since it's so close to the water and the highway, and it's so old and the ceilings are so low, it feels when you walk in there like you're walking into a bunker.  Sometimes, when you want to have an intimate conversation with one or two people over a beer or a glass of wine, that's perfect.  Also, talk to the bartender about the history of the place.  It was built for George Washington's African American aide, became a speakeasy during prohibition, and much more.  It really is so indicative of the Hudson Square neighborhood- tons of history, good service, and somehow feels like a secret between you and the history of NY.
