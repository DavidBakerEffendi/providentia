This is officially the best restaurant in South Philadelphia now and incredibly affordable.  I took my Anglo-Saxon family there and the food was astounding.  The service is very slow, so when you go, do not be in a rush.  The food is made to order and the definition of delectable.  Everything on the menu was amazing.  They go out of their way to create make each order designed to share.  It takes them a lot more time but if you love food, it is worth the wait.  BYOB, cash only.  They should remove the T.V., and play music, those are my only two suggestions.  The prices here will inevitably go up very soon, and still it would be worth it.  Thanks for providing South Philadelphia with high-quality food, we need it.  I felt like I ate food in someone's family kitchen.  Each dish was presented and prepared with a lot of love.
