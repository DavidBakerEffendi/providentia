This restaurant is a gem! To start, the food is outstanding, the best in morningside heights for sure. My friends and I have tried the burger (which is the best burger you will ever eat), shrimp ceviche, mushroom risotto, airline chicken, and the wreckfish, all amazing. Every dish is cooked to perfection and so well thought out. Even the olive tapenade they give out with bread in the beginning is so delicious. In addition, this restaurant carries Blue Bottle Coffee, and their new orleans iced chicory coffee is to die for. The waitress we've had is so friendly and accommodating and service overall is high standing. Flat Top is the perfect cafe during the day and a charming fine dining restaurant by night. If you haven't been here yet, it is a must!
