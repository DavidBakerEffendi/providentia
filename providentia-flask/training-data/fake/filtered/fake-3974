I was very excited to try this place but was sorely disappointed. The menu offers several types of meatball -- beef, pork, chicken, veggie -- giving the impression that there is something for everyone. I was all set to order the beef. So you can imagine my surprise when I saw the very small print at the bottom of the menu saying that most of their meatballs contain pork. When I questioned the waitress, she confirmed that ALL the meatballs except the veggie ones are made with pork fat. (I, like many New Yorkers, don't eat pork.) Â Major bummer. I ordered the veggie, and they were fine but nothing special. And, most importantly, they werent MEATballs. Kind of defeated the purpose of going to a meatball shop for me. Change the recipe, Meatball Shop! Give us some real choices!
