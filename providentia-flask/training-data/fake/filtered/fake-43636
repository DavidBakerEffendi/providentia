Definitely a hip atmosphere, and the food is ok. But if you've already paid homage, and want much better food for a much better price try La Brique around the corner on Manhattan Ave. Don't let the dorky atmosphere fool you, the food is AMAZING, and they have a nice outside deck in the summer. Everything we've had has been great, but get the Lamb Chops or Filet Minion....as good as anywhere, and half the price.
