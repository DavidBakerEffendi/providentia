The first time I went for my birthday earlier this year I wasn't too impressed. I don't remember the meal I ordered but dessert was the brownie sundae. It was basically a scoop of vanilla ice cream, served with cheapened brownie mix and topped with too much whipped cream. I decided to give it another shot. We ordered an arugula salad (which was delicious) and rigatoni with eggplant and mozzarella and had chicken added to it. It was okay nothing to write a symphony about. The wait staff was friendly and asked us a couple of times if things were ok. I also had a peach bellini which was what I liked the most. Overall, I'd only return to this restaurant if someone else was covering the tab.
