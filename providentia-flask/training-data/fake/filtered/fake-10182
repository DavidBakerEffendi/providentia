So I went there after not having been there for about a decade (moved away).  I stopped on Friday, October 19, 2012 at about 4 p.m.  Lots of seats available, etc.  The wait time was a bit much.  The bartender continued a conversation with wait staff about odds and ends (where did you meet that guy? types of conversations).  Wait staff was not notified by the host that we were seated because we waited for about 10 minutes before she noticed us.  Even after having been noticed, she kept cleaning tables (empty booths everywhere).  There was a point where we discussed leaving, but once we decided to leave, the waitress did come over.   The only thing memorable was the mashed potato pizza.   In any event, they need a bit of a wake up call by management or owners.  Bar has lost its edge.  Come on guys, with all the competition out there, you can't do this.
