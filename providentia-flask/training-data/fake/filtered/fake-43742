If you want to be part of a hopping and attractive scene, filled with lots of young, good looking people, Alta is a fantastic choice. If you want good food, Alta may be the worst choice in the West Village. We orders 12 dishes, then went out for dinner afterwards. Old seafood, stale dishes. One visit and you can tell most people aren't here for the food, and the restaurant knows this.
