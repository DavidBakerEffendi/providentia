I was so relieved when I found out Nizi is still in Rutherford.  The food is great, and the service is excellent.  The two waiters who have been there forever, Dan and Dominic, are very friendly and attentive.  The prices at Nizi are very reasonable, and the sushi is fresh and delicious.  The cooked Korean food is also delicious.  The restaurant is small, but worth waiting for a table.  We drive past many other sushi restaurants to get to Nizi because we haven't found another one that even comes close.
