My husband and I went here for my birthday last night and the entire experience was exquisite.  The service was friendly, attentive and helpful.  The grilled octopus appetizer was out of this world delicious, as was the swiss chard and mushroom raviolini.  We shared the chicken dish and the lamb dish, both of which were outstanding.  Usually we can pick who out-ordered who, but it was impossible at this place.  For dessert, try the chocolate brioche pudding or the panna cotta...you won't be disappointed. Atmosphere was lovely, with low lighting and a choice of many different places to sit, and the food was timed perfectly.  Even though they were pretty busy, it never felt frenetic or rushed.   All in all, a perfect dining experience.  If you haven't been, try it.  So glad we discovered it.
