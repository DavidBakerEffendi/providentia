Amazing. Fantastic. Perfection. Choose an adjective-- I grew up in California, and have been living in Manhattan and it's lack of decent burritos for a number of years now. If I'm getting Mexican food, it's at Dos Toros. You can't compare this place to Chipolte because it's light-years ahead of it. Guacamole people. Guac-a-holey-moley. Go.
