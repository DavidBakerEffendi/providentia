I am 100 % dominican and i can truly say the food from here taste straight out of my mothers/grandmothers kitchen !! I've Â been to many Dominican restaurants and i can honestly say this one is by far the best i had. The prices are really good too . Very reasonable . I will defitnetly come back here to eat. The service was truly awesome , the waiter a tho was new he knew the menu and made great suggestions .. The Empanadas were to die for !!! Delicious . I love the feel of the place , the old rustic look is pretty dope. Makes me feel like i was having dinner back in my mother land ..
