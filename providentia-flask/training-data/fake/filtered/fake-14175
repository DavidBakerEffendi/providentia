Me and my boyfriend trusted the high ranking of this place on yelp. Unfortunately, food was disaster. I tried shepherd's pi and my boyfriend tried burger. None of us was even able to eat half of what we got due to lack of quality of the ground beef used on both meals. We couldn't guess it could be that bad by looking at prices either because burger is $13 and pie is $18. Only positive thing was the ambiance. This pub is really cute in design, cheap but cute. I suggest do not buy anything which has meat in it. Actually, I remember their half burn horrible fries now and change my mind if you want to eat something just go somewhere else.
