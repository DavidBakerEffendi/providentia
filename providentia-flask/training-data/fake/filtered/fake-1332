One of my favorite lunch spots in the city. Love that they're kosher, but wish it didn't mean I can't get my falafel fix on Saturdays. Great deal for half or full falafel sandwich... Great soups in the winter as well. Their fries are pretty good, but there's a bit of a wait for them. The staff can be a bit short with people at times, but it's only cause some people don't understand how to order at a lunch spot that has a line out the door all the time. Owner is a great guy as well. Definitely recommend stopping by if you're a falafel fan.
