I LOVE the diner!!  Although, there's always a bit of a wait, the food is great!  The menu offers unique options.  I also love the option of alcohol with my breakfast.  It's a very cool little place.  Everything I have gotten at the diner has been wonderful and the service was great too! My review on the lounge is quite different.  It gets so unbelievably packed that you and the other patrons are quite literally as one.  Clearly, they ignore the occupancy laws.  The bartenders are also VERY rude at all times.   Do the diner!  AVOID the lounge.
