I was in Philadelphia for a few days visiting my brother back in June.  While there I had the chance to bum around Old (Olde?) City for awhile.  I stopped by Mac's for a quick beer...and ended up staying the remainder of the evening. The atmosphere was very comfortable, the beer selection was great (I just got back from living in Texas, so I'll take Victory on tap when I can get it!) and I think the dipping sauce for the fries was created in a secret government laboratory.  It was awesome! The only disappointment?  I came by the next day for lunch before leaving town, only to find that they weren't going to be open for another couple of hours.  Oh well.  I'll get my hands on that dipping sauce again someday.... In short; I highly recommend Mac's.  A great place to hang out, have a few quality craft beers, and an awesome meal.
