I'm a big fan of Gusto, and here's why. 1. Delicious, fresh-tasting sauce. I prefer cheese pizza, which is pretty minimalist, but that means that if the sauce is meh, there are no toppings to hide behind. Gusto can stand up to the challenge! 2. 10% student discount, on top of already low prices. 3. Quick turnaround time. Our pizzas are usually done in 15 minutes or less. We live a short walk from Gusto, and there is actually a closer pizza place. But we always go to Gusto. Why? Because it's a great pizza for a very good price.
