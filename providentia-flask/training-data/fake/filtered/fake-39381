Need a caterer? I would strongly recommend finding someone other than the Cosmic Café. I was looking for a caterer to cater my wedding reception. I went to a meeting with the manager there to discuss details and get more information. I liked what I heard and decided that I was going to go ahead and use them for my reception. I called the owner to let her know, I received no phone call back. However, she did email me to tell me that everything her manager told me was false ( btw, what her manager told me is also on the café website, so I thought it must be accurate) But according to the owner, her manager and her website are wrong. She tried to get me to spend more money than I needed to, she didn't try to work with us and eventually she just stopped responding to my emails. I am now looking for another caterer.
