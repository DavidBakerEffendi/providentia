I'd definitely come back here because it was such a pleasant experience. High-end food, comfortable atmosphere, great non-stuffy service. There really isn't much to complain about this place. For such a high profile restaurant, I was pleasantly surprised that our servers were down to earth with personality- not the cookie-cutter 5-star dining servers who may say and do all the right things, but because they have to. Very refreshing. See the bill , Pay the bill. Â Make reservations for next month.
