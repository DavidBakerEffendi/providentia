Okay.  This company is not spectacular.  But they work hard, they are honest and they get your food to you inside an hour.  This is Chinese delivery, not pizza and subs.  It is complex food and needs to be microwaved or - better yet - oven-reheated to taste best.  They are slightly expensive for local Chinese but remember- they will bnring your food to your house!  I buy a meal or two from them every few weeks and the portions are always big enough to have more than one meal.  I like Kwans for what they are and do not expect 5-Star Montreal-quality  Asian dining.  Great if you are staying in a hotel in Greater Burlington - so long as your room has a microwave.
