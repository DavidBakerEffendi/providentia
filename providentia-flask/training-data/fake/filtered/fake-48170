I had one of the best meals of my life here. We had the scallops with black pudding, soda bread, and the beef wellington. everything was seasoned and cooked perfectly. We also ordered whisky/scotch flights and the waiter was very knowledgeable in helping make our decision. He was attentive without being pushy and the atmosphere is very romantic.
