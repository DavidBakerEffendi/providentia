Good local place to meet fiends for dancing and drinks.  It's an older crowd, which is good for us "mature" people.  Good to be with adults.  Best nights are when the Soul Cruisers perform.  Also, if you get a table ask which is waited on by the owner, Frank's girlfriend, and don't sit there! She's obnoxious, rude and incompetent.  Everyone has  complained, but of course nothing is done about it.
