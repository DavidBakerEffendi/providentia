This has to be the worst restaurant I have ever been to.  The service was horrible and the food was terrible.  They did not tell us that the sangria had no liquor and refused to explain anything on the menu.  When we got there they were out of pork, chicken, beans, "arroz congri", and the only thing they had was skirt steak.  How does a restaurant run out of food?  When has a "Cuban restaurant" run out of Pork and beans?  Seriously, the employees were rude and the manager and owner themselves had an attitude and literally were yelling at us for complaining.  We should have left when were heard another woman complaining while we were in line.  Very unprofessional and very low class service.  I would never recommend this restaurant and much rather visit Havana Central in the City or the plenty of other Cuban Cuisine Restaurants I have gone to in the past.  This was a complete waste of time and money.  DO NOT GO!
