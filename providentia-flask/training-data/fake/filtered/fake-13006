I've never been to this restaurant for dinner, only for brunch.  I have to say this restaurant combines high quality of food, service and class.  It definitely lives up to its reputation.  I love the decor of this restaurant.  The white leather and glass windows give it a very cozy feel.  It also makes it feel like you are at a spa or a hotel restaurant.   This restaurant is a bit difficult to find if you've never been there before.  I would've never noticed this fancy restaurant if I was just walking by the neighborhood.  Parking isn't so hard either (which is a plus).  Though it is inconvenient to get to if you were getting there by subway, but the food and ambience are worth the inconvenience.
