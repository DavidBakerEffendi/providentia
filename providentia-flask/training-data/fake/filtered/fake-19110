Il Porto catered our wedding at Littlefield (130 people) and they did an AMAZING job!!!!!!!  Chef Mario, the owners and staff were all fantastic.  Not only was the service excellent, but the food was SO GOOD. Our guests were raving about it. I even had an out-of-towner tell me she will come back back to Brooklyn just to eat at Il Porto.  We had an array of pastas, antipasto, salads and pizzas. All delicious and fresh. Incredibly reasonable prices, especially compared to many places who will take advantage of you just because it's a wedding. Great service, great people, great food.  Thanks for helping to make the night memorable. Highly recommend!
