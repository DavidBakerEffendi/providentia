Being from New York, I LOVE bagels and was so happy to find Feldman's. Nice ambience, friendly staff, and DELICIOUS bagels. Their everything bagel is the BEST! I would also recommend trying the olive & herb: it has chunks of olives in the bagel, and dried rosemary on top. I'm not a fan of breakfast sandwiches, but I hear they actually use fresh eggs, not the powdered stuff. Definitely a must-try.
