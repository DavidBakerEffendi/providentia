The owner and servers of this place is so very rude!!! I recently had a Birthday celebration reserved here and the owner told us to quiet down. We were seated in the garden area and there were several parties around us and we were the only ones approached by the manager to quiet down. We were appalled by this consistent rude action and our party decided to leave. The manager didnt even apologize! The birthday celebration there was ruined.
