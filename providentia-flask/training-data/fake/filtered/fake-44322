I've eaten here a couple of times, Â the food is ok, if you don't know how to cook for your self..... BUT THE SERVICE IS HORRIBLE, VERY UN~FREINDLY it seems that they are pissed off that you are in there restaurant... well never go again I'LL NEVER GO BACK, So if you like average food, and like being treated like Shit, this might be your place......
