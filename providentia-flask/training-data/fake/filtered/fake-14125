I haven't been to picnic in two years, they are quite dishonest, last time I ordered a BBQ chicken, when I got home found that several pieces of chicken were missing.  Today i was passing by and decided to give it another chance, well, I got home and once again, there was 3/4 of a chicken in the container.  Is it really so hard to give people what they paid for.  If pic-nic charges you for a whole chicken, why not give you a whole chicken.  If this is one way of cutting corners, I wonder what else they do, or do not do, in that kitchen.  Very dishonest and disappointing.   I will NOT be going back there
