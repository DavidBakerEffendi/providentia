Camp town shrimp is a must! Â Never had anything like it. Long wait has stopped us from eating here, but the crowd is aware of the good eats inside. Interior is family oriented with a bar area to wait and have a Margarita. Taco chips are plentiful as a courtesy and I order the steak fajita. Always fresh, hot and tasty. Many special offerings on the menu that make this a hot spot for the tri state area. Great food ambiance, but the loud noise and crowds waiting inside and out, can stop the family from stopping in.
