Ordered many times from every category of the menu and have not been disappointed yet!!!! When we saw Pizza One in Wayne had opened, we called and were pleasantly surprised that they deliver to Little Falls.  We looked up the menu online and were overwhelmed by the choices.  We played it safe and ordered to specialty subs, which were delicious.  Since then, we've ordered over a half a dozen times and sampled many different things.  Everything has been delicious, from the appetizers, to the salads, sandwiches, pastas, dinners, and pizza.  Everything is fresh and tasty, without being salty.  The cold cuts used in the sandwiches are very high quality, beyond what you typically find from a pizza place. Not only does the food speak for itself, but the orders are accurate, and the delivery is always prompt.  Even if you have your go-to place (we did), give Pizza One a try. I guarantee they will become your go-to place.
