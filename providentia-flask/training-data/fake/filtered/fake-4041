I've been there a number of times now, and this is by far my favorite restaurant in Brooklyn.  Dining there is always such a pleasant and positive experience. The food is downright mouth-watering.  I'll spare you the list of what we had, because every other review has covered the many dishes that give the place its gastronomic reputation.  But I'll say this: the food is marked by a higher level of creativity, with flavors that truly titillate the palate.  No matter how I try, I cannot put to words the OMG feeling from dishes made more uniquely than anywhere else. The service is unparalleled.  My wife and I were there again with friends last night, and Jacqueline and her brother John tended our table.  Their professionalism is so noteworthy.  Fresh plate changeovers, water refills, superb recommendations, truly attentive service overall, with smiles and a friendly demeanor.   This place is not to be missed.  The food and service are above all expectations, and the people are just really nice.
