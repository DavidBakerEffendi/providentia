The mushroom burger is the star attraction of this place. I took a friend who likes conservative places and she went with a really negative attitude. She had the mushroom burger and said she wished she could lick her plate. (When she was finished, it look like she did.) The grass fed beef burger is also great, as are the fish tacos. If you like Margueritas, Duino makes them fresh. No mixer. Yes this is where the hipsters hang. I am not one, but I get a kick out of observing. The range of people who go to Duino from hipsters to oldsters like me is fun also. Varied music also, although tonight, the loud horns and drum solo made it impossible to hear. Drum solos and blaring horns are not a good choice for such a small establishment. Only problem with this place is the inconsistent service. Sometimes the food is amazingly fast, other times ridiculously slow, So don't plan on this place if you are short for time.
