Was invited here Saturday for a friend Surprise party, Never had Thai food and after viewing the menu online i wasn't interested in actually eating. We had a party of 18 people which we reserved and had the restaurant to ourselves. After getting there and seeing everything on the menu was so reasonable price, I said why not just try it. Well to my surprise everything was so good i was amazed. I had chicken dumplings, salmon garlic, and chicken basil rice. Every one pretty much had something different and we were all very pleased and satisfied. Its BYOB that  was a plus. There staff (the cook and waiter Louis) was very nice. Did i mention reasonable, Our bill all together came up to $278.00 which was with Gratuity added. Defiantly  added on to my list of all time favorite restaurant.
