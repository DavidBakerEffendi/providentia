The food at Black Bamboo is great!  I've been there twice since they've opened and both times were good.  It is a small restaurant with a very modern style.  There are only a few tables and chairs, but it is comfortable seating.  The kitchen is open, so you can watch while your food is being prepared.  The chef also told me that this is the only Chinese food restaurant in the area that uses all organic oils and vegetables.  I believe him, you can really taste the difference in the food! On my first visit, I tried the curry shrimp.  It was nice and spicy.  I ordered delivery on my second time; the shrimp lo mein and General Tso's chicken were great.  My boyfriend ordered fried chicken wings and he loved them.  I'm telling all my friends to eat here, it's the best Chinese food I've ever had!
