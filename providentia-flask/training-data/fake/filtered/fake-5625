YES. Went here for some late-night desserts with friends. The place was packed but we didn't have any trouble getting a table for our group of 8. I'm not usually a tiramisu person but I got the Chocolate Surprise Tiramisu, and surprise, I loved it! Okay, I love chocolate, so I guess it's not that surprising. It was sweet and rich without going overboard, and the berries were a nice touch. Came on a super-cute platter with a little flask of chocolate sauce on the side. It was pretty difficult to decide on a dessert - they offer a ton of options ranging from contemporary to classic. It's expensive but considering the location, the atmosphere (lively, upscale, a little pretentious but that's offset by the young, semi-clueless servers) and the selection it's what I expected. If you want cheap chocolate ice cream, go to Friendly's. If you want a trendy, unique, delicious chocolate experience, go to Max Brenner's.
