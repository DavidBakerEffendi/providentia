The service is why I give this place one star. The service is constantly horrible. The waitresses don't care about your needs and wants. Asked for my steak cooked well and eggs cooked soft/easy. Steak came back raw and eggs were rubber they were cooked so well. Waitress never came back to check on us. The bus boys are always amazing though!! The orange juice is amazing and why we go back. But this past time was the last. Better Latin restaurants have opened up in the area, do yourself the favor and go there.
