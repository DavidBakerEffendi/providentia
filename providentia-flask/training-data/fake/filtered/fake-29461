Let me start by saying I've eaten here in the past, although I don't remember it being one the best experiences, this was by far the worst! The food was terrible and the service was not much better. I had the Africa Babatta(fried whiting 2 sides)of choice were backed Mac & cheese & Cabbage, The fish was dry and looked as if it were pre cooked and sitting under a heated lamp, the Mac & cheese was mushy with a glump of unmelted cheese and the cabbage was salty & bitter. I also order a side of potato salad, which to my surprise was one big potato!!! When I called the waitress over to ask that my mac & cheese be melted a little more; she replied with "what you want me to put it in the microwave" I asked for a different potato salad as it was clear that was not a salad, she huffed and walked away!! I thought the prices were reasonable until I actually tasted the food. Â I would not reccomend this to a DOG as southern soul food cusine!!! "Buyers Beware"
