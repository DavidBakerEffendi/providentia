We came to NY for the weekend and ended up coming here twice during our stay. We first came for lunch, which turned out to be very good, both food and drinks were great (and reasonably priced too). The location is perfect...near Bryant park, Times Square and fifth avenue.  The decor is much more upscale than we expected, and so when we were looking for a drink the next night we came back. The place was full, but  not so crowded we were overlooked. In fact, we were served our drinks quickly and had a great time. Next time I'm in the city, I will definitely come back.
