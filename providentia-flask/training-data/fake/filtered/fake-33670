I live in Texas so I know what good tex-mex/mexican food is.  This is NOT good Mexican food!!!!!  and the service was horrible!  First off, all I wanted was queso on my enchiladas instead of ranchero sauce because I hate ranchero sauce.  The server and then later the manager refused to accommodate my simple request.  I love enchiladas and eat them all the time in Texas and having queso on them instead of sauce has never been a problem anywhere I have ordered it.  The manager said if I wanted queso, I was gonna have to pay the full appetizer price!  Totally ridiculous!  And overall, the enchiladas were not very good at all.   My other issue was the bill.  There were 6 of us that ate.  When we were all finished eating, two of our friends came and joined us but didn't order anything because they were just waiting for us to pay and leave.  The menu clearly says gratuity added to parties of 8 or more.  Well when we got our check, sure enough gratuity was added!  I work in a restaurant and I know for a fact that you only count people who are eating towards the gratuity!  We all got the last laugh because we all tip at least 20% if not more wherever we go.  We gave the server his 18% and not anything more.  Needless to say, next time I am visiting New Jersey (which I do for 2 months out of the year), I will make sure to avoid this place and let everyone I know about my experience.
