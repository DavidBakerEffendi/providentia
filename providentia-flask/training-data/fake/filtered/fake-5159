We went back to NY and the first night we were there we headed back to Bistro since we never had a bad experience so far . With so many restaurants in NYC people usually never go back if they had one bad experience ,they move on . We sure went back because everytime we had great food Â and great service The owner remembered us which made us feel good. This place is a must go !
