I've been coming to Georgie's for several years now, ever since I was diagnosed with celiac disease and discovered they have a gluten-free menu here.  The GF choices are really great, there's an entire separate menu instead of just a few things marked "GF" on the regular one. I've come here so often more than half the staff recognizes me, and they're always friendly and ask how I'm doing. They also always point out when they have a new GF menu item or dessert -- this past weekend they even had GF cupcakes, which of course I had to try, and which were heavenly. I've gotten to be good friends with one of the servers, Sophia, and have come in a few times just because I know she's working. Although I've only ever tried the GF options, I've brought a lot of other non-GF people here, and they tell me the rest of the menu is really good as well. I'm so happy I found this place -- I love coming to a restaurant where I can count on all the employees actually understanding what gluten-free really means, and always being happy to see me.  Highly recommended. :)
