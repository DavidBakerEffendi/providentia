What a great dinner date spot. And the prices are amazing. The mussels are fantastic, and we loved the lasagna (so meaty), and tagliolini (seafood pasta). The staff was great and wine was really affordable. For dessert, we tried a bunch and the tiramisu won hands down. Great place, def a regular. FYI it's cash only!!
