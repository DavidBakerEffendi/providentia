I'm from Dublin Ireland and in October 2012 I paid a visit to some friends in Philly. On several occasions they took me to Cafe La Maude and I thought that the food and coffee were excellent. The owners and staff where great, really friendly and very helpful. The cafe has a fantastic atmosphere, it's the type of place where you can go relax, meet up with friends and enjoy your coffee and food. I look forward to going there again on my next visit.
