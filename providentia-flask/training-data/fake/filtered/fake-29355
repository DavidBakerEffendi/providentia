Absolutely amazing - easily the best late-night, drunk-off-your-chutzpah stop in Greenwich. I stole a bottle of the hot sauce. Sorry. On the other hand, when I went up for seconds, I left a $5 bill as a tip. Probably doesn't exonerate me any, but I tried to make it work. Delicious. Amazing. Go. Now.
