Me and my husband used to go here all the time when it was Sante Fe Grille.  We would love to sit at the bar on a Friday night, order some food and drink and chat with all the people that became our good friends over the years.  Now, there is absolutely nothing normal to order at the bar.  The pub fare is not my type of pub fare.  Shepards pie, mac and cheese, a burger served with an egg on top??  Where is the more casual bar food such as a Chicken sandwich and salads, etc...  This place has no idea how much business they're not getting just by trying to be different.  Put some normal things back on the menu and you'll see more people coming in for a nice casual evening.  If you have a lovely bar, the way you do, why waste it??  Just a suggestion..  When the menu changes a bit, we'll be back.
