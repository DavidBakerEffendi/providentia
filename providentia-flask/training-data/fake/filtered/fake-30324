I have been here several times with my boyfriend, and we absolutely love it!  Not only are the owners amazing individuals with a wealth of knowledge about their products, but the environment is rebelliously anti-Starbucks.  I say this meaning that many cafes tend to encourage an environment where individuals do not interact, but rather keep to themselves and bury their faces into a laptop or i-Phone. Infini-T is this warm, community environment that brings everyone together for a simple cup of tea and cultural experience. All in all, its a cute niche little place to stop for a great experience and a great cup of tea.  I would absolutely recommend Infini-T to anyone looking for something fun and new to do in Princeton, especially if its date night ;)
