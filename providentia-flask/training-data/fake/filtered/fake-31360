Have eaten here many times over the years and enjoyed it  but sad to say just had one of the worst meals ever. Food was warm not hot, dried out meatloaf, ribs were tough, fish was bony. Service was haphazard and coffee was cold.  Two stars for the mash potato and the wine. I really hope this was just an off night because it used to be great.
