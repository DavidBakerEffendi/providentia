The pizza's all right. Given that (a) this place is in New York, and (b) it bills itself as being some of the best pizza in an already pizzalicious town, I thought I'd be more impressed. I've had much better pizza at Pepe's and Sally's in New Haven. I ordered a plain cheese pie, which for me is the true test of how good a joint can cook a pizza. The sauce: great. The crust: just OK--good consistency, but not very tasty. The cheese: fine. The spices: fine. But it wasn't excellent. It didn't leave me drooling for more. What leaves me drooling for more (aside from the New Haven venues) is Ben's near the 4th St./Washington Square stop in Manhattan. Now THAT is killer pizza. I would go to Grimaldi's again. I just wouldn't rave about it.
