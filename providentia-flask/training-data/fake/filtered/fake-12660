I go there almost every day with my friends - mostly because we love pizza and its convinient for us. There have been many times that we have enjoyed our selves... but there are also sometimes that we cant wait to get out becuase of manny reasons. I have seen it get very busy, to the point where there is no where to sit. And when you pull up a chair, the sometimes rude and demanding owner will tell you to move. The food dose not compare to other placed in montclair like Ah' Pizz Â off of bloomfield avenue where the food taste just like it dose in Italy. The owner and workers are verynice... SOMETIMES. But once in a while you will have some rude college kids behind the counter helping you, or trying to help you. The owner is nice. He enjoys talking to his customers.. ALOT. But there have been times where he is rude and inpatient with kids trying to eat because he believe they dissrupt his buisness. But the way I see it is that the midddle school kids are the buisness, especially during the week.
