Great service and experience.Group eating style seating. Staff is very active and very accommodating. Lunch set for $3 more gets you a small side salad and a decent bowl of rice ( I got eel) in addition to your bowl of ramen. I got the classic. Hardy broth, thin noodles and well seasoned. Very solid bowl of ramen. Best I've had in a while.
