this restaurant, nice decorated, the worst food ever tried in a restaurant, from the soup to the main course took 45 minutes, the codfish was as salty as you could get, the wine was good, but the service ignore us, we had to remind the waiter to serve us, we were the only table in a Saturday night, we all regret to pay a visit, and never ever will go back to that place
