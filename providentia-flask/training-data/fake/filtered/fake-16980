I regularly visit New York (from the UK) and upon my latest visit, my friend Jenny took me to Gitane.  It was very busy but we were soon seated and ordering.  The host paid us great attention and he has since become a very good friend... I think I spent the majority of the rest of my trip hanging out with him and his friends. The food here is awesome (satay chicken a particular favourite) and the service is great.  What they say is very true, this is a very hip location - full of famous/notorious characters and extremely fashion savvy folk.  Gitane wouldn't be the same if this wasn't the case.  This is it's personality.  Very, very cool.  All the staff are interesting and beautiful.  Trust me. Go!
