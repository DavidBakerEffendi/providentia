Even before I knew that some people actually preferred Modern over Pepes and Sallys, I preferred Modern and kept it to myself. The pressure in New Haven to choose either Pepe or Sally is shockingly strong. But for me, Modern takes it. All are cooked at high temp and I believe all are wood fired, brick oven. Pepes is fantastic -- no doubt. Thin, classic "apizza " (pronounced "a-beets"). But modern, also thin, crisp (cinged around the edges) is not quite as greasy as Pepe's. A hidden jewel of Modern: the simply have the best calzone on the earth. Sally's was always a distant third for me (even fourth -- I actually thought that Naples made a great pie!). And as for potatoes on pizza? That is no pizza, my friends.
