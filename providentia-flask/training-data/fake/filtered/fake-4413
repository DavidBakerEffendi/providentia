Locals know best - the Bluebird is a great place for drinks and dinner. The Bar - short list of craft beers, but with Hill's Farmstead always on tap, there isn't much better in Burlington. The BBT is also, without a doubt, the best cocktail place in town. House infused liquors, inventive combinations, muddles, seasonal herbs and fruit, and even mushrooms set the cocktail list here well above what you will find around Burlington. Solid selection of local and small batch stuff too. Small Plates - From the start when the location was on Riverside, I would say the small plates have been the strongest dishes. The mix generally includes an oyster dish (with seaweed aioli, trout roe and maple sugar for example), game, pate, and seasonal salads. The double burger is excellent and a great value pick. I'd recommend sharing several small plates. For large plates, I'd say you probably want to be a carnivore, though we've had great ravioli and gnocchi. A shared large plate can be enough for two, and you can split several with a bigger group. We never hesitate to bring vendors or clients to the Bluebird, but it's at its best when you can hang out for a quiet drink and dinner with some friends. The staff is friendly, approachable and has extensive knowledge of the menu - helped along by a daily meeting and staff tasting. If you like interesting dishes and don't need any pretense, you will love the Bluebird. If you're picky or are looking for a plain old steak-and-potatoes dinner it's probably not for you. Check out the menu daily.
