This is the place to go!! My husband and I love this place.. The food is so delicious and the staff is good. We went to the Cuban restaurant named Mojitos on Washington ave and they cant come close to the taste of this food. I've gone a few times and love it there.. I highly recommend this place. My favorite is arroz con pollo. My husband loves the steak. The warm plantain chips with their signature sauce is so great. The only thing I'm not a fan of is their empanadas. I don't like the cornmeal crust. I think I will be here for my birthday..
