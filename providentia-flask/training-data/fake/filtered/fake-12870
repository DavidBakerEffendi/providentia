Imagine, dear reader, the most terrible pizza you've ever eaten. Utterly bland. Petrified cheese. Cups worth of grease lathered on top that serves no discernible purpose. Made with actual cardboard. The box it comes in looks like a tasty balanced meal by comparison. I thought I knew what this hypothetical pizza abomination tasted like. I thought I'd had enough stoner-late-night-delivery pizzas, enough middle-school-roller-skate-rink pizzas, to know the taste of something truly bad. Lord, was I proven wrong last week. I would not serve a single one of those 10 (10?) unpalatable slices to my cat. Even suggesting that might be grounds to investigate me for animal cruelty. This pizza really smelled like dog buns. I'm pretty sure they were trying to make it bad. You could form a think tank of chefs, put them in a kitchen with a single bunsen burner, and task them with making the blandest pizza known to man. They wouldn't even get close to this. Citizens of New Haven and West Haven, I beg you: don't do it. Â You live in the pizza mecca of the modern world. It's literally one of New Haven's coolest things. Take advantage of it. Go to Est Est Est, or Sally's, or Bar, or Modern, or Pepe's. Hell, even Yorkside. Anywhere really. Go to Sushi on Chapel and ask for pizza. They probably won't give you pizza, but it'll sure as hell be a better life choice. And to USA-1 Pizza: I would seriously consider a rebranding. Maybe USA-1 Hot Wings. Those were kinda decent.
