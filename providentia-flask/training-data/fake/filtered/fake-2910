so, im stranded in my dorm, hungry, cold, and a little bit of a hangover....Senioritas to the rescue!! I called for a delivery in this God forsaken snow and behold, they were open and delivered my food in about 40 minutes. The food was delicioso!! the portions were huge. I ordered this burrito hay carumba or something, along with buffalo wings and a tortilla soup(i know, i was hungry ok) the tortilla soup was like nothing i ever tried before, Â spicy, yet mild, filling and satisfying all at the same time. The burritos were filled with rice and beans, guac, salsa and sour cream! genius!!! the perfect combination. i couln't fit the buffalo wings so i saved them for later. Only downnote: THEY DONT DELIVER MARGARITAS, that would have really made my day,not to mention gotten rid of this headache. but hey, you cant have it all now can i?
