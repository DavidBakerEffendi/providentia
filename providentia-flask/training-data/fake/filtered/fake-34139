Given past reviews, I was hesitant to eat at Bistro Mediterranean & Tapas Bar but finanlly went  a few weeks ago with a friend who eaten there before. It was a wonderful experience & I am hard to please! My party of 5 had reservations for 7PM on a Saturday evening.  Three of our party called to say they would be 20-30 minutes late just as we arrived at the restaurant. We were greeted promptly on arrival; we explained the delay of 3 others and the staff were very gracious and understanding esp since it was a fairly busy night.  We were seated immediately, shortly thereafter a waiter approached to ask if we wanted drinks while we waited. Our wine & food orders were taken, once our party arrived. We had a large selection of tapas.  The food was outstanding esp the ceviche, short ribs, baccalao croquetas with aioli, shrimp in garlic sauce, lamb stuffed piquillos and the lamb chops. The queso de cabra was good but given the other fantastic choices, I would not order it again. Food was brought to table at good intervals so we were not rushed nor did we wait too long between dishes. For dessert we had the cheese assortment with serrano ( it is listed as an appetizer) with a muscadel wine recommended by the staff that was the best i have had-crisp, wonderful body with a deliciously light sweetness-perfect with the cheese platter. The service was very good; the owner and staff are aware of the negative reviews about the service and they told us they have worked to improve service.  Given my experience on my visit, they have been successful.  We are returning this weekend and I am hopeful we will have another delightful evening.
