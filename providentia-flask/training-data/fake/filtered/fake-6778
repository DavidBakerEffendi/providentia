I have heard of this restaurant before and decided to go for a late lunch i work around the corner. first thing i noticed was there was no one at the door to greet me so i ended up sitting my self , finally when i was noticed my waitress asked what i would like to drink but never brought me a menu after getting my drink i looked over the menu witch seemed average for pub food, i ordered the hickory burger with sweet potato fries . To my amazement the burger was cooked very well and very tasty but my fries were cooled. the service definitely lacked it seemed as though they were more concerned with socializing with the staff. I wouldn't recommend this restaurant neither will i be coming back!!
