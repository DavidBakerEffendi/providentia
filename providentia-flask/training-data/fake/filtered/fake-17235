Every single time I'm home be after deployments or just popping my head up in jersey I hit up Andros diner because of their food and family atmosphere there... The best part of the whole meal is when I eat their cheesecake after an amazing entrie, it's just yummy yummy in my tummy!!! Even my friends i bring home to jersey for the first time are like oh wow the food is unreal. Everyone who works in the diner is always in such a great attitude always smiling wih a positive attitude!!!! If I could get the food shipped to me I would..
