Absolutely the BEST dining experience since going gluten free!  My husband later told me he didn't think I was that happy on our wedding day!  (Sorry, babe.)  Gluten free bread sticks are AMAZING, the risotto was awesome, and the carrot cake rivaled my grandmother's.  My entire Gluten eating family enjoyed the menu too! This is the first time in almost 3 years I have ordered from a menu and not worried about getting sick later.  THANK YOU Risotteria- you are a God send.
