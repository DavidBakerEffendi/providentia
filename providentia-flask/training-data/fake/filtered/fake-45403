So i went to this spot after the GIANTS won and i was floored..... it was like i walked into scene from brown sugar b/c the vibe was very cool, laid back , & sexy without even trying! we were seated immediately and our seats were directly in front of this AMAZING violinist! talented is an understatement for this guy. he played everything currently on the radio! UH MAZ ING! Â then our drinks came and they were delish! food was outstanding! i had the red velvet waffle & chicken while my date had the shrimp lobster & grit's of the staff that worked there was very accommodating and friendly which is sometimes a rarity here in NY. Overall great experience and will definitely be going back & recommending. oh yeah that mac & cheese in a skillet rocked my WORLD along side my peach cobbler cocktail:)
