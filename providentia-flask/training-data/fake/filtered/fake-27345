Unfortunately we had a bad experience.  Something was clearly wrong with the service.  The food took over an hour to arrive.  The staff apparently lost the order and seemed to be having a bad day.  Several times they brought things we didn't order to the table, then had to try a few different table to see, for example, who ordered the pork. When we asked what kind of juice they have available, we got attitude and rudeness old that this is not a juice bar.  Seriously WTF.  They added some things we didn't order to the bill at the end.  The food itself, when it finally arrived was just fine, but the portions were small and overpriced for what it is.  The decor is fine for shabby hole-in-the wall hipster chic.  Definately not worth the trek over, will not be back.  Maybe whoever runs the place took the day off and we got the B-team or something.  Major disappointment.
