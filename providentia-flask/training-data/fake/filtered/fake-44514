I've never had a bad meal here. I've been here with my wife, family, and friends, and each and and every time, everyone comes out satisfied. The food is great, the service is friendly, and the prices are reasonable. Located in a great area of Philadelphia, it is the perfect spot to have lunch or dinner and then go exploring. This place also boasts a 2nd floor where you can throw parties, has a bar upstairs, and a dance floor. I threw my wife's birthday party here and it was a great experience. This place has it all. Great food, good prices, and customer friendly hosts and servers. I highly recommend it for anyone looking for a wonderful Indian restaurant.
