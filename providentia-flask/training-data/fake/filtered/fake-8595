DELICIOUS!!! I walked into this place with very high expectations and they exceeded my expectations and that is saying something. We inhaled everything it was so good. The kale salad and pork gyoza are a must and any ramen dish is mouth watering good. I can't wait to take everyone I know to this hidden gem!
