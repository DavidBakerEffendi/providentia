De Mole is the best mexican that we've had in the area.  The interior is very nice, the house-salsa delicious, and the specials excellent (I wish they would put the Chile Rellenos on the normal menu so I could have it more frequently and the fish tacos are worth an order if they have them when you're there).  Most everything we've had is good, but especially we've enjoyed the Carnitas (crispy pork) tacos, the Enchiladas Verdes con Espinaca, and (for any vegans out there) the Seitan burrito.
