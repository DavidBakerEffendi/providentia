A bit on the pricey side but if you take people there for work or perhaps first impression, it is a great place. Very loungey with great lounge sofas. Three-level offer great options from formal dining to chill-out. Portions varies. If you get the scallop it's literally $26 for three pieces which would be fine except the bacon/stuff at the bottom was super salty. The people that I was with order other things that was fabulous however with greater portion. I guess the seafood was just very small. Great wine list and great sangria. Don't expect to leave without dropping at least $200 for two though.
