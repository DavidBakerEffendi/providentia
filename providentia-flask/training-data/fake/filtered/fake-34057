I was travelling for work last month and stopped here for a quick lunch break. I'm a big fan of gyros and they didn't disappoint. Their Gyro Wrap had the tomatoes, cucumber, onions, and a delicious sauce. Served fresh, hot and fast. Their menu has is huge, I would've liked to try out some other dishes as well, but didn't have the time.
