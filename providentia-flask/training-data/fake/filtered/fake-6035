Don't get me wrong, when you go to Pat's you get a decent steak, but i think it has waaaaaaaaaay to much hype around it. This place has turned into a tourist trap. People drive anywhere from the tristate area just to get a Pat's steak. If i was driving 30 minutes to an hour for a steak I would definitely go to Steve's Prince of Steaks. Steve's is ten times better, but i like it because there isn't always a lot of people there. So in my opinion a good traditional spot, but not the best in the city.
