I come to Bocca Rossa usually once a month on fridays.  I come with my girls before a night out either in downtown or in WHC...we come here for two things....the music and the spectacular food!!  We always start off with the mouthwatering mozzarella bar that comes with five tapanades (adorable) fresh basil and fresh bread (a plus form Mozzicatos!)  My girlfriend Jill loves the Espresso martinis for they are not made too sweet like some places do.  I always get the carbonara because it is EXACTLY how I got it when I went to Naples three years ago...that egg on top is so different and more authentic than the dishes you can get around here.  I also love how the wine list is ecclectic, fine tuned, and that they offer barbaresco and barolo by the glass for a reasonable price.  I love the barolo they offer for it is only $12 a glass (usually places won't open up a barolo for you because it is an expensive wine) and it is completely mouth savoring.  (Goes great with the pancetta in the carbonara.)  Then on Fridays around 9pm the music hits..and my friends and I feel like we are in a downtown lounge in NYC.  I am from Astoria and anything that can give me that "at home feeling" like this place does, deserves applause.  I'll be back soon ,Bocca.
