This is an amazing little restaurant which has the best Chinese food in the area. I lived in New Haven for many years and had lots of Chinese food.  When we moved to EH, it was a great surprise to find this place after a trying a couple of others that were terrible.  by the way I found it because of the reviews here and tried it.  It is so good we serve it to friends who also are impressed.  We always use delivery and it is freshly cooked.  They call from the car and then bring it to the door.  Great shrimp rolls, and the shrimp anything has large fresh shrimp in it.
