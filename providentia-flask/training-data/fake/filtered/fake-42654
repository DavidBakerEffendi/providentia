This place was the worse Chinese restaurant I have ever been too.  To start off we walked in and the host was behind the front counter with other workers in front of the counter playing on their cell phones.  Then came the worse part.  We got our food which was cold and not good at all.  We were looking for something better then fast food to eat but honestly would of rather gone to McDonalds and had a greasy burger and cold fries then this food that myself and my fiancé regret that we ate and ever went to for dinner .  I would not suggest anyone to go here
