I was visiting NJ for Mother's day and happened to eat here. Let me start by I was shocked by the number of people waiting in line outside the door. My Brother had warned me but nothing could have preapared me for this kind of wait. So after about an hour wait we finally get a table for 8 of us and my second surprise the place is small can accomodate about 35-40 people and they had 5 waiters outside. Anyway we were famished and ordered a bunch of stuff right away. for the chaats we ordered Big Bite, Spinach Tikki Chaat, Bhel Puri, Dhai Puri. OMG I swear to anything I have not had such delicious chaats since leaving Delhi 10 yrs ago. Next we ordered Pau Bhaji, Chole with Masala Paneer Bhature grilled and Bajra Roti with Baingan Bhartha and some 5 different types of their famous Stuffed Paratha's......Let me remind u that Im from Delhi and nobody beats the parathas there but hats off the Khasiyat they can beat any paratha place in Delhi hands down ....Simply Superb food ... From next time whenever I visit NJ Im stopping here at least a couple of times to eat.
