The  wait staff clearly think they are in Sydney, where treating customers with disdain is the norm. I regret stumbling across this place . Being served by someone that can't  be bothered to open his mouth when speaking to customers or refrain from shuffling around like he was the most important person in the City was an incredibly annoying experience. Who cares what the food is like when you have to be in the company of such arrogant wait staff. There are a million wonderful places in New York where you can experience amazing food and welcoming service to say the least.
