We were frequent customers of NWP, but have decided to give it up and try other local places.   The wings are good, but not seasoned.  However, the 911 sauce is outstanding. Pizza is good, but not great, and has been delivered to us cold one too many times.  And it is overpriced.  I would love to continue to support NWP, but no more.
