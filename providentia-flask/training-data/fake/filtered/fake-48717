I was so excited to try out Eulogy after all the good things I've heard. My brother and his friends were in Philly for the weekend and I thought it'd be the perfect time to test it out. I have to say, I was impressed with their beer list, but everything else was so disappointing!!! To start, we made a reservation and when we got there we were just pointed to our table instead of taken to it. We sat down and realized that our tablecloths were DISGUSTING. Not just a few crumbs, but stains and chunks of someone's meal before us. It was gross. There was no apology or "we haven't had a chance to clean the table yet"... it was like it was totally normal there. When we asked our waitress if we could get a clean tablecloth she was noticeably annoyed. We waited for ten minutes before she came back to get our drink order. Another 5-10 minutes later she brought two drinks at a time to our party of 6. Same thing happened when the food came... we got two plates at a time. She had no idea whose burger was medium and whose was medium rare. I asked for another beer when my food came and had to wait at least another 5 minutes. We had no silverware, no salt and pepper, no ketchup... nothing. When we asked, she didn't even respond, she just walked away annoyed. It's not our fault there's nothing on the table! Anyway, I Â could go on and on because honestly it was just one thing after another. She had a bad attitude like she didn't want to be at work and that is so disheartening as a customer. If you don't like being here, why should I? The beer was good. The food was great. The service was so bad that I will never go back. It's a shame.
