I enjoy going to this place every couple of months. The ambiance is hispterish cool and the staff is very friendly. Is it authentic Mexican? No. I think the majority of their taco dishes are tasty, with the exception of the fish tacos which is breaded fish inside a taco- double bread really. However, the tacos are kind of tiny. I believe the best thing on their menu and value are their nacho dishes. Nachos kenzo is a huge plate with diff meats and quite satisfying. Their vaquero menu items are ok- but I wasn't crazy about their chili dog. Way too much stuff for the supermarket hot dog bun to hold. Even after I picked off some of the chili with the sauce- the hot dog went right through the bun as soon as I picked it up. Their margaritas are also good. Parking is usually ok. Staff is competent & friendly. The place in clean - even with their retro look. I have it 4 starts because they do not accept credit/ debit which is kind of a pain for those of us who do not like carrying cash around.
