We tried Magnolia's this Sunday for Father's Day and the food was good, not memorable but ok. The problem and the reason I five it one star is because when a member of our party went to the rest room, one of the staff was in the rest room and left without washing thier hands and went out and immediatley started serving food. Without thisI would ahve voted it a 3 but the lack of hand washing was a definate turn off and I think we will not return.
