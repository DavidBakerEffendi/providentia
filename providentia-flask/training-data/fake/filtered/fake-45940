This is literally the WORST place I have ever eaten. The only decent thing was the service, but the waiter was very creepy to my friend who was sitting besides me. The food is very bland, the place smells terrible,  the bathroom is covered in graffiti, and the furniture is vandalized. To my surprise,  even though this place is incredibly cheap, you still do not get what you paid for. Dont come here. I made a yelp account solely for this review.
