Let me begin with the decor. Yes, it is dated. It has the look of a banquet hall that has not be updated since the 80s. The majority of the clientele is in their late 60s-70s. My fiancee and I (both 25) were certainly the youngest there. Once we were seated, we were handed menus and the waiter disappeared. By the time he had returned, we were ready to order our drinks and food. My fiancee asked what was on tap and the waiter responded with a list of sodas. When my fiancee clarified that he wanted beer, the waiter said they had Coors Light and Corona. The food was very good. We had the smoked salmon appetizer which consisted of smoked salmon, arugula, and capers. It was a very nice combination. For entree, I had the Classic snapper and he had the Classic Long Island duck. Both were cooked beautifully, although the sauces were quite rich. My main complaint with the restaurant is the appalling spelling on the menus (Main and Dessert). Gelato was written multiple times with different spellings. Banana had too many Ns. Tomato had the addition of an E. A simple run through spell-check would do wonders for the overall impression of the Paris Inn. If they can't be bothered to make sure things are spelt properly, how can you be sure that they bother with other things? I'm not sure if I will return, although there are not many other restaurants in the area.
