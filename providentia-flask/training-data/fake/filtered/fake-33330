Last week I was spending some days in NYC when I came across Colicchio randomly, and IÂ´m so happy I did! I was there with my boyfriend and I dont know which one of us was more enthusiastic about every single dish that we got on our tables. I particularly recommend the Loup the mer and the Milk-fed Porchetta. Every ingredient is super fresh and tasty, cant stress it enough!
