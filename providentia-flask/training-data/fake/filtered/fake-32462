Been going there for 15 years.  First time I went there I was amazed how good it was.  It gets better each time. Bring cash, no credit cards.  Best baked clams you will ever have.  Family style with plenty of food.  Try the stuffed artichoke and shrimp luciano{you will ask for a straw to suck up the sauce}.  Pasta with clam sauce is pure heaven.  Ask for plenty of bread to sop up the sauce. Both the house white and red wine are perfect.   No reservations so prepare to line up on a saturday night and wait with the rest of us.  It will be worth it.
