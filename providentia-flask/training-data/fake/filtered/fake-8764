I don't always eat burritos, but when I do, It's Iztaccihuati. This place is fantastic! Authentic cuisine and even spanish soda all of it delicious. I ordered the burrito al pastor (marinated pork with a pineapple, mmmmmmm) and let me tell you, this was the best burrito I've ever had in my life! great wrapping and balance of ingredients with the perfect amount of spice (not too much! JUST RIGHT). Too cap it all off, the service was great right down to the speedy delivery. I will be returning.
