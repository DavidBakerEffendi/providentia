I've lived a block away from this place for many years and I'm embarrassed to say I've only eaten their once before until last night. We had an 8pm reservation and weren't seated until 8:30, but I half expected that to be the case because it is HUGELY popular and always crowded to capacity. We both Â had Rigatoni all'Amatriciana Fresh Tomato Sauce with Onion & Bacon which was AMAZING. A smaller portion than I would have liked but it really was some of the best Italian food I've had in ages (aside from my Italian mother's home cooking which always trumps everything else). We also had the stuffed mushrooms as an appetizer--quite good indeed.
