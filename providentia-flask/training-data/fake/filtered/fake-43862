Amazing food... this place sounds like just a regular pizzeria but they have all types of food, the service was amazing and very friendly. My girlfriend and I came to this place after passing it by for years on a saturday night and were very pleased that they had live entertainment not too loud where we could still talk but loud enough to enhance our dining experience. Thanks for a great dinner!!
