I went here for the first time with two of my friends, and It was hands-down the best pizza we ever had! There should however be a different name for it, because it doesn't taste like your ordinary pizza. The ingredients are so fresh and uniquely put together, and wood fired to perfection. If you explore the menu you will be pleasantly surprised by distinctly new flavors! The crust is also delicious and savory. The staff was very helpful and professional. It is a new item in town and it is getting more and more popular, experiencing it is a must! Â I can't wait to go back!
