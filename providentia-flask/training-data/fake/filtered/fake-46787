A++ pizza! I'm 13 right now and I've been going to pizza time since I was about 5. I love their pizza. It has so much taste that you just want more. The service is also wonderful, the workers are Italian guys that are so nice and really care for each customer. My uncle had cancer or growth on his cheek and when he got it removed he had a bandage on it. The guy at the counter said I really hope you get better my friend as he gave him his pizza. Wonderful pizza and service recommend to all and also recommend large pepperoni or plain pizza well done, makes it crispy!
