One of my absolute FAVORITE places to eat in NYC. A perfect place for a romantic date or just catching up with friends. There's always a great crowd, small and cozy place, awesome music, friendly staff.. and it doesn't hurt that the food comes in pretty generous portions! Unless you get a booth to yourselves, be ready to get extra comfortable with the strangers around you. It's nice that the place is small but that means really tiny tables and being squished with the other guests sitting about 10 centimeters away from you. Good for eavesdropping, bad for arm room. Please don't leave this place without ordering the CORN. A little pricey for nearly five bucks for two corns on the cob, but they aren't JUST corns on the cob. They're rolled (laced?) with cojita cheese and sprinkled with cayenne pepper... with a squeeze of fresh lime juice at your disposal. Warm and smoky right off the grill. An explosion of creamy, buttery, spicy and zesty goodness in your mouth. I'm getting giddy just thinking about it. ORDER IT.
