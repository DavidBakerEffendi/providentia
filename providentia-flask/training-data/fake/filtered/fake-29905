this was excellent ! eggplant rollatini was best we ever had -  definitley be back - the owners and chef were very attentive- they  were out of the ahi ttuna special and chef came over and suggested the scallops which were amazing - cooked perfectly served with an awesome arugala pesto really good! nice atmosphere too
