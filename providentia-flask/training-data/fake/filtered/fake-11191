I thought I would give this place a try a few days ago and I am sorry I did... The food was diappointing especially among all of the published hype. I had the pickled vegetable salad and broccoli rabe special pizza. The salad was not a pickled vegetable salad, aside from a pickled onion and carrot within a heap of lettuce. There was nothing special about it and I could have gotten the same at any salad place. The timing is also way off, the pizza came out about 2 minutes after my salad. I can't say how it would have tasted if I ate it right away but when I did eat it, it was very soggy and dripping with moisture. The pizza also had way too much cheese. I ended up having to rework the whole thing by pealing off layers of cheese to make it edible. Diasappointing all the way around!
