Highly recommended. I went with my boyfriend to celebrate his birthday. Our food came out so perfectly. It was well seasoned. We didn't need anything else. I had the Picanha and he had today's special Tuna steak. We ordered the cod fish cake appetizer, very good. We loved everything. The sangria was yummy too. I didn't have anything bad to say and I am kinda hard to please. The waiter was nice and friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu. The chef came out after to check if we liked the food and greeted everybody. You should give it a try, it is worth it!
