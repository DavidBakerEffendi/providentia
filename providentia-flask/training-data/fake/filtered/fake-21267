I am colombian,but this is not the real colombian food is a mix of many latin american food they are not really representing my country, please stop miss representing my culture, our food is better than that. The mojitos were the only good thing I had there. If you want to eat good Colombian cousine go to some of this restaurants, La pequena Colombia, El basurero, Caserolas, this is Colombia
