I came here to get the much-raved smoked gouda and bacon mac'n'cheese takeaway (to eat while waiting for a cronut from Dominique Ansel. It was about 5am and the restaurant was buzzing with people waiting to get a seat! I was greeted promptly but had to wait for a while (standing awkwardly at the door) for someone to come ask how he could help me. The place has a trendy vibe and cool ambiance and decor. The mac'n'cheese was wonderful and contained more bacon than expected!
