My favorite place to be. Everyone that works there is amazing, Every time I go to Dirk my colleagues and myself are treated with the best hospitality that you can get in this city. The beer is incredible and only gets better and better. The Â food is insane! Everything is very fair priced too. Trust me when I say there is nothing like Dirk The Norseman, by far the best bar around.
