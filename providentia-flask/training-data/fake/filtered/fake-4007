Came with a friend for lunch. We both got the lunch special: 2 rolls and miso soup for $6.99...a great deal!! The miso soup was delicious. I got a shrimp tempura roll and a California roll. The shrimp tempura roll was excellent. The California roll, however, was not that great. It was pretty much all cucumber, with barely any crab or avocado. The service was fantastic. The waiter was very friendly. The drinks and soup were brought out almost immediately after ordering and the sushi was made and brought out within just a few minutes. The waiter checked on us a couple of times. We also ordered a roll for take-out and the waiter did not forgot to bring out the roll with the check which I was very happy about. The restaurant is small but very clean. The only thing is when you walk in, there is no sign saying whether it is self-seating or "wait to be seated" but the waiter was very attentive, greeted us as soon as we came in, and told us we could sit wherever we could like. So although it was not a problem, it might be during busy hours for those who are eating here for the first time. I will definitely be going back for the lunch special!!!!
