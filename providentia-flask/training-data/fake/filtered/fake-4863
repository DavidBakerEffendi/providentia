This place is great, wide variety of menu options, polite and expedient service, and wait for it... they got my extremely complicated order perfectly right! It's a shame that now-a-days just getting what you ask for is a great surprise, but other places just can't get it right. Definitely stop in here next time you pass by, you'll be pleasantly surprised .
