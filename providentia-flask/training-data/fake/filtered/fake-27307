I requested a table near a window well in advance of my visit, but at the door was told that was impossible. The server (Matt?) was overly friendly and slightly obnoxious, even touching me at one point to adjust my collar. The food was good, as was the wine, but the presentation was lacking. Perhaps he didn't take presenting the wine to me seriously (even though I ordered it) because I was younger than everyone at my table? Food was good, but I wouldn't return due to the service.
