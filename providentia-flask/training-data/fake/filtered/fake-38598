This place gave me food poisoning. Took a bite of a burger I ordered well-done, it was rare inside. Waited a half hour for waitress to come back, she takes my burger, goes into the kitchen and returns with the same exact thing I gave her - still raw and with the bite mark I made in it. I've eaten rare burgers lots of times so I ate about half but I think they tampered with my food when they took it back into the kitchen. Had to call out sick from work the next day and almost went to the hospital. I called the store a few days later when I was better and the girl took my phone number and never called back. I called again everyday and finally got a manager to speak with me. He was very rude and condescending and told me it was all my fault and hung up on me when I asked for him name. I used to eat her at least once a week for lunch but since then I've told all my co-workers to avoid the place and quite a few have had the same problem with rare burgers.
