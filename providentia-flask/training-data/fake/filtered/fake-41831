Searched Yelp before making a reservation for pre-theatre dinner last Friday, July 11, 2014.  Decided on this place because the reviews were good.  WRONG!!  This place was terrible.  What a disappointment. First ordered salad (spinach, goat cheese, walnuts).  Mediocre and overdressed.  That wasn't the worst part...half way through my salad our entrees arrived.  Why are we being rushed through dinner. Entrees weren't good at all.  My boyfriend ordered the pasta special (chicken, broccoli, sundried tomatoes in garlic and oil).  Literally needed a magnifying glass to find the chicken, broccoli or anything other than just pasta... I ordered the monk fish special.  I can guarantee the fish was frozen, definitely not fresh fish.  Rubbery and no taste. Won't be returning here for dinner or any other meal for that matter. Don't waste your money on this restaurant.
