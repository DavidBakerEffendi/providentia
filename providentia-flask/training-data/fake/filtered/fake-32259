Beware, it's a really tight space. You might be hearing more of the convo at the table next to you than the one at your own table! But everything else about it was pretty decent. I wasn't much of a fan of the mushroom things everyone else seems to love--what even are those?! The food was moderately priced for what you're getting though I guess. I went with friends on a Friday evening, so I dunno if it's like this at other times (looks like more neg reviews for the brunch crowd), but it was a pretty okay scene as far as ambiance or whatever and my group took major advantage of the BYOB policy and brought a shit ton of alc. So after we started drinking I think everything actually got better. My overall feeling is ehhh but it can be good if you bring enough beer.
