Tried a few things of the menu and the only thing I fell in love w/ was the cuban arepa. It was uber delicious! Also had the pernil empanada which although was overly stuffed with pernil, was yummy! The other items I tried like the empanada wih feta and spinach and broccoli and cheese were just ok. It's a whole in the wall type of place, w/ small tables right next to each other but the prices are not bad.
