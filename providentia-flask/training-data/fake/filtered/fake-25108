It was not the best place but I liked it. I've read and heard about these Brazilian burgers but never tried one until now. Altas Horas Â yes, they make big burgers! I ordered the X-Banana with a side of fries, and let me tell you--that sandwich/burger monstrosity was DELICIOUS! You get sweetness from the corn and banana, crunchiness from those mini potatoes, richness from the mayo, saltiness from the beef patty, and softness from the buns... all kinds of contrasting action happening in unison. Five of us piled into my car and found parking 100 feet from the front door-down on this end of Ferry St. the parking isn't too bad.
