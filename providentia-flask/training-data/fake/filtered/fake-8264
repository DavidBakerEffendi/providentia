My friend and I went to National Mechanics yesterday in search of a great veggie burger. We ended up channeling our inner big girls and ordered calamari, nachos grande, veggie burgers with fries and bread pudding. Everything was amazing! The calamari was cooked perfectly, the nachos where huge (the barback wished us luck when he dropped them off), the guacamole was the best I've ever had and the veggie burger had my friend making her "O" face in the middle of a room full of legal clerks that gradually seemed to move their party around our table. Our waitress, Mackenzie, was awesome and moved us over to a booth when some of the other patrons seemed to be unaware of personal space etiquette. By the time we made it to coffee and bread pudding the barback was calling us tanks and we knew we were in love with this place. Everything from the atmosphere to the food to the service was fantastic. We can't wait to go back!
