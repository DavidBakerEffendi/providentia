A wonderful tasty surprise when I was visiting Phili Chinatown. I had lamb skewer, chicken wings, squid and pork sausage. Lamb was soooo soft and juicy. Wings were different than any grilled wings I had before. Tender, fully-flavored but not greasy at all. My favorite is the squid. Genuine northeastern China style. I also tasted the hot pot bowl, the other main dish they had there. There were around 30 types of contains to choose from. The base soup is newly brewed using veal bones every other day. The taste is just just amazing. Strongly recommend it to anyone who want to try something "new, special and tasty" in Chinatown.
