WOW!   I really owe one to my work colleague that told me about this place.   Great dinner -- amazing ricotta, handmade pastas, grilled octopus and interesting desserts.  Very friendly service.  Extensive wine list.   Nice contemporary decor.  And all reasonably priced ... am I really in NYC?!!!     Pinch me I must be dreaming.   I actually AM dreaming about my next return to L'artusi.
