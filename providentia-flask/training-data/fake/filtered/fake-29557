The food is delicious but the service was horrible. I am a Hispanic American, I went there with my girlfriend that was also Hispanic and we were treated terrible. Â We got there and no one greeted us or told us that there were seats in the back. People came in after us of Caucasian descent were greeted and were given food before us. I Felt mistreated and so did my girl friend.
