Excellent food, simple menu, nonchalant service, characteristic and old-school (but sometimes grumpy and aloof) host. Still, it's the best pizza place under the bridge. But try to avoid weekend evenings. Looong lines of tourists that stretch down the avenue. Oh, and make sure you bring cash. They don't take cards and their ATM charges $4!
