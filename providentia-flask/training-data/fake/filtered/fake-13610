Absolutely delicious food, excellent service, wonderful atmosphere, and appropriately priced. Just got home, and the first thing I wanted to do was reward them with a great review. A warm mix of romantic and friendly, with fresh and desirable dishes that make you feel good eating them (the sauces were especially impressive), it was the perfect night out.
