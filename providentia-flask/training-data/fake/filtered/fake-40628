I went there with about several people and almost everyone loved their food.  The swordfish is so-so and their veggie pastas (the ~$23 special - only thing vegetarian) was really really bad.   We also ordered the Calamari (appartizer) and it was more than enough for everyone, great deal with a group. The service is great and the staff is very very friendly.  If you are a meat eater and want a nice meal with nice atmosphere, this place is great.
