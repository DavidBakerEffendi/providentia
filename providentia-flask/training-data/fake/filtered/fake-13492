I love HJ House! I stumbled across the small little restaurant by accident awhile back and immediately fell in love. It's seating area is very small and whenever I go it's fairly empty and quiet, which makes it a great place to get away from the Burlington crowds that take up the other restaurants during the evenings. This place has the best sushi in town and fantastic noodle bowls! I have yet to get a meal that I haven't loved. The prices are very reasonable; excluding the sushi you can get a large meal for a very low price. Although I'm sure their Japanese food doesn't compare to what you would find in a big city, it's great for what you'll find in Vermont. I highly recommend this place!
