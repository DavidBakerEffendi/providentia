we love sushi!  decided to try this one for lunch last week, did not like it at all.  the seaweed wraps were thick, tough, and chewy.  Hubby ended up spitting most of his out, and I gagged on mine with each bite.  The seaweed just would not go down well.  THe portion size was ridiculous, compared to other top or even low notch places we have visited.  Service was ok.  Would not go back at all.
