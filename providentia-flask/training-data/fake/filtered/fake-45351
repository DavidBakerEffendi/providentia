The food here is good, but there is a tendency for excessive sweetness -- the mashed yams are an example (way too much sugar added), and even the collard greens were sweetened.  Their specialty cocktails also are very sweet.   I had the blackened salmon, ordered it medium rare, and it was perfectly cooked.
