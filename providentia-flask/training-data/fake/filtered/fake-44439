I love this place. Everyone who is complaining about the long lines needs to realize that the reason the lines are so long is because its a place everyone wants to hang out at. Nothing beats 2.50 six point on draft, amazing 2.00 corn on the cob and an amazing atmosphere. If you get there around 5 you beat the after work crowd and can score a table all night for you and your friends and none of the staff ever hassle you to get up. I've been there until they closed! Super cute girls at the bar, and if you're extra friendly to them they'll often top off your drinks a little more. Like someone else said, a great place to bring big groups especially if you can't all get there at the same time. Yeah Habana!
