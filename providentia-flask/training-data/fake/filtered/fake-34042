Food Quality: Fresh & Tasty, but not memorable Service: Inattentive and Slow Pricing: Overpriced for what you get My wife and I dined here tonight, on Sunday.  We entered around 5:30pm and the place had just a few people on the inside. Despite this, our sloppily dressed server was VERY SLOW to bring our simple drink order over. After asking someone to send server over, we entered an order for a Grilled Seafood appetizer special for $25.00, and a Braised Lamb special for $21.00.  Both dishes were generous in size and came out after 10-15 minutes and both tasted good.  Server took forever again to realize we were done, which enabled us to stare at our dirty plates for 15 minutes.   Afterwards, we walked over to dessert case, where the Asian woman who is co-owner of this place allowed us to try one of the deserts.  We proceeded to order 2 orders of pistachio baklava to go, only to learn when we were handed the bill that they were $7.50/each or $15.00 in total - this admittedly gave me some serious price shock. Now that I've tried the baklava after returning home, I can confirm that it tasted ordinary and was a total rip off. My wife and I do not plan to return here again.
