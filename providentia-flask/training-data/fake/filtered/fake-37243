This place is worth the 45 minute wait on a weekend. First of all this location is downstairs with overhead windows so the place is dim which is great for romantic dates or first impressions. Â Second they have live Jazz performers playing while enjoy the artwork randomly place around the restaurant. Third is the food, its American cuisine and there is many choices to pick from. It can be very pricey unless your ordering a burger but i think its worth the money for something like a rib eye or a seafood platter. The drinks can be very pricing too so be care full on how much you have to drink if you really don't want to break your pocket.
