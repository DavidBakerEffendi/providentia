I work at the Red Onion, so let me give everyone a few pointers about the place. If you want a more personal experience at the Red Onion, we can provide. But, you can't come in at 12:00-3:00 and expect this. We are extremely busy and are doing the best that we can. On a normal day, we will have a line out the door throughout this time. So we feel it is best to get people their food as quickly as possible. This means that if you are waiting in line, PLEASE figure out what you would like as best as you can before ordering. There are so many people who stand in line and actually don't look at the menu until they get to the register. A couple more pointers: a) A heated sandwich takes time, we do not have a toaster or a microwave, everything is done in the oven. Please be patient; if you're in a hurry, don't order a hot sandwich. b) Please have your entire group stick with one server, we move much faster through the line this way. c) We DO have salads, they are listed on the middle board and usually sold by the pound. We also have green salads (Chef, Caesar and House). d) Coffee refills are now free e) The only way we don't lose money on sandwiches is by charging this much. We personally roast four turkeys a night for our sandwiches. This gets expensive. If you don't want to see prices go up, please try not to use your credit cards for orders under $7. We actually lose money when this happens. f) If we tell you there are no loaves for sale that day, then we are not joking. Unfortunately, on busy days, we can't afford to sell you one. As a staff member, we do care. Problems arise when people don't understand quite how we operate. As a side note, we bake all of our own goods, besides the baguettes, bagels and french rolls. These come from local companies in our area.
