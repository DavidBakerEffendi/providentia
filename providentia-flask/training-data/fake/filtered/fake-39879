I TELL YOU I WAS IN HEAVEN!!!!!!!!!!!                                                                                            Everyone within some of these reviews I have read they say the lines are at pepes across the street but have you ever gone there its pizza and just negative ok pizza. Tony and Lucilles Is FOOD REAL FOOD real people that run it,  there all family,      and it shows how much they care, warm and friendly. Even though I ate most of my meal and polished off a bottle of Chianti I still had room for an Espresso and of course Dessert  the best and...............................                                                           I MEAN THE BOMB OF ALL BOMBS      " THE CANNOLI"                                                   Homemade in house, crunchy and creamy,  I just can't say no more........                 GET there to eat I can't wait to go back. I could never say anything negative because this restaurant is so positive all the time everytime!                                                                                                                                      Thanks for being in business for ever.
