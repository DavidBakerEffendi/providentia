My wife and I like Thai food a lot.  Started eating in the early '80s when it broke in California.  Sri Pra Phai is pretty fair, but does not live up to the hype.  Food is good but on par with other good Thai places around the city.  Service staff is uneven and the buzz probably puts too much load on them and causes the service issues.  We were rushed to finish, and change was not returned until we asked for it.  (We left the change, but that should be OUR choice, not an assumption.)  Food is fine but avoid busy nights and don't make a special trip.  I could name two other restaurants in Queens that are as good, and some in Manhattan and Brooklyn that are better - mostly for the service and atmosphere.
