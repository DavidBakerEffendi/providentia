If you are looking for a nice quiet, not busy place, Abyssinian is a great place. The food is absolutely delicious. If you like Middle Eastern food, Ethiopian is very similar. Its located in between Monte Albom and Tisane in the West End of Hartford. The owner also gave a walk through of how to eat the Injera bread. I started off with the Tima Tim Salad for appetizer, and had the Doro Tibs for the main course. I was so impressed with the food I got an order to go as well. The food is very reasonably priced and very friendly service. It was really a great surprise how good the place was. I highly recommend you try it if you never have had Ethiopian food before.
