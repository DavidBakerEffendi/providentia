We thought a 5:30PM reservation was like the early bird special and we were thinking we'd have to keep it down amongst the "seasoned" Tavern-goers. But no! The restaurant was a buzz and very festive. We even sat near Kramer from Mad Money! The pre fixe menu was perfect and the Dark and Stormies were even better!
