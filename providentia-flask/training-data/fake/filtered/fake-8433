Ate here last night with a party of four. Great spot.  We liked the space immediately and were seated within a minute of arriving.  It's a fun, warm and unpretentious setting-perfect for an evening with friends or a date.    Our server was attentive, friendly and knowledgeable.  Favorite app was the brook trout, but liked the duck leg and the buttered clams too.  The crispy duck breast entrée was terrific, as was the hanger steak.  Capped off the evening with a yummy lemon bar.  Have already made reservations for a return visit.
