Stopped in while in west Hartford Ct. on business Thursday 7/11/13. Never heard of Max's before. Grew up harvesting oysters and clams as a day adventure and treated the family to the days catch. Old Connecticut Yankee with soggy Topsiders. So I think I know good seafood when I come across it. (rarely these days). Max's is absolutely my third favorite place after Provincetown's Lobster Pot,(an institution for decades), and Cap's Place in Pompano Fl. Everything,especially out server Guliana, the seafood,meat, beer and wind selections,decore, the whole Magilla was off the chart great. I write this because some who frequents Red Lobster gave the establishment a not so favorable review. "sorry but Max's doesnt have LOBSTER FEST on it's menu...Next time those people should get the Dollar Menu Fish Sandwich !!   As Aahnold said once, "I'll be back".  Kevin McClellan, Danbury, CT.
