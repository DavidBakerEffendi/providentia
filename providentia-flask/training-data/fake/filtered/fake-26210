Decent quality, but tiny, tiny portions at a big price. You'd think the debu guy who runs it would put more consideration towards scale. $60 for a snack. Bozu in Williamsburg is much better in terms of food, atmosphere, and price. Debu guy can make a killing because of the location and lack of competition. This is the first time I've been compelled to write a review on yelp.
