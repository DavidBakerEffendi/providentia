Can't recommend it. We live nearby and have tried four times. First time was lunch, had nice pizza with egg on it. We enjoyed our first visit. The next three visits were not good. Food was ok, had some nice short ribs. But numerous issues - out off food selections, out of drink selections (tip-don't recommend a drink selection you only have one of!), poor service (four people but only got two drinks, bartender forgot the other two!). But really the main reason we will never go back is the incredibly in attentive and RUDE hostesses. We are nice people, always smile, say hello - we know you get what you give. So absolutely no reason to be treated like we are bothering them by trying to eat there. We are professionals, no kids, eat out a lot, and have a good time wherever we go - unfortunately can't here. Which is not good since we try to support our neighborhood businesses.
