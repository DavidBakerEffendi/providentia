My Husband and I rang in the New Year at Hot Tomato's...And Yes, It was Hot!!!! Â We had great service,(which is so hard to get on New Year Eve) and the dinner was over the top, GOOD... We dance the night away to a great band.... and then watch the fireworks from the front patio at midnight. We ended the night by walking right across the street to our hotel room, which had a awesome view of the Capital Building in Hartford... This is a New Year Eve we will never forget... Thanks to Hot Tomato's!!!!!
