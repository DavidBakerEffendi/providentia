I had my rehearsal dinner at Fitzgeralds' private room Sidecar. The staff were extremely responsive during the planning stages and friendly and helpful during the event. They were able to accommodate a few special menu requests as well. The food and atmosphere (exposed brick, fireplace) were perfect. The best part was that they took care of everything with minimal work on my part (as I was extremely busy planning every little detail of my DIY wedding!). I highly recommend Sidecar at Fitzgeralds 1928 for private events!
