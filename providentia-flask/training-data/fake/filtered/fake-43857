The husband and I decided to eat at Chips because we heard mixed reviews about the place and figured we would try it for ourselves. I had the "two eggies" with added birthday pancakes and he got the steak and eggs with home fries and bacon pancakes..yes..bacon pancakes! The food was okay but the portions for the price it was, was pretty sad. His steak looked like something from a frozen box at Walmart and the pancakes were nothing compared to the raves we heard about them. I would call them "doughy." Things that you would see automatically added to a meal at other restaurants ( bacon, eggs, toast, homefries, etc.) were an additional outrageous charge. Needless to say, our mediocre meal came to over $40.. Next time we are craving breakfast for dinner, we will go to the cracker barrel where quality meets quantity, and surely meets the price.
