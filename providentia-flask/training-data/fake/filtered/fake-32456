We just dined at Il Triangolo and had a fantastic meal.  The homemade pasta and bread were outstanding - as good as any we have had in Italy.  The Tiramisu had a wonderful chocolate smooth, rich taste - the texture was perfect.  I generally am a difficult customer to impress - I was this evening at Il Triangolo.
