Cosmis is a rare find in philly. An uderrated and relatively unknown cheesesteak shop. Every time someone from out of town hits me with the "where can i get a real philly cheesesteak?" question I try to convince them to go to Cosmis. They usually look at me with suspicion probably because I didn't say Pats or Genos or any of the other famous places. I suspect most of them end up at 9th and Passyunk anyway.
