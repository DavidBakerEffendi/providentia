$2 smoothies on Tuesday are amazing. You pick what 4 fruits you want so it is truly your own creation. I also had the Beef Shawarma Wrap. Was very nice and very filling. They've changed their hours recently (I think for Ramadan) so I actually went there at 10pm and was great that they were still open. Very quiet at that time too.
