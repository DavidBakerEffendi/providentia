I applaud these guys for the success they have worked so hard for and they deserve every drop.  That being said, no bad mojo going your way.  I wish you many more  years of success. I've been dying to try this grilled cheese since it's beginnings.  I stopped one afternoon on York St. for a bite.  $5 is a little steep for a grilled cheese and I don't care what type of artisanal cheese you're using.  Oily to the point where I burned the tip of my tongue trying to bite into it.  Is it flavorful?  Absolutely, but very oily.  Grilled cheese is a simple concept, but the flare they add with the add ons is very creative and flavorful.  Workers are very pleasant to deal with.  Line moves at a steady pace.  Just that price is steep.  I can go to the corner of York and Elm and get a HUGE burrito or cheese quesadilla for $5 (not the guy across from Au Bon Pain) and still have some left over for dinner.  Again, these guys are out there hustling, doing a good job and are very nice.  I can say that I tried it and encourage others to do the same at least once and have them decide on their own.
