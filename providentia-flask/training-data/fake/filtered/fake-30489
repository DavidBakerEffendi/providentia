So came after we realized that DiLorenzos was closed on Monday. We walked in about 7 of us, it seemed like I was back in the 1950's. Everyone in the place turned in our direction, as if they've never seen any colored people in their lives. Even the staff broke their necks and made us feel uncomfortable. I then asked if I could plug my phone into the an outlet. Moments later a family was seated at the very both I was charging my phone. The useless, fat waiter then asked if it was our charger and just gave it back to me instead trying to be helpful and find me a new outlet. Za is decent... Ordered a "to go" pie, I heard one waiter tell our fat/rude waiter that our pie was ready. I had to ask ten minutes later so that our group could finally leave this absolutely unwelcoming racist place.
