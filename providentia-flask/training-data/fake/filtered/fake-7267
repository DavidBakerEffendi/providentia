We had a great dinner at a hole in the wall in NJ and decided to end the night with desserts at Balthazar.  What a MISTAKE!!!!!! Walked in the place and right behind us, three drunk and very rude guys almost knocked us down trying to get in the door. The host decided to ignore us and greeted the three guys that for some reason she knew  by their first names. I just asked if there was space at the bar and before I even finished she rudely replied..." There's an hour WAIT!" ok! I just decided to walk over and see for myself. To my surprise, there were two empty bar stools. My wife and I sat down and were greeted by a lanky female bartender that didn't look like she wanted to be there another second. Anyway, we ordered a half bottle of white and three desserts. Fifteen minuets later...they were plopped right in front of us and that's that! No..enjoy or how are your desserts or even would you like some coffee with that. I guess if your not someone important at Balthazar, your just a number in the never stopping revolving doors of the NY city restaurant night scene! All I was looking for was for some old fashion down to earth hospitality to finish off a great dinner. I have run fine dinning, casual spots, night clubs and gastropub venues for fifteen years and finding good service now in these days, is like finding a needle in a hay stack. I could have spent that $100 on the ASPCA.   STARS Equal - ***** Excellent  **** Great *** Good ** Ok * Terrible Service  * Food * Value *   Atmosphere **
