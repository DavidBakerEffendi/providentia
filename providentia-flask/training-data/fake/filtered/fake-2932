I've been to Cuban Pete's about 6 or 7 times. The place is always very loud.  The music is blasting. There is so much running around by the servers and busboys. It's not a relaxing place or a place to have a conversation over dinner.  We went there because the food was very good except for yesterday. The Maduros were so ripe they were like mush and they plopped so much on the plate that we were given very little rice. So, we had to order more rice. The black beans had no sauce..so we had to ask for more sauce. My daughter ordered the half boneless chicken with Cuban Mojo.It's funny , when they take the bone out you also lose the thight. It's to far a ride for the disappointment. Won't be going baclk....
