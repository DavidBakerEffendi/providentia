Although we did have to go in the early evening because reservations were scarce, it was worth it because the food was so good. The special appetizer lobster and gnocchi, mussels, burger, minetta steak, and chocolate souffle are AMAZING. The restaurant itself is very small but I did not feel like I was sitting on top of other people, even with it being 100% full.
