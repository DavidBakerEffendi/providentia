Best Vegetarian Food.. I thought Anjappar is only Non-Vegetarian food. I was wrong. They have added a lot of vegetarian dishes recently. I had Gobi65 and Vegetarian Thali(meals) and my wife had Parotta with Vegetable Kuruma. Service was decent. Everything was great and I hope they keep the same quality.
