The egg waffle is fine, and the price is cheap. You can only spend less 5 dollars for a good lunch. I have ordered the chiang fun, steam bun and egg waffle. BUT...Steam bun is  a  little too sweet for me, so as chiang fun....I was expecting more salty flavor...But overall, the staffs are nice, and they have plenty of different kinds of dim sum... i will try again but to try different things...
