GREAT beer, only SO-SO food, and spectacularly AWFUL service (think a cross between Boston & Paris with a South Philly twist). Burger was overcooked (even though they highlight their house-ground beef). Incredibly long (20+ minute) wait before any server arrived. Then we were finally greeted by a surly attitude from a server telling us they don't let you sample any of the draft beers. Finally, she agreed to bring one sample when I said I didn't know many of the drafts. Anyway, even a great beer isn't worth this kind of treatment... er ... 'service'.
