The restaurant IS blazing hot, especially near the front.  But if you navigate your way to the rear, it is noticeably cooler and the space is beautiful too.  I went last week with one friend and two bottles of wine.  He ordered a pizza that he said was very good.  I ordered the swordfish, but was told they were out.  However, they substituted grilled tuna (which wasn't even on the menu) and it was lovely.  Not only was the food delicious, but it took just 10 (maybe 15) minutes for it to arrive at our table.  The waitstaff was attentive, competent, and downright pleasant.  What a refreshing addition to the neighborhood!  I'm looking forward to an expanded menu in the future.
