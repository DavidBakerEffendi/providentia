This place was recommended to me by someone who lives in Corona Queens, so I though it must be good since Thai restaurants can be found almost anywhere in NYC. Just had dinner here tonight, and think this is one of the best Thai restaurants I've ever been to and I've been to quite a few. The food was fresh, and the service was good. The place was really crowded for a Tuesday, and there was a line waiting to be seated! Had the tom ka gai soup, fried calamari, curry puffs, fried tofu, mussels, Thai beef salad, and pad thai. Everything was delicious! Highly recommended! The only con is that they are cash only and don't accept credit cards, and I didn't know until I got there. So had to run out and get cash.
