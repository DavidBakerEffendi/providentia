I was debating whether or not to try this place, or go to a restaurant we've already been to, for my birthday this year.  We decided to come here to try something new and I am so glad we did!  It is a very cute restaurant, small but cozy.  When we walked in, there was a old man playing some sort of wooden wind instrument, setting the tone immediately.  The food was amazing.  We ordered pad thai, drunken noodles, and the lettuce wraps, which all tasted so good.  They also had nice cold sweet tea.  When we were walking back to the car, we noticed a small garden of herbs, which means that all of their seasonings was fresh!  I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for delicious Thai food in a new and fun environment!
