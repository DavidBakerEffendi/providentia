After the change of ownership, Cafe Twelve got a decent spruce up.  But while the interior got some new paint, the desserts and snacks that I enjoyed are no longer available; the current offerings are not as good as they were before.  The hours are TERRIBLE.  How can a city coffeehouse in a gay district shut down at 7 PM every night???? Cafe Twelve would be out of business in a second, if it kept those kinds of hours in Paris or New York, let alone Philadelphia.  Even my favorite hamburger joint, now over 60 years old in my native Connecticut, keeps longer hours than this place.  Cafe 12 still offers my favorite iced tea.  But there is also a Starbucks and another coffeehouse (Cake and Beanstalk) within a block from Cafe 12.  Cafe 12 needs to get its act together.
