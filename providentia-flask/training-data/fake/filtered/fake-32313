Don't try this truck!!!!  I dont usually do reviews but after reading such high reviews, and driving an hour drive in traffic, I felt I must review this food.  The food was horrible. The chicken was too spicy with an after taste. They served regular white rice with a slight yellow tint instead of basmati yellow rice and the white sauce taste like mayonnaise. I love Halal chicken and I was greatly disappointed. I've had better food from the trucks near Jamaica ave.
