From the minute we walked we could feel the Cuban flare and we're greeted by the friendliest staff.  Atmosphere was trendy and upbeat.  Bartender was knowledgable and instinctively knew what we wanted to drink and they were perfect.  Wait staff was very attentive and pleasant.  The small plates and appetizers were all absolutely amazing, we tried a bunch and liked each one better than the next.  Highly recommend the guacamole and chicken croquettes, vaca Frits, market fish and lamb curry.  Desserts are a must.  We left are congratulations to the chef for a great dinner.  A definite go to in Philly.
