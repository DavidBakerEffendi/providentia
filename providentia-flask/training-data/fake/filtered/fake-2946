The food here is great! The servers are okay but the management is terrible!!!!!!!!! We were sitting at the table and before we even paid or finished or wonderful conversation they began connecting tables to our table for another party. Then had the party stand behind us and hover over us while we were sitting there. One of the guys from that party approached our table and tried to apologize saying that they were told to stand there by the manager and they werent trying to make us feel uncomfortable. But obviously people looking over our shoulder standing up made us feel uncomfortable. After getting up because we felt as though we were no longer wanted as customers we approached the manger to let us know that the situation made us feel uncomfortable and it was kind of rude. He did not like our comments in front of the many people waiting and told us that we shouldnt come back then. I will never go back because clearly the management feels as though they have more then enough customers to not have to make everyone feel welcomed.
