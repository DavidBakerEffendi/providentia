I've eaten here in the winter and the spring and the ambience is great. Outdoor fireplaces set a comfortable, country house feel. During spring the outdoor seating lends itself to talking with friends after a meal. I ordered the grilled natural turkey burger, because I don't eat beef. As far as turkey burgers go, it was okay. The shoe string thin french fries were also okay. On another occasion when I was back to being vegetarian, I ordered the gluten free farmers seasonal vegetables and creamed spinach, which were pretty good. The after work cocktail hour is packed and a great place to make friends. I went to a meet-up there on a Wednesday and I became good friends with a woman new to the Princeton area. I recommend it.
