Always fresh delicious and yummy food Highly authentic indian food and highly recommended. The owner Mr Vijay Vyas Â is very friendly,warm and gives good hospitality to the customers. The servers are also friendly and attentive. One should definitely try their vegetable biryani which is very delicious and not very very spicy. Try to finish with either their masala tea or mango lassi.Price fits everyone's pocket. The place is compact and clean and the music is soothing to ears . Your first visit here will always tempt you to go back again and again.We will be frequenting the restaurant more and we would highly recommend this restaurant. We would like to suggest Dhokla to be included in appetisers May this restaurant be a place home away from home for everyone
