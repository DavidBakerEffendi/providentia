Ok I can admit that the pizza here is good.  It's not groundbreaking.  I've had better and I've had worse.  I made a reservation ahead of time, and when we arrived we spent some time outside because you couldn't get in the door.  Once we came in and said we had a reservation we were seated....although they didn't ask my name or anything to confirm.  As we sat trying to decide, the waiter came by and threw a couple of additional menus at us.  Literally, threw.  A minute later he came by and threw more down on our table.  Apparently there was no where better to put them.  We kindly stacked them for him. My boyfriend first attempted to order heineken.  They were out.  When we got our drinks in, it took twenty minutes to get them, which is nothing, because the pizza took an HOUR AND A HALF.  No exaggeration, we timed it.  The place was teeming when we came in, but by the time our pizza showed up more than half the tables were empty.  And like I said it was ok. And they don't take CASH.  They charge for CHEESE...so a large pizza with a couple toppings is well over twenty bucks, but you can't pay with a card. Go to Bar.  Seriously.  It's way better, the waiter won't throw things at you, and you'll eat before your stomach eats you.  My basic impression of Sally's is that they feel like they've been around forever so you can have it their way or screw yourself.
