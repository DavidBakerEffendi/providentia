The family owned restaurant is as enjoyable and as friendly a dining experience as you will find in Bayonne. The Italian cuisine is a cut above the typical chicken parmigiana fare (but they have that, too, and do it and calamari better), and offers dynamic combinations of Italian favorites with unique and well-rounded preparations, and daily specials that keep the experience fresh each time. This is a place where everyone knows your name, from staff to the regulars. There is no better spot for consistently good, diverse and priced-right Italian cuisine in town.
