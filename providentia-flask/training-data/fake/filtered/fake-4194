Several issues with staff , they don't really know what they have , and I herd a lot of we are out of that . Also the timing of when you receive your meal is way off , I finished my meal before my party of 3 even received there's . price is an issue , I spent $17 for a little bit of teriyaki chicken and a cup of rice as they said they were out of salad ..... Also $2 for a can of soda they don't have anything on tap so apparently u just buy cans of $2 sodas
