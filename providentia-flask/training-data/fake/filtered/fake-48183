i dont get what the hype is. the french fry is good but if a place called pomme frites screws up the actual frying of the french fry then they shouldnt be in business. what i dont get is the sauces. i tried couple of their most popular ones and sorry to say but i thought it was disgusting. if i was eating the fry alone with ketchup or hot sauce i wouldnt mind.
