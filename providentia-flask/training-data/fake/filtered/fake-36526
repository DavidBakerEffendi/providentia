Went here on a Thursday night and had the rodizio.  I had high hopes for this place because of all the positive Yelp reviews.  The standard by which I judge and compare all churrascaria/rodizio restaurants is a chain called Fogo de Chao.  Unfortunately there isn't one in the tri-state area, the closest one being located in Philadelphia. First, there is no salad bar of any type here.  The meat selection itself is pretty limited and the quality is nowhere near as good as Fogo de Chao.  The service was OK but not great.  It's a decent place and for the money (half the price of Fogo de Chao) it's not a bad place by any means but there are much better places although for more money.  For me, I'd rather pay the extra money and have higher quality meats, more attentive service, and a salad bar full chock of cheeses, olives, roasted peppers, hearts of palm, etc...
