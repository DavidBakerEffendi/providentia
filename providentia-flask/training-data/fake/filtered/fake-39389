The best ramen I've ever had (not an expert, but experienced).  The staff there are enough reason to return on their own.  Warm and accommodating.   Try the curry rice as a side dish if you like Japanese curry at all.  It's totally worth it. And I'm Rumpelstiltskin if you don't slurp down the last wash of soup in your bowl!
