The outside of the place is misleading, it's so nice inside!  Food presentation on par with very high end establishments in NY and Vegas, yet, a friendly staff and cozy (if loud, they need something on the walls to absorb the sound) atmosphere.  Salad to dessert.....all wonderful.  One of us had the Chilean Sea Bass, I had the blue cheese and portobello crust on the fillet mignon.  Gabe was a wonderful server, we'll be asking for him again.  The fillet was $30, very reasonable.
