Rye is the epitome of what Brooklyn foodie's desire in a pub. The old world feel of the interior, dark stained woods, simple back-lit bar, and wooden stools, compliment the classic array of well mixed cocktails. My favorite is the house take on a Dark & Stormy, although their Blood & Smoke is a deeply, delicious surprise. The food is good. At times, tries to be overly refined, but the former chef of Dumont certainly is up to something good. I prefer the bar menu, particularly the braised short-rib sandwich and creamy baked mac n' cheese. This place can get super crowded, so I suggest going on a week night or starting out here early to set the tone for a good evening. Also, the bar tenders are really great, service has always been fine.
