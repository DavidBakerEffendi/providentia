My husband and I hosted our daughter's rehearsal dinner at Anthony's. From the planning to the execution, Anthony and his staff aimed to please. Our guests traveled a long distance  and they were not disappointed. Our party took over the whole restaurant. The tables were nicely dressed, and Anthony set up an appetizer table and small bar. Our guests had a preselected menu to choose from, that was agreed upon by  Anthony and our daughter. Every item that was chosen, was  excellent. Our guests were more than pleased. Anthony was hands on and attentive the entire evening. He took great pride in  making sure all the food was  fresh, well prepared, delicious and eye pleasing. The meal was followed by a wide variety of Anthony's famous desserts and choices of hot beverages. Our guests were full, but managed to sample both and the raves continued. We couldn't be happier and we would recommend Anthony's for breakfast, lunch, and a weekly dinner. Being small allows for quality and attention to detail. Anthony went well beyond our expectations.
