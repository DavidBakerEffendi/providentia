If I could give this place negative stars, I would. I ordered at 10pm on a Friday night. Cheeseburger with fries and mozzarella sticks. Their food is too overpriced for the quality. The mozzarella sticks were overcooked and left out to cool. Biting into them was horrible. There was an unpleasant crunchy outside with a hard cheese inside. Don't get me started with the cheeseburger and fries. The fries tasted like they were yesterday's overcooked then re-fried fries. By the time I finished my portion, my jaw was beyond sore. I didn't get to the burger yet! The bun felt like it was microwaved - bread turns hard and chewy after being microwaved. The patty was WELL overcooked and rubbery. I took two bites and threw the food outside. Let's see if the neighborhood raccoon will even eat it. Worse $14 ever spent. They also overcharged me. I ordered just the cheeseburger with fries, which is $5.50. They charged me $6.95 and didn't include the cole slaw, not that I would have touched it anyways. Cheap place, crappy food. BEWARE. I don't want to see what the kitchen looks like.
