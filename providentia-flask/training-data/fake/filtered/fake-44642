One of the best brunches I've had in recent memory. Went at 11 on a Saturday without reservations and got a seat at the bar immediately. Split the Uovo Modenese and polenta waffle with a friend, which were both amazing, full of flavor, perfectly cooked. The bartenders were incredibly nice and stopped to chat briefly even though the bar filled up pretty quickly. The space is beautiful, everyone's attractive, the food's delicious... This is what brunch is supposed to be.
