Non-white patrons beware!!! I was recommended Zavino by my father who lives a few blocks away.  So one day I figured that I stop by and check it out.  On first sight the place is impressive in an intimate way, but generally a very small space.  I took a seat at the bar and had to get the bartender's attention although the bar was sparsely populated.  He provided me a menu and made me a pretty good martini as I waited for my pizza's (ordered 2 to go).  It wasn't until a white couple came into the restaurant and sat next to me that I realized how much I was treated differently.  The bartender's attitude immediately turned to perky and welcoming when attending to the white couple (also, there was no indication from their conversation to say that they were familiar with each other).  He subsequently went into full service mode - explaining all the specials, other intricacies of the menu, etc.  I felt extremely insulted.  I did what was the only thing left for me to do - I requested the manager and explained in detail how the service that I received was sub-par at best to other customers and that I was not only disappointed but insulted.  The Manager was decent enough to offer an apology of which I accepted.  However, what I witnessed was far from a pleasant dining experience.  I encourage all Non-white paying customers - if you get treated in an insufficient manner at any restaurant, request the manager, blog about your experience, and never support them financially again. Otherwise, the pizza was OK.
