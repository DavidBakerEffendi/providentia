If you love MEAT, then this is thee place to go, you flip the card and here comes the herds, slicing their flesh off right in front, onto your plate, someone told me they sold salad their or veggies or something weird like that, like I said this is a Meat factory or slaughterhouse that's decorated or camouflaged, trust me the animals are in the back, sometimes I hear them screaming, Â but for our pleasure they are willing to make the ultimate sacrifice, so I guess you can call it war meat, but the only thing tough about those herds are their brave souls, so swing by their and some them animals some love and salute them as you enter, they are really making the ultimate sacrifice for you bellies and mines..Peace !
