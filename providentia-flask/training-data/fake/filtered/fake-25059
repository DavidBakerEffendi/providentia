took my daughter there for her birthday dinner . both of us ordered. 14 oz ribeye steak. ribeye usually has marbling of fat. but these steaks were horrible with mine being 10 oz fat maybe 4 oz steak. At first my daughter was teasing me as i kept cutting and cutting fat couldn't get to meat her steak was much better but still probably 1/2 fat. i wrote to shepard pie and nicely asked if they could do anything to make it right and a month &1/2 they haven't responded. so even though i have never written a review for anything on line, i am reviewing them &1 is actually only for salad bar.
