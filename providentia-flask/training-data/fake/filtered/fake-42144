excellent burger -- agree that it's one of the best I've had in the city: really fresh, very tasty and the perfect size. sat out back in the patio area, which was nice, but a little bland, as was the rest of the bar's decor. service was agonizingly slow, and had to ask several times to get our check. music was loud, with too many Counting Crows tracks for my taste... the food's a draw, certainly, but probably not enough of one to get me back.
