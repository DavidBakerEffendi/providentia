Everyone says that Geno's has the best steaks in Philly. What a crock! They are awful. Highly commercialized is all. The best steaks in Philly are at Jim's steaks. One is on south street, and one in the northeast. Steer clear of Geno's. all you will get is a small, overpriced, tasteless steak, a stomachache, and a ticket to the nearest bathroom.
