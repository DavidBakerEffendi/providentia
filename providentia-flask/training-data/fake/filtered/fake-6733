I had a party, and I needed to find the best Chinese food in the area, so I tried them all.... This restaurant I call "Lawyers Service Chinese" because it is right near the Lawyers Service mailbox -- I would never have known if I didn't have to drop something off.  I stopped in and got some take out, and it was really, really good!  When I told them I was having a party, they were GREAT about catering a large order, and their prices and freshness could not be beat! (I also Ordered some from another restaurant in the area, but the chicken and broccoli here had more chicken and was a better deal).  They really did a great, great job, and made it seem like it was no big deal to cook for 60!  Surprising little gem of a take out place!! I ended up ordering a HUGE tray of chicken and broccoli from here, and snow peas and mixed vegetables.  They made it exactly what I asked for, and had it there on time.  Everyone asked where I ordered from.  This is really, really good food!!  (They will even do amazing steamed shrimp and vegetables with sauce on the side for weight watchers).  Totally amazing food, so close and so much less expensive than other places where the food isn't as fresh or tasty!
