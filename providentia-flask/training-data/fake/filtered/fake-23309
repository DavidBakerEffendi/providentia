Never ever again!! Went here for a family party and I don't even know where to start on the issues. First off, when we went to set up the room we noticed there was food rotting in the drain in the sink behind the bar. Then when the guests started arriving we all noticed that all on the dishes on that had been set up on the tables were all filthy! Dried up food on the plates, lipstick stains and dried food on the glasses, and greasy residue on literally everything! Even the pitchers of sangria and soda were dirty and had greasy residue. When we initially went downstairs and complained the manager told us we were lying, so we had to go get the pitchers to show him. Mind you, he's the one making the pitchers of sangria at the bar downstairs. So then he tries to justify it by saying "oh well sometimes the washer we have doesn't get everything off". I guess that wasn't an indication to get a new washer for the dishes or to make sure that the dishes came out clean. Then instead of actually cleaning the dishes, the staff just wiped them off with the linen napkins and even wiped the glasses inside and out with Windex! you could smell the cleaner in the glass. Talk about a serious health hazard! My aunt actually went in the bathroom and cleaned all the dishes on her table with soap and water from the bathroom sink. Not to mention the nasty attitude we got from several staff members when we asked them to clean the dishes in the first place. They even went so far as to talk trash about us in Spanish thinking we couldn't understand what they were saying because we don't look Spanish. And to top it all off, we saw at least one of the staff members eat one of the personal cheesecakes we had as favors for our guests! The food was decent but I would never again eat at this place, much less throw a party here. my advice to you is STAY AWAY!!
