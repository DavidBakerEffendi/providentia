I really like this place. The flatiron needs more solid neighborhood joints Almond. I live around the corner so I've been in a few times-ranging from cocktails and oysters at the bar to full-on meals. Vibe is relaxed, the staff is earnest, and food is great. The menu ranges from bistro classics to Northern Italian, with some esoterica thrown around. The prices are totally resonsible. The specials get a bit pricey, but if you stick with the regular menu you can get out of there paying about $45 a person
