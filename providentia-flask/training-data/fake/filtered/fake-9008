welcome to the center of the east village brunch universe. menu: middle-eastern twist on brunch staple items mixed in with standard breakfast food fare. salads and sandwiches as well. excellently priced all around. outdoor patio under awning serves as great people-watching (can't count the number of weekend mornings where i've seen a model in last night's makeup). charming ambiance that reeks of the neighborhood in the best way possible. sub-par service, but when you're rolling up hungover on a sunday morning, it's not like you're in a rush anyway. any east villager will tick this off as a reliable standby for brunch/lunch/dinner with friends.
