I don't know what you people are on but i want some.  It must be good s&*t if it's making you think Toby's is a good place to eat.  Let me start by saying the owner and staff are soo shady I'm loosing my appetite just thinking about them.  The food is horrible, pizza, is that pizza.  The definition of pizza is being tested here at Toby's.  I usually get a bunch of slices and topppings for $18 but at Tobys you get 4 paper thin flatbread pizza slices for $20.  I could fold the entire Toby's pizza into one slice and still be hungry for 3 more, $60.  They don't feel bad about ripping people off ,but I don't feel bad telling thousands of people how bad Toby sucks.  Only yuppies that move into that neighborhood eat at Toby's.  Real locals from brooklyn don't go there, ever.  Take my advice and don't waste your time and money at this spot.  There are soooo many better pizza spots in bk, grimaldis, Di Fara, Totonnos, Enzos,etc  Toby's will be out of business in a couple months. Oh ya and good luck eating that beef jerky you j.o.  Have you ever wondered how disgusting it is eating homemade jerky from some t-bag that trolls around the bar-bathroom all night.  Oh the dishwasher has homemade flan for sale behind the toilet also.
