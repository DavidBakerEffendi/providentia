One of my favorite places for a quick burger. I enjoy the place. The staff is young and not on top of things or just maybe they dont care that much. Took three of them to figure out how to draw a black & tan or a half & half. they basically gave me a glass full of foam twice. Â the place... its been around for 200 years so I figure it still works.
