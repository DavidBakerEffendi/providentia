I love, love, love the atmosphere in this place. You can tell they've gone above and beyond to make a wonderful addition to the neighborhood. Very quick and friendly service. Great local coffee that comes with refills. They even have a small store when you first walk in if you want to buy cheese, coffee beans, etc. The only reason I'm reluctant to give them 5 stars is because the food could really be improved. I have a few "go-to" menu items that keep me coming back to this place (like the steak and eggs with a side salad for brunch). If they fix the food, this place will be a knockout!
