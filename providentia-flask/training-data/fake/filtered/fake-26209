'Eek! Methinks not' - That's quite accurate, dear yelp. Let me just tell you guys what my experience was at this place tonight; It began with an immediate seating in a cool, relaxed environment. We ordered a few dishes, quickly prepared and served, each more delicious than the last. However, before we were finished with the last, a patron with a large LIVE snake walked in and was seated immediately not far from me. Yes, you read that right. A LIVE SNAKE. Most of the customers were disturbed. We asked to moved, but the manager or owner (I think) talked us out of changing seats, further away from the gigantic LIVE snake; granted MOMO SUSHI SHACK is very small, so the furthest we could have been still too close for my taste. My boyfriend and I finished the rest of our meal very fast and we made our exit, thank god, relatively quickly. I find this laughable, disgusting, appalling and I just can't get the image of the snake out of my mind, slithering on the tables, YES, on the tables where we are supposed, as patrons, to enjoy our meal. I am writing this review to vent, because I cannot fathom the idea of what happened tonight, it is just not okey. Tomorrow morning, at a more decent hour I am calling the health department and I am making a formal complaint. I have never felt so compelled to write a review about a bad restaurant experience as I do now; I didn't even have a Yelp profile before this... This is not my first time at this establishment; the service is TERRIBLE. I apologize for my crude honesty, but I just had to get it out there. GOD BLESS.
