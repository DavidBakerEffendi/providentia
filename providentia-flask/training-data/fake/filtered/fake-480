Being from Philly, it would be a true tragedy for me not to visit and indulge in Geno's. Needless to say, I have been a true fan all my life. Though I am not one for the lines, I don't mind considering they are open so late or shall I say early in the am. I love the fact that there is outdoor sitting, I can watch my food being made the service is great......Always a repeat offender of Geno's.
