Overall I was very disgusted with my visit to Cubano's. I decided to take my sister to this restaurant for her BDAY since she loves Cuban Food. Although the restaurant was clean, everything else was of poor quality. We sat at the bar, as the tables were completely full  and had to wait an hour and a half for 2 meals that were completely dry and did not contain the Latin flair that I am accustomed to. The service is NOTconducive to the atmosphere. I was also disappointed to find out 2 days later that my credit card was  charged twice for the poor quality of food that we did not even eat. After calling and speaking to the owner (JERRY), he stated there was nothing he could do on his end because his establishment does not deal with banks. He sure dealt with them when they  took my card for payment!!!! All my bank needed was a faxed letter from his business stated that only one charge should be put on my card and he refused!!!!! VERY BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE JERRY!!!!! BUYER BEWARE:(
