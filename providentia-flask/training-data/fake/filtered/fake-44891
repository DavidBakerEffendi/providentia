Best Pizza in New York period. Margherita pizza is made with fresh Bufalo Mozzarella, so yummie, it melts in your mouth. Not sure what they do to their tomato sauce but it is seasoned to perfection. I love cocktails and they have a variety of great ones. The Gin Basil is my favorite. My friend had the Butternut Squash Cappellaci. The oozing cheese combined with the flavor of the butter, sage and amaretto cookie is just to die for. Service was attentive and friendly, not overbearing. Our server was super cute! :) Cant wait to try some of their other dishes.
