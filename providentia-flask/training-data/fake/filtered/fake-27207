I catered food for 120+ guests from Penang, and their food definitely marked the highlight of our event. The curry puffs were a big hit, and so were the potato chicken curry and shrimp pad thai. According to my Malay friend, it was very authentic and good Malay/Thai food! The manager, Tim, was kind and willing enough to work through our limited budget. They were obviously very skilled at catering for big events, because the amount of food was perfect for the number of guests. The food was prepared on time for the scheduled pick-up date. The sauces were ready in separate containers to be served with the food later. I couldn't have asked for a better catering venue. I've never dined there, but the interior also seemed very pleasant and clean. I would love to stop by again to try those curry puffs again! Very highly recommended!!
