Excellent place! Been coming here for years. The owner is usually around and he is very engaging. Prices have gone up and it used to be a BYOB place, but I can't complain too much about that since every other restaurant has increased their prices in recent years. At least this place hasn't compromised on quality. My absolute fave is the reine pepiada arepa. It's delish!!
