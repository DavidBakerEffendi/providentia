I have been to 116 Crown often since they opened and I enjoy myself more each time.  No place in New Haven has a better atmosphere and the people there are diverse and sophisticated.  I have been for dinner as well as drinks.  Some friends and I actually went for drinks before a dinner reservation elsewhere ended up blowing off the reservation and stayed all night.  Different and surprising, just what New Haven needs.
