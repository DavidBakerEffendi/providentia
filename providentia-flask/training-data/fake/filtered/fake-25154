We recently went to Amis to celebrate a friend's graduation.  I was so impressed with this restaurant, that it is now one of the top recommendations I give to people looking to have a lovely dinner.  We had a large party, so we had to wait for a specific table to be seated at.  Despite our reservation, the people who were at the table took a VERY long time.  The people obviously did not have diner's etiquette when eating at a restaurant during the weekend, because they took their sweet time.  Amis handled the situation delicately, and ensured us they would make it right.  Because rude diners are unfortunately out of the control of the restaurant, the Amis staff did their best to accommodate our party and the party that greatly overstayed their welcome.  We have been to many restaurants throughout the city, and any other restaurant would have taken the attitude of if you don't want to wait, then leave.  But, Amis was different.  They were caring and committed to having us as customers.  Now to the food...everything was so delicious!  The pecorino, the pasta, the bread, the desserts -- everything.  Amis did make it right, and we happily celebrated a wonderful occasion with delicious food at lovely Amis.
