To start, it's not your typical Mexican restaurant, it's actually better. Family owned and attended, you get treated like one of them, since you walk in you're greeted with a smile as the smell of delicious food invades your nostrils. I was impressed by how rich in flavor their food is so when I asked they confided that it's made fresh every day and the ingredients are carefully selected, did I mention is extremely affordable? If u are on a diet or having a cheat meal u can't go wrong.
