My wife and I went to eat at this new place the service was good the place looks nice the food tast good but the price is to high. We order enchiladas which cost $11.75 we were expecting to get a classic Mexican dish which comes with rice and beans and guacamole and sour cream on the side. When we got are food Â we got a small plate with the enchiladas and sause on top so since we didn't get rice or beans we had two order a side of rice which cost $5.00 extra.so are dish come about $16.00 not including the beans. I don't think it will last if they don't change there prices.
