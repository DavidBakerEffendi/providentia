Heard alot about this restaurant, went with friends the service was so-so, the food literal;ly sucked,  appetizers were over-rated; all the dinners came out cold and over cooked, the lobster was cold and tasteless, fish was cold all-in-all dinner was over-priced and not worth the trip to this place anyone who thinks it is great knows nothing about food.   NEVER WILL GO BACK OR RECOMMEND TO ANYONE THAT I LIKE.
