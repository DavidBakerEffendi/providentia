We ordered a large pizza to be delivered. Half sausage and half mushroom and onion. With out a doubt this was the worst pizza I have ever eaten in the state of NJ. The sausage must have been old and frozen - it had no taste. There was about 1/2 teaspoon of red sauce on each slice. They used the lowest quality mozzarella cheese on earth- no taste and rubbery - that processed junk. Â Just as bad as Dominos. I had frozen Pizza from Shop Rite like Digornos and Fruschetta that put this to shame. These people are trying to cut costs by using horrible ingredients. ZERO TASTE! WHAT A DISASTER. Try Albivi's in Millstone Twp NJ off Rt. 33. They use fresh whole milk mozzarella cheese, fresh basil and all fresh herbs- and their pizza is baked in brick ovens and comes out crispy. When I called the restaurant to tell them just how bad their prizza was, the guy that answered the phone could care less.
