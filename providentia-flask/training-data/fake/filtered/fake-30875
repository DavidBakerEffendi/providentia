I've eaten here twice, and I'm a big fan.  I'm happy to report that many of the early kinks tied to long waits seemed to be improved and/or are improving. The good: Meats (I've had most by now) are excellent. 5 stars.  The Sauce also gets 5 stars.  Really good, authentic BBQ.  Enjoyed the cornbread, and the biscuits are excellent.   The bad: some of sides weren't great, and as other have mentioned, some of the food really needs to be a bit hotter.  To me, sides seemed 2 to 3 stars. The Awesome: without a doubt the people here really make the difference.  Everyone is nice (which unfortunately is a rarity these days!)  But beyond that, I could FEEL the pride in the food, and enthusiasm.  I was offered samples of things, provided feedback and suggestions . . . they moved quick, but engaged in conversation, kind of southern hospitality meets NJ fast pace. Trying their catering now, and will try desserts next. For the people alone, that positive vibe, pride and warmth, I'm a fan.  So glad they opened in my town, and hope they continue down this path and thrive.  Check them out!
