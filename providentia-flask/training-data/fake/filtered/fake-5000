My wife is a huge chinese food fan where as I am not.  I usually protest chinese for dinner but every once in a while I have to give in...but I've gotta say, I haven't had anything for Lin's that I haven't enjoyed.  Their General T'so's Chicken is great and its crispy when it arrives which is a huge plus for me.  I love their fried wontons as well and my wife is in love with their pork fried rice.  You can't go wrong with this place, their delivery service is super fast too.
