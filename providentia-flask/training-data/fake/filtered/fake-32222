The most amazing food i've had in New York so far! I had the pate to start and the mussels for main- beautiful flavours and good sized portions. mum had a pear and walnut salad to start (she still can't stop talking about it!) and salmon for main. Service was great and the wine was delicious. 5/5, highly recommended!
