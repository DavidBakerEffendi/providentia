My family and I have gone to Bonefish at route 18 many times and have always enjoyed the food there. We were so happy that they opened one in lawrenceville, which is closer to home.  Sadly I have been disappointed with the quality of the entrees at the lawrenceville location. Been there two times not long after they opened and was disappointed every time. Gave it another try today and was disappointed again.  My son tried their new seasonal entree, branzino fish and could hardly enjoy the fish because there were so many small bones left on it.  We had same fish at Seasons 52 and not a bone was found.  Another time we were there my son ordered grilled salmon and it was burnt on the underside.  That fish should never have left the kitchen. We used to love their house salad and now it's just like any other salad - not special anymore since they started to skimp on the ingredients. I have been to other bonefish restaurants in other states and found them to have better quality food. At the lawrenceville location, the servers are great but the Foods are lacking quality standards.  Don't think will be returning anytime soon.
