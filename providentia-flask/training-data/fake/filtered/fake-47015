It has a great atmosphere. As soon as you walk in you're greeted by a worker and seated to a table. The servers are nice when it comes to ordering but they are constantly waiting around or watching, kind of freaks me out a bit but I guess they're attentive. Waiting for the food was very quickly actually. Ordered a small dish it was an omelet with oysters and it was DELICIOUS. It's something I would recommend even though it sounds a bit weird, but I had ordered it because I missed breakfast and wanted something with lunch food as well and was not a disappointment honestly. Great place nice for parties as well.
