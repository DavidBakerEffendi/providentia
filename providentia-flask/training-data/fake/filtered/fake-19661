ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE!  To say this place is authentic German cuisine is an understatement; you literally feel like you're in a beer hall in Munich!  The food is top-quality and the beer is amazing.  The best part is their affinity for European Football and their annual Oktoberfest and Maifest events.
