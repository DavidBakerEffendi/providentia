This restaurant is known for its rodizio; they are very good, and come around very often. However, it is overrated and overpriced. 1. A plate of pasta with chicken $19.25. Hell no!!! Never again, it wasn't even Vodka Sauce same goes for the Alfredo Sauce.   2. A pitcher of sangria $23, Hell no!! You are better off going to Adegas Grill $17 / Sagres $20 or even Fornos $21.   If you wan to impress a date, please take them to Fornos; a bit expensive but cuisine and service are spectacular.
