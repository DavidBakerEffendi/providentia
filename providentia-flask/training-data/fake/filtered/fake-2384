I can't understand what the hype is about.  The meat in the dumplings is really poor quality.  The place is very small and ran inefficiently.  Every dumpling is just filled with grease.  I have had better dumplings at pretty much any chinese takeout in the city.  These are cheap for a reason.   We also paid the woman with a $10 bill and she gave us change as if we paid with a $5. We only had a $10 bill so there was no room for mistakes on our part.  She was unwilling to budge and essentially ripped us off for $5
