Sushi Yasuda is great for the sushi connoisseur.  The menu is by no means creative, but you can consistently count of the fish to be fresh and flavorful.  It's a great place to impress a date with your sushi knowledge, and the prefix gives you good value for your money.  You'd be crazy to order a hand roll instead of sushi, anyway.  This place is all about simple, fresh flavors.  And as a suggestion, snag a spot at the sushi bar to take the chefs recommendations for the night.  They know what's up.
