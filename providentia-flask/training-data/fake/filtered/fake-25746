Great Fresh Subs I finally got to try Vito's last week and so glad I did. This is a takeout place that serves hot and cold subs with salads. I had a basic turkey and cheese with LTM and pickles. The Italian bread was nice and fresh and it was packed with good quality meat and made with care. You can easily make 2 meals out of one sandwich. The lady at the register was friendly as can be and happy to serve. Her fresh baked cookies were so tempting. I would gladly pay an extra 2 dollars for a sandwich here over that skimpy, mass produced, preservative laced junk at Subways. I wish I lived closer to New Haven. Nice to see a few great family owned places are still alive.
