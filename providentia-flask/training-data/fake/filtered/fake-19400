My friend and I came here for a quick pre-theater dinner. And at 6pm, the place was packed. The music together with the quaint old films projecting (Grease!) on the brick wall kept us well entertained during our short evening here. We tried their green pasta with shrimp. This pasta tasted really fresh. Although there were only 4 pieces of shrimp, that too was perfectly cooked and so juicy. Together with the cream sauce, this whole dish was just fantastic. Our only gripe was the service - While waiting for our table to be set up, we were at the bar and had ordered drinks that had not been made. During this time, one of the staff started showing us to our table. I alerted her that our drinks had not arrived. So she offered this peculiar piece of advice: One of us should wait for the drinks at the bar and bring them over ourselves later, while another should follow her to the table. Isn't this strange??? I've been to several restaurants, and they've invariably offered to bring our drinks to the table whenever this happens. Also, throughout our meal, we were offered food that we did not order, THREE times. Perhaps this is some elaborate marketing strategy to get us to order more food. I hope this restaurant straightens out their service issues soon, before I come back again for their green pasta!
