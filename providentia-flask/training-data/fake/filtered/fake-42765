I try to have lunch here at least once a week. The food is wonderful. My favorite is the curry soup with pork and rice noodles. Their sesame wontons are the best I have ever had. Also, Corinne will make you anything , even if it isn't on the menu. I have been coming here since they opened and have never been disappointed. Corinne and Jeff are the best.
