We experienced the bad traffic on the way here ALMOST made it not worth it, but the food was prepared quickly and tasted great!!! We wanted to try a another D3 place in NJ, but it turned out to be a disappointment and we both wished we had just grabbed another sandwich from here!! Great price for a very filling sandwich!!!!
