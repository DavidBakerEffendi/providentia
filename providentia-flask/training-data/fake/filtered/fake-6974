I have not been to Franklin Steakhouse yet, but I plan to since I pass by it everyday on my way home from work.  I have been to the steakhouse in Nutley and like it a lot.  I could understand having problems the first couple of weeks any restuarant opens, even one that was already established at another location.  That is why when I read the first 2 comments, I could believe the problems, but the customers have to give it a little more time to develop. What I do find hard to believe is the post from Joseph C. in Riverdale.  Is this guy a sales rep for the place or what?  Or is he one of the owners or managers?  In less than 24 hours he had a completely different description of everything about the restuarant.  He describes the place and menu like he is on an infomercial.  5 star rating right after 2 people give it 2 stars?  Rome was not built in a day. I am sure this will be a great place in the very near future, lets just be realistic and not try to sell the world on it until more people can check it out themselves.
