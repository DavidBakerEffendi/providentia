Most of the reviews that have been written previously were on the menu and service after 9 p.m. This review will focus on high-value, low-price soup and sandwich lunches Mondays through Fridays that cost $5.25 including tax. There are always two choices of soup each day and they are varied and satisfying. For the unadventurous, there is always some form of chicken soup, with celery, carrots and noodles or pasta. The second choice could be lentil soup, beef barley soup, cream of broccoli, split pea, clam chowder or cream of spinach. These soups or a salad can be the start of a senior dinner or a standard dinner. These are really good values when compared with other restaurants and run the gamut from broiled steaks and fish (salmon, sword fish, scrod, stuffed sole), fried fish, beef stew, sausage with peppers and onions over rice or spaghetti, veal with peppers and onions over rice or spaghetti, Â roast lamb, meatloaf, or salisbury steak or beef liver with bacon and onions or several varieties of fettuccini spread out iindividually over half the days of the week. When servers are not coping with a 2 a.m. bar rush, the service is knowledgeable, competent and attentive. Don't be put off by the overnight reviews and the egg dishes. Goldroc has a lot going for it throughout the day and early evening!
