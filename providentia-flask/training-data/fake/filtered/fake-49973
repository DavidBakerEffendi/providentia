I had ordered take-out from here once before tonight and enjoyed it, but I was extremely disappointed by the food this time. The take-out service was very slow, and my food arrived almost 2 hours after I placed the order. The Tom Yum soup was fine but a bit bland. The salmon and shrimp hommok was the strangest consistency, more like a badly cooked quiche than any Thai dish I have ever had. I could barely eat it. It was also quite bland. I will definitely not be trying this place again. Very disappointing.
