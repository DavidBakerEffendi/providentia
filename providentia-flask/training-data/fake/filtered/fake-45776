I love Panini's! They have amazing outdoor seating right on Market Street which is perfect for people watching, which I LOVE to do! Lunch there is great for Panini's or a fresh salad, but my friends and I go for dinner a lot too. There are barely any BYOB's in Old City, at least ones I like, and it's so cozy there, we always have a great time! I'm actually going tomorrow night!
