The food here is incredible - this pizza isn't like anything you've probably eaten before. It's not Brooklyn or Sicilian style, it is LEGIT Italian pizza. When I visited from San Diego a few weeks ago, my family and I got the margherita pie and something similar...the owner made everything fresh to order and I wish I could articulate how amazing it was. Everything from bruschetta to pies to the unbelievably delicious Nutella-berry pie was brilliantly fresh. Even their cappuccino was beyond compare - smooth, not bitter at all. All of the gelato desserts we tried were out of this world. The four of us just ate and ate til we could eat no more. The only tiny drawback was that the waitress was more interested in comparing cell phone features with another waitress than bringing things like straws and sugar, which we had to ask for twice. But if you go for the food and not the less-than-stellar waitstaff, you will be duly impressed. I can't wait to get back east just so I can dine at Osteria Procaccini again.
