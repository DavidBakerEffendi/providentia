As a student, I am always looking for new places to study and have a snack or drink. Infini-T is not the place. I understand that outside food is sometimes not allowed in location of this nature, so when there was no sign stating so, I brought in food. That being said, I did nothing to conceal it. The owner (after taking 20 minutes to make my iced tea) was EXTREMELY rude and patronizing to my friends and I, asking why we ethically thought we were allowed to do such a thing, while the other owner stood outside creepily smiling down on us while smoking his cigarette. Not only did she not ask us to put away the food but bombard us with questions that made us EXTREMELY uncomfortable, but she also confiscated my friend's drink, telling her she was welcome to go back to Starbucks, which in turn made us feel awkward and made us want to leave. This is after her and the other male owner got into a passive aggressive discussion about us RIGHT IN FRONT OF US. Sure, the ambiance is nice because the place is pretty empty, but I'm starting to think that the reason is because the owners are so horrible. For free Wi-Fi, go to starbucks or panera, or somewhere on campus. Honestly, it's worth paying every hour at small world to avoid this place.
