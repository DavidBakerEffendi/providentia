We found Georgio on the Pine because of it's vicinity to our hotel, the fact that it is "kid-friendly" and the fact that we just love Italian food. We stayed nearby at the Radisson, just a 5-10 minute walk, and we went with our 12 week son. GOTP was a cute little restaurant. We didn't realize it was BYOB, which is pretty cool. We met who we think is the owner, and he was super nice constantly checking on us and thanking us for coming in. The waitress was also very nice. They both were very friendly and made us feel welcome. The food was amazing! We ordered the sweet sausage appetizer, the gluten free pesto pizza and stuffed chicken breast. All were very delicious!! I was super impressed by the fact that they had SO many gluten free options, even brought out a gluten free bread bowl. The price was good too. the waitress even included a complimentary slice of gluten free chocolate cake...AMAZING! Even when the baby was fussy, everyone was still very nice and kind. Would absolutely go again!
