My husband and I finally got a chance to try SONG. The plus: Portions- were huge- & we got a big bank for the buck. The cons: In their pad thai- had virtually nothing other than noodles in it. Â No eggs, vegs, or peanuts to speak of.. but it was really crazy busy so perhaps we will stop again. Curries- good- not overly sweet, which I hate in Thai food. Fried Calamari- eh- ok- not light & crisp, but rather heavy and doughy,. So unsure- I'd have to try again, but I'd probably check out somewhere else first. Loud- really loud-, but I expect that @ dinner time in most NYC restaurants.
