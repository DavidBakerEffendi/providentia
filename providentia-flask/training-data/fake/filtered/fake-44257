Do not eat at Taco King.  The food here is disgusting.  I ordered the wings to see if they would be any good; they were horrendous.  They were soggy and tasted sour.  The "blue cheese dressing" tasted more like soured milk.  I also got a chicken hard-shelled taco.  Thinking, how can one mess up a taco, right?  Well Taco King must take cooking badly as an art form because the taco was beyond rancid.  I literally had to spit it all out of my mouth.  I will never ever eat here again and neither should anyone who wants to save their taste buds.  I was actually afraid I was going to get food poisoning.  Nearly all of my "food" was thrown away.
