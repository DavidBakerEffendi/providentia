Contacted them to schedule an event about 9 months in advance. Was told they don't schedule that far in advance because of price changes they make in December. Yes, that's right: they would rather lose guaranteed business over the possibility of making an extra buck or two. Sorry, but I prefer to be prepared for my large events a tad bit more than a month in advance - as do most people and places of business. Can only assume I spoke to someone low on the totem pole who just didn't know any better. Otherwise, the business owner needs to go back to school. Will never go here again!
