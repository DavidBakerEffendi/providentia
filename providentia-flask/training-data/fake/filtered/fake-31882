Food was great, though it turns out I don't like eating Yucca fries with my bistec. But it's so noisy. I don't have a hearing problem, and it was too loud for me to have a conversation. The ambience is excellent, however, and certainly a great place to have a raucous 24th birthday dinner with your 12 best friends, like the table nearby. I would definitely go there again, if I didn't want to talk to the person I was with.
