GREAT food! AMAZING service! The rolls here are truly delicious and creative! I go here at least twice a month. The fish is always super fresh, so whether you go for the sushi or sashimi, you won't be disappointed. The service is excellent. They're always attentive and extremely nice. The portions: price ratio is also great Sometimes i have to roll out to my car, I'm so stuffed. LOVE this place!!
