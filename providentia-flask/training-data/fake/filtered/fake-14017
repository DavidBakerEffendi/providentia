The perfect "great food/casual setting" thing on lockdown. Really great service. As vegetarians, my wife and I were a little reluctant but the waitress was awesome. Didn't snub us or look at us like we were asking her to move City Hall two feet to the left. Also, you COULD spend $8 for 2 tubs of crappy ice cream at the local Safeway or you could get the salted caramel budino and have sweet sweet full color HD dreams and wake up standing at their door 4 hrs before they open up again.
