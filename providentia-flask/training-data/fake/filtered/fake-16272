I have always loved Cafeteria for their amazing White Grape Martinis (with the cutest green grape skewers for a fun twist on the classic martini garnish), and for the best veggie burger I have ever had! But what gives Cafeteria its 5 star review, is that I brought in a very well known foodie from the west coast for a business meeting. The restaurant set the perfect vibe. She was totally impressed with the food, service & atmosphere and it was still reasonably priced for me to pick up the check. At the end of the day I got the job & Cafeteria's was definitely a contributing factor!!
