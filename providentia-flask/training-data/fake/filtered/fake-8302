They have great food and the Bar Tenders are awesome.  The Hostesses and how they seat guests that come in is extremely bad.  They sit folks according to your party size and not who walks in first. They are focused on maximizing the seating, I get it but when you go in with a party of four and you wait for 1 hour to be seated, that's tough.   Parties of 5, 6, 3 , 8 and 2 all go before you even if they came in 1 hour after you have waited, because your party is four and you have to wait for a table of four to open up.   The south philly location is extremely  known for this.   I'm sure others feel the same as I do.
