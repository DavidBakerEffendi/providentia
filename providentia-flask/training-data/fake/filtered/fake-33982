I love Sally's Apizza, it holds a special place in my heart, and I'm sad the remaining owners are thinking of selling. Between Frank Pepe's and Sally's, I would pick Sally's every time. Now granted, their service isn't the fastest or friendliest, and mozzarella is considered an added topping, but their pizza just tastes better. The best part? - It's Â the thin crispy charred crust that leaves my fingertips black for a while, thats all flavor baby, and I love it haha. I really hope the family keeps the restaurant. New Haven Pizza just won't be the same without them around.
