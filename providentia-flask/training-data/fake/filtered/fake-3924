Silk City on Saturday nights is like heaven to me!  I was so happy when they reopened last year, I love the updates they made to the place (especially all the extra bathrooms - yay!) DJ Deejay is awesome and so nice and actually plays things that are fun to hear and even more fun to dance to.  I go to silk because I never have to deal with a dj who's trying to "school" me like so many of them do.  He is what all djs should be like - ask anyone around town.   Saturday nights - no cover, no douchebags, all fun.  Hope to see you there!
