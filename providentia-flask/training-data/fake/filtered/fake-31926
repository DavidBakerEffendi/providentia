Came here for restaurant week. Cocktails are amazing. I had a mojito and it was delicious, with a real sugar cane stick, my friend had the Tropical Sangria which was also delicious. Food was absolutely spectacular. Get the Domino for dessert!! Atmosphere is very pleasant, we also had a very pleasant waiter! All in all, loved it.
