Let me start on a positive note the space is BEAUTIFUL so beautiful that it made me go there twice not so beautiful that I would go back It was alright, that's it...just ok they price it to be competative-let's face it, it's on little Thailand Street but the portions are TINY the food is mediocre and the service was just ok it's not great-but....it's a nice looking place...hence the two stars
