I usually get the linguini dinner from Andy's, and it's not bad, linguini isn't too hard to mess up, they do give you a good amount of pasta too. The only thing I really have a problem with is a few of the girls that work there are very snotty and I don't feel like they put the customer first. I also recommend not getting delivery because they NEVER fail to forget something or mess something up. Every.Time. They're pizza is not that great, at all. It's a pretty meh place.
