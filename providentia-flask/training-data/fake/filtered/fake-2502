When we were in Philadelphia in June 2013, we asked a local where the best Philly Cheese Steak was. They told us to go to Sonny's and it was AMAZING! The meat was delicious, the bread was fresh, and the overall sandwich is one that is still fondly talked about. Go check them out! It's down an adorable street with so many things to experience and see.
