My husband and I saw Pat's and Geno's on Food Network and decided to make a day out of Philly and compare them for ourselves. Pats lives up to its name, King of Steaks. The  With, Wiz is AMAZING!  Who knew such a simple sub could taste so good. So good in fact that after splitting a sub at Pat's and Geno's I made my husband go back and get Pats sub for the road. This is a MUST try place while in Philly or even withing a reasonable driving distance!
