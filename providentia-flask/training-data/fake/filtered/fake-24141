Very traditional authentic Japanese experience. I My friend recommended me this place and I the first time I went there I took a date with me. We had a blast! I had a vegetarian one and she took with a pork. I loved it a lot - friendly stuff, great food and nice people around you The RAMEN is amazing we couldn't stop talking about it, overall great experience.
