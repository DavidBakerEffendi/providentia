I used to go to Le Grainne Cafe for many years. It was my favorite restaurant for breakfast in NYC. I was very disappointed last Saturday. I always order French Toast (only place I used to eat French Toast) but it was terrible. The bread inside was dry. I asked the waiter if the cook or chef was changed. She said the he will be back later in the evening. I took a look at the kitchen and I did not see the old cook. Next time I will check if the old cook is back. If he is not back, sorry but i will take my bussiness to another restaurant. Interesting, my best friend experienced the same last Sunday. Â Good thinks don't last.
