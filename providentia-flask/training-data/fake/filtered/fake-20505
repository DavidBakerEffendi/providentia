Last minute decision to meet up with a friend here...just happened to be an easy meeting place.  What I liked... my Bangkok chicken pumpkin curry.  Was it outstanding? No... but not bad either.  The summer rolls were drowned in a sweet sauce which I wound up scraping off because it was too overpowering.  My friend's mango lemongrass chicken had no noticeable lemongrass.  There may be better dishes on the menu but we didn't have them.  The worst part for me... menus that stunk of sour dish rags! GROSS!  NYC has too many good restaurants to give this place a second shot.
