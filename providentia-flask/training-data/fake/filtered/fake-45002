Fantastic little gem! I've lived at the French/German border close to Alsace for a long time and I'm so excited to finally have found a place that serves authentic thin crust tartes flambées. They are delicious and as good as they get! Try the different cheese toppings and leave room for the delicious sweet tarte with cinnamon, apples and calvados! This is the only place in the city that serves authentic tartes flambées and I really hope that despite the subway construction this place continues to thrive.
