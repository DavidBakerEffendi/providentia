You can't beat this place.  Quantity + quality.  Freshness + consistency.  Parking + good prices.  A friendly neighborhood institution, I've been going there since this family moved to its present location (from where they were for 13 years before that, I hear), some 10 years ago.  Favorites include: chicken parmigiana, cheese-steak wrap, Cobb salad, the Bolognese sauce, whole wheat pizza, hotzy totzy shrimp, cream of mushroom soup...
