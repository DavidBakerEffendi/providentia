Wow what a total rip off!!!!!!!!! My wife went in and ordered 3 Sandwiches . First they were way overpriced at 9 dollars each not to mention they charge extra for Banana peppers and extra mayo. So we get home the first sandwich has no cheese, only two peppers, Stale bread and hardly any meat on it. The Second sandwich was a BLT and to my surprise they forgot to put the lettuce on.....REALLY! the last sandwich was made correctly. So I call the place and was told they were not going to replace or credit them !!!!!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY I went to Obriens store down the road, for an affordable sandwich that was fresh and made as ordered!
