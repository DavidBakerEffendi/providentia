Michael White can do no wrong. Let your gut be your guide and try everything and anything you can!  Loved all the antipasti starters.  You can even "finish" your meal with pasta, even though that isn't how real Italians do it, because there are so many great ones and they will leave you beyond full.  Try a seasonal cocktail, with or without booze, both have great flavor!
