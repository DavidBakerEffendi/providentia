Very welcoming and comfortable ambiance. Distressed wood walls and wood floor make for a warm, inviting environment. Staff is very friendly, and our waiter was charming and knowledgeable. Service was outstanding, which reflects good management. I had the fixed price lunch for $24 that included a to-die for asparagus soup, truffle cheese appetizer, mushroom papardelle, and choice of white or red wine. The pasta was cooked to perfection and the sauce was light and flavorful. My companion had calamari which was also cooked to perfection. We went for lunch and arrived when they opened. I would advise getting there early as it filled up very quickly. I will definitely return the next time I am in New York.
