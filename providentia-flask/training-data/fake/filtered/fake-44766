Had a fantastic meal here 3 months ago, so was psyched when I needed a last minute spot for dinner and reserved via Opentable...there was tons of availability every 15 minutes on a Monday night...arrived and had to wait 10 minutes for hostess to figure out what was going on, even though restaurant was only 1/3 full.  She directs us to a table right next to the door (it's 32 outside) that has one window seat/bench (fine) and the other is a tiny stool, 14" high. We politely ask to sit away from the door.  She looks blankly at us and said this is the only table available.  We point to the near empty restaurant and say that surely she could fit us in at one of the 8 open tables.  She half apologizes and says unfortunately she can't. Bizarre, frustrating, disappointing, stupid.  We left and went to Morandi, without a reservation, got a corner booth, had incredible food (as you always do there) and warm, friendly, top-notch service.  One of these restaurants will be around for a long time.
