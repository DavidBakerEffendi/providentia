We ordered 3 noodle soup, 1 noodle , 2 roti canai, and chicken/beef satay. we were told by the waiter that the satay will take about 15 minutes to make, do we still want it? We said yes. 1 roti came, second came later.  Noodles arrived, they were good. Then the chicken/beef satay arrives! By then a good 20 minutes had passed and our 3 noodle soups (curry noodle, prawn noodle and shrimp noodle) were still missing.  A few minutes later the prawn noodles arrive, a few minutes after that the curry arrives and then the shrimp noodle arrives. The shrimp noodles looked like they had water and a little oil. Why does it take about 30 minutes to make that? The roti canai was not that great. New Malaysian Restaurant makes it better.  The curry noodle soup didn't have any potatoes. The satay was nothing memorable. Overall this was not a great experience.
