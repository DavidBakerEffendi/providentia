Under new management this year!!!  This place is so much better now.  They offer dinners for two that are a great value and you get a ton of food.  The food was good as well.  We go regularly for ice cream now.  My favorite is the caramel cheesecake flavor.  I haven't found it at other places, so it keeps me coming back.  Much more friendly of a place now.
