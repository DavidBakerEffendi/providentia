Ventured in to the city from Queens the other night for dinner with the girls, and was not disappointed. Typically unimpressed with Spanish food of any kind, but of course I trusted my company. First impression of Cafe Habana: super small. Plus a 40 min. wait + empty stomach = not amused. Luckily we were seated in about half the time. We got a super-squished table in the back but hey, we were seated. My friend ordered for the table: 3 orders of the famous corn (don't judge, it is really that good), an order of the roast pork with moros y cristianos, and a cuban sandwich. One word, CORN. Cheesy, spicy, tangy roasted corn goodness. And side note, no need to be embarrassed by the combination of cheese kernels and mayo all over your face. The table to the left of you, right of you, and front of you will most likely have ordered the exact same. Pork was pretty good, not a fan of veggies in my rice though (mini turn-off). The flan was a little thicker than I like but hey, it was still delicous. On that note people keep in mind one thing during your visit to Habana's: CORN.
