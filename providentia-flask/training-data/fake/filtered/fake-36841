The food is here is great! Definitely try the hurricane nachos and fish tacos. They have great themed nights like Taco Tuesday and Wine Wednesdays. Happy hour drinks are great too. My only complaint is that for a Saturday night, they really need more than one waiter. Service was a little slow but I can't blame the waiter because it was busy and he was the only one out there. I'll definitely go back because the Tex Mex is great!
