ARE YOU SERIOUS!? I live in New Haven and I was just told that I was OUTSIDE OF THEIR DELIVERY AREA!?!? Â Mind you, this is supposed to be wings over NEW HAVEN! And then when they asked the manager if they could deliver to me...he said it depends on how much you order!!! REALLY UNPROFESSIONAL!! I am having some friends over & I was going to order about $60 worth of food but they just screwed that up. Never again....
