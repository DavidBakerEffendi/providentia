Would not recommend. Ordered blueberry pancakes, all it came with were a few blueberries on top, some of which were still frozen. I went here with a friend and her pancakes were not fully cooked, so she sent them back and they were still prepared poorly. The coffee was just ok. At least we had good service though. I will not be coming back here anytime soon.
