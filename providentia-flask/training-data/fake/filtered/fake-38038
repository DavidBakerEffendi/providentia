Love this place! Had been for drinks a few months ago and decided to come back for dinner. The food is great - definitely lots of fried/southern food, but if you're in the mood for that, it's perfect. Drinks are fantastic and super strong - you get what you pay for! Wait staff is so friendly and never makes you feel rushed. Will definitely be coming back here the next time I'm in NYC.
