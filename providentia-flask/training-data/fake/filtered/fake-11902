Quality of ingredients are fantastic. We ordered a regular pizza with meatballs and mushrooms. There was also a mozzarella salad and arugula salad. The large square pizza is an amazing deal Â crust is crispy to the touch and taste, and the cheese and sauce are a delightful combination. Besides that it was relatively a pleasant lunch.
