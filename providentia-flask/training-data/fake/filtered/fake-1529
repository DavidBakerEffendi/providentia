In terms of little-city-big-taste, P&M is as good as it gets. The staff is very welcoming & friendly, and there is none of the get-in-and-get-out feeling to some of the other local spots. Their meat counter is very fresh, and they have great daily deals. I highly recommend their store-made sausage - delicious! Their steaks are not too fatty, and the chicken is always fresh. I have not yet tried the fish (aside from the stuffed clams which were very good). They have a wide selection of fruit and veggies, and also a number of different cheeses (they carry raw milk as well, which is a bonus in my book!) They have speakers outside which makes their patio a great place to sit and enjoy the day. Sometimes the checkout line can be a little long, but frequently one of the employees will jump in and open the second register to help out. They also recently installed a points system - sign up for one of the "Spot" cards, and each time you make a purchase there scan the card. The points will add up and you can apply them towards future purchases :). All in all, A+ for P&M for great sandwiches, fresh veggies, and service with a smile.
