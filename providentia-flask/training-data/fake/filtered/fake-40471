I used to love coming to this place or ordering from here at least twice a month. Unfortunately last time I came here I had a horrible experience and I will never ever come back. My food had a hair in it and when I told the waiter he simply removed my plate and didn't bring me a replacement nor had some type of discount on my bill. No manager approached me to apologize for it. I also had to go to the front to ask for my bill because my server was no where to be found nor stopped by our table to see if everything was okay. I will never go back to the restaurant as after finding the hair I got really disgusted by it.
