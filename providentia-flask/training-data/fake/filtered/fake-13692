Great spot to go to & you don't need reservations. We decided to check this place out last minute be we were able to get in. The host told us it would be a 40min wait but we only waited 20min at the bar downstairs while i enjoyed a mojito. We were seated in a separate room upstairs...very cool with white sheets draped everywhere & the sounds of live Cuban salsa penetrating them. We had the Cuban Tuna as an appetizer & sweet plantains, Tostones Rellenos, the seafood casserole, & some sort of skirt steak. Everything was great. I'll definitely be back soon.
