This is the perfect low-key neighborhood place. Everything I've eaten here is delicious and fresh (kale salad and veggie burger being two of the highlights), the beer is great, and the vibes are relaxing and fun. Staff is very nice. The only downside to this place is that the backyard is kind of ugly. The place is relatively new (1.5 years) and they have been continually renovating their look, so there is hope for improvement there. All in all, glad to have this little gem in the neighborhood.
