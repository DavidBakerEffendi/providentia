First time at Soco's and what a delight it was. I have not had food that delicious in a very long time. We had Mac n cheese, Gumbo, Wings, Ribs, Grits, Greenbeans, Mashed potatos and for desert the brownie w/ ice cream and all of that came with the most pleasant waiter. I cant wait to re-visit. This Place ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!
