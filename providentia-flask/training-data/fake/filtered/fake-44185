I just had dinner there tonight and what a nightmare This waiter Josh " comes up with this boring pitch That his  mgmt is forcing him to say . Our table was small Me and my wife ordered drinks there was red lip stick on the wine glass! I still can't believe it took 45 minutes for a salad to come out Smh !  This Restaurant has NO NO NO written all over save your money and Just go somewhere else
