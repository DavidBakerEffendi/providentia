If you are looking for a small, cozy place to entertain yourself for the weekend, this is the spot to go. I went there one Saturday and I was surprised as to how much fun I had there. They have a live music and a guest appearances. Like that day, this guy played harmonica amazingly. When I spoke with one of the lead singers about the techniques of how to play harmonica, he took his time to explain every detail. People are nice and extremely pleasant here.
