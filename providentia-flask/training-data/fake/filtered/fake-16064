The food is GREAT and I have always loved coming here, BUT last Saturday 3/1/14 was the last time I ever step foot in this place. We got there at 11pm and were seated right away, but the bouncer who asked us how many, would turn to the hostess, who would look at you and your party and if you didn't fit her criteria, you were denied. Never once, over the next hour of letting people in and denying others, did she look at her manifest to see what tables were free. The only way she Â decided whether people could get in was based on their look. For them to be so openly discriminatory towards paying patrons who just want a good meal I cant rock with.
