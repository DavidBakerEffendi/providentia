The Castello Plan upon entry feels like a great addition to the ever growing Ditmas Park community. But you will be quickly disappointed by its sheer pretentiousness. Unfriendly staff that seem to think we should be lucky to find a seat, small portions without a distinct style and resonating flavor and an owner that seems to feel as if he invented the neighborhood. This an example of gentrification at its worst- whereby "hipsters" swoop in with a sense of entitlement without engaging a community that has been nurturing this diamond in the rough for sometime. I have tried to be open minded, giving the Castello Plan several chances as myself and local friends are happy to support new establishments, but i seem to be more disappointed each time I go. Â I see some positive reviews - im not that surprised as there is little competition in the neighborhood. My recommendation? I'd cross the street and head to Cinco de Mayo, The Farm or Sycamore for a more friendly and Brooklyn style experience.
