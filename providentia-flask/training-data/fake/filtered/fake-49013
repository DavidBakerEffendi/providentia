Went for Valentine's Day.  I guess that serves me right: sometimes V-Day prix fixe meals in NYC can be a rip-off.  And this one was.  Very small servings for $125/person without any bread or even a glass of prosecco.  Chicken was good but NOTworth $125/person.  Courses in between were 2 sunchokes per person.  And the beets were miniscule--definitely not for sharing.  Beets, chicken, sunchokes, gnocchi--are not worth that price.   Waitstaff, however, is excellent and very attentive.  The flavors were great, but definitely feels like a small-plates restaurant, like Tertulia.  Overpriced, small portions.  They have a good idea there if they can appreciate their customer a bit more.  Otherwise, not a place to go twice.
