Three of us went to Ibiza tonight and ordered ten items... my first TAPAS experience... We ordered nine items for dinner and one dessert item. Out of the ten items, I was ecstatic about nine (the one thumbs down was because the shrimp item was not as fresh as it should've been)... but everything else was AWESOME... a fun experience, different, delicious food... vegetables, fish, meat.. they had it all. Yes, small portions, but that's what TAPAS is... and a little higher price, but.. again, some of the best food I've ever had. The downside to this restaurant is it's small and tables are close.. noise level is very loud. Next time, I'll try the quieter one in New Haven.
