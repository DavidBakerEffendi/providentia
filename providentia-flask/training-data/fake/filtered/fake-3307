Almost 1 year ago, my husband and I held our wedding reception here. We heard nothing but raves about the food and warm/cozy atmosphere. The wait staff was wonderful and Heinz the owner and his son Michael catered to all our needs. They treat you like family there and we couldn't have asked for a better experience. Did I mention the food? We have enjoyed Valetine's Day and other occassions at Pheasants Landing and always pleased. It's just DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!!!!!
