I was offered a "special" of chips and guacamole as soon as I sat down -- as if it were free.  Awesome!  I was surprised and pleased... and wrong.  Not free.  I ordered a shrimp burrito with mango salsa.  The chips were weirdly long and quite stale.  The guac was bland and there were two tablespoons of it.  There were three shrimp in a ten dollar burrito, and nary a mango bit to be found amongst the old  tomato bits and wilted lettuce shreds scattered beside it.  To drink?  I had water.  Total bill?  FIFTEEN DOLLARS.  Seems that dollop of tasteless guac was more than a beer would have cost -- if they served beer.  Obnoxious music and worse singing along with it.  I'm not a picky eater, but I am outraged by this sort of bait and switch.  Unpleasant in the extreme.  I should have walked another block and gotten a slice of pizza handed to me through a window.
