I have to admit the food is very good! I grew up around the Ditmars area and really used to enjoy their food. Â My family and I would go there usually more than once a week, but that all came to an end when we saw a rat crawling above us on a ledge. YES I said a RAT. Like I said I do really miss the food, but I could not go back after seeing that.
