December 2012 - my wife and I were treated to a rare night out for dinner, and we try to find new and interesting experiences for these rare occassions.  We had never been to this place in it's various forms, and from the outside it seems appealing, yet the experience was otherwise.  The only positive was that the food was tasty, however we were first seated by an exit door on a cold night when there were plenty of other tables available, then moved to a corner near the kitchen.  Service was amateurish, not knowing the menu details, and constantly pushing our meal and asking if we were done.  Again, there were empty tables even when we left, so there was no rush for turnover.  The price did not justify the experience, and other comments about the bar running their own business was obvious, when I was quoted a $5 glass of wine, then charged $10 for a glass.  We will not return, and I feel this version will follow in the footsteps of the previous tenants, out of business within 6 months.
