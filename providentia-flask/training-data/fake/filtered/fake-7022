Overrated.  Pizzeria Verita came with very high recommendations from several friends and we were quite excited to eat there.  However, it was quite disappointing overall.  The pizzas themselves are okay.  Nothing special for the cost really.  There is better wood-fired pizza locally (Folinos in Shelburne comes to mind).  The antipasta plate was nothing special either and the salad was quite disappointing for $9.  I don't consider a plate of arugula with 2-3 pine nuts on it and one smallish slice of parmesan to be anything worth paying $9 for really.  A couple of things were annoying overall.  We arrived at 5 pm on a Sat and were one of the first tables seated.  We didn't get our pizza for well over an hour and we weren't alone.  This was after the server made a big point of how quickly the pizzas can be cooked ("90 seconds in our 1100 degree wood-fired oven" was the quote).  Even giving huge allowances for it being a busy Saturday, the wait time was excessive.  The other complaint was a $1 surcharge for a small portion of grated parmesan with the pizza.  My fiancee asked for it  initially only to receive a very puzzled look from the server.  The server said yes and then promptly came back to the table saying it would be an additional $1.  Now, honestly, $1 isn't a big deal but I find it odd that a place that charges nearly $20 for a small thin-crust pizza is nickle and diming it's customers over something that is a standard condiment at many pizzerias.  Penny wise, pound foolish I suppose.  Considering our overall check for 2 adults was over $80 before tip, it seemed excessive to do so. Overall, there are better options in the area and if I were really in the mood for wood-fired artisan pizza, I'd just go to Folinos instead. As for it being filling, we ended up getting Pitas to take home from a nearby restaurant.  Neither of us are big eaters either so take that for what it's worth.
