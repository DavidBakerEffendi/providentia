My girlfriend and I went there for lunch and were not pleased with the owner's attitude.  To.make a long story short, he made some offensive anti-semetic remarks about  who he charged for sharing dishes...I don't care how good the food is, I wouldn't support a business that discriminates against the very same Jewish clientele that pay his bills.
