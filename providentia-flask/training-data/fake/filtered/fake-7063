Hi in response to Lou P. Review I totally agree. I work on the same block and often work late. For lunch it's my spot for a quick fix but last night I saw a Kati roll truck doing deliveries and the employees smoking over the food bins. I watched them as they walked in and didn't wash their hands. They immediately started to prepare good for customers, very disgusting for such a popular spot. Beware if ashes in your food yuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk. I tried to speak to delivery guy to tell him that's really inappropriate behavior and told me to "f" off.
