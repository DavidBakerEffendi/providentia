I only had a few days in Manhattan, but when I realized that Junior's was a block away from my hotel, I knew I had to have a meal there--and I absolutely had to have some cheesecake. It did not disappoint. I went for lunch and sat at the bar, where I was surrounded by other friendly solo diners, mostly fellow out-of-towners who were also there because they'd heard great things about the place. We were all waited on by Mr. Gus, who was amazing to watch in action. He calmly and efficiently managed to take care of at least a dozen of us, getting our orders quickly, making sure we always had full glasses of water and soft drinks and keeping us all laughing with his banter. I'd return there just because of him. But, happily, I'll also be returning because of the food. I decided to splurge on calories (since I'd already walked about seven miles that morning--gotta love NYC!) and had the bacon cheeseburger, which was huge and absolutely, decadently delicious. It came with a few massive french fries and onion rings, and though I have a champion appetite, I couldn't finish the sides. I made quick work of the yummy burger, though, and then sat quietly for all of about two minutes before going ahead and ordering myself a piece of their strawberry shortcake cheesecake. Oh. My. GOD!! It was the best of all worlds--the best strawberry shortcake I'd had in decades combined with unbelievably fantastic cheesecake. The piece was huge but insanely light and tasty. It wasn't hard at all to make it disappear, calories be damned. I am keeping my eyes on airfares to NYC because I can't wait to get back there for seconds. And thirds. And twentieths. In the meantime, I am thrilled that I can get my fix via their mail-order cheesecakes. Haven't had a chance to try one yet but plan to very soon. If it's half as good as the ones you get in person, I'm going to have to start blocking out six hours a day for the treadmill. It will be worth it.
