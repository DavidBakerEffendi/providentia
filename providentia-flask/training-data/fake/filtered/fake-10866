LOVEEE IT! clean, stylish, and chic and the food was amazingly good. I've had crawfish in the past and never cared for it until i had crawfish at The Boil and it totally changed my perspective. Deffinitely try the cajun mix but i'm partial to the garlic/butter because well, I love butter! Their mac n cheese is also a must try! Can't wait to go back! p.s excellent service too, the wait staff was friendly and attentive!
