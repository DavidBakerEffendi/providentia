very fresh fish. authentic japanese preparation (rice is perfectly formed and not too dense). Seasoning was used rarely and artfully (i.e. on unagi sushi), and added to the experience. great ambiance, lovely all-wood walls and floor. attentive but non-invasive service. not the best sushi in NYC or Tokyo, but definitely one of the better ones in NYC (that said, I've eaten at the awe-inspiring KyuBei in Tokyo which is amazing...) and you could get out of here for under 30 bucks if you get the nigiri set -- though I'd actually suggest letting the chef just bring what he suggests as that worked out well Â in getting the freshest and best prepared sushi (albeit a bit pricier at around 100 bucks)
