Perfection! Amazing food and welcoming service in a beautiful, relaxing setting -- it doesn't get any better than this! Having family in the south, I've grown to love such dishes as fried green tomatoes, shrimp and grits, hushpuppies, and homemade bread pudding -- nearly impossible to find here up north until now. SweetGrass not only offers many of these favorites but also adds delicious and unexpected twists using fresh, seasonal ingredients. I'm hooked! We enjoyed a terrific lunch starting with the soup of the day, a creamy tomato basil so tasty it should become a daily offering. The grilled romaine salad with cornbread croutons and parmesan was the perfect pairing. And not to be missed is the SweetGrass BLT! There are no words for how phenomenal this sandwich is; it's my new craving. (And I'm apparently not alone -- our server shared with me that one patron has been back four times in as many days, ordering the BLT every time...) The accompanying thin cut fries are a standout on their own -- next visit I'd like to try the homemade carrot salad or the coleslaw, but I'll likely order a side of the french fries as well since they're too good to miss. We finished the meal with a dessert of bread pudding. Wow! Absolutely delicious, especially paired with the rich vanilla chocolate chunk ice cream. Last but not least, we enjoyed several glasses of refreshing sweet tea, some of the best we've had. SweetGrass was pleasantly abuzz with other diners during our visit, and from what we gathered they were as thrilled as we were. We overheard high praises of both the pulled pork and the southern fried chicken sandwiches among other dishes. The vibe was relaxed and cheerful, accentuated by the prompt attention and warm personality of Cutler, our server, who saw to it that our needs were met and our sweet tea glasses were always full. We're incredibly lucky to have a restaurant of this caliber here in Hopewell. Do yourself a favor and check it out -- you'll be glad you did!
