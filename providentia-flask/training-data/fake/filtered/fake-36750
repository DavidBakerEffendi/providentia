PYT burgers are delicious.  I don't know what the deal is with all these people complaining about the neighborhood and inhabitants - what does that have to do with the quality of this restaurant?  One guy was comparing PYT to Vietnam??? I usually go up to PYT when I have guests from out of town or a friend from outside the city that hasn't been yet.  A tasty burger universally hits the spot for a casual dinner.  I live in Center City so the free parking at Piazza is outstandingly awesome.  I've never had bad service, and they are usually cool about suggesting a beer on tap or a pitcher.  The only time I've had mediocre service there was on summer weekends when they were crazy slammed... which is pretty much par for the course when you sign up to eat at a restaurant thats nuthouse busy. The food is simple but tasty and straight to the point.  The prices are totally reasonable for Philadelphia.  Music room, outdoor seating and free parking all a bonus.
