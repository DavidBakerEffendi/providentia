This is my new favorite place!  You think I'm kidding, but I've already been there twice in the last week.  What makes it great?  Other than the excellent selection of bottled beer and 5 standout tap beers, I'd have to say the $5 Texas Two-step is pretty exceptional.  That's right, a shot of Tequila and a Lonestar.  Nothing makes me long for home more, but the Levee does a good job helping me forget that longing..... And for all the other Texans out there, the only other thing I need to mention is Queso.  The real deal, with Rotel and all.   So there it is.  The owners are good Texas folk  hailing from Houston, but have been all over and know how to provide a good time for all.   I look forward to making this my new neighborhood bar.
