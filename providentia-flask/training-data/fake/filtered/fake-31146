My wife and I have a pretty wide range of food dishes; ethnic, Asian, European  or American. We love middle eastern as well. So with great reviews we decided to venture off to my old neighborhood and try Wafa's. Falafel  for appetizer blew me away, then I ordered lamb shwarma. First thing that hit me was a pungent and overwhelming mix of spices, seemed like nutmeg mixed with cinnamon and possibly cardamom. Yes, I cook and have a sense of balance in a dish, but I could not tell you if it were lamb or beef on my plate. The meat was some hand chopped browned pieces with unexpected tough parts of tendons and I was glad I left my reading glasses at home.  My wife had some dish with ground lamb with the same overpowering flavor of this spice mix. My son, on the other hand, liked his shwarma. A side of babaganush and humus was pretty good thus a score of two. Interior reminded me of an upgraded pizzeria with few waiters that were not sure what they were doing, but please don't think of it as a restaurant, it's  more of a trattoria. Surprisingly the place got full with people as we were finishing up, maybe it's me but I doubt it. Hopefully it's just a case of a heavy hand and a spice shaker and an end cut of a lamb shank.  But we're not going back.
