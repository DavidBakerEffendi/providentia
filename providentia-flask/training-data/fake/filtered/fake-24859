2010 - Happy Cinco de Mayo! Upon entering Toro Loco, our senses were immediately stimulated from the robust scent of the sizzling Fajitas passing by to the fun atmosphere. People all around were parting hardy, while some promo girls were handing out free T-shirts, little mariachi's and other cool giveaways.   I'm new to the area and just met Oscar, the bar tender, who was so friendly and very helpful in choosing just the right Mexican beer, XX/Lager, which I had never had before.  It was so good that I might now be addicted.   While at the bar we started with some appetizers, such as Guacamole dip and freshly made Salsa with home made chips.  We also ordered some enchiladas and shrimp in garlic sauce (if I was home I would have licked this plate).  So far it sounds great doesn't it?  Well, let me tell you, it gets better.  After being seated for our main course, I initially thought I wouldn't be able to eat another thing, but with a little break in between, all of us were ready again to experience a feast.  We started out by celebrating with some frozen Margarita's, probably the best around, we couldn't resist so we ordered a pitcher.  While at the bar, we took the advice from another patron to try the Clam soup and the Whole Red Snapper with Mexican spices.  Being a group of four we also ordered the Fajitas Toro Loco to share and OMG we just wanted to devour it all.  Here we were sharing all our meals, and me thinking, that I wished my friends would have continued being a little more social with the guys from Seton Hall, just to allow me to selfishly eat it all.  We really indulged with the fried ice cream and - Oh My - you have to experience this, it couldn't be better.  I have to thank our server too (I think his name was Eric) for immediately getting me some club soda for a spot on my shirt.   This was the absolute best time tonight; made us feel like we were back in Cancun.  Will definitely recommend to all and will be back for more.
