This is, to be sure, a fascinating restaurant worth checking out. But I am being generous with 3 stars, and could go lower. It simply does not make for great romantic experiences, which is what she thought it would be best for. While it was a very exciting ambiance, with interesting Japanese music and kept relatively dark, there were a few issues. First, the waiter kept trying to sell us more stuff. Sure, we were dressed nice and were on a date, but it got a bit ridiculous how much time he spent on our table recommending things. Second, since he successfully got me to buy a drink, I did not realize how expensive their drinks were and ended up being unhappy with our check. Then, it was simply too loud. As someone who is a bit hard of hearing, it was pretty difficult to keep a smooth conversation going with my ex. We could hear a group sitting not too far from us trying to speak over the music, which added to the problem. And the plates were huge. This isn't a problem, typically, but it seemed a bit wasteful, we left food behind. The food is good; the egg rolls were some of the best I've had. As I said, the portions are very generous. Overall, however, it felt an expensive experience. And it is clearly aiming to impress guests. But it all seemed like too much. And, good grief, it was too loud!
