We went to Gramercy Tavern on Easter Sunday for my husband's 30th birthday and I would really recommend this restaurant for a special treat. We don't usually go to this kind of place but found it really friendly and welcoming - the service was excellent. The food was really great but it was the little extras that made all the difference - like the extra bits of food they brought between every course and the fact that they put a second table cloth down when the wine waiter had spilled a drop of wine on our table! If you are visiting New York and looking for an upmarket but unpretentious meal out - choose the Gramercy Tavern (main dining room).
