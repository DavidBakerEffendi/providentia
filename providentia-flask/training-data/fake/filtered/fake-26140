We went to this restaurant based on Philly magazine,  when we opened the door to the foyer it smelled like urine and fish, when they opened the doors to the kitchen, it smelled like a sewer, needless to say very unpleasant.  Did anyone from philly magazine actually visit this restaurant? I described the dish to them from the Philly magazine with the shanghai style noodle and pork they had no idea what I was talking about, we ordered egg rolls and it was frozen inside, the fried rice dish, general tso  chicken and sweet and sour chicken was good, not too difficult to mess up those basic dishes!
