Wow, This is an amazing little spot serving the most unusual and extremely tasty pizza.  If you could imagine pizza meeting the great hardwood flavor of southern open pit BBQ, this is it!  It is more of a flatbread style then a traditional Italian pizza with an extremely thin crispy cust, fantastic cheese combination and a great sauce.  This is one of the most unique and flavorful pies I have had.  I have not tried any of the additional toppings because being a Brooklyn pizza purist, I just don't usually do that. Many pizza places use so called "wood fired" ovens these days but none that I have tried take advantage of the wood so righteously to achieve such an amazing, smokey result.  This is one of the best flavors in Bayonne and better then most wood fired pies I've had in the five boroughs with the exception of maybe Fornino's or Via Tribunali.  Their penne al vodka is great and also features that amazing hardwood smoke flavor.  I've eaten in and taken out and it is works out perfectly either way.  My only complaint is that their menu could feature more choices.  Do not sleep on this great pizza spot!
