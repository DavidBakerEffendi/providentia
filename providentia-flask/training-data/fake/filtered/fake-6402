This place is amazing - don't be fooled by the "Lou's Bagels" sign. This is a really amazing sandwich place. They have these $5.99 lunch specials that are incredible. 40 different sandwiches for $5.99! Seriously who does that and all on HOME MADE BREAD!!  Hot pastrami, egg salad, jersey sloppy joe, a BLT w/cheese & side of mac salad.  It's crowded at lunch so you might want to call in your order ahead of time. This place rocks.
