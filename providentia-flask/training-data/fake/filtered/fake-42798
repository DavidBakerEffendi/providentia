came here several times. sometimes alone and others with friends. the two things that never fail to please my palate: the hainan chicken and the seafood rice noodle. i like the option to order the chicken in different portions so that a solo eater can still enjoy its wonderful flavor and texture. however, more than once, i had vegetables that were too stiff, or simply too overpriced. and the service staff could be a bit more patient.
