One of the few places that I make it a point to go to whenever I'm in CT is The Russell. I only get to go there about 4 or 5 times a year and I have always had a pleasant experience.     My server for the night was an extremely professional and knowledgeable individual by the name of Gianna. She directed us to a comfortable place upstairs and went out of her way to make it even more comfortable by placing two tables together so that we could sit next to each other.    Her advice on appetizers (and the best beer to go with them!!!) were accurate and added to the dining experience.    If I didn't know better I would swear that she diverted other customers away so that I could have a quite romantic evening (as much of our time we were alone upstairs.).     The music was perfect. It was easy to hold a conversation in a normal tone of voice. The selections that were played only added to the moment. And when the candles were lit, it made me feel very special.     Gianna also provided valuable information about upcoming events as well as some of the past history of The Russell.     We did get to meet the owner (Hugh) and he made us feel welcomed as one welcomes an old friend to your home who you haven't seen in a long time and who has stopped in for a nice chat.     This is one of the few places that I will always return to and I strongly reccommend that anyone who wants a romantic evenining or just a friendly watering hole to stop in, The Russell is the place to go.      Thankyou Gianna for the great service. Thankyou Hugh for opening up such a wonderful establishment.
