Love Red Star. Must have eaten their food a few dozen times over the years. Usually pick up take out but have eaten in a handful of times. Takeout- Very dependable, food is tasty and delivered hot. Have ordered numerous items, I recommend the following: Salad-insalata siciliana ; warm sandwich-garlic spinach chicken (yum!) ; any dinner special ; pizza - great crust and sauce. Dining atmosphere - the typical take out joint atmosphere...a few tables and chairs scattered with a fountain soda machine.
