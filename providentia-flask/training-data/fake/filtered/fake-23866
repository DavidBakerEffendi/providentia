My husband and I have been going to Sazon Restaurant for more than three years at least once a week, and for us it has being always a good experience. We love the food in this cozy restaurant. My son is just a year old and he likes tequenos, the chicken with cheese arepa and their natural juices. My husband favorite dishes are the Asado Negro and the Pabellon, but also he likes the Cheese and Carne Mechada empanada. When I was pregnant I used to order soup, chicken or beef are the best. I also like the Pernil arepa this flavor is amazing, the Arroz con Pollo is really good and the Pork Chops are so juicy. Of course we can't miss the chocolate at the end. Robert and his wife Judith make the best hot chocolate. it is awesome. We really feel so comfortable is this restaurant, for us it has a great atmosphere and the service is very good, that is why we are having a party next weekend, I am sure we are going to share and enjoy with my family and friends a very nice moment eating amazing food and getting a good service.
