The food, seems to be more new-age Spanish and non-conventional. In general, I thought there seafood plates are their weak side, probably because the dishes were handled heavily, way too much flavors and techniques which mask the essence of the protein. For the most part, their tapas under delivered in terms of value. In terms of taste, I thought they were trying to do a little too much on most of their dishes, leading to sauces dominating in meat dishes (Morcilla & Lamb Tartare) or over use of cooking techniques that hurt the main component of the dish, (Fried Sardines, Pork Belly).
