I had such high expectations as this is closer than Panera, but expectations were dashed.  I placed my order for a salad to go at 2:06; I did not receive it until 2:20.   Back at my desk and my chopped salad did not have any bacon on it and I had to slice the avocado as it was presented in my salad as a big mound.  I guess I will stick to Paneras for now.
