Where do i begin?...First off I love this place the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because when I order Long Island Iced Tea they sometimes give it to me in a small glass that they usually serve water in instead of the tall high ball glasses. Other than that I love CTH. I'm not a beer drinker so I can give any recommendations as far as beer goes. I absolutely love the Shrimp and Grits!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Its served as an appetizer but I get it as the main entree. It's INCREDIBLE
