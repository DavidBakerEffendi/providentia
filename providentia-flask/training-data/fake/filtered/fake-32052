One of the worst restaurants I've ever eaten at, by far.  I had the blackened mahi and risotto- over cooked fish, no taste and creamy overcooked risotto.  Seriously bad decor from the 80's- I think.  Really tacky and ridiculously overpriced for the quality.  Nothing fresh, can easily get better italian from a supermarket.  This place should close down... the 1 star is for the service- all whom were nice and attentive.
