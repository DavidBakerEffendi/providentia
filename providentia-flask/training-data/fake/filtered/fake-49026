The service was horrible.  The food was served cold and sent back and came back the second time just luke warm.  We could not find the waiter and had to go find a server to get water.  While the restaurant itself is just lovely there were very few other diners so it should not have taken so long to get served.  We had to get spoons and plates to share our desserts off of other tables because the waiter was no where to be found.  I would never go back there.  We did complain to the Bar Manager who was gracious and very upset and actually refunded the two dinner entrees that came out cold twice.  She could not have been nicer or more apologetic about it.  The waiter disappeared when confronted.  I was not going to say anything but when we were asked about the food and the service I just could not keep quiet.  I would not go back nor would I recommend it to my friends.
