stepped in this place to actually see and ole friend, an ole girlfriend, and her family. i was really quite immpressed. i am really proud of T. Hencheck. I really miss her after all these yrs. she didnt even reconize me. havent seen her since the day she left, back in the late 90s. I am happy for you T. you look good after all these yrs.
