First time at The Orange Squirrel last night for my birthday! Every dish we sampled was Delicious, superbly seasoned, and generous portions. The signature squirrel balls were very tasty. Very light, airy with a unique cheese inside.  The banana bread pudding with caramel sauce, procuitto and arugula pizza, Mac n Cheese, and the jumbo skillet Chicken pot pie with puff pastry were out if this world; great comfort food too. We were lucky enough to get a private tour of the kitchen and wine and food refrigerator I must say was the cleanest commercial kitchen ever.  I highly recommend this unique culinary dining experience to Everyone!! We will be back soon.
