Food was disgusting. The atmosphere was fun!  The service was fantastic and the waitress was upbeat.   The Ahi Tuna tacos were awesome. But, I ordered the Cajun Crawfish Po' Boy, it described it as being topped with cole slaw and tartar sauce... It came on a MOSTLY empty sub roll; underneath the very very dry, obviously frozen crawfish, there was a very small amount of what was either chopped cabbage or lettuce mixed with some mayo.  It was possibly the dryest most disappointing sandwich I'd ever had. So I reorded something else. I then ordered the Buffalo Bison Bites. Described as mini buffalo burgers topped with an avocado aioli, American cheese, a touch of chipolte, and onion strings.  I ordered the bites RARE, knowing that whoever is cooking I have now lost faith in talents, thinking that they would most likely come done.  I was correct.  I ordered RARE and them came to me... WELL DONE.  NO onion rings on these bites, I had 2 fried onions on each.   SO disappointing.  I might add we did complain to the manager and she did give us credit for each of my entrees that were horrible.  Definitely NOT going back anytime soon.
