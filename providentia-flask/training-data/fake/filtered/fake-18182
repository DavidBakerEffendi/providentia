On a trip to Philadelphia, my boyfriend and I passed this on our way back to our hotel. We liked the name & the style, so we decided to look up the menu and we went. He got a chicken, cheddar and broccoli dinner crepe, I got a mushroom, egg and cheddar dinner crepe, and we split an apples and brown sugar dessert crepe. All this, with two beers and a coffee, was only about $42, and it was a lot of food-- I took home about 1/3 of my crepe! And the crepes were delishhh, especially the mushroom sauce on mine. The service was wonderful and fast; our waitress (Amie?) was super friendly and nice (as were most people we experience in Philly) and even the busboy had a recommendation for dessert. The waitress was even nice to the dummy next to us who couldn't understand the "build your own crepe" menu and messed up his own order-- then blamed her! It was a tad dark, but the atmosphere was nice (I'd say a good date place). All in all, a great place!
