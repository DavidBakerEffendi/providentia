Wanted to eat in Hartford after the UCONN game today so came to this place.  We were one of the people to get there after the game and were seated right away.  There were 2 of us. Service was slow! Took about 10 minutes to get drinks. Right before I ordered another server came over and took my menu away...said they were out of them and needed it for another table (the menus were photocopies...can't you just print or copy more?). One thing I did not like was that they did not have a plain burger that you could just add toppings to.  All of their burgers were themed.  it took about 25 minutes for our order to be served.  The servers seemed really frazzled.  I know Hartford typically is not busy on the weekend unless there is an event in town but this was the last UCONN men's basketball game of the season to be played at the XL Center...the season started in the fall...you should have your act together by now!  Granted the place was pretty full but we were one of the first people there and there was no line of people waiting so I don't consider that to be really busy when your talking about a restaurant.   Finally got our burgers and mine was missing the bacon.  The server took care of it right away.  The burger was fine...not bad but not extraordinary.  Fries were ok.  By the way, the burgers were $12.95 each!  That is too much for hartford. If you are in Hartford for an event and feel like burgers afterwards, I would suggest driving to Max Burger in West Hartford Center if you live west of Hartford--both the speed of service and quality of food is much better. Will not be going back here again due to lack of organization.  People don't return for average tasting food when the service is subpar...they only put up with it when the food is special.
