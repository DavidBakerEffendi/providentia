After driving by nemuerosx times, my mother and I decided to try it out.  Like Rhon, I expected more of a Hawaiian cuisine and was disappointed by the limited menu offered.. The restaurant was large and airy, but sparsely populated.  The ladies room was a mess; 2 toilets had overflowed and one had not been flushed.  As you left the bathroom, there was a fishy smell experienced as you passed the sushi bar, and this should not occur. I enjoyed the seafood linguine very much as I ate half my meal; however, after getting home, I did not enjoy the experience over the next five hours.  I paid for my dinner with severe food poisoning.  I coukd not even keep down a mouthful of water, and almost went to the ER.
