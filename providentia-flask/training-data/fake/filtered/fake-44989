I just had the worst experience ever ordering from Wings over Hartford West. I ordered a Hangar 4 from a menu that was provided to us from a previous order. The price on the menu was different than the price quoted over the phone. The manager picked up the phone and said that they are not going to honor the price because we apparently have an old menu. He was vary rude and very unprofessional. If that's the case, (which is not) he should have honored the price and told me that he would send me a new menu. The difference was $5 and I asked him if he was going to argue with me over the amount. His response was, "your total is .... and that's what you have to pay".
