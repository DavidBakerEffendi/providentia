I love Calandra's Village!  As soon as you walk in you get a welcomed feeling and the food at the restaurant there is delicious.  I have been there with my family numerous times and the food portions are so large, we always have leftovers for home.  The kids love it there and are always excited to get some gelato, while I relax with a cappuccino.  Known for its bread, the bakery out does itself, and they even have a deli with sandwiches and pizza for a quick lunch.  I definitely recommend stopping by!
