We called ahead on a busy night and the owner somehow managed to squeeze us in for dinner at the last minute. When we arrived, he remembered my name from when I called, which was quite charming. I am writing this review a few weeks later, so forgive me that I don't remember the exact details of our meal! For the first course, we had the appetizer special which was something with pumpkin polenta. My boyfriend and I are still talking about how amazing this dish was, almost a month later! If they have it on special, GET IT! For entrees, he had the gnocchi, and I had the osso bucco. Both were outstanding. For dessert, canoli, which was probably the best I've ever had, and I've had a lot of canolis! All in all, a fantastic experience, and we will be returning.
