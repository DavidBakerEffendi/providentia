One Stop Jamaican Restaurant -- formerly Caribbean Connection -- is a tiny establishment on Whalley Avenue (just before the Stop & Shop).  It may not give off the most inviting vibe, but the food is certainly worth it!  It is small and out-of-the-way.  And unless you count the scattered bar stools inside or solitary table in front of the restaurant, there is no place to sit.  Evidently, One Stop is a take-out place (and they deliver free of charge!).  I went at around 5:00 pm on a Wednesday with one companion, and we ate the food back in our dorm room. I ordered the restaurant's specialty: oxtail.  I had never tried the dish before, and I have to admit, I was a little intimidated.  But the meal (I also ordered a side of moist and delicious cornbread) was quite good.  The meat was clearly fatty, but it was also warm and succulent.  Back in my dorm room, my fork did me little good, however.  And I was eventually forced to eat the generous portion with my hands, which were promptly slathered with BBQ sauce!  My friend enjoyed his Chicken & Pork Jambalaya, with a side of collared greens, as well. One Stop is certainly not on the radar of most Yalies, but I believe it should be.  It is relatively cheap (the two of spent spent about $16 total), serves tremendous portions, and offers a culinary experience we would otherwise rarely have.
