Worst delivery experience I've ever had. Order arrived cold, with no receipt and took over 2 hours to get to my house- I live 1/2 mile away. I called 4 times to get an update and was told each time that the driver had just left. When I called to complain it was cold, they were rude and had a "whatever" attitude. Â Better off eating an m&m in the couch cushion.
