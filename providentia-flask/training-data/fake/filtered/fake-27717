Been getting my sicilian pizza with rainbow spumoni from this place since I was six. I didn't know how good the sicilian pizza here was until I tried others... and... realized I was spoiled. I have an unhealthy love affair with the spumoni... I buy a quart size thinking I'll have it in my freezer for the entire week... but it only lasts one night. Seriously people, sicilian pizza + spumoni are a match made in heaven.
