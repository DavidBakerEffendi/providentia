Mamoun's was the first place I tried falafel. Since then it has remained my favorite. If you like middle eastern food you should definitely try it. I give four stars only because the restaurant is not absolutely presentable. But it is made up for with awesome service. My favorite is the falafel sandwich and the chicken kebab sandwich. Try the hot sauce and honey on it. AMAZING
