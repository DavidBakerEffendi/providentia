Terrible customer service, mediocre food, and over an hour and a half wait for my delivery. This sums up my first, and only, experience of this place. I ordered a half-chicken with rice and fries, with a chocolate mousse. Â The teenage girl on the phone neglected to ask my phone number or give me an expected delivery time. After 45 mins, I called back to make sure the driver had my number so he could call me when he arrived. The man who picked up the phone seemed annoyed that I had called back and asked about my order. He told me it was ready and would go out in a moment. I asked him if they had my phone number so the driver could contact me, and he placed me on hold and hung up. I shrugged this off and went to wait outside (in 30 degree weather), thinking since Picnic is only about 6 blocks from my apartment, it wouldn't take long. Boy was I wrong. After sitting out there for another 25 minutes, I called back to see what the hell was going on. A different man answered and told me that the order had just gone out 3 minutes ago. "Great!" I thought to myself.....until 10 minutes after that when I STILL did not have my food. Eventually I saw a car with the company logo atop the roof, which drove past my place, realize his mistake, make an illegal u-turn on FERRY ST, to then nearly drive past me again. After begrudgingly signing my credit card receipt (had I been paying in cash I would have told the place to shove it), I get my food into my house to find it lukewarm at best, flavorless and greasy. And to top it off, they didnt even pack plastic forks, or napkins, or sauce! Avoid this place like the plague. Ferry St barbeque (on Congress and Ferry) is a ton better.
