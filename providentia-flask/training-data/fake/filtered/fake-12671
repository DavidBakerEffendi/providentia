The Host told us to expect 30-45 minutes wait time for a table. Alright, fair enough. We understood. But hold on - we did not sign up for an Hour Wait time and NO Service orientated staff! Not to mention, a bad Calabrian Wine on the Wine-List. As if we did not have enough, after an hour of wait we simply asked for the status of the table. Ofcourse we had to wait a "little bit more". At that point we gave up on the pleasure to eat here, but who imagined that we would also had to kindly wait for the bar-tender to give us the bill! Seems like she was in the midst of some serious chitchat. Did I already say that this was completely awful? because it was. It ruined my beautiful night. Â  Lupa and Mr. Batali - I think I will pass on this "wonderful" experience also in the future. Good Luck!
