I have this coupons for this restaurants.. Just called they told me THEY ARE NOT GOING TO HONER it.. and the manager is was yelling over the phone, we have stop that last week.. excused me it says till Nov 30ths that's tomorrow.. you just pissed the 1st time customer off.. so if that's how they are to the customer they service and food has to suck !.. this is UNCALLED for.. the manager should just honored it . I never will and tell people to go this Restaurant anymore ! YOU JUST LOST a customer or many of my friends who loves Thai food.. because of your manager action You lost all my respect as a customer to even step foot in there.. All i wanted to do try the food and use the coupons before it expire tomorrow !.. PS NYC PPL or anyone who wants to go there to eat DON'T"T they are rude as hell..
