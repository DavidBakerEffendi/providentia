Last night we took the trek out to Brooklyn. My girlfriend is from Uruguay and I wanted to surprise her with a night out that would make her feel like being home.     Let me tell you this places is, "THE JOINT!", We had the best time. The place is small but really nice, from the moment you step inside   you feel comfortable.   There where some folks celebrating a birthday, so there was a wait for a table, so we sat at the bar and never left.   The food was great, we had Mussels and Provolone for apps, Chivito (classic Uruguayan plate) and  Churrasco for main, both were superb. It's home style with a flair, delicious, and just enough. For dessert we ordered the Flan and  were invited to a delicious chocolate torta ( cross between a mousse and flour-less chocolate cake).  This place is one that I will highly recommend and definitely revisit with friends. I wish nothing but the best for Ramiro and the crew., This is a place that you should support if your around  Williams burg, you wont be disappointed.
