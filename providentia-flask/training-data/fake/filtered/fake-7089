This is another Times Square oasis in a lunch food desert for people who work here.  What would I do without Kati Roll!  The long lines are annoying, but they're long for a reason.  The rolls are delicious.  The veggie roll with beets is unusual and excellent.  Don't wait in line!  Definitely call your order in ahead of time.
