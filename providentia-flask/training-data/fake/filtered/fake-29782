EXCELLENT!!!  Was on a mini vacation from freezing MN and the warmth of Erawan Chinatown was so welcoming!  From their initial glowing orange sign outside to the spacious interior with warm colors that made the atmosphere so cozy.  Not to mention the unique wall dividers that were like huge windows; the beautiful decorations--I especially loved the Thai paintings and glowing candles throughout the restaurant; and the great friendly service from the entire smiling staff.  It was a Thursday night and the place was almost full with a very diverse crowd--a great sign!  My girlfriend and I loved the refreshing Thai Iced Teas (she adored the little hearts on the straw wrappers too) and her savory red curry, but my Wild Boar entree was even better!  Both dishes were very flavorful, wonderful presentation and generous portions.  Make sure to top of your delicious dinner with their Fresh Mangoes & Sticky Rice for dessert also.  Philly Chinatown, you have a diamond in the rough there!
