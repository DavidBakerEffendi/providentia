Such a treat to go here ..... Amazing Indian food and very reasonable prices. If you love delicious Indian food at a very reasonable price in a lovely atmosphere then this is your restaurant!  They bring you warm and fresh food. The malai kofta is the best I've ever had.  The service is very good and friendly.
