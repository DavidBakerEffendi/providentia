I have never posted a review before on yelp, about any business, I wanted soup to-go and stopped in there to get the mushroom soup, but I cannot even believe I just paid $12 for a cup of broth and a tiny side of rice. There were no mushrooms in it, no tofu. Just broth. And these onions that tasted like chemicals that are fried that you put on top?? Â And a hunk of lime. I wish I had my $12 back so bad. I am embarrassed for this restaurant. I am embarrassed that I didn't read these reviews first before wasting my money.
