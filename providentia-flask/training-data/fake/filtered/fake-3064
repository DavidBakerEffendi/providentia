My family and I were very fortunate to visit Cuban Pete's the other night .  Must say that I was not crazy about the idea of waiting but the wait was worth it.  What an experience , the food , the music , the atmosphere, the service, wow !!!  The owner himself sat us and made us feel at home. Without a dought it is a place that must experience yourself. Take the entire family and don't forget to order the Armamdo Passion sangria.
