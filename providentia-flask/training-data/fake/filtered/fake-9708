The food here is good. I like their margherita pizza. I would've given them a better rating if they had not try to scam me. I held an event here and they overcharged me by $50. I looked at the bill to see if I was charge for anything extra but the items on the check were correct so I assumed the total was correct. However, I did the actual math afterwards and noticed the total did not match the items that were added up. I called the restaurant to inquire about the incorrect total and to see if there was something extra they added but did not write down on the check. They took down my number and said the manager will call back. Days went by and no one called. I contacted them again and again but was given the run around. The person I needed to speak to was either on break or on vacation. Â I finally got a hold of someone who asked me to call back after they review the tab. I called back a day later and she gave me the total I was charged but didn't explain what items added up to that amount. I had to call back another day for them to pull up the tab again. Then she told me the total was correct. I said no it's not because we were charged per head, so that plus tax and tip does not equal to what I was charged. She took out a calculator and I had to help her do the math. Finally she said "ok so $50 extra I can give you a gift certificate for that amount but I'm only here on certain days and times" I was annoyed, not only did they blatantly tried to avoid the "mistake" they made, no apology was given, instead I was offered a gift certificate I can only come pick up during some magical hours that she was there. I was polite the entire time and not once did I complain until now. So people, if you have a large party, make sure you add up the items one by one to see if it matches the total. Because apparently they have a hard time adding even with a calculator.
