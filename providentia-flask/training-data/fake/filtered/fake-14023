It makes me sad to write this review but there was no opportunity to get our point across at Farm yesterday so I'm left with no choice. Farm on Adderley has always been a favorite in my family-both for food and service.  However yesterday's (Mother's Day) experience was unbelievable shocking.  We arrived (three adults, one two year old) for brunch right when they opened.  The restaurant filled quickly and clearly they were not at all prepared.  We ordered two egg dishes, a burger and a side of scrambled eggs and toast-didn't seem complicated.  The food took over ONE HOUR to come-that is no exaggeration.  The waitress didn't even try to offer anything (bread, some fruit for our child, water...) and just kept blaming the kitchen.  Apparently "the burger takes longer."  We have a $50 grill at home and you can cook a burger in 15 minutes.  We were not the only extremely dissatisfied customers (some bordered irate and left, went to CT Muffin, got coffee and muffins and came back and their food STILL was not out).  I've been a waitress-stuff happens in the kitchen you can't control but how about saying "let me  warn you our burgers take a long time" when someone orders it.  Or at least make sure you keep their water glass full!  FYI-the food came out lukewarm at best, the eggs were runny and my husband's burger was sub-par at best, not even served  on the english muffin that was advertised!  Argh!  Luckily it was a very happy mother's day despite the lousy food and service!
