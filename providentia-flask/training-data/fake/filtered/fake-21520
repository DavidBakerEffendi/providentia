Ward III is a great find!  Great ambiance, interesting drinks and very friendly staff.  The scene is very energetic but the space does not get  overly crowded, even when we were there on a Saturday night.  The drink menu has many interesting choices (loved the Moroccan Martini!), and all my friends that ordered bespoke cocktails came away happy.  Music selection was also much appreciated, albeit a little loud for casual conversation. I was there with a group of about 25-30 people to celebrate my birthday and received so many compliments from my guests about choosing Ward III.  Many people were adamant about returning.  Additionally, I found the staff to be super friendly and accommodating - from Abdul to our waitress to the bartenders.  Cannot say enough! Thanks Ward III for a great night out and a fun birthday experience!
