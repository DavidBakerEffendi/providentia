Such a great venue for a sunny Sunday afternoon. The Pork Verde was delicious, but I especially loved the sweet potato fries and the wings. The outdoor seating was relaxing, the inside was beautiful, and the beer list was great. It offers a Center City vibe without the hustle and bustle. Nothing better than sitting outside in Pennsport with a cold craft beer and good food. Highly recommended. The only issue was the lack of alcohol prices on the menu, which many others have noted.
