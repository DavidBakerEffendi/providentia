This place is a must when you're in soho ! Being of french origins and living in NY, top notch french food is pretty hard to find in a city like this. This place defines french cuisine. Elegant, classy restaurant that really gives you your moneys worth even though it's a bit pricy you won't regret it. Full bar, awesome desserts ..this place is a tourist attraction and is always PACKED ! So you might want to make a reservation ahead of time or a walk in ahead of time too. The Caramelized Banana Ricotta Tart is awesome !
