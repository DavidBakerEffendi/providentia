Hearing a lot of great things about this place i had a lot of high hopes. With that said, the fries were good but the line to get in was ridiculous and the place was wayy to tiny to sit and enjoy, don't even know why they even bother to have a seating area. Sauces were pretty good, loved the variety and the fact they let me try the sauces even with a 100 people behind waiting lol.
