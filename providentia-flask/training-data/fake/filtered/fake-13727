My boyfriend and I came to Jolie Cantina on a whim while spending the day in Brooklyn. As a lover of Mexican food he was understandably excited, however, as I tend to stay away from the spicy variety I was tentative to say the least. I was worried for nothing!! Though certainly the dishes we ordered were spicy, they were spicy in a flavourful and enjoyable way that enhanced the dish (rather than making me die). I ordered the Cantina Mama Nachos and he the BBQ Organic Chicken Tacos and both were DELICIOUS! We were both SO glad that we stumbled on this place. Now that we are back at home (in Canada) he continually talks about the food here and complains we are so far away. If you are looking for a great (and pretty affordable) lunch/dinner with a zesty twist and a fun atmosphere, this is a fantastic option!
