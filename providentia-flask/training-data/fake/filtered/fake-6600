I got a Cesar salad with chicken on it from here. I paid $11.00 for the salad and $4.00 for the chicken to be added. I got the salad to go, when I arrived at work and open the salad I was amazed at how little chicken was added to the salad. It looked maybe about 1/4-1/2 a chicken breast...for $4.00 No Way!! And the salad, which the menu said was a large (the only size it comes in) did not turn out to be a large, it looks to be a small salad with even less chicken on it. Very disappointed to spend a total of $15.95 and receive a very small portion considering the price. However, the salad tasted fine, nothing special, and the service was speedy. Overall, I cannot get over the price and lack of product.
