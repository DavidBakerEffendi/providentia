I LOVE THIS PLACE! I am never disappointed in my churrasco with coconut rice. To top it off, it is BYOB. I rated this place 4 stars because sometimes the place is too hectic and busy that the waiters don't get to our table to take drink orders or anything. Also, they ask how you want your steak cooked, and even if you say well done or medium well, it's still bloody. The food, atmosphere and music are great. Definitely must come here for the food!!!
