This place is new and I went to try the food, which was excellent! I highly recommend the General Tso's Chicken, the sesame chicken, the fried rice, or the lo mein. If you spend more than $15 you get a free can of soda (but this is only for carry out). I love their food, i usually come to order lunch.
