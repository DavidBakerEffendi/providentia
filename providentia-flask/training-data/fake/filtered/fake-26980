My husband and I celebrated our anniversary at Guild & Company, where we have dined before.  We were given a nice table, gracious, attentive service and a fabulous meal (the ribeye for two with two sides, salads and sauces included in the price)  The steak was perfectly cooked to order and we even brought some home---it was so large. The cocktail list is extensive and they offer Vermont's excellent Hill Brewery beer which is not available everywhere.  That was definitely a treat for my husband who appreciates local microbreweries.  The pricing is on the high side compared to many local restaurants, but we felt it was fair for the excellent quality of the food and service.   The only reason I did not give it five stars is because the dining room was quite noisy and there was no dinner music.  This might not bother others, and it would not deter us from returning,  but it took away, somewhat, from a fine dining experience. (Maybe because we are older people!) The Guild bar and dining room was very busy for a week night, so I would advise making reservations.  We will definitely be going back!
