We were heading down from Maine to DC today and needed a place to stop for lunch.  There's a Subway in the same shopping center but we decided to go with the local option.  We were VERY impressed.  Loved their menu, the two people who attended to us were very friendly and personable, and both of the 2 sandwiches we ordered were exceptional.  The lunch meat was high quality and high quantity.  They also encouraged to try some of their samples and their chicken salad was delicious.  We probably won't be able to go back there anytime soon but wanted to send them a good word.
