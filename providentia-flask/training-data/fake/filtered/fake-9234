WOW! I received a belated Birthday cake and pizza as a belated Birthday present. Both delicious! I have a gluten allergy and I try my hardest to stay away from cow dairy and soy. First, the Birthday cake, the first "real" and "store bought" cake I've had in 10 years! It was a beautiful cake, and delicious! Vanilla cake, raspberry filling, "buttercream" frosting with coconut on the outside. I saved a piece for my sister-in-law who's dairy/gluten free and she couldn't believe how tasty and wholesome it was! The pizza was to die for, it had diya and sheep cheese (lactose free), zucchini, roasted red peppers, artichokes, spices, tomato sauce. Just the right combination of each. But the best part was the crust. It was a thick crust (which is hard to find), soft and crispy. I highly recommend it! The person who dealt with the ordering and pick said the staff was extremely kind and helpful. One person I talked to said that their prices are a little high, but when you cook or bake gluten/dairy/nut/soy (egg and yeast free also available), all ingredients are expensive and that's the way it is. They have great pictures and items available to see on their facebook page. Thank you, Dee's One Smart Cookie!
