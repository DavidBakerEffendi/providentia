The food is fantastic, the cost is very reasonable and the service is warm and friendly. I've tried several sushi places in the area and I honestly have to say that Sushi California has the best food and atmosphere. It has a nice warm, cozy feel to it. We love coming here whenever we have a sushi craving.
