Came in the other night for the first time. First impressions are everything and our first impression was amazing. They really did an amazing job renovating and preserving Montclairs history. Hostesses were attentive and extremely accommodating. For dinner we had the Elote which is this smoky creamy corn dip- Amazing!!!! Dinner was roasted venison and rabbit fricasse!! Both were out of this world! And dessert we had the chocolate soufflé which took 15 minutes- very quick for soufflé!! Overall the service was spectacular and our waitress was extremely accomidating and was able to properly answer every question about the meal and suggested awesome wine pairings! I love that they use iPods at the tables to take orders. I've read some morons reviews about the servers using their cell phones at the table. Get with the 21st century!!! We will defiantly be back!!!
