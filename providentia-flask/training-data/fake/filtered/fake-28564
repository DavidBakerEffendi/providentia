4 adults and 4 kids (age 3-10) enjoyed a great lunch here.  We arrived around 1:15pm and the place was 1/2 full.  They were helpful at moving tables together since their small restaurant is all 2- and 4-tops.  We shared delicious Chicken Curry (mild) - kids loved it, Tandori Chicken, Dal, the Samosas, Chicken Tikka Masala, nan, and some vegetable fritter things and of course rice and the sauces/chutneys.  The food was delicious!  Everyone cleared their plates - even the 3 year old.  Most lunch servings were about $6.95 and the Nan was extra at $2.50 each.  Our family of 4's bill was $42.00 with tip (and just water to drink).  The server didn't check back with us but we bothered him enough for more water, Raita, etc that we kept him coming around.  I will definitely be back again!
