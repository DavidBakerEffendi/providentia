Went last night, and ordered al pastor, brisket, and fried chicken tacos. The tacos that arrived at our table were fish, chorizo, and grilled chicken. They were ordered by the neighboring table, I think. We began eating before we realized the mishap (it was dark outside), and then at least one staff member realized what had happened and did exactly nothing except question us about which number we had been assigned (he'd already taken the stand w/ the number on it away) and then walk away shrugging. So yeah, pretty unsatisfying as we ended up eating tacos we had no particular craving for, and no one at Gueros cared Â to remedy the mistake. The chorizo was good, everything else we got was not seasoned enough. The frozen margaritas were excellent, much better than Chavelas (which always have too much triple-sec.) I don't swear by Chavelas (competing Mexican restaurant down the road), but they've never gotten my order wrong, and they generally have enough room to sit down, unlike Gueros.
