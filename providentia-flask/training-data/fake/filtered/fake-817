Amazing chili dogs, the best fries this side of the boardwalk, and great prices. For $8 I got a fully loaded hot dog, French fries, soda, and a chocolate milk for my daughter. The fries were perfectly cooked and were overflowing from the container they were served in. Â The chili dog was amazing, a bit crispy on the ends and full of deliciousness. Everything from the bread to the onions on top was a mark of perfection. Large varied menu and fantastic prices.
