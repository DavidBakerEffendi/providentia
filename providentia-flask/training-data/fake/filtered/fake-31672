Wow! The menu is great, the food is inexpensive and the staff is extremely friendly. I've already been here 3 times since it opened just a week or so ago and it hasn't ceased to amaze me. The gnocchi lasagna for ~$12 is delicious! I also recommend their pesto and proscuitto flatbreads (haven't tried the others yet but they look incredible), and the goat cheese poppers. So happy this placed opened up.
