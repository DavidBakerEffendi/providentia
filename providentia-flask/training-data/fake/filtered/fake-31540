This place is amazing. A little noisy but the view is awesome. Alexis, my waitress provided exceptional customer service. She was very courteous and knowledgable of the food that's in the menu. My fianc√© was overwhelmed and enthused about the service she provided. Her customer service skills are EXCELLENT which made his birthday dinner even more exciting. Just for the record, I'm a big critique on customer service. Thanks Alexis for making our night enjoyable and pleasant. Oh, and how can I forget, the food was DELICIOUS AND AFFORDABLE. We will definitely be visiting again. Love it!
