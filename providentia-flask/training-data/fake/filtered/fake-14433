Went there for the first time ordered turkey wings, rice, black eyed peas, collard greens and banana pudding. Let me get to the point.: The food is just OK. The greens had a buttery flavor which on first bite I thought was good but by the end became boring. I've had better turkey wings before just basic flavor nothing special, the rice and peas seemed like they were from a can or box. The banana pudding is real sad not sure if any real banana were present just one vanilla wafer on top of some "pudding" mixture with some cookie crumbs. The portions are way too small for the price. Sorry but there is no way in the World that meal should have costed me $21! Too bad JE's closed down.....
