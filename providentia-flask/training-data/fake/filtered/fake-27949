So, I'm totally THAT person who asks a million questions about the menu, and I do have to say I was quite impressed with our waitress here! Without hesitation, she knew the menu inside and out (a sign of great service!). Our party of 4 had brunch here on Sunday. Two orders of the creme brulee French toast, 1 order of steak & eggs, and 1 order of the omelette of the day were ordered. We waited quite some time for our food - The waitress was apologetic, and the Manager even came over to apologize. This was their first day serving brunch, so we figured there probably were some kinks that needed to be worked out in the kitchen. When our food finally arrived, it was beautifully presented and tasted just as good! The long wait for our food was quickly forgotten, as we all loved the food so much. Â All in all, we had an enjoyable experience, and will definitely be "brunching" here again soon.
