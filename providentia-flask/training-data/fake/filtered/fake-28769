The food here is amazing! What a nice place to relax and have an incredible meal at a surprisingly great price and not feel like you are being rushed out so they can open up the table. If this isn't your style then I wouldn't suggest coming here, this is not McDonalds or Applebees, there is no 20 mins in and out. Go here with friends and enjoy spending some time together without being rushed. Great food, great drinks, beautiful and simple decor. Love it here!
