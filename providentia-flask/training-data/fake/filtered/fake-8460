I go to the Devil's Den at least once a week.  Beer selection is constantly evolving.  So it's a great place to try something new.  They change their food menu pretty regularly so check back often.  I've never been disappointed.  Their farmhouse burger (dry rubbed beef, pulled pork, fried egg) was incredible.  I couldn't  put it down til there was nothing left but grease on my fingers.  Their mussels rival monks and eulogy and "The Den" has a better layout/ floor plan in my opinion.  Happy hour they have 1/2 price oysters on the half shell, something I usually take advantage of. They're a little pricey, but fair.  You're getting top notch food and incredible beer so you definitely get what you pay for.  Bar staff is awesome.  Most of them know my name, I haven't done anything exceptional (that I know of), they're just good people who are good with faces.  I'll continue to be a regular for as long as they'll have me.
