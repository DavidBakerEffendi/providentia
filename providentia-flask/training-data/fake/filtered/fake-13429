I'm usually satisfied with this place, but today the "manager" was very rude to us. We were a party of 5, waiting for 30 minutes to get a table. First, they didn't make any effort to accommodate us, and were filling the large tables with couples, but that wasn't as bad as their attitude. After 30 minutes of wait the "manager" asked us to wait outside, and we asked to stay inside because it was windy and still cold. She said that we should leave then. That was really rude and inappropriate, because we are regulars and would wait longer to get seated. Dissapointed.
