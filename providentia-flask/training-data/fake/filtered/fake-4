I enjoyed coffee and breakfast twice at Toast during my recent visit to Philly. The first morning I enjoyed the Omelette du Jour which had a savory filling of roast tomato, portobello, artichoke, goat cheese, and wilted spinach. It was accompanied by a crisp small side salad of baby greens, tomato, and berries. The house dressing was light and complementary, not at all over powering. I just HAD to complement the chef. The barista recommended a pour over coffee and it did not disappoint. He prepared my cup with care and attention to time and form. I followed the pour over with a wonderful latte, again prepared very well. As I was leaving town, I decided to visit again for breakfast before my long trip ahead. This breakfast was a delicious Eggs Benedict combo that was perfectly done and complemented by mushrooms, roast tomato, and a generous helping of wilted greens. A rich cup of melted butter accompanied the dish and the sweet side salad again brought balance to my meal. This time the barista made me a perfect cup of French Pressed Guatemalan Vienna roast coffee. It was balanced and bright, yet rich in flavor. I had to have a second cup to go! Cudos to the barista, chef, and friendly staff. Toast is definitely a place to visit, eat, and enjoy coffee prepared in a variety ways. Don't miss this one!
