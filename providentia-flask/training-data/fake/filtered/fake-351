I love me some pizza! I eat pizza a few times a week, and I always say. even bad pizza is good pizza. But thats not the case here, the pizza is always good. The service and the staff, not so much. I love the pizza, so I try and stop in for take Â out when im eating alone. I can find much better options if I want table service.
