High expectations after reading the reviews here but.... Went without a reservation on a Wednesday evening and got seated in an elbow to elbow table not fit for European cloister phobics. After pleading, got our wish to be moved to the open table in front of the open window. Ahhh. Ordered wine - a bottle they also sell by the glass- a Pino Blanc from Alsace and requested to have a taste before making the $47 decision (one of the more bottom end priced bottles). Not possible, the handsome,  French accented waiter said. I stupidly accepted then he brought the bottle, opened it and proceeded to pour two FULL glasses - half the bottle without letting us taste it. It turned out to be luke warm and slightly sweet. when I remarked about this, he retrieved an ice bucket noting awkwardly it would get colder soon. It turned out the guy was in training, first day on the job. But that shouldn't be our problem. The more competent waitress who took over explained this to us and apologized, at least. But that was it. We ordered the mussels and clams as an app- our impression was they were slightly overlooked. The broth had flavor but was over salty. I had the sautéed halibut in lemon sauce- fresh tasting, nicely done - best with the good ratatouille we ordered as a side. The fries were not worth the $6 price or the calories- fat and mealy and tasteless despite the spice layer. Husband ordered the steak which was perfectly fine. The best part of the meal was the warm mini baguettes with butter!
