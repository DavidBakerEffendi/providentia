I had an amazing amazing time here. Service, price, food and overall experience cannot be beat. Even though its entrance is in an alley, you likely won't miss it as it has an intricate maroon door with an iron knocker and a dramatic awning indicating its presence. You'll knock on the door and be greeted by the charming employees who won't hesitate to tell you how long they've been around (34 years!). The black and white montage of celebrity visits (Cher, a very young Brad Pitt) also back their word. You'll start the evening off in a decadent and exotic Moroccan den with the waiter dousing your hands in rose water. You'll be primarily eating with your hands so don't be alarmed by this. It's a pre-fixe seven courses but you do get choices for the first two main courses. Definitely get the spicy chicken in cumin sauce. The chicken is so tender that it falls off the bone. Â  Here's the other need-to-knows: Roll with: Groups of four and more. It's way too much food for a date. Pro-tips: The waiter will come with a basket full of pita bread at the start of the meal - make sure you get plenty of these as they'll be primarily what you'll be eating with. Also, bring your own wine or alcohol. It's apparently a thing in PA.
