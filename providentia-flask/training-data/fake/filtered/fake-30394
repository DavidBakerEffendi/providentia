My husband and I enjoy this place for date nights sans kiddos, althogh we've brought our 3 kids before (early dinners) and the waitstaff is great in getting food out in time so no one gets bored or cranky waiting for food. we went last week and we shared the calamari and seafood risotto which were both excellent. save room for dessert too - they have some really yummy ones!!
