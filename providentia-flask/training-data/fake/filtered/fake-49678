Awful!  We went there on Sat. night and there were many open tables which should have alerted us.  The bread, popovers, and lobster crepe appetizer were very good.  However, I ordered scallops as my entree for $31. and out came 4 medium-sized scallops.  My husband's hanger steak was tough.  Our friend's lambchops looked great when they were served but when she cut into them, they were underdone and extremely fatty.  Mention was made to the waitress, but no one came by to address her displeasure.  There was practically no meat on these chops, just fat.  Our other friend odered a burger for $24. and it was certainly not worth the money especially since the french fries that accompanied it were not hot.   It was our friends'  45th wedding anniversary and I'd called earlier to arrange something special for them.  I was told to let them order what they wanted and they would put a candle on it and write Happy Anniversary in chocolate.  They said they were making a note of it on the reservation. When we arrived at the restaurant, I went up to the front desk to confirm and was told that they had a record of this request on the reservation and would inform the server. When the dessert came out, it said Happy Birthday instead of Happy Anniversary. I was livid. My husband and I usually share a dessert but inasmuch as his hanger steak was minimal in size and I only had 4 scallops, we opted for our own desserts. Good thing as the chocolate lava cake, while being very good, was the size of a small cupcake($9 each). . In summary, beautiful surrounding, overpriced food , mediocre to poor quality at best.
