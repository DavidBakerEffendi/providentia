So, this was my second visit because I loved it so much the first time. With that being said I wasn't as happy the second time. Menu is still very small and the seared snapper special was so small it looked more like an appetizer. Waygu burgers all ordered medium came out more rare to med. rare. Calamari was great on a positive note. I think I will visit other places before coming here again.
