Loved it. I ordered "The Smoker" burger based off a recommendation from Anna E...(thanks!). This was a juicy burger full of flavor. The Garlic Aoili was great! It's been an hour since I ate there and my mouth is still watering thinking about it. I ordered the sweet potato fries as my side...they were good too. I also ordered the Chipotle and Agave Wings. They had good flavor and were about the size of normal wing portions. There was just enough meat on them. I went around 12:30 and it was not overly busy. I sat at the bar. I was very happy with the bartender and the service i received. Everyone seemed to be very friendly. Â The food came out in a timely way and at a good temperature. There is a nice ambiance to this place. I would definitely take my wife here for dinner when she is in the mood for a great burger. The only negative is this is New Haven...so if you are going during the dinner hour don't expect to find parking right in front of the building. Fortunately my wife and I love New Haven and walking around in it. Do not let it deter you from coming here....you will not be disappointed.
