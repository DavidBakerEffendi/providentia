Our first trip to Fond, after they first opened, was just... OK. I'm glad that, months later, we returned. Fond is a young BYOB with fairly young owners, and it's apparent to me that they have learned, adjusted, and matured quite a bit in the 6 months or so since they've opened. The parsnip soup with chorizo was outstanding. The cream is poured in separately from the other ingredients, so everything has a nice snap and comes together without becoming diluted. The short rib was, flat out, one of the best things I've ever had. The grain (I forget what it was called) had a delicious goat cheese sauce. The next time I went (about a week later), the food was again terrific, and the service outstanding. Even though 2 in our party of 5 didn't order appetizers, the server split up a serving of one of the apps to give them for free, just so that they would have something to eat while everyone else had their apps. I thought this was a really top notch thing to do.
