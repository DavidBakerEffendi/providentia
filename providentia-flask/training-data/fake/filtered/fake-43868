Unfortunately I can't say that I have had good experiences here and I have visited at least 4 separate times.  The food is sub par at best  and the service leaves something to be desired and I found a bug in my food the last time I went.  It's such a shame because this is only 1/2 a block away from me but I travel to the Maoz 2-3 block away or get  take out from Smyrna now.
