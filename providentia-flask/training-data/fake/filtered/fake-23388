Whenever I come here I always get a hot, steaming bowl of curry chicken noodle soup along with their country-style duck (the duck comes with a spicy dipping sauce they make themselves). This place always hits the spot--especially when I'm craving something warm and hearty. That said, I found myself going there several times this summer. Would also recommend the beef belly flat noodle soup and the wonton noodles. Have yet to try their rice dishes, but hey, why mess with a good thing?
