Never go to this place.i am Indian  and went with my family.manager named Anika or. Ania is bitch.she is no one racist.was very sweet and hospitable to all white families and was very rude to us.her staff  did not bring menu to us for 15 min and then continuously asking us if we are  done even b4 our appetizers came. She and her staff were like dogs wagging their tails to all white customers.food was ok nothing special.never seen such racial behavior in broad day light.never never go there.
