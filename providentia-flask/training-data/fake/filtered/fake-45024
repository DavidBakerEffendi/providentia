I had walked by Cafe Henri, and read the reviews. I decided to meet a cousin I hadn't seen for a long time there. Being brunch, I called twice the day before. At noon, they told me that the might take reservations for a group of 8, but I would have to call at night. At 8 PM they told me again no reservations, but if I came in by 10:30 AM, I would have no problems. In any case, I should call in the morning to give the restaurant a heads up. On the Sunday I was planning on going, I called at 9:30 AM and was told there would be no problem. We arrive exactly at 10:30 to be told oh too bad, we got busy, come back in 30 minutes. It was freezing outside, so we decided to get in our cars and drive around the neighborhood, which my relatives did not know. We returned 25 minutes later, to be told "Oh you should have stayed." Charmant? Mais non!!!
