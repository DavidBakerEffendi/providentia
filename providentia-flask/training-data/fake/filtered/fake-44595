Their brunch is by far better than their dinner. The dinner menu while it looks great items are just okay. I do recommend the ravioli, Which has a lot of flavor. I do have to say that the ambience is very nice; But my experience recently with the waiter wasn't a good one. I went with a group of six people and the bill was very expensive. Â It was upwards of $250 per person so we all put credit cards down on top of the check to be split evenly. The waitress in a rude manner let me know that they can only take three credit cards. I asked her nicely to them please split the bill into two and use three credit cards on each divided bill. She refused! It went as far as me needing to speak to the manager, because who in their right mind brings $300 in cash to dinner? When I told her that we didn't have enough cash on us she told me to go to an ATM. At a restaurant this nice where prices are high I really did expect that they would accept our credit cards. They did end up accepting it after talking to the manager but I left a bad taste in my mouth.
