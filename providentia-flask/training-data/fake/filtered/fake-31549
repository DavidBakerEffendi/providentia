Ive been to blend a couple of times, including for my moms birthday. The food is amazing. I've tried maybe 5-6 things on the menu and I've loved all of it ! Also the service is amazing. My server tonight was Stephanie and she gave us great service. Everything we asked for came quick, and she was super friendly! This is seriously one of my favorite places don't hesitate to try it!
