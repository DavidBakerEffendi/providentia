I'm am currently writing this as I am still waiting for my delivery order- 2 1/2hours later... It's unfortunate that this restaurant, that does have really great food, is suffering from this lack of customer service. We have called them 5 times. The manager has not offered any type of apologies and or reimbursement. Steer clear from ordering anything for delivery unless you want to go to bed hungry and pissed off.
