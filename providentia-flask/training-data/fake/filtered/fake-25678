The decor is very nice, the food is good. Service is friendly but you have to ask for just about everything it becomes tiresome. Portions are tiny so go when you are not too hungry. It's a designer kinda place if you are into that sort of thing. Nice place to have in Bed-Stuy though. As a white friend said as we waited for our food, Where did all these white people come from?
