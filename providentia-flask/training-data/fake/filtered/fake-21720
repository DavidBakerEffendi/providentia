I thoroughly enjoyed last night's seafood gumbo and the beet/ squash quinoa side but consider the much-vaunted chocolate bread pudding overrated.  Each  component of the gumbo was perfectly cooked, even the okra, which is easy to identify and a lovely fresh shade of green.   There was just enough cayenne to make the broth interesting without overwhelming the palate and the portion was generous, a great buy for the price.  The quinoa was further enhanced by a touch of fresh ginger.  My husband really liked the chicken in red wine and we both thought our waiter was excellent.
