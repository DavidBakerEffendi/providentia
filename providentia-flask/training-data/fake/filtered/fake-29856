The food was excellent. We were a large group and dined on probably the whole menu. Small plates for sharing! Not a bad choice in the bunch. The place is tiny! We went on a Thursday night and there was a singer and guitarist. Great ambiance. The wait staff was also really helpful, polite and efficient. It would be a great night out for a large group Â (like we were) or dinner for two. My guess is make a reservation though.
