had dinner at the Hourglass Tavern on Sat. Sept. 7. I had the short ribs from their menu- excellent! My wife ordered leg of lamb, which was a special that day- also excellent- We also shared a special salad of the day- brown fig and warm goat cheese and greens, delicious. Very tight table area like a lot of great places in NY. Our waitress was a very gracious woman named Maria- she could not have been more pleasant and attentive. We will return.
