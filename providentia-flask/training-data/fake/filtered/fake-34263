Love this place.  We tried a a lot of different things - sausages, ribs, brisket, pulled pork and a bunch of sides too.  Everything was really good, and the ribs were my favorite.   The only problem is that everyone else loves this place too, and the line literally goes out the door and down the block if you go at prime-time, and even pretty late (it is the East Village after all).  I try to go offpeak.
