I'm honestly not sure what all the hype is about The Spotted Pig. The staff was pleasant enough, but it felt like I was waiting for my food for years. Ages. Millennia. Who knows, maybe they were having an off night but after having to wait for a table it just felt ridiculous. The food was pretty good, but there are plenty of other places that somehow manage numbers and timing more gracefully.
