Look up in the sky and you will possibly see how many stars Serpico deserves.It is not your typical Starr/pick a country restaurant. The food is just incredible, very creative and absolutely delicious. The menu may look a little daunting but don't let that inhibit you. It is a marvelous blend of textures, flavors, etc., from beginning to end. The wait staff was just terrific, even the hostess, met us at the door to thank us when we left. These people are well trained and it shows. The ambiance was a lot of fun, boisterous but still able to have a pleasant conversation with your friends.This place is a hot ticket and deservedly so.
