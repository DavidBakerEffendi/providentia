I want to give a shout out to the owners of Ol Boy soul food. Every time I come there the food is consistent and delicious. I have tried almost everything on the menu and I can't say what I like the best. If I had to chose, I guess I would go with the BBQ turkey wings. The place is very clean, which won my heart from the door. The two young ladies at the front counter was very pleasant and attentive to your needs. I like that you can see straight back into the cooking area, it lets you know that they are clean and not trying to hide anything. I read the comment that was made by Maggie on 7/19/13 and I must say that you couldn't have had the food. The food is amazing and always on point. I have had ppl from my job order from there and they all loved it. Maybe you was trying to give them a bad rap but it didn't work. Ol Boy Soul Food is the best (in my opinion) soul food is west Philly.
