Cute. Food wise everything was delicious. Lagman was tasty, full bodied and perfect for the cold rainy day. Pumpkin samosa pretty good. My fav was was the dumplings. It was so so good, the scallions, made the dish. Cookies awesome. Even my drink was fresh and tasty. What put me off was the owner, I don't know if he was shy or aloof. When I eat out I consider the overall experience not just the food. However everything that matters was good so I will definitely come back and give this place a second go around next time I'm in the neighborhood.
