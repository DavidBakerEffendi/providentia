Pomme Frites! or in English: French Fries. I can not believe I forgot to write about this place, I just realized two nights ago when I came here... "Why didn't I yelp this place yet?" Was it because I wanted to keep it a secret? Well I don't want to be selfish so let me share my fave french fry place since I'm a true french fry lover. What amazing fries! The fries here are perfectly thick, perfectly fried, and perfectly priced. There are various sauces to choose from, just about every single sauce they have is delicious! This place is tiny, there is no bathroom, there is a small seating area, it's very cute and cozy. The place makes you feel like you're in a village somewhere in Europe, which by the way is where you can find the very best food in Europe, from small villages. Basically what you do is: Go inside. Wait in line if there is one. (& stop being a biatch if there is a huge line, no sht there's gona be a big line sometimes if you come during the stores rush hour, that's a sign that the fries are YUMMMMM!) There are three sizes, Regular is pretty big for a single person unless you've got the munchies, the other two sizes are pretty hugee! You can share it with 3-4 people and they will disappear quickly! ....Yes they're that great! Don't be shocked to find out there is nothing more than french fries here, the name of the place is Pomme Frites. Just like the crappy movie The Women, which ONLY has women in the entire movie (cheesyyy), this spot ONLY has the Pomme Frites (AWESOME!). You can pretty much eat french fries ANY TIME YOU WANT! When you're hungry, in the morning, for brunch, for dinner, late night.... So you can't go wrong.
