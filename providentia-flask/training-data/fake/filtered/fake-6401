My son and his girlfriend took me there last night. The place is small but very clean. They were expecting us as my son called ahead and made reservations. The service was impeccable! Friendly, knowledgeable staff and the Tapas are AWESOME. We dined on garlic shrimp, mushrooms, and sirloin tips. Plenty of warm bread and butter to enjoy the awesome sauces. Â  Will definitely be going back. Welcoming attentive staff and delicious food
