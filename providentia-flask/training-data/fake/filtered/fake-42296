dumplings, dumplings, dumplings this place has the best dumplings i have had in NY, on the same day i had both Prosperity dumpling's dumplings and Vanessa's Dumpling House dumplings. me and my friends bought and ate bought 50 dumplings 2 different soups and 2 pancakes which where good but a in my opion did not have enough meat in it. the soup at this place was ok nothing special. i gave this place a 4 out of 5 simply because it seemed very dirty, with holes in the walls and all, also it was very small, meaning there is not enough room to stand. -Prosperity dumplings had a far better dumpling then Vanessa's.
