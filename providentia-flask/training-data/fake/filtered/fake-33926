Had brunch with a girl friend.  Excited to try given all the hype and I love Element with same owner.  Thought it was just ok.  We got 6, 7 dishes to share - overall pretty good; presentation very nice but a bit heavy on the salt.  Service was good.  For this price, would expect more.  Perhaps dinner is different but overall it's decent but don't feel like it's great.
