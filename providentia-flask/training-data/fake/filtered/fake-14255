I was very happy when the owner reopened after 'Sandy'. If you're like me and was brought up on eating in NYC Chinatown, than you're always comparing any Resturant outside of NYC Chinatown. Well---, I like Lees very much. The food is as close as you're going to get north of NYC and if you know what you like as Chinatown, they will cook it for you.
