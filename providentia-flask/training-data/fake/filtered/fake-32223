Great value for your hard earned dollars! Food was tasty, portions were generous and service was excellent!  If you are looking for a fancy French restaruant, Le Parisein may not be your choice. But if you are looking for real French food, unintimidating and real down to earth atmosphere, you must come here. We enjoyed all the 3 apeptizers that the owner recommended, escargot was served with real shells, duck confit was chunky and done well. I wasn't feeling too well, so I only had a French onion soup, the best onion soup I ever tasted, not salty at all, infact you can taste the sweetness  that came through with tons of sweet onion condensed in the base. My husband had the steak tartar. He said it tasted like what he had in France when he went there on business but bigger portion. My daughter had the Marseilles mussels, she loved it so much that she took the left over brooth home with her. Even the French flies were done to perfection, not greasy, serve up in an aluminum can to keep them warm (brilliant ) and you can taste real hand picked potatoes! For dessert, we absolutely loved the creme brûlée, very creamy and not too sweet at all. A must try! Service was excellent with just the right amount of attentiveness. We will definitely return again to try all the other dishes on the menu.
