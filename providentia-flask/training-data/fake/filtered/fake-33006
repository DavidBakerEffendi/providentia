This has got to be some of the best, most authentic cuisine I've eaten in Philly. I find that a lot of restaurants are skimpy on their portions and lack flavor and love (the most important ingredient). The service here at Ratchada was amazing, friendly, attentive and professional. The food was flavorful, fresh, authentic and clearly crafted by someone who knows and loves what they do in the kitchen. I will be here again soon. And you should go, too!
