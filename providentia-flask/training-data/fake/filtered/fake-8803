Blue Ribbon is one of my classic stand bys that never disappoints. The staff is friendly and professional, and the bartender was very helpful in selecting an appropriate cocktail to go with my meal. Every time I go to Blue Ribbon I can't help but order oysters, which are always wonderfully fresh and delicious. Along with oysters, I usually prefer to get a few small plates and share, but I'm sure the entrees are great. My strawberry sundae for dessert was divine!
