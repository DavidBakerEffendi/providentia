I am sorry I cannot rate this any higher, but I work at Jefferson and I order pizza for our residents on average once a week, for years.  Multiple years.  We all prefer the pizza at NYPD, but our second and third choices in the area will have to do going forward :-((  The management (owner I think), is the RUDEST man I have ever encountered, especially over the phone.  He has a brother who screws up the orders or omits information.  The owner  starts out rude and he ends rude.  Please and thank you aren't in his vocab.  He honestly sounds like you are bothering him when ordering from his establishment.  And when we order, our order is no less than $80 and sometimes hits $150 when we have a dinner event.  Jefferson is this man's livelihood but when I ask around, I am not the only one treated like a bother.  He may think he's the pizza nazi from watching too many Seinfeld episodes, but we can give our money to another pizza shop who wants a few grand in pizza purchases a year, not a creep.  I swore I would never go back the last time I went, but now it's a done deal.  Your great pizza alone just isn't enough!!!  Try NOT being a d**k!
