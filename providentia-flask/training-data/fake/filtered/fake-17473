Although I was not thrilled about waiting 2 hours to eat this pizza, it was definitely worth the wait. The coal oven makes the crust crispy and reflects what true Italian pizza should taste like. The ingredients are super fresh -- the tomato sauce tastes like they just squeezed the tomatoes right onto the pizza! A must-do if you're in NYC.
