Finally made reservations to this place after several attempts. They are always packed and there is a good reason why. We took our 15 year old son with us who appreciates good food and we all loved it. We had a three-course tasting menu and enjoyed every dish. The place is small but cozy, seams like their target audience are couples. The service was great and very personal. You can clearly see the chef cooking in the kitchen area, reminded me of one small restaurant we dined at while in Paris. Overall, the quality you get for the price is amazing. We are already planning to go again and try other offerings from the a-la cart menu.
