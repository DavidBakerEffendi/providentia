How can you NOT love BBQ? I swear this place is pretty awesome. The appetizers were kinda small but then you get your entree meal and its a perfect size. If you come hungry I promise you will leave satisfied. My friends and I all got different things and pretty much just shared everything off each others plates thats how good the food all looked. SO OF COURSE we had to try all of it lol. I got the RIBS and oh man so saucy love that. I would recommend the ribs to anyone that likes saucy food =)
