Had some old folks in tow and needed a place in this neighborhood where we could hear each other. I explained this when making our reservation and was pleased to be seated upstairs, where we were near the kitchen but could enjoy catching up with each other. The service was impeccable, which is no small feat since our server had to run up and downstairs...he was as kind as could be when my dad wanted a beer but wasn't familiar with any of the belgian ales...he asked questions and got the perfect brew from the bartender. Salads were great and my burger (sirloin w/short rib!) was fantastic. Â I had originally been hesitant because of some underwhelming reviews but now I understand that some people need a lot more than others...if you want a very good meal, very good service, and a perfectly fine atmosphere for a group, come here!
