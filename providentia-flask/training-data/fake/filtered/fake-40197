I usually can't taste much of a difference in Pizza. Its crust, sauce and cheese. But Di Fara I had to try with the reputation it has. OMG! OMG! OMG! I have NEVER tasted better pizza in the whole world! The crust taste home made and fresh, not too thin or too thick. The sauce taste bucket fresh of tomatoes with fresh spices. Basil leaves on top of fresh mozzarella. A must experience for a lifetime!
