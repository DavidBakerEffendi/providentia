We always stop for lunch or dinner here when we're in the Quechee area. It's hard to believe that the food is so fabulous in such a modest venue but we are newly impressed every time we visit. The chef can do everything from very gourmet to homey and everything is well-seasoned and balanced for flavor and texture. I couldn't believe some of the reviews on Yelp that were negative-- we have eaten here numerous times and every time it was great! The waitress remembered us from the previous summer and all the staff is friendly and attentive. I used to live in Berkeley, the foodie captial of the West Coast, and I can say that I know my food.
