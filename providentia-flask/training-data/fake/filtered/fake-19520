The Staff is exceptional.  Each server, bar person smiles and I think it is because they know what is being served and they like where they work.  How many of us can say that?    From the extensive extraordinary wine selection, beer selection, food and awesome service to th attention to detail an artistic surroundings, this is a place you will always return to.  It's home for the weary worker and traveler.  Thanks Standard Tap, you rock.  PS:  Don't forget to taste the fabulous coffee.  A NC resident.
