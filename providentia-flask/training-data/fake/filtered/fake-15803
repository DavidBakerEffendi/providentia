Came in before a show and sat at the bar.  What is wrong with the owner and managers of this restaurant.  Do they really think that old man behind the bar is funny with his mean humor.  They to need to FIRE him.  The way he treats his co-workers( the busser and the the girl working with him behind the bar).  It's unbelievable how his co workers takes his abusive humor and still try to have a smile on their face while serving the customers.   I felt so bad for the girl behind the bar, while she tried to keep a smile on her face while that mean old man belittled her in front of a bar full of customers.  I guess she really needs her job... I refuse to go eat their again as long as that man has a job there and I will be spreading the word about staying from Junior's as long as he is there....No MATTER HOW GOOD THE CHEESCAKE WAS!!!!!
