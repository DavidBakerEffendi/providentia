I was visiting a friend and she said we had to get lunch here and I am so glad we did! It was the most delicious pizza I have every had- sorry mom. Â I will admit it is more expensive than average pizza place, it is super crowded and it's not fancy at all but it's all about pizza. Authentic, fresh, absolutely delicious. Worth waiting for and paying extra for!
