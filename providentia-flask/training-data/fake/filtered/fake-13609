You're going to wait but the food is absolutely amazing.  These guys take pride in individual ingredients and it's more about the quality of said ingredients then it is about the dishes (though they are stellar!). To top it all off the bang for your buck is out of this world.  These guys always have a wait, I have no idea why they don't charge more because they totally could!
