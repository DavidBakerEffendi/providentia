My boyfriend brought me there as a surprise for the first time tonight and I am already thinking about when to go back! I absolutely fell IN LOVE with this place as soon as I entered through the palm trees. The atmosphere is on point; like if you just walked into Cuba. My boyfriend read the reviews that said the garlic shrimp was one of the best - we definitely do not regret it, although it was a bit pricey for the portion but so worth it. We both got the skirt steaks but different flavors (gaucho and mango). Each flavor gave it a completely different feel. I've never enjoyed EVERY SINGLE BITE of my food like I did tonight. I cannot explain how much I love this place and is now my favorite restaurant. The only reason why I give it 4 stars and may prevent me from going back is the service; not because it was slow but because I felt the waiter was extremely rude. I felt like he was rushing us the whole time. I didn't feel comfortable taking my time to enjoy my food with him standing around watching us and waiting for us to finish. It was kind of annoying.
