I was in Smokin Bettys Thursday Night 8/20/09 with a friend having dinner when I was greeted warmly by a young lady (I wish I can remember her name) and was promptly seated in the back dining area, chose a seat by the window facing 11th street, ordered wine, skipped the appitizers and I ordered the BBQ wings, my friend ordered a HUGE grilled chicken salad. The food was, to me,FOUR STAR GOOD. I, and my friend, WILL BE BACK...and both of us WILL TELL ALL OF OUR MUTUAL FRIENDS TO COME AND CHECK OUT THE GOOD FOOD YOUR ESTABLISHMENT SERVES...from smithmr357431@yahoo.com
