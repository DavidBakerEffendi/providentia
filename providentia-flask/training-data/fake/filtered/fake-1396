How about a zero star.... I had terrible bathroom problems.  Visiting from Cali where REAL Filipino food can be appreciated.  Used the bathroom and when I walked in I saw 3 tiny brown longated creatures with about 6-8 legs (ROACHES) scurried into holes big enough to fit a large booger.  So I can't imagine what the kitchen looks like at 3am.   If any of you New Yorkers comes to San Francisco....please Yelp Filipino cruisines for you will have plenty to choose from.
