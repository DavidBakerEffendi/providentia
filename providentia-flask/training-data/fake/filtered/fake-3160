Mexican food is my favorite; I've been to many restaurants looking for the perfect Mexican food. Mexican Mariachi is by far my favorite restaurant ever. I've had the Speedy Gonzaléz which I would recommend to anyone who likes steak. They always cook it to tender perfection whilst every strip of beef is meticulously selected for quality as I have never seen a piece of gristle in it from the fifty or so orders I've had of it. The chicken fajitas are excellent as well. The chicken always perfectly tender and never over or under seasoned ( get the side of guac for only a dollar it will be delicious :] ) Last but not least The Trés Leches is my addiction. I order it every week as much as I can. The best dessert I have ever had hands down, two thumbs up & five stars with a 11 out of 10 rating. I've never tried trés leches before I decided to give it a try and I'm glad I've found the best dessert in the world that I try to eat every day of my life. If you like mexican food or food in general check this place out! You will not be disappointed. In fact: you will probably return from the amazing quality accompanied by a more than reasonable price. P.S. The Trés Leches is incredible; don't pass it up.
