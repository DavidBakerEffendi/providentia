Four Corners doesn't need another 5 star review. Take a look -- it's pretty obvious this place makes bomb sandwiches. I think these sandwiches are so good because they're crafted by a man who cares about his craft. Some of the reviews complaining about wait times and other logistics seem to expect the art of thoughtful sandwich-making to scale, just like that. And now details: my favorite is the kimchi pork, or tibetan tofu if you're vegetarian.
