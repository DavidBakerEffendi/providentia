5 Stars? On a scale between 1-5 stars this place rates 10 stars! It's hands down the best Roast Beef in the country. You listen on here to people who say they shelled out $6 and feel they got ripped off. You read it and clearly know that that person knows nothing about food quality. They want quality and quanity at the same time. I am sure you can get a huge $6 roast beef sandwich when they use a buck a pound beef with meat tenderizer.  I guess people just assume because it's a hole in the wall dive that the place just serves a cheap grade of beef that is made well. If you assumed that you would be wrong. Nick's Old Original Roast Beef uses only U.S.D.A. Aged Prime Beef. Aged Prime Beef is about 5 times the price of regular roast. Knowing that you can't possibly expect to get a huge sandwich of the quality that Nick's sells. It's very rare to see the word Aged Prime unless you're dining at a 5 star steak house. So when I hear someone criticizing Nick's for the size of their sandwich I instantly know that person is cluess to quality. And as far as their seasoning, forget about it! The savory flavors of Nick's overboard beef are second to none. Their secret seasoning can't be duplicated. Others  tried but never came close. You can dupicate a Pat's or Geno's, but you can never duplicate a Nick's. It's by far the best sandwich in Philadelphia, and probably the country.
