I want to say that this place is not child friendly, perhaps some notice of that would be great. I traveled 30 minutes to get to this restaurant, I did not know you needed reservations. The host was rude and hide behind a curtain and peeked out and said she would not be able to serve us because there is no room for my child to sit in a child seat. I have never experienced a ruder host and will never come back to this restaurant.
