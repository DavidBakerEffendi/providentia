Meh. Everyone talked about this little halal food stand forever...saying, "Oh Its the BEST food you'll ever eat!" Sorry guys, I don't think so. While the food was ok, I thought it VERY greasy and kinda gross...and the flavors didn't really pop for me. It was pretty much just as good as any other halal truck food I'd ever had. I guess if I had been completely wasted at 3:00 in the morning, I wouldve thought it better. The tahini sauce was not really that at all. It was basically ranch dressing on the side. Needless to say, I won't be running back anytime soon.
