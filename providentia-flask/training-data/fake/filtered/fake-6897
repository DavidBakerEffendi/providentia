Very nice and knowledgeable staff , warm and cozy atmosphere and last but not the least very very consistent food . I've lost track of how many times I had a meal and endless drinks here ...boy I'm hooked to (an) Open Door ! Now about the food ...don't really know what to start with since I went thru nearly all the items on the menu..from a heavenly delicious Trio of Tartare ( tuna , salmon and fluke ) to a Beef Stew served w rice and toasted bread , let me not forget the Meatloaf w roasted garlic mashed and onion gravy....yummy , as of for brunch the French Toast or Steak and eggs are something u can't Â go wrong either .
