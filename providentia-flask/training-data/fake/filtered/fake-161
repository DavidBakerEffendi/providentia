Went there todaywith my wife & daughter, THE ABSOLUTE WORST so called cheesesteaks that we have ever had!   Dry meat, cold, uncooked mushrooms, nasty, rude, unpleasant staff, not to mention, $ 45.00 for 3 crappy sandwiches, 3drinks &2 fries,  pleeaassee, never again!. Good thing they have the tourist thing going, because return customers do not exist.
