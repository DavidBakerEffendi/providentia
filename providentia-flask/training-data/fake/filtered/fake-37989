My family and I decided to go here for dinner on a Saturday night. The staff told us the wait would be about 35 minutes. We waited more than an HOUR AND FORTY FIVE minutes before they even THOUGHT about serving us. This is dishonest to customers and prevents honest people excited to have a meal at a nice place from having a meal on a timescale that they determine (based on the word of the staff). Had I known this place would keep my family in paralysis for nearly 2 hours, we would not have considered going. This is particularly offensive for a business that does not allow for reservations. My recommendation: if you have any sort of plan within 4 hours of dinner, don't even think about this place.
