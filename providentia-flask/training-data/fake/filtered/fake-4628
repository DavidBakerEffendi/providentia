Went for a quiet dinner here one evening in September. It was really warm outside even though it was after 9pm so was delighted that the place was air conditioned! Cannot recommend this place highly enough. The staff are so nice and friendly without being too intrusive, the food is amazing and there is a lovely, very italian atmosphere in the place.YUM!) 5 stars!
