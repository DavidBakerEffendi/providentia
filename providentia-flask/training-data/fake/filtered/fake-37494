this place was amazing! we stopped in on a saturday evening not knowing they took reservations and they were more than happy to seat us anyway. the service was amazing from the minute we walked in and the food was yummy! run, do not walk to this place... since there is really no other way to get there. this place is a hidden gem in red hook.
