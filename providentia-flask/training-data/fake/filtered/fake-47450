Bitter sweet for me now that the word is out about Pepe Rosso Social! Not only does the home style cooking taste like it's straight out of some Italian mom's kitchen, the prices, service and atmosphere is about as good as it gets. You'd be foolish to not check this hidden gem out before reservations are required!
