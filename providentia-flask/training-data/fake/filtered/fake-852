I don't know where to begin,:-)  I went there for lunch I stood in line I waited 15 minutes.I was totally ignored to the point when I ask to speak to a manager the manager never came out .I believe this to be because I am African American I never felt so disrespected in a place that I intended to spend my money at. I recommend that if you are not of Latin descent you are really not welcome in this establishment. I never even got to try the food and wouldn't recommend trying to food . I have many Spanish friends  who told me to try this place out now I regret ever going at all I left feeling less of a human being.
