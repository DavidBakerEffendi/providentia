Food is excellent and the closest one can get to good old home cooking. Unlike other Â filipino restaurants, their food is not soggy and always tastes freshly made. Price is reasonable, staff is friendly and the place is clean. I totally understand why some orders can get delayed in the weekends. It is because they are not made via a fast food method. I have placed orders there almost on a monthly basis since they opened and never had to wait for my order .i highly recommend the place.
