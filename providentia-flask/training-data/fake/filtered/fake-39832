Holy Moly! what a find! the folks who recommended the ribs were spot on. lotsa meat, brilliant sauce, and not to heavy. Knowing that I went for only 2 to eat, and 2 coming home in the bag. The dry noodles with homemade noodles, had an aroma that was as erotic as it was tasty . Crab and Pork. the waitstaff was friendly, helpful, and willing to teach the ways of the spices to add. My only regret is not spying the specials board when i came in. But I'll be back.
