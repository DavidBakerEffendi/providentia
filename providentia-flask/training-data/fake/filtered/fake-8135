Yuca Bar has been consistently excellent for a long time.  I usually go for the Tuesday half-priced tapas and the food is remarkably delicious. But I went yesterday and they mustve had a new chef, because every single dish I ordered was bland at the best, unpalatable at worst.  Crab cakes were mushy and flavorless, Coconut Shrimp was dry and flavorless, Quesedillas were crispy, almost burnt, and the black beans ONLY flavor was that of being burnt.  Also no salt in anything and WAY too much sugar in the hot chocolate. Entirely an amateur, if not malicious meal.  Please taste these things before you serve them!  Please bring the previous chef back at any cost!  (Oh and to add insult to injury, their prices went up)
