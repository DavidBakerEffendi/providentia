I don't know why someone would be surprised why a small business owner specializing in breakfast might not be happy with someone "bringing half of their own breakfast" while expecting no surcharge....bizarre!! Forget the food, the service at Plum is excellent and the food is even better ...anyone writing a negative review because they were pissed they got charged for bringing their own coffee to a place specializing in breakfast (btw, their lunch and dinner is outstanding too) may not be "wrapped too tight"...I suggest readers try Plum sans the Starbucks coffee prior to judgement (btw, Plum has better coffee anyway)
