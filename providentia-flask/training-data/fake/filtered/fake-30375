OMG!  Saraghina is my "Go-to"  spot to "think-n-drink"!  It seems like I'm compelled to wake up, get my morning coffee and muffin fix and get some writing done here everyday!  THE best cafe Americano and THE best... and when I say THE best... THE BEST pastries and pizza ever!  I make it a point to be there when Pascal brings out those freshly baked muffins, made FROM SCRATCH straight from the kitchen.  They're never too sugary and sweet, and made just right -- even more amazing warm!  Again, the pizzas are amazing too and they are freshly made to order.  The atmosphere is rustic and cozy plus the staff a all friendly, even the patrons all seem civil and cordial to one another.  Sarahgina, the BEST pizza, pasta, and pastries hangout in Bed-Stuy!!!
