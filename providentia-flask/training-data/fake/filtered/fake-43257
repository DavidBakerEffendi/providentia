Best BBQ experience on the East Coast! Add it to your bucket list. The pork ribs and brisket were cooked to absolute perfection. If you are driving through this area, you neeeeeeed to find this little place and check it out. The staff were very friendly. Lots of souvenirs, interesting foods and hot sauces to browse.
