A friends dad took us here and it was AMAZING. I've taken a bunch of friends back since and the food is SO reasonable and SO delicious. Nothing on the menu is over $20 and pasta dishes are $9. 5 of us split two appetizers, each got an entree, two desserts, a bottle of wine, and drinks for under $200. We all were so impressed and loved every bite! Best kept hidden secret. Be a part of it.
