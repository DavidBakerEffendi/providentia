JTH is a great spot to relax and have a great meal in the Heights. Great for the locals since there are only a few decent dining spots like this one in the area. Great beers on tap, nice wine selection too. The octopus appetizer was a must. I've had better mussels in Manhattan, but the herb fries that come with the mussels are a hit. No room for the pear upside down cake, maybe next time!
