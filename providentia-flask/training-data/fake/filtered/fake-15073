Risotteria serves the worst risotto I've ever had in my life. They have tons of options, but this is very misleading: it's all the same. I imagine they have a big pot of generic risotto in the back and they slop a portion on a plate and throw some peas or prosciutto on top depending on the dish. But worst of all is that the risotto is just bad. I cannot emphasize this enough. It makes me sad that people see a place called "Risotteria" and think "Excellent! I love risotto! This is the place for me!" and have to sit through a meal here. I can't even imagine what they do to make it so bad. Amazingly, I also had the worst wine I have ever had, right here at Risotteria. Risotto is absolutely beautiful when made even somewhat proficiently! Do not go here for risotto... go to any other Italian restaurant in New York.
