THIS PLACE IS DEFINITELY NOT THE MERCHANT HOUSE.  My wife and I had been fans and regular customers of the Merchant House for years, and were disappointed to see it change hands recently and reopen as Tierney's Copperhouse.  Despite this, we went to Tierney's last night with an open mind.  We were both extremely disappointed with the menu selection.  This is one of the most limited menus I have ever seen, and have to say that the most appetizing option on it was a turkey burger.  A $14 turkey burger no less!!!! Although it is true that the Merchant House's menu was on the smaller side, they had countless specials every night!!!  Not only is the food limited, it is extremely OVER PRICED!!!  What kind of restaurant mixes a $9 greasy personal pizza with a $79 steak???? I'm not quite sure that the owners of Tierney's know what they want their place to be.  The decor is pub style, and a nice upgrade, but the dining room is small, and there are hardly any booths.  The old main dining room is now littered with high bar tables, and is not family friendly.  If they want to be a restaurant, they need to add a lot more items to the menu and make it more of a formal sit-down restaurant.  If they want it to be a pub, once again, add more pub type items to the menu and LOWER the prices!!!  Honestly, don't waste your time with this place unless the foolish management make a lot more changes.
