All I can say about Jose Tejas, from this Brooklyn resident.... Loooooooovveeeeee IT! I look forward to crossing the Verrazano Narrows Bridge to have a delicious meal at Jose Tejas... Moderate pricing as well..... If you have a car and willing to go to New Jersey, its worth your tastes buds, cravings and pocket......
