Very tasty food and inexpensive - unless you show up assuming that they take credit card and have to go the convenient store next door to use their ATM. According to Yelp info they take credit card, but I found that not to be the case. Have eaten there a couple of times now and will eat there again. I found the positive reviews here to be accurate.
