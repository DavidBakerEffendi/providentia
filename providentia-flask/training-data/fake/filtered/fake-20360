I placed my self here, and in 5 minutes this place was renewed for future visits. I have not seen a place able to stay afloat in an area being beat by Downtown Brooklyn in a long time. Their seems to be a better breed of people here, and I am the expert by now I am sure. Being outgoing here is the next phase, not the next generation. The people are friendly here "positive." Let this place be the teacher to the other PUBS, one of which got a free cosmetic makeover and drain their customers wallet at the same time for past 3 years. Until we meet again like 3-16-12.
