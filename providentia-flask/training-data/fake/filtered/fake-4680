We came to Philadelphia for the weekend with some friends and were looking for a nice place to eat. We stumbled upon Rouge via an internet site. They were able to accommodate us with a table for six on a busy Friday evening. Then we needed to change to a table for eight people, no problem. Then running late due to traffic we had to change our reservation time, once a gain no problem. When we finally arrived, it was as good as I had been telling my friends all day. Great look and feel, friendly staff and great location off the square. Some reviewers said the noise level was loud, well for an intimate place with lively people you can expect elevated noise levels. It was not a problem, my crowd fit right in and didn't have any trouble with our conversations across the group. Our server was awesome. She knew the menu inside and out, had great suggestions for entrees an drink as well. Very attentive through out meal. The food did not disappoint either, it was delicious! My wife had a gluten free meal which was as tasty as they come. Bravo Rouge, we wil see you again!
