Shopping and a burger!? What could be better than that. Plus, I'm sorry adult milkshakes? You had me at adult. You can design your own burger and that makes me happy even if it does mean that service is a bit slow. Â Honestly I'll take slow service in exchange for good food versus the opposite. It's still new so I expect they'll work the kinks out and will definitely be heading back to try a different burger combo. Yup, good stuff.
