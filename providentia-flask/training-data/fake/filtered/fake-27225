I've been living in Philadelphia for the past four years and have lived in South Jersey and New York City before that. (so I've had alot of different sandwiches).  I've been getting bored with your typical cheesesteaks, heroes, subs, hoagies, bagel sandwiches, etc... so I wanted to try something a little different. Paesano's, by far, has the most unique sandwiches while not overloading them with tons of different items and condiments to simply try and make a "fat boy sandwich".  The rolls are perfect and the portions are more than filling.  I had a Turkey sandwich that was a special and they used hand carved turkey, with pepper shooters, spicy cheeses, and a spicy chipotle mayo spread. If you're looking for a lunch to really grab the attention of your taste buds, please check out Paesano's II -- I guarantee you won't regret it.
