Maybe it was an off-night, but this was just a terrible place to eat.  My wife and I are in CT on a business trip and the iPhone suggested this place would have reasonable food.  The place was in a low-income area, but that doesn't bother me overmuch.  The first thing I noticed was that my wife and I were the youngest people in the establishment.  The remaining guests were all elderly... again, not a big deal but something I noticed.   At $20-$30 an entree, I was expecting quality food with great service.  Our server's presence was almost non-existent.  The ambiance was underwhelming.  Service was extremely slow (2 hours in total with no appetizers or dessert).  The biggest letdown was the food.  Starter salads were a mishmash of wilted lettuce & under-ripe tomatoes.  I ordered the $30 filet while my wife had the chicken parmigiana.  Medium rare came out well done and was sent back (no apology by the wait staff).  Second attempt came out correctly cooked but was one of the poorest cuts of meat I've ever seen served at a restaurant.  Greyish in color, tough to chew, stringy/fatty, way over-spiced.  They also never brought back my side dishes after they took away my first steak.  My wife's chicken was slightly better but nothing special.  I've had better at chain imitation Italian restaurants, but it was at least edible and portion size was huge. This establishment seemed to have no pride in the service they provide.   I will say that the wine was adequate and the salad dressing was superb, but diner beware!!!!
