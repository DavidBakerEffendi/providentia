I must have  gone to a different Blu than those reviewing this place before me. The place should rename itself to "Burnt Orange" from Blu nothing Blu about about it hideous ambiance cheezy  track lighting "some blu" not much. Dirty velour sheet covering front waiting bench again orange not blue, bad colors, no artwork and must be saving on utilities way too cool luckily it was only late October not November. Waitress was only around along enough to take the food order not followup, no water refill, no wine pouring, no check up. Kale salad. Butternut squash with apple etc., raw kale, one hard butternut squash, olive oil no flavor very bitter, ask for salt/pepper given combo grinder pepper worked salt didn't come out owner didn't offer to apply either just demonstrate by shaking into his hand fortunately not dumping onto the kale from there although might have if we said please don't. Mahi and Monk were our picks both were relatively good but, very small portions, I will not be coming back, off my list don't waste your time pre-check your bucket list as complete for this place.
