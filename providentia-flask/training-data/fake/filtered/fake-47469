I am a real New Yorker. Pretty snobby on my pizza; really turned off by tourist traps. Despite the zoo that Grimaldi's used to be, I used to promote them--good pizza and affordable. Worth the touristiness. NEVER AGAIN. Last night I went with my wife and her friend who is moving away. As a tall man, I had my leg stretched out--under the table but extending slightly. The manager (?) came by and while I was in mid-conversation with my friends, (1) kicked my foot, (2) yelled at me that i was going to trip someone and get him sued. To which I explained that I would be happy to move my foot if spoken to and shown some respect--not being yelled at and kicked. His response was to yell at me more. Being a New Yorker, I yelled at him back. I would have left but my wife made me stay and act calm. The service is terrible--worse since they moved--and this bullshit is unforgivable. DON'T GO. There's plenty better pizza in New York and you don't have to get KICKED for it.
