I use to loooove good ol JB'S.  It had cool lighting, great venue upstairs, pool table, and lions head!  This was the bar I came to to hang out with friends, hit on girls, or write from a dark corner as I sip on some beer.  Ah the good ol times. But has anyone noticed a shift in attitude in the bar tenders within the last two years?  Its like your privilege to be served by one of them, the king of hipster bartenders.  It makes me want to reach over the bar and smack the shit out of them.  (of course don't, but I want to.) There's especially this one bartender, the tall stick thin blonde with the face of a boney crystal meth user.  Every time I walk in there trying to get a beer she'll be leaning on the counter talking to her friend.  She stairs over at me with those droopy eyes and doglike wet blonde hair parted down the middle.  We've taken to calling her skeletor.   I'm onto you skeletor!  Just b/c I'm not a hip hippster don't judge me.  serve me a beer goddamn it!  If I were your boss i'd fire you in a second!
