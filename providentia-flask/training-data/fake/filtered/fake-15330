Considering the fact that most yelp posters have an over righteous agenda and believe that they should decide the fate of any given establishment, I give Cafe Ghia five stars. What can I say? This corner of Bushwick has been starved for a place to chill and enjoy a drink or two. Plus one for the $2 pbr. Plus two for the $3 pork slap cans! A nice rounded selection of draft beers and bottles, and an appreciable wine selection, make this the perfect date spot. The food is affordable, light and delicious. Heavy food would just weigh down the hanky panky after the date! Cafe Ghia specializes in delicious wholesome foods that will fill you up without the "duck fat!" , Â "organic (city grown) pizza's?!" and other atrocities that some other Bushwick spots have to offer. Great plates and sandwiches define a new attitude and new culinary face for the neighborhood. Mmmmm....
