After seeing this restaurant on Groupon twice, I was motivated to check it out when I was in the area Saturday about noon. It was a good experience and I am looking forward to returning.    When I arrived, I was told I would have a 20 minute wait outside, and it was accurate.  I was OK with this because it was a nice day.  Kudos to the hostess: although I was alone, I was seated in an excellent location. This is not always the case at restaurants in the city, dear readers, as you probably know.   Because it was so well-reviewed in the past, I ordered the French Toast . All around me, people were having the the $4 two-eggs, toast and potatoes special--and those potatoes looked amazing, appeared to be roasted, chunky, fresh. Others were eating the Eggs Benedict, which looked very well-prepared and freshly made...I was wondering if I should have ordered that, and will try it next time. I ordered a cafe mocha, which was delicious.  Watching the other diners, I gave in and asked for a side of bacon ($4 for approx 10 pieces, nicely prepared, a great value, easily shared). The French Toast was even better than expected. It has a lovely crunch with every bite from the crusty exterior, and comes heaped with fresh strawberries, blueberries, and sliced bananas, with a large dollop of whipped cream on top.  I was very happy with the dish, and will definitely return with friends/family.    I had good service here, and didn't mind having to flag down my waitress to add that extra side of bacon to my order, or to switch to coffee after the cafe mocha was done. She was really pleasant, and responded quickly to my changes.  Despite the busy brunch time, I was not rushed at all, even once I had finished my meal, and read for a bit over another cup of good coffee before leaving.      So--all in all, a keeper. What would I like to change? Put a couple of benches on the side of the restaurant for those waiting.
