We went dining & used a recent groupon - in an nearly empty restaurant during lunch hours - we requested to outside. The salad was great - however pasta's were average at best. In the bill we noticed a 'Open table' charge for $5 & a gratuity of 20%. We were a party of 3 (usually gratuity is added for party over 4) - & I have never heard of open table charge before. Seems the restaurant owner were trying to make up for the groupon discount by adding hidden charges and charging tips without allowing guest to make that decision. Â Sneaky business place - nice takeaway. Agree with another reviewer - few patrons looked like they had left a construction site.
