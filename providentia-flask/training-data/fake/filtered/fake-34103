Food was average. Service was horrible. Condescending and incompetent wait staff. Never felt so demeaned in my life. However, bus boys and other help were very good. If youre looking for a good drink and friendly service I would suggest driving .2 miles down the road to La Pergola. Don't waste your time at Mediterranean.
