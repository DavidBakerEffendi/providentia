Hostess was very rude at reception. We had a reservation for 10pm and our table wasnt ready. We wait outside the restaurant for about 20minutes.. hostess never offered us to wait at the bar or apologize for the delays.. Awful experience with her. On the other hand, the food at this restaurant is excellent and the waitress was very helpful with our dinner and wine selection. regardless of the hostess this is a very good option to go out and have a great dinner..
