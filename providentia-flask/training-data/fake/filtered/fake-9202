This is a GREAT restaurant for Burmese food (and now some Chinese and Thai dishes).  The food is fresh, unique, and absolutely delicious.  I have been coming here for 20 years, and it's only gotten better!    Over the years I have introduced at least 30 different people to Rangoon, and they all loved it.  In fact, whenever my friends and I meet in Philly, someone always suggest meeting at Rangoon.  With the reasonable prices, cleanliness, table cloths, and friendly service, you can't beat this place.
