Best in Burlington Area! I love this place! Give this place a shot! The food and service are way better then the other Thai restaurant in the area. Great lunch specials. At dinner, there is never a wait let alone a 45 minute one. Cooks and staff are actually Thai and know the food. People that complain about Americanized dishes must realize that yes we are in America so businesses may cut down on spice, but all you must do is ASK!!! This staff wants to give everyone a great experience, but can't read minds. Again, this is the place for Thai in VT!
