We went to iSpice for a Saturday buffet lunch with full family of 6 people. There was another one family in the restaurant. So without any wait, we were seated. We are local to Central NJ so we have tried almost all other restaurants. I must say food quality at iSpice makes it to the top of the list. Even basic items like Plain naan/Roti was one of the best I have had in the recent past. Very soft and fluffy. Perfect blend of spice and taste across all the items. Don't miss this one, give it a try. You will not be disappointed.
