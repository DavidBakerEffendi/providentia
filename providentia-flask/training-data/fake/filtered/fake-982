Had dinner here  with a group of friends.  I split the Rustico appetizer (board of meats, cheese, and veggies) and thought it was great. I ordered the pappardelle with wild boar ragu for my entree and thought it was good, though it was a bit small for my appetite  and I was still a bit hungry afterward
