This food is fantastic! I'd been to this restaurant a few times before, then left CT for a year, and when I came back the restaurant was on a whole new level (change of ownership). The food is so full of flavor, and every dish is so well done and so tasty. The communal experience of eating out of one big platter with your hands is really one-of-a-kind. My family and I shared several dishes and I can't remember exactly what they were called. I was apprehensive about the salmon dish, but it was phenomenal, cooked perfectly, spicy and flavorful and VERY generous with the salmon. The lentil dish we got, yemeser wot, is hands down the best lentils I've ever eaten - and I love lentils so I'v eaten a lot of them. Overall the food was incredible, the restaurant comfortable and inviting, the servers extremely kind and hard-working, and the whole meal a really pleasant experience. I suggest anyone looking for a unique and delicious dining experience stops by. Also, there is free parking in the lot across the street - just make sure you only use the parking spots with the yellow lines!
