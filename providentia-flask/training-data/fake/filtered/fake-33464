Ugh! Bleh! The tired ass hipster vibe we all hate can be found behind this bar. Text book. Um...I'm pretty sure you are schlepping brats and beer? Life just isn't that miserable buddy, and for crying out loud, we know those damn glasses aren't corrective! Â The beer was good,The PRETZLES were $6 or $7. I'll spend my money on overpriced dough somewhere friendlier thank you very much! The two stars are because I had a great time with my friends.
