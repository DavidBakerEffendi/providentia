Went here and was very disappointed.  Food was average and service sucked.  Did as is my right and let them no by stiffing the server.  Tipping is always optional.  If a tip isn't received, it wasn't earned.  If it wasn't optional, it would be included in the price.  A paid employee is not the equal of a paying customer.  Never was-never will be.
