Batters up ! highly recommend the chef's tasting menu either 5 course or 8 , you cannot go wrong either way.  My mother always says you can judge the restaurant;   if the bread is good, you might be in for a good treat ! Here at Battersby you are! ... mountains of ricotta cheese piled on warm frescata .  I have eaten here twice and cannot wait to try again. Sweetbread bacon and eggs.... a dream ,seafood mounted on crisp kale, tomato consomme to clear the palette ,between courses ....   you can do parings or just enjoy a bottle from a solid wine list.... tasty desserts  to finish , highly recommend to post pone the physical the next day. But it is all worth it !
