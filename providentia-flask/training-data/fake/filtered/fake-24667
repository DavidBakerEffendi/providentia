This is my favorite restaurant in Philadelphia, where I lived for two years before moving to NYC.  Even after moving to NYC, I think this is my favorite restaurant out there, especially when combined with the Graffiti Bar out back.  I love this spot and couldn't recommend it more.   I would LOVE if Sampan/Graffiti would come to NYC.  I think it would do great in the Lower East Side.
