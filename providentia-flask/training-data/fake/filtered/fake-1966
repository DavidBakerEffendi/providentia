It's like people don't know what it means for a restaurant to be open for a week! I've worked in the restaurant business my whole life and yeeesh yelp sure gives entitled costumers an outlet to complain. If you don't want a long wait, don't come to a restaurant on one of its very first weekends. I'm here because while I waited for my food, I heard some prick mention that if he wasn't seated in TEN MINUTES he would get on yelp and write them up. I'm sad to say I think he may have gotten a seat. Anyways, the place has plenty of things that they could work on-- the time I waited on father's day was more than the kids could handle and they ran out of the dessert I wanted to order. That said, the food was delicious, my waiter was fab and the vibe sent me straight back to summers in Montauk. I will be back in a month when things are settled. And hopefully you unhappy customers will get a life...
