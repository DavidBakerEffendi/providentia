Bad Pizza from Leone Restaurant After a day of traveling, I ended up in Montclair at Leone. A clerk recommended Leones as having the good pizza and Italian food , as opposed to other Italian restaurants in the area. After eating at Leones in Montclair. I have to say they need a lesson in providing good good food and service that one comes to expect when you go out to eat. I will just be brief and comment on the pizza because the food we had could only be described as tasteless. So pizza something so simple... The pizza arrived at our table it was topped with half green peppers and half ground beef with a thick crust. I am almost certain that Leone used pre-made pizza crusts. The crust was a horrible, dense, foamy bread. I say foamy because if the crust was poked with a fork, the holes would close up and appear that it was never stabbed. Although the crust had seemingly magical powers to heal itself, one thing it couldn't do was connect with cheese. Every bit of cheese, sauce, and topping slid right off the crust. Sometimes this happens if there is too much sauce on a pizza, but there was actually very little sauce on this pie. It's hard to tell exactly how much sauce the pizza started out with though because a lot of it got absorbed into the crust, making it kind of soggy. Perhaps this soggy crust couldn't provide a proper surface for the cheese to adhere itself to. Whatever caused the flaws with this pizza, it was totally unacceptable from what was recommended as the "good Italian restaurant." Â I've had better pizzas than this pie from the kfrozen food section at the Supermarket. 1 out of 8 slices...
