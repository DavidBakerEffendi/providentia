Disappointing.  Unconscionably hot, even at the bar near the door, as far as possible from the pizza ovens.  Visiting Philly on night in early July nowhere near as hot as the ones we're having now. Food ranged from amazing (meatballs) to okay (pizza) and in between (charcuterie).  But the wine was as overheated as the restaurant.  70? 75?  i don't carry a thermometer.  The bartender pointed to the wine bottles stored in racks near the ceiling.  Not his fault.  He even fetched a "cooler" bottle from somewhere, though the restaurant was very busy.  Wonderful gesture.  But the Cabernet he offered was not very good and only a degree or two cooler.  If the food had been a knockout it might have saved the evening.  But at these prices with this level of discomfort, I can't recommend it at all.  The apparent lack of concern for the ambience and the comfort of the clientele should be your clue. Don't go.
