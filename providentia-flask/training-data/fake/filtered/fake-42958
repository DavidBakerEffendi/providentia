I placed an order for pick-up at this place. I arrived 30 minutes later and was told that my food would be ready in 5 minutes. Forty minutes later, I was still waiting, watching other people come in, eat, and leave. When I got my food, pretty much everything was cold (somosas were even frozen in some places). This place is just the worst. I think the owner is prejudice against non-Indian people.
