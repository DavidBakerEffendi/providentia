I was in Philly the weekend of the Eagles vs Saints playoff game and found them during a search for nearby restaurants. The service and beautiful building were awesome and the food was amazing!!!! I saw so many delicious plates pass by me that I had trouble deciding. When I did make a choice I chose off of their special brunch menu for Sundays and was NOT disappointed. If I am ever back in town I WILL be returning! Do yourself a favor and eat here!!! I was blown away!
