If I could give six stars I would.  My husband and I stumbled across this place while house hunting in astoria.  WHat a fantastic suprise.  We had the peasant salad, lemon potatoes, grilled octopus, and the swordfish.  Everything was really, really good and as other reviewers have stated...very fresh.    Can't wait to go back!
