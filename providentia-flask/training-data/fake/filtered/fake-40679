Grimaldis is another classic historic NY pizza joint.  I remember being blown away when I was younger by their pizza.  I thought that it was not as good as Patsy's, but definitely better than anything I could get in my home town.   I went back recently, as I have been revisiting all of my favorite childhood pizzerias.  Sadly, I was underwhelmed.  The sauce was the best part of the pizza.  The crust was flavorless, and the cheese was rubbery.  It looked like the same cheese that Patsy's uses.   They seem to always have a line of customers, but if they are like me, and went there as a kid, then the lines wont be around for long.
