If you have eaten in Thailand or tasted real authentic Thai food in New York or LA, you will find this place very disappointing. Food is tasteless. You can order your food requesting level of spiciness. I asked for "Thai level" spiciness, the red duck curry and chicken green curry were still bland. The Thai beef salad had well done chucks of beef instead of rare slices as it should be. The dressing for the this beef salad was ok. The Chicken coconut soup (Tom Ka Gai) was again tasteless. The best thing with this restaurant is the service. Very friendly and efficient.
