today my friends and i went down to ri ras cause they had the half price burger deal. as i sat down i was introduced to my waiter then minutes later i got a different one. the burgers we ordered did not come out to the temps we wanted. the service was very bad it wasnt that busy. it took forever to get a check. i wanted another drink but when she came back my food was done with.
