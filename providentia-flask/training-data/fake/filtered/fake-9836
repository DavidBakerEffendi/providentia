Mulberry & Vine works like a lunch service line and employees will make up your plate as you pick your items down the buffet. Although I'm not a vegan or vegetarian, I imagine you'll do well here if you are.vI would say just a bit under 4 stars but only because they have a variety of items, many of which I can't speak for yet. A few more visits will definitely solidify my opinion and warrant an update. I just havent been a huge fan of the food lately.
