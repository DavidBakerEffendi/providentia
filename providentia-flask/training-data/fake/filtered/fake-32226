My 3 previous reviews of this place have been filtered out by Yelp's obviously crude and poorly-tuned filter. I might jokingly say "Help! I'm a prisoner in Yelp's program!" I persist because I enjoy seeing whether honest human communication can survive in an increasingly computerized world. I find this the most comfortable and enjoyable restaurant in the neighborhood, lunching there once a week on chicken in a few forms or liver or portobello (the sandwich is a very nice construction) or papardelle with either Bordeaux, Malbec or Cote de Rhone. Mussels once in a while. In almost two years, believe it or not, only a single dish (cauliflower soup) failed to please me. Perhaps it is best that my reviews be censored because it is getting increasingly crowded at lunchtime. Happy New Year!
