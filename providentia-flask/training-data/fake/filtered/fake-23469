One word for this restaurant; terrible. The rolls that you get when you first arrive, they were warm but were incredibly stale on the outside. The dipping sauce was excellent, but combined with stale bread that lacked warmth and flavor, I'd have to say it was not satisfactory. We ordered pizza for the afternoon and even though we didn't wait very long, it was NOT worth the wait. I've been to chain restaurants that have better pizza than this place. The crust was stale and burnt, and the center of the pizza didn't even have that one bite that made the meal. It was also very oily and soggy. The red peppers and onions on the pizza were slimy, and tasted like something out of a can you would buy for a dollar. The waitresses were very polite and happy-go-lucky, that is the only thing about this place that I loved. She would take back our drinks that we didn't like and not charge a thing. My family used to LOVE this place so much that they would travel a long distance just to buy a pizza. Now, we traveled even further to get crappy food. I wouldn't even call this a pizza.. If only I could rate this a negative 1,000....
