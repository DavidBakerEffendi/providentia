Overpriced? Yes. Loud? Yes. Line out the door? Many nights, yes. Great place for a bit of food and drinks at 2am? Yes Bacon and Gouda mac & cheese is as good as mac & cheese gets. Drinks are great Fried oreos are great. The rest of the menu is all pretty decent food nothing extraordinary but the service is always good as well. Friendly host, bouncers and waiters.
