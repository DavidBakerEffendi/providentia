Have gone back 2 times since my last review, once in April, and once again yesterday. Regardless to say this place has gone way down. The food was great both times but service was terrible. And both times it was obviously understaffed. It seemed like there were only two servers in this huge bar seating area. The first time we went there our server took the time to tell us about Plan B and make some really fun suggestions this time we were lucky to get our orders in without our poor server being rushed to the next table. We waited 15 minutes to get our order taken, 25 minutes for our meals (a slad and a pink burger why?) never got a refill on drinks, and then waited almost 25 minutes for our check to be given and run once we were done. My friend commented that the manger looked just as frazzled as the staff. There seemed to be no organization, and it was just a mess. Dont know what changed over the last year, but please change it back. The food is so good..... but I cant deal with the frustration!
