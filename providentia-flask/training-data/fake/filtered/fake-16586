This is the 2nd time I ate at this restaurant within 2 weeks.  The first time was with a small group of 4 and the second time was with a large group of 17.  Both times, the food was EXCELLENT.  Everything was cooked to order, was served at the perfect temperature and was delicious.  I have no complaints at all!  The waiters, both times, were very accommodating and their service was top notch!   I will definitely recommend this place again and will be going back myself in the future!
