Who doesn't love Il Bambino? The paninis are amazing, both on and off the brunch menu, their salads are delicious (love the mimosa), and the small plates and crostini give you a ton of choices. I've been there at least 20 times and have never had bad service. Plus, the prices are amazing for the quality of food and the ambiance.
