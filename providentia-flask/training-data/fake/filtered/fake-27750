First things first... INCREDIBLE food. The best Chicken Marsala I have ever had, period. (Have tried this dish at over a dozen locations... no joke.) The best part was the incredible portions, had plenty for lunch since the saled that came with the meal was a healthy serving as well. I live relatively close and have driven by this place many times but visited for the first time last week on a whim (and had the chix marsala). This place can be easy to miss since it's kind of tucked in. Went back yesterday and decided to try the meatball grinder based on my 1st positive experience and again came away surprisingly satisfied with how tasty the food was. I am impressed with the combination of food quality/ portion size/ and price combination that they have going on here. Perfect for a quiet dinner and I've made it a point to come back.
