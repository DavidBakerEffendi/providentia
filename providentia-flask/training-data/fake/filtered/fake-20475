I got a $40 gift certificate to Zahav, and for 3 weekends in a row, I couldn't get a reservation. Must be a very good restaurant to be so busy, right? OK, so I decided to get takeout, just to be able to use the gift certificate. I wish I could upload pictures here, to show you what Zahav provides for $40 - because I did take pictures, so people would believe me. I was so flabbergasted. Five miniscule helpings of the dishes I had ordered - the mushroom dish could literally have fitted into a tablespoon ($8). RIP OFF!!
