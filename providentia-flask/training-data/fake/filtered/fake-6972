Service awful and disorganized. We were seated quickly at the time of our reservation. Beer selection plentiful but they use small "pint" glasses to serve. Two people in our party of 8 had cold main courses served and one other got two things wrong with her order. The server was more concerned with how this mistake would affect her tip than getting help fixing the issues and blamed the kitchen staff constantly throughout the evening. Atmosphere is a noisy sports bar with TVs everywhere. The noise doesn't match the style of food or the price. I wouldn't go here again.
