My girlfriends from Pittsburgh were in town for the weekend. They wanted a great Brunch place to eat at this past Sunday before their return trip home. I immediately suggested Sabrina's Cafe. I am pleased to say it NEVER disappoints! My 2 friends and I enjoyed ourselves over huge portions of Stuffed Challah French toast, breakfast potatoes, and cheddar cheese, spinach and sausage omelets. Great place. Call ahead to minimize your wait time.
