The restaurant has a delightful ambience. Cool servers with excellent service. Reasonable prices on the menu. Happy hour drinks and amazing house libations. I would recommend their OBAO drink. Gin and jalape√±o with pineapple juice. They just took it to the next level. Its worth the try. Coming back again.
