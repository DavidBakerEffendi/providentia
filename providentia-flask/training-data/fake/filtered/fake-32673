One of the best Indian buffets that I have ever had - and I've had quite a few.  The owner/chef, Raj Raza, is quite willing to discuss how the food is prepared.  The food is spicy, not for the feint of heart.  I don't understand how Raj can serve such great and plentiful food at the luncheon buffet for only $7.49.  I've been telling all my friends about this recently opened restaurant.
