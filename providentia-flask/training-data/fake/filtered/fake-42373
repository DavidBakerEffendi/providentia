A friend and I had brunch at Saxon + Parole a couple weeks back. So good. We started off with a basket of their homemade pastries and bread. I remember especially loving the cornbread muffin and mini cinnamon roll. Mimosas? Check. They had a healthy portion of champagne which is always appreciated. And although it's not my cup of tea, I saw a ton of Bloody Mary's going around. The restaurant had a cart set up where people could assemble their own and add accoutrements/toppings. It's like an ice cream shop for big kids over there. I ordered the Mangalista Ham. Eggs Benedict is my favorite meal, so it was a natural choice. Â The ham is sandwiched between a poached egg and a potato Parmesan cake. I loved the potato pancake and actually prefer it over the traditional English muffin. One of my biggest peeves is hollandaise without any citrus. I typically load mine with lemon, but the yuzu was a new twist, and I loved it. My best friend ordered the baked eggs and thoroughly enjoyed them. We ordered the basket of fresh doughnuts. We were stuffed, but it's hard to resist warm, sugar and cinnamon doughy pockets of amazing served with vanilla and chocolate sauces. Service was excellent - Kylie took great care of us. And the space was beautiful. I walked past the restaurant last weekend and saw the terrace was open. I'll be going back to brunch alfresco.
