Whenever we come in from out of town we ask for recommendations and Lupa came highly recommended by a few.  It did not disappoint.  As we were told it would be, the place was packed, but we were able to sit at the bar while we waited for our table.  We so enjoyed talking to the bartender that we stayed there even when our table was ready.  Perhaps it was those very creative and refreshing house drinks we were served. We loved the choice of appetizers to begin with, especially the beets with pistachio.  My fluke with spinach dish was simple but absolutely delicious and my husband was very happy with his hangar stake.  Overall, we felt like the prices were reasonable and the food scrumptious.  And we loved the laid back, somewhat romantic atmosphere.   Am looking forward to our next trip to go again.
