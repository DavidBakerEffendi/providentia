I went there with alot of hope but the place fell short. I ordered a burger and told the waiter to please not put bacon, after 25 minutes of wait, what do I get? Yep. So, back to the kitchen and another 25 minutes later I finally have a burger without bacon. The burger itself was small and the fries felt stale. I dont think I would hit up this place again when in Burlington.
