Great pancake, fluffy on the inside, crispy on the outside. Everything else is mediocre. Â In fact, i had been there twice. First visit was delightful. During the second visit, I was very put off that the restaurant refused to give me some maple syrup for the leftover pancake to pack home (the waiter did pack me some maple syrup to go in my first visit, unlike the host I spoke to during the second visit). I will go back but will not order extra food cuz i dont want to have any leftover to go anymore.
