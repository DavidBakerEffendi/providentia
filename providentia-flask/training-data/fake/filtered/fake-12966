The "idea" of this place would seem so cool right? Outside patio and bar? a bar/ restaurant right in the heart of Caldwell? Well, in those beautiful spring and summer nights, you're lucky if you find the outside bar open at all! and if it is..it closes up by 8:00. Then you are forced to go inside and be accompanied by waiters sweeping the floors and moving table and chairs... you ask "are you closing up?" The bartender answers no we have to stay open til at least 11:00.. They either have the air conditioning blasting so you freeze and leave OR they have the lights on over the bar so bright, you feel like you're the star attraction in a Broadway show. They charge $14 per drink...They run out of the proper glass wear, and liquor line is never fully stocked. Â  The prices in this place are astronomical! A simple chicken dish is $27!! I can make it at home for $8 !! Bathroom... I have scene numerous times an employee NOT wash their hands after coming out! At the end of the night it makes you wonder.. Was all the above worth the price? Not for this couple
