very disappointed...i was one year ago here ,2 nights on the round Â and had amazing dinners but this time was very bad. bad service,(i order something,they brought me something else but they didn t change it on the bill). one of the orders,the dumplings had a strange taste and so on... i was so happy to try again this restaurant but i was very disappointed
