I'm dying to try the Sunday night 14 course "meze" for $35 sometime soon! The food is fantastic and it's BYOB so you can bring a fantastic bottle of wine you can actually afford. Specials are always inventive and delicious! The atmosphere is bustling yet cozy. You can't go wrong with the Cyprus breakfast--eggs, halloumi, and ham! I had amazing duck egg with a spicy yogurt and merguez sausage for my birthday brunch a few years ago which I still crave. The grilled octopus is awesome, but my favorite may be the "manti" which are spicy lamb dumplings! If the dips of the day include the pumpkin-feta dip definitely order it! It's amazing. Their baklava and cardamom ice cream are heavenly. Whenever I walk by and see people on the street enjoying their meals and wine, the corner is so inviting! I also love to inspect the quirky decor and handwritten signs. These are just the things that make Kanella uniquely special.
