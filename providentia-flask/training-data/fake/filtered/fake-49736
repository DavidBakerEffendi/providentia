Ok. I have been to Taboonette many times, mainly because it is in very close proximity to my work. Let me be clear and say that the food is generally good. My issue with Taboonette is that there is a lack of consistency in the food preparation. I expect to get my food the same way each time which is not the case here. Every time I've ordered a chicken shwarma it had no pickles then one day I get it with pickles. I was told that is how it is made. Okay I thought, my fault for not reading through the ingredients since I was buying off of a recommendation. Then the last time I ordered the chicken shwarma it had no hummus. I did not complain I just ate it because there was not time to go back and correct it. A few weeks ago, I ordered a salmon pita and there was no arugula. Again I said nothing. Today I ordered a salmon pita and they gave me a dinner plate on rice and charged me $2 more for it! When I called and told them that the salmon was not cooked thoroughly and it wasn't even the dish I ordered, they told me "you can stop by and get some cookies". WHAT??? I don't want cookies! I want what I ordered. Needless to say. I will not be ordering from Taboonette again. This is NYC and there are plenty of other places I can get my lunch. Good customer service goes a long way.
