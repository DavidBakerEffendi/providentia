I just ate Brunch at Bubby's this weekend, and it was excellent! Also, they do take credit cards in addition to cash on the weekends. I am not sure when they ended that policy, but they did. It was really busy, but still the staff managed to make our table feel special and very taken care of. The hostess greeted us warmly. Our server was very knowledgeable about the food and drinks. I learned a lot about the processes and ingredients that go into making that delicious food, and I was impressed. Did you know they make all of their soda pop by hand with fresh pressed cane sugar? The food: First off the coffee is really spectacular, I am a coffee fantastic and I noticed that they were roasting some really fine brews. I had an amazing cappuccino, with beautiful latte art. It was so smooth, maybe it was their all grass-fed natural milk? My boyfriend had their homemade lime soda. It was very refreshing. I would highly recommend their sour cream pancakes, they taste better than the ones my mom use to make me as a child. I also had their grits which were awesome.We shared the Huevos Rancheros which was plenty for two. It was so good. Spicy but not too spicy. Overall, it was a really good food experience. Not only was the food & drinks excellent, the service was as well. And it there was something about the experience that took me a little further than most restaurants do. I guess it was reading about all the cool things they do on the first page of their menu, it really got me thinking about food. Bubby's is so cool. I am excited to go back for dinner. The prices for very very reasonable for the portions and quality.
