Public is my go to restaurant. Always a great welcome at the door, wine advice is beyond, and space and crowd is cool without being pretentious.  This says a lot for Nolita and it likely means they are doing something worthwhile. Now- for the food:  All dishes were perfectly seasoned, and if you have never had an "herby lentil salad" drop what you are doing and go to this restaurant and eat it, now. Scallops are like no scallops I have ever had. How do they make the sauce for these?  Sweet and savory. All fish dishes I have tried are out of this world. I stick to the fish because I need to go light to save room for what is likely the yummiest desserts in town. They change, but the hokey pokey ice cream is a must have, always,
