I have been coming to Poor Henry's to drink beer for the past 4 years and that alone is worth the trip. It is a great divey bar atmosphere if you just want to feel like you are at a bar and not some swank place for a quick bite to eat. Things are simple here. They have your standard pub grub, daily specials and salad bar. As I said the beer is worth the trip, especially if you are a beer geek. 24 taps with a lot of New Jersey beer and some other gems from around the world. Ask for Jesse, he would love to talk beer with you.
