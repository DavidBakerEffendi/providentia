Well i tried this place and i really enjoyed it. Of course with this place being brand new there were a couple of things that needed to be worked on but it was a good experience overall. I found the fries(chips) to be very tasty and different as a side . I tried the double header and it was awesome.the burgers were grilled to my liking and the lettuce and tomatoes were very fresh.The sports sauce was like the best sauce ever. The customer service was very good they showed a lot of of team work which i found appealing. So keep an eye out for these guys at Sports Burger If they are this good just starting out they can only get better from here. They even told me it was BYOB. My new Fav place for burgers in Newark. you Guys should deff try it out!!!!!
