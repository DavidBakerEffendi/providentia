This place is just amazing for cocktails and comfort food. First of all, they have a chili infused gin cocktail called the Brooklyn Gin, super spicy (i LOVE spicy) and so delicious. And strong too, don't get me wrong. I want to try other ones on the menu but this gets me every time. That or the beers. They have an extraordinary tap beer selection. Something for everyone (although don't expect the bartender to know too much about them since they apparently change frequently) Also the food. SERIOUS comfort food with a delicious twist. I've had a few things on the menu, but I'm saving my calories for the day I can try their fried chicken BLT on a biscuit. Super cool place for the UWS, check it out for sure, and their neighbor Slightly Oliver too. It's nice to see this neighborhood expanding towards a younger crowd!
