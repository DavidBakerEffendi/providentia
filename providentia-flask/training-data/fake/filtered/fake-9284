I attened a baby shower on sunday. What a horrible time .They booked a second party and stuck the two parties together,We were suppose to get a buffet but got family style. The food ran out and they did not refill. So loud you could not hear the person next to you.Ran out of coffee cups.No service for drinks you had to get this yourself.The owner did not care he told the person giving the shower if you do not like it your free to go.  the grandmother of the girl having the baby fell outside owner did not even check to see if she was alright. She left  with the first aid squad.Nor was there a gift table or cake table. My friend wanted thing to be perfect for her daughter and her daughter left in tears. She also had to stop to eat on the way home because the food never made it to her. We were not able to play the games my friend planned out becuase of the noise level. They ruined both of these girl's  and the mother 's special day.
