I avoid Edo and only go when I am being dragged along with a group. I used to go quite often though. First of all, the interior is terrible. There is no ambiance whatsoever -- if my friend's dining room was styled like that I would raise and eyebrow. It's designed to look Asian but it has no taste or style. The tables are also very crowded; it's painful to watch the waiters try to maneuver their way around. It is indeed tidy , but only in the sense that it's not sloppy or disorganized. For me, in a restaurant, that's not good enough. Second and most importantly, the food. On the best days it's unmemorable. I will eat with relative satisfaction but it has no impression on me, and I don't particularly feel like I've had my money's worth. Several times, I've had unfresh sushi. Once is excusable, but twice is weird and three times is wrong. It wasn't rotten and didn't give me any stomach problems, but it undeniably tasted like it should not have been served. And on a regular basis the fish is tolerable but not fresh and clean like sushi should be. I love sushi and have had it since childhood. If you think you know something about fish, you prepare to be dissatisfied.
