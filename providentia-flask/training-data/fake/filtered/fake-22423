Been there 5 times, always amazing. Small local place, HUGE menu, with MANY out of this world dishes. Very comfort food, very heavy. The inside is decorated amazingly, with many random things, and always some old movie playing on the wall. If you want to bring people from out of town someplace good, bring them here!!!
