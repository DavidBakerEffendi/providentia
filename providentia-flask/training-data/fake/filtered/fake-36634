I ate there once while in Philly a couple of years ago. The food was about average, but the wait staff was confused and inefficient. They tried hard to get the atmosphere right. I went back recently and the atmosphere was the same, but the food had gone a bit downhill. The staff, however, was no longer confused. They seemed quite brazen in their unwillingness to serve customers efficiently or politely. I was served something I didn't order, and I was somehow made to feel it was MY fault for getting my own order wrong. I generally tip at least 20% but actually limited my tip this last time to 10% of the tab - quite a statement on my part. Apparently it wasn't enough of a statement to rate a photo posted on their social media accounts, however. Next time I'll keep my tip to under 25Â¢ and see if they don't try to make me famous. Just kidding... there won't be a next time.
