Went on a Tuesday night for a belated Father's Day dinner. Everything we had was very good, nice size portions, you leave satisfied, but not stuffed. We had the pâté with cornichons (did wish it was more than 2 tiny cornichons) as appetizer, then the red snapper (special), and steak tartar. The wine was also very good, only drawback was that since they don't have a full liquor license, my Dad was left wanting for after-dinner cognac... The profiteroles and coffee made up for it nicely though. The place/tables are quite small, but it's quaint if you don't end up between two other tables, and we were lucky to get a table against a divider. Overall, I was pleasantly surprised, and would definitely recommend it.
