Very slow and confused service. Three waitresses came by our table at various times, often repeating questions. Food was cool when it arrived, and not very interesting. Peppers were VERY oily and unappetizing. Also, booth was not as clean as it should have been. Manager contacted me to request that I add stars to this review. I will not alter my review and will not visit Emporio again to give it another try. In my opinion, the food was mediocre enough that I would rather spend my time visiting other of Nyc's plentiful Italian restaurants.
