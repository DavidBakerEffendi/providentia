My favorite coffee house!  The coffee is wonderfully strong and the staff is lovely.  The atmosphere is perfect.  I love the book selection and the bulletin board lets me know about events and other random awesomeness.  I can (and do!) spend hours and hours here. The sweets and drinks selection are very nice.  I do wish they didn't have so much Vegan Treats though.  It looks nice but doesn't always taste as good as it looks (kinda dry and super heavy on shortening). The sandwiches and bagels are yummy but I miss the prairie fire (grilled vegan cheese with avocado and tomato) something awful! I really enjoyed all the events they used to hold and hope there will be more soon.
