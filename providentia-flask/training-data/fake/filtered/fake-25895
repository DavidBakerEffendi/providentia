"this is definitely more of an italian-american restaurant rather than tradition italian." Really? I just had the Linguine Abruzzi here and I have to say that it tastes just like the food that my grandmother used to make; The very same grandmother who stepped off the boat from Naples at Ellis Island just 4 years after this fantastic restaurant opened. I guess her food was Italian-American, though, not like the authentic food at one of those chains that have been around for 10 or 15 years. I don't care that they only accept cash or how the service was (it was really good) or what a pain in the neck it is to park - It's all about the food.
