Ye Gods! Â Great spot, nice ambience, good service, and I get what they were thinking but jeezus what crappy delivery. The food here is nothing short of suckey. Great ideas, but this place needs to either fire the cook, change the menu or both. If what they said in another review is true, that they came up with the menu by getting drunk and smoking a lot of pot, all I can say is the cook must have been getting drunk and smoking a lot of pot when he cooked our food. A downright abysmal dinner. The worst we've had in years. Ah you oh so cool but know nothing about food out-of-towners would you please stop posting your ridiculous reviews so that people who really like food won't waste time and money eating in places that if really rated correctly would go out of business....fast. Your revews are as pretentious as the food in this so not French food establishment! I feel like I was ripped off.
