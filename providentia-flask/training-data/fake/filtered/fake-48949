People who gave bad reviews know *nothing* about Chinese food.  This is the best Chinese in the state, easy.  Even on Monday nights the place is packed with Chinese people, some of whom drive across the entire state to get here.  If you like takeout Chinese-American food, you won't like it here, it is a different cuisine!!  The hostess is incredibly friendly & helpful - don't know what the other reviewers did to piss her off.  Yes the servers speak little Engish, it's true.  I literally dream about this food.  My recommendation:  beef & tofu in szechuan hot pot with hot oil.
