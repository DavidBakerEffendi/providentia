We have been to this place last year couple times and each time it was a disaster so needless to say we completely took it off the list of places to go. Recently driving by we saw a sign that the place was under new management and my husband time after time would try to convince me to check it out and give it another chance. Tonight we did. It is night and day difference!! The service was outstanding. The server was very knowledgeable, polite and fast. Food came out cooked to perfecting and in a very timely manner. I have to give it out to new managers and staff- well done! Be back soon!
