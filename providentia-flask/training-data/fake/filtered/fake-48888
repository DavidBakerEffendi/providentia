A must stop everytime you are in Philly! This isn't Chi-Chi's or taco bell, folks, so be prepared for authentic mexican food. I generally hate mexican food, because everything tastes the same to me... but this place is totally different. I have been here probably a dozen times and loved every time. Â They moved the location about 10 years ago, so.... if you havent been there in a while try again, it is much more up-scale than it was when it was a couple blocks south. Make sure to make reservations, this place can get packed.
