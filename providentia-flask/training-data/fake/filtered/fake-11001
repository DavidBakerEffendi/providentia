Do NOT get the curry chicken salad! It's basically mayo, chicken, and lettuce. My boyfriend (who eats everything) couldn't even eat it because he felt it was sooo heavy (and he easily eats two cheeseburgers with large fries) and just bad tasting. When we told the waitress she said there was nothing that she could do except for tell us to write what we think online.... The atmosphere of the place is nice and warm though. Â If we had ordered something else, maybe our experience would have been better -- our friends, who told us about it, love it so it must be good for some dishes.
