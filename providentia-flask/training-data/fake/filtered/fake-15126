For the record and to set things straight, as a very happy and satisfied patron of Risotteria for many years, I got the scoop on what actually transpired on Friday. The Â person responsible for the maniacal and dramatic yelling on Friday was a former, disgruntled employee who was dismissed for theft. The reason why (I gather) the manager stayed near to the restaurant while talking to the dismissed employee, was so that witnesses were present if the disgruntled former employee did something stupid, which would have led to the cops being called. I will not let one anomaly of a former employee's bad behavior stop me from enjoying outstanding food. Go and go often! P.S. They do deliver.
