I just got the worst lunch ever from Fedelo's, which is unfortunate because we have been ordering from them for years.  Parts of my order were missing, chicken was missing from the chicken and vegetables special, there was next to no chicken salad on one of the sandwiches, chips are stale, and my chicken salad had a piece of white plastic in it.  If I could upload a picture of it, I would!!!    They have really gone down hill.  Won't be ordering from them any time soon!
