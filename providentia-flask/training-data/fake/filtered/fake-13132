I went to Louis Lunch for lunch on my way to RI from NJ, and I would never go back even if I lived in New Haven. The 30 minute wait, the cramped dining area and the lack of fries are not worth an okay burger. That's right, the burger was okay. Perhaps it could have been better if my burger wasn't well done (I don't understand how a burger that was supposed to be medium rare, which is the default burger, ends up being cooked well). Â However, I doubt my burger would have been much better if cooked right, because although the burger was juicy, it had no flavor. I don't care how good the quality of the meat is, it needs seasoning. Not wanting to mess with the meat is a dumb excuse. I've been to many great NYC steakhouses, and they all season their meat.
