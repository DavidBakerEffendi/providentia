Came to Philly for the weekend from New York. Looked (googled) for an Irish pub to have dinner and possibly hang out and this place was first on the list and had 4 stars. Even the reviews HERE for this place are very favorable. Let me tell you...I was absolutely disappointed. I've been to many Irish pubs whether in NY or even Boston but this place shouldn't even be considered an Irish pub. They don't even serve Guinness...no Mother's Milk!!! I was with a party of 4 and every single dish that we ordered was inedible to say the least. They don't serve Irish beef stew either btw! I cannot recommend to anyone that they come here for dinner. I will say that the place was completely packed downstairs and upstairs and seems to be a fairly touristy place. From what we were told by locals was that this place has some of the cheapest prices for beer in town which is a big reason why it attracts so many people. Maybe this is a place to come hang out and pay less for your beer but I wouldn't recommend the food whatsoever.
