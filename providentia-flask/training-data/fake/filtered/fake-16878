Really 3.5 stars. Â Part of it may have been just the company but I had a good time at this dive eating some bar food and having a couple of beers. It's fairly clean for a bar and the crowd was good. Wouldn't have gone out of my way to find it and come but since it was suggested by one if my buddy's we went. All I can say is good times. Probably would go again.
