Cash only and BYOB (Premium state store across the street closes at 9PM.  Reservations Recommended. One of the best meals I've had in the last several years.  Fantastic food. Small-ish portions, but the Turista Menu for $35 fills you up with four courses, including dessert. Very assured chef, who avoids extremes.  All dished are terrifically balanced.   Recommend the octopus appetizer.  Perfect blend of crunchy grilled diced vegetables and perfectly grilled octopus.  Also recommend the beet appetizer.  The ravioli with veal pasta was also terrific.  The Tiramisu was glorious.  Usually treacly sweet elsewhere, it is wonderfully reserved.   Service was a little slow, but within acceptable range.
