Veggie Heaven is one of my favorite vegetarian restaurants. They have so many options and each one of them is just as delicious as the next. Even my non-vegetarian husband loves their food. Some of my favorites include: Crispy Chicken Cutlet Supreme, Chicken w/ Broccoli, Cold Noodle w/ Sesame Sauce, Scallion Pancakes and the beloved Spring Rolls. Please don't forget the Spring Rolls. They're that good! If you're lucky and live close enough they even deliver. I have taken advantage of that many times.
