If you want to relax and enjoy your meal DO NOT GO HERE!!!!!!!! If you are looking for a great meal and are in an extreme hurry this is the place to go.  My husband took me here for my birthday dinner,  Food was excellent, BUT, they would not let you order a few tapas sit and enjoy them then order a few more.  We were told we had to order all our tapas at once the manager even came over to our table to instruct us on how it is done here.She actually told us they need to turn over the tables. They even took our menus away. We were told if we wanted them back we would have to ask for them again.  At one point we had 4 plates of tapas at the table.  Needless to say at least one was COLD by the time we were able to get to it.  We ordered a drink at the bar, had 7 tapas, a glass of wine and dessert and were out of the restaurant in 40+ min!!!!!!!!!!!  It's a shame all they care about is table turn over because the food was excellent just a shame we could relax and enjoy it. Imagine expecting to relax and enjoy your b'day dinner and be pushed out the door within 45 min. shame shame!!!
