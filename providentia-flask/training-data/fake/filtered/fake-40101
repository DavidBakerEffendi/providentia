Great pizza and a show. The Pizza is delicious and unique style, somewhere between NYC "street pizza" and "gourmet" pizza. The whole pies are reasonably priced. However, the single slices are kind of pricy and it can be over an hour wait to get one. The upside is watching the dramatic performance of making the pies, while you wait.
