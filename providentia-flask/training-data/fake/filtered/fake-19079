Oh em geeeeee the ramen is the best, hands down! The broth is just soooo delicious that I can drink all of it and my bowl will be clean by the end of dinner. The pork buns are good too! I love the bread they use. So nice and fluffy! Lychee martini is killer here too. So don't be surprised if you're stumbling out of the restaurant because they make some strong drinks here. But delicious! Just be prepared to wait. It gets ridiculously crowded here. I mean like having to wait 2 hours just to eat kind of crowded!!
