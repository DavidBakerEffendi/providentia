Bagels are good, but you shouldn't go for your classic bagel with cream cheese... This place has a lot of options from meats to bagels to eggs, and the bagels are really good (not spectacular, though). One drawback - it's slightly pricey. A bagel with eggs, cheese, and bacon with a small carton of Tropicana orange juice was close to $8.
