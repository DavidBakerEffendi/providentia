8 times of 10 they won't have what you want. Once they were out of coffee, than they were out every veggie meat, than no veggie patties. Your sandwich Â must likely will be made wrong and take upwards of 20 mins. And the fake chicken cutlet is a piece of unseasoned tofu, no thank you. The pastries though are good, but expensive. Also the service is mind numbingly slow. Call ahead. Today for the 2nd time they didn't have bagels, it's Sunday they should have bagels.
