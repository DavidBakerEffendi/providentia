this place very quickly became a favorite for my boyfriend and i. they have very eclectic food and it always pleases. i love the beet salad, while my boyfriend is partial to the rack of lamb. it's really cozy (hence the name) which provides for a great intimate atmosphere without being gaudy/over the top. it is a place that you do need to do a little planning because it's cash only and byob. my boyfriend and i happen to see the byob as a plus because it saves money!
