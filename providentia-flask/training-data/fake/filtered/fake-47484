My BF and I consider ourselves "Foodies". So you can imagine our surprise when our favorite pizza place (John's of Bleecker st) was on Travel Channel's Food Wars up against Grimaldi's, a place we had never been to but drove by quite a few times. We immediately made it a point to see what was so great about this place that won the title. "There cant possibly be anything better than John's" we thought. Boy we were right! The first thing we noticed was how unwelcoming this place was. Our "Greeter" was outside chatting and ran back inside when we entered. We were seated next to ( and i mean directly next to) another couple with no room between our tables. so close that our elbows touched. and the smell wasnt a delicious pizza smell, it was more like a weird baked bread smell. To make a long story short... Our pizza was bland and tasteless, The dough was chewy and the sauce SUCKED! IF YOU WANT A TRUE NY PIZZA EXPERIENCE VISIT JOHN'S OF BLEECKER ST. U MIGHT HAVE TO WAIT A BIT BUT YOU WONT BE DISAPPOINTED!
