I was looking for a great pizzeria to take a couple friends that were in town. After a couple recommendations from friends, and the fact that it is advertised as America's first pizzeria, we went. We ordered the Classic Margherita and the sausage pizza. They were great tasting! Real ingredients, none of that fake stuff. The crust could have been a little more cooked, but besides that, it was great. The service was alright. Because we were a big group, we were taken upstairs so what may have been the roof of the building at some point, but is now enclosed. We got a great view, which kind of made up for the lack of service we received at times. For those curious as to their "America's First Pizzeria" advertising, we asked our waiter. He said that they aren't actually the first, but that all the pizzerias before them have closed since opening.
