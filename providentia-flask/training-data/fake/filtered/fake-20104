What a cool spot.  Next time you head through philly and you have time for a trip into reading terminal (which is cool on its own in many ways), if you are looking for a diner type setting for some great breakfast foods, all homemade, you need to give this place a shot.  They are apparently known for their apple cinnamon french toast, among many other things.  IT's an amish run business, and the service is top notch.  We've now been twice, both times getting the same thing - omelets and pancakes, and want to return yet again next time we stay in philly.  It's always busy, and there is limited seating, so prepare to sit in line for 5-35 minutes.  When you're done you can stroll around the terminal for a bit and waste some money on other treats.  Best part - they validate parking for the lot across the street so you will only have to pay $4.
