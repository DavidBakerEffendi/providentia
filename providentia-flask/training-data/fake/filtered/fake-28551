Tasty food, friendly service. Don't be deterred by the looks outside, the food will more than make up for it! We are Indian, and this food meets our standards. It is MUCH, MUCH better than Jewel of India in Hanover, there really is no comparison between the two The food here is clean, tasty, and inexpensive. The samosas are excellent. Our only criticisms: the taste is a little inconsistent, and the service is take-out-only.
