Incredible restaurant.  Service by Peter was impeccable.  Wine recommendation was spot on after I described what I typically enjoy.  The mushrooms, gnocchi, hanger steak and the hazelnut dessert was incredibly delicious.  A wonderful finish to a great NYC weekend!  I cannot wait to return.  Dr. Susie NC
