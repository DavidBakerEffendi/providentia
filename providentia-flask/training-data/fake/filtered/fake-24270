Had brunch here today.  Food was good, service was attentive, music was enjoyable.  BUT: The menu says "Prix Fixe: 6 tapas, mango or watermelon mojito, rice for $35."  When we get seated, waiter recommends this says: nice deal for two.  We sit down with seven, so three of these deals sounds like a nice brunch.  But when we order with another waiter, we can't get this deal.  We end up paying $167 (plus tax plus tip) for less food than what we should have gotten for $105 (plus tax plus tip).  Sorry, guys, if the menu says one thing, don't try to refuse to honor it.
