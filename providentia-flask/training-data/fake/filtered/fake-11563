If you want amazing quality for your wedding budget, this is the place. My husband and I were impressed with their service from the start--our coordinator, Steve Ranieri, was just so professional. We wanted to be married in the outside garden, and were reassured that the indoor "just in case" room would be available in the event of any last-minute weather issues. For the same price that other NYC-area venues wanted for a Sunday brunch with a limited bar, we got a three-course meal, crazy bountiful cocktail hour and full open bar. Steven responded to my random questions so quickly, and the answer was always that the idea (signature cocktails, practice time on the dance floor, etc.) was easily arranged. He, and The Bethwood, made planning the wedding so easy. On the night of, all our guests were impressed. Steve kept everything running like clockwork, which was no easy feat with our large bridal party of 19. All of our other vendors said The Bethwood was easy to work with, in arranging deliveries and setup. The food was delicious (get the Chicken Monterey at brunch--it's so tasty!), so much so that a large contingent went back the next day for brunch. I'm so glad we discovered this place.
