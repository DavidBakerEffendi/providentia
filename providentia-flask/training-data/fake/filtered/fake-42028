I have been going to the King for 5 years now. Mike, the owner, is a great guy who knows his stuff! His hummus is the best you will find, as are the shishtawook, lentils, and babaganooj. The Syrian Cheese whith cucumbers is fantastic! All in all EVERYTHING at the King is great. The prices can't be beat either. My normal meal there is Syrian Cheese, Shish Tawook, and hummus. I spend $12. Mike makes the best middle eastern food around, and the prices can't be beat!
