Went here last year - had an AMAZING CULINARY EXPERIENCE. The food was amazing and visually stimulating. The service was great. It was an undiscovered gem last year. Now, It's over crowded, There's a new Chef, and the service is not so good. I raved about this place to my sister for a while. When I finally took her there - it was bad, rushed food for a $90 bill. She even found someone's (a cook or bartender or waitstaff) long, blond, strand of hair in her drink. We were not compensated in any way for it and the waiter joked that it could be one of our hairs - we are black latinas with afro - curly hair - that does not translate to long blond strand. My food was rushed, dried, burned and I INSTANTLY KNEW THERE WAS A DIFFERENT CHEF in the kitchen. I inquired where the Chef from last year was- the waiter said, "He works at OLA 2 - in Bridgeport, CT. I will be going there from now on. If you think this food is good, you obviously did not eat at this restaurant in it's prime with a good Chef at the helm. It's good / okay now - it was great before....Lost it's flavor. P.S: BAD FOR VEGETARIANS AS WELL - NO OPTIONS. Unless you are a pescatarian and eat seafood.
