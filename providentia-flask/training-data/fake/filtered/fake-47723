The pizza is delicious. It was done just right and I enjoyed every bite. I also ordered the Olde Brooklyn Root Beer, which came in the glass bottle. I kept the bottle as a souvenir since it has an image of the Brooklyn Bridge on it. There was a line outside the restaurant, but it was very organized and I did not have to wait too long for a group of three to get a table. The restaurant was very busy when I was there, but the service was fast. I highly recommend eating at Grimaldi's Pizza and then enjoying a walk over the Brooklyn Bridge after, which is what I did.
