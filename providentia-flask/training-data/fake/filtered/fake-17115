I always was not a fan of this place because of the average food, charging for celery with buffalo wings (literally have never heard of that), blaring music, and the fact that you can't move because it is so overcrowded.  However, it is really the only establishment like it in the West Hartford Center, Thank GOD, which is why I unfortunately got stuck there last night.  Not my choice.   I watched someone throw up on another person and have it not cleaned up probably for about twenty minutes.  When it was finally brought to the attention of the "manager" Brandon, I have never seen someone be so extremely unprofessional or quite frankly someone be such a careless asshole in their life.  As someone who works on management team in the restaurant business, to see someone talk to a paying customer in the fashion that he did was absolutely mind blowing.   To my parents and their friends who dine their often, I will do my utmost to ensure they never set foot in this nasty establishment ever again.  Praying that this is the next restaurant in the West Hartford Center to be in and out and that it is replaced by a properly run Irish Pub.
