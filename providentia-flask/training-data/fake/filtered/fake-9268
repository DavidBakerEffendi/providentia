A person recently complained about this restaurant and this was the owner's response on Craigslist. I personally think he is an ass and shows poor taste in handling this situation. This was his response:"The owner of L'Amante here. I just wanted to respond to the folks who were embarrassed by our server on Friday night. Yes, your wife did speak to me on the phone and I apologized profusely for the incident. So, to say that I could not care less is an outright lie. I asked if there was anything I could do to remedy the situation and she told me that the only thing she wanted was for us to have a policy for these situations. That's a hard one as it has never happened before. As another poster mentioned, the server is responsible for collecting payment from the guests. If someone does not pay it's their responsibility. But, now we do have a policy to cover these situations and I thank you for that. The waitress used poor judgement and made a mistake. We've all made mistakes in our lives, you included. She panicked when she did not see any form of payment on the table and she should have asked the other staff members if they had taken the check presenter. She asked the hostess if you had left and she said you were right out front so she went out the front door and walked 5 steps (hardly chasing you down the block) and asked if you had left payment. She did not accuse you of 'dining and dashing'. You said you paid with cash and followed her in to the restaurant where she did indeed find the check presenter with the cash in it near the bar. The waitress should have then apologized to you. It seems she did not, so I would like to apologize now for your 'humiliation' (your wife's words) of being asked if you paid your bill in front of complete strangers. I hope you reconsider and do come back."
