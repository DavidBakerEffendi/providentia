I took my 3 adult children to Fratelli's and can't say enough good things about it.  We had flawless experiences.  The neighborhood was fun.  Near City Hall. I shop groupon for my first experience at a restaurant.  Great introduction to my new favorite Italian Restaurant in Philly!   Go to Fratelli's and you won't be disappointed.  Great ambiance, view of Chestnut ST. with a big picture window; well trained server knew the menu and had good recommendations; good clientele and wonderful menu.  I'll go back again and I highly recommend it.  Their cheesecake is to die for.  We placed our reservation on opentable.com and it went very well.  I even commented on opentable about it being my son's 23d birthday and they were ready for it.
