This place sucks. And when I say sucks I mean BIG DONKEY BALLS sucks! I think that yelp owes me a start just for taking the time to write this. The bartenders think there doing me a favor by getting me a drink and "letting" me tip them. And they know nothing of the beer that there serving. Completely incompetent! Oh and the kitchen? Nuff said! People dont waste your time. I think Mac has some serious management/ownership issues. I guess with all that money you can afford to have a slezzy place!
