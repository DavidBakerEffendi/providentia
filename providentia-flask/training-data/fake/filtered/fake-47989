Food is great.  Excellent comfort food (and I mean showing up after a break-up and needing to eat your emotions away excellent).  The problem is they are always short staffed, the wait (not only to be seated, but to get your food AND the check) is really long, and you'll be questioning if it's worth the wait after you've been seated.  Great food, not so great waiting for everything after sitting.
