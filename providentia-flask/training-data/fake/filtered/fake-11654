what the hell is up with them 1 stars?! there nuts ! rosas fresh pizza is amazing, the people there are awesome and very respectful. The boss man named mason is very concerned of every customer that walks threw his door asking hows the pizza , qhat can we do to change things, thats pretty impressive. The environment of the store is very comforting. There pizza is slamming!! thats love for one dollar!! The little rosa program is also amazing , you pay it forward to feed the homeless or people who are short of cash! And also the short woman with the short hair , she makes wonderful amazing yummy pizza and she so nice ! just putting that out there! (:
