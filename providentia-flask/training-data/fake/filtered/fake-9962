As a chef who specialized in Italian cuisine since the beginning, I can honestly say that eating here and tasting authentic Sicilian cuisine was a learning experience as well as one of my most memorable meals at a Restaurant in New York. We rarely see true regional dishes on a menu. Sadly, Americanized dishes like Chicken Parmigiana (which does not exist in Italy) have become standard on menus not to mention overly filling. True Italian cuisine is light, consisting of ingredients a person would grow in a garden or catch fishing. More importantly, real Italian fare is more than just food... its a memory. When I sat down to eat, I felt like I was at Sunday dinner with family and friends that I've known my whole life. The staff was polite, fast and incredibly hospitable. I had the wood fired artichoke and arugula salad as an appetizer. Never have I tasted a more perfectly cooked artichoke in my life. I can say the same for the whole market fish of the day which was a red snapper. I asked the waiter if I could speak to the chef, to find out his secret... To my delight, the owner Nick Accardi came over and gave me peak at their hand crafted brick oven, which was imported from Italy and made with clay from Mount Vesuvius. After dinner He invited me to come back to make pizza and to show me how fish cooks perfectly in the wood burning brick oven... which I eagerly accepted and came back the next day. I felt like a kid in a toy store getting to play with a new bike. I left Tavola Incredibly inspired, wanting to go back to my kitchen and cook up as many memorable experiences as possible. I look forward to my next visit... and the one after that!
