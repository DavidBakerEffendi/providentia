I love stage house, Im a regular there now every single week im in there.  They have an incredibile scotch and whiskey selection they even have a list, and if you finish all the different scotchs they pay for dinner for you and three others.  The food is just perfect for the price, i rate food on what its supposed to be, not compared to a 50 dollar filet.  For the price there is no possible way to beat the food or the service, I love this place.
