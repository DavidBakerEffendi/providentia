We were visiting our daughter in Brooklyn, staying at her friends in Tom's neighborhood; when we found good reviews we tried it out the day after T'giving; we got an immediate seat.  It was so positive we came back on Sat. with our son, daughter and her fiance.  The service was over the top, the coffee great, delivered to us in line along with cookies, sausage, honey toast, fries and orange wedges.  My first day pumpkin Belgian waffle was great.  Second day's eggs, bacon, toast, coffee were also great.  The welcome, quick service, friendly smiles, efficiency all with neighborhood charm were spectacular.  And the price was right. We highly recommend it and will go back for sure on another trip to NY.
