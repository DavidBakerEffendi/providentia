We drove all the way from NJ, waited on line for about 20 minutes and thought, "What was all the hype about?". We brought our own wine but they would not allow us to drink it. The manager said there license was pending. I thought that if you BYOB it doesn't matter.  Anyway, there was twelve of us. The pizza was undercooked and we kind of felt  a bit rushed.  The toppings for the pies were very typical. I would have expected a better selection.  Short of using paper plates, the dishes were "one size fits all" even for the dessert. Granted, I don't care about stuff like that if the pizza was out of this world, but when I can get BETTER at my local brick oven pizzeria. Maybe it was an "off" night, but it really was not worth all the hype!
