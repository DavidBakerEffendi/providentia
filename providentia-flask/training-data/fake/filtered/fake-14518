This review is well overdue.  My husband and I found this great little pizza place driving around the area one day.  We happend to live very close by at the time.  From the first time we ate there, we were hooked.  It's simply wonderful pizza and what a friendly owner, Tino..  He and his best friend and brother all sat and chatted with us as we dined there for the last time before our move to the DC area.  Perfect neighborhood spot and totally unpretentious.  We highly recommend this place and hope they open one up in Northern VA sometime soon!!! :)
