I went because of the post instead of going to Mi Penqueno Mexico and this place was horrible. I ordered the carnita taco and the meat was scares and there was mostly fat in the taco. The cook in the back put his fingers in his mouth to "taste" the food and never washed his hands after. I will NEVER go back there again.
