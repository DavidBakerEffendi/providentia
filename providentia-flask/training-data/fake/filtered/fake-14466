We ordered takeout from this restaurant tonight based on the other reviews. The bill was more than $90 and the food was inedible. Everything tasted the same and was very bland. We called and spoke to the manager who told us to come back for a refund. When we got there he refused to give us a refund for all but a few things because we had started to eat them. When I explained that if we hadn't eaten them we wouldn't know it tasted so bad he said he couldn't speak to me any more. Food is poor quality and prices are high. Need I say more?
