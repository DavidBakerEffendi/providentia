I've been to Supper twice, once on a date and once for a private party. I had the pancetta parmigiano and mushrooms risotto, which had good flavor but was pretty thick. My boyfriend had the lemon pasta (not what he ordered) but it was decent. We sat at a bar where you could see the food being prepared, which I thought was unique and added some authenticity to the meal. My one complaint (besides being given the wrong dish) was that our server had a thick beard which he was constantly running his hands through while he flirted with another server. Can anyone say disgusting? The private party was pretty good. We were able to try many of the dishes, and while the private rooms are a little claustrophobic, they have their own bathrooms and ipod hookups which was convenient for a work party. The servers kept our wine glasses full and pleasantly tolerated our obnoxious music and dancing. I'd probably come back here again.
