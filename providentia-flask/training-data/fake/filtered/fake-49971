Went here for diner for the first time. Dining area was nice, not lit well and hard to see the menus in the dim lighting. Our server was very nice, the food was another story. The menu looked great and sounded delicious. The prices IMO were a little too much. Food portions we received were nothing to brag about by any means. Soup came came out cold and we had to send it back, really is it that hard to have hot soup and not cold soup when delivered to your table? Whoever was doing their quality control checks before the food was served missed the boat for sure on more than one meal. One of our orders came out completely wrong. The server never wrote anything down and tried take multiple orders without any thing written down, poor way of taking an order IMO. 3 of the meals arrived and were not even warm like they were sitting out for a while before they were sent to our table so we had to send them back to get them hot. One meal was completely not what was ordered, so not only did we have to wait for cold soup but now had to wait for the right meal to be cooked, the last meal that came out was sort of warm, it was my meal and was ok but would have been better if it was hot. Greater care should have been taken to get hot food delivered to us on a Saturday night @ 7:00pm and this was not done. The appetizers were good (again high priced IMO). They include a salad with the meals and that was good as well. Our server can't remember her name was very pleasant and they took 10% off our meal for the food not even being close to hot. I would like to give them another chance cause the menu sounds so good but better food at a more reasonable price can be had at other places. Does not look like we will return here anytime soon.
