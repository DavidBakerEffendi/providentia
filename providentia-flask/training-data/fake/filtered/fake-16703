We liked the ambience, the server was friendly and knowledgeable, and the steak frites TASTE was good but the meat was pretty cold.... the biggest mistake was that a nice bottle of Malbec came COLD - really COLD! Â even a novice should know not to serve red wine cold......we should have sent it back but she had already opened it.....
