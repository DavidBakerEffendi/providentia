YES YES YES!!! On Â a short day trip to Philadelphia for my brother's wedding I stumbled across this gem as his reception was a few blocks away & the food options were not to my liking. Needless to say this restaurant was the best sneaking away from a wedding reception EVER. The brisket was divine! The mac and cheese was probably the best I've ever had. Loved the pinto beans. Staff was great, very friendly. Fast service as well...managed to sneak back in reception at a reasonable time! If I'm ever in Philadelphia again I will definitely return to this amazing place!!!
