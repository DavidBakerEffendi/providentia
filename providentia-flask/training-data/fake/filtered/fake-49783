I've been passing this place for months and finally stopped in today.  The food was so so so good.  Really high quality, fresh, flavorful, delicious and satisfying.  I got a  kale and chickpea wrap with potatoes chunks in a spicy sauce. I ended up taking half of it home because I was so happily full after the first half and an empanada and veggie pattie.  Usually I eat all my food and everyone else's to, but this was just too good to gorge on.     And the place was bright, clean and women there were both very nice.  One even gave me an amazing raspberry smoothie, I think my brain/stomach is still in shock from so much great tasting & healthy stuff.  I seriously cannot wait to go back and try more.
