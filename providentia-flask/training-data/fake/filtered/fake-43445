By Central TX standards, this place is very good (hence the 4*'s).   For NJ, it is outstanding!  Best bbq I have had north of the Red River and that is a very big complement. . Haven't tried the ribs yet, but I am guessing they are as wonderful as the brisket. Sides are very tasty and creative.   . This place is worth driving past Famous Dave's for.
