Dear customer Jeff, It's really sad that you feel that way about our restaurant. I remembered that you and your friends came to PF Market  for dinner  and you ordered the fried calamari...and yes you returned it..BUT  we made another one, completely FRESH  and we served it to you .WE NEVER- NEVER SERVE THE SAME FOOD. That's such a mistaken impression you are giving to other people.  We respect and love our customers!!!   Although , since you were not happy ( it could  happen and we respect that, too ) we called you the next day and left you  a voice mail, since you didn't pick  up your phone  and we APOLOGIZED and asked you to come back since we want to  make our customers happy . We understand that you might have  had an issue, but THE CALAMARI WE SERVE IS FRESH AND WE MAKE IT TO ORDER . We deliver fresh fish to our restaurant everyday and we have been  in the seafood business for 32 years. We work very hard and we are devoted on making our customers happy. We don't want you to feel that way and expecially to make comments that are not facing the reality. Our food is fresh and clean 100%. Please accept our invitation to come back and give us  a second chance , since  we are completely sure that you have mistaken us. With Regards, Theofili
