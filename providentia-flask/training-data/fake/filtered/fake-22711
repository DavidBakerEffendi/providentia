I had never found Italian food equal to that of my Grandmother's outside of her kitchen until I found Carmela's.  Owned by a family from the Naples area of Italy, the menu ranges from Pizza and Grinders to some of the best ravioli I've ever had.  Small, unassuming,  and glaringly inexpensive you'd never expect anything out of the ordinary. Prepare to be surprised!
