BBQ pork for 4.25 ( one bread slice into 2 Cheaper than subway plus taxes or $5.5 They asked you spicy or not spicy Fast service like less than 5 seconds They had a lot of the breads already done and ready to go. I like the pickles the most ( carrots and some Other type of veggie) The bread is too crispy that you must slow down, otherwise you will have gums crack in your mouth. Definitely drink water before or after eating the bread.
