I could cut and paste Bethany L.'s experience word for word. Even sounds like the same server. Same drafty table. I think I got that table because I opted to not use the coat check in case I got a drafty table! After that I was most likely  assumed to be a cheapskate.  Major attitude from staff and not even in a classy way like Lucy was treated at the Brown Derby on I Love Lucy Funny thing is I have a friend who is a well known singer who introduced me to Joe Allen a few years back. This was my first time there without her. We always got a great table and great service.  The big joke is as legendary as she is she is not an over-the-top tipper.  Last night I would have given a 40% tip since we only got the burger and soft drinks.  As a former server myself that's what I do for polite service. Not this time baby. Unless I go back there with a celebrity or someone who looks like one I will never go back!
