Best cheese steak I've had to date... Fresh bread, fresh meat and cheese, this place is authentic Philly. Other places have bread that is old or hard and not here! I love that everything is fresh made upon ordering. I would recommend the fries as well - great side addition to a cheese steak. Go with whiz and onions - you won't be disappointed!
