This place is incredible!  Layover at JFK last night...searching for some authentic Italian cuisine.  Google search led us to Don Peppe's (South Ozone Park - Queens).  We were seated immediately -tight quarters but lots of friendly conversations going on.  Lots of Italian people dining here which is a good sign!  Menu is on the wall on a black board...many choices...all look delicious.  Our waiter came by, described the specials...and offered us beverages...house red wine is relish!   Party of three...we started with the house salad...family style.  I could have been content with just that...fresh beyond belief...from the crisp, green lettuce to the obviously imported tomatoes that taste like they came from your grandmother's garden.   And the dressing...mwah!  It was the lightest, freshest, homemade Italian imaginable!  Olives green and black...incredible. As one member of our party had a seafood allergy...we had to shy away from the clams...and although the veal gets total raves, we opted for spaghetti with garlic and olive oil first...delicious!  Plenty of garlic and sauce.  The pasta was not homemade...only downside of this entire meal...and not a big deal. 2nd course chicken with lemon and butter...can't say enough about this dish...wish I could make it that good at home...pounded thin...tender and moist beyond belief...vibrant lemon butter sauce - bright with a hint of fresh parsley! Dessert we split two...tortufo and a cannoli....seriously THE BEST cannoli ever.  Filling so light and creamy...again AMAZING! If you are in or about the JFK area...this is a MUST!
