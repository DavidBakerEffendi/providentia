I was so excited to finally go here because it looks so cute and fun. my friend and I got FOOD POISONING! we ordered the Cold Platter and the Peel n Eat Shrimp and shared everything. The peel n eat shrimp were great. We think the crab and oysters were old as they seemed questionable. 3 dungeness crab claws, mine was oooook, hers was bleh and the third completely inedible. one of the king crab claws was slimy. my friend was violently ill for 5-6 hours and ended up in urgent care the next day!!! BEWARE!!!
