This is the 12th time I've been to Lucali and each time it has gotten worse! Pizza was undercooked and all the basil was in one pile in the middle. Service was as cold and snotty as ever. I can't believe I'm still reading about people waiting 2 hours to get into this place! If you want a real pizza go to Ignazzio's and get the Sicilian...
