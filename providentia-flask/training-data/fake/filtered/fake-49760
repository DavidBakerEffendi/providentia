I've been here on a Friday night with a big party. The Restaurant is very cozy and has a great atmosphere. We shared Arancini as appetizer and I had Risotto ai Funghi. An amazing Risotto!! The real Italian Risotto like the one you can have in Italy (I've been in Italy many times and also in Verona). I will go back for sure! I loved the food and the place and I highly recommend it to everyone! Suggestions: - Don't miss the Profiteroles... An explosion in your mouth!! - The Restaurant is quite small, you will probably have to wait a little bit (we had to wait for 30 minutes even with a reservation... still, totally worthy).
