Joe's Shanghai is bombtastic. My only complaint would have to be that they need to expand more, and have a larger restaurant. This place is so good. I've had plenty of XLB but wow it was my first time eating the crab ones. I was pretty mind blown. Only advice I'd give when eating soup dumplings is to be careful because it's really hot and they burst relatively easy. It's a must for me to go here everytime I hit up NYC.
