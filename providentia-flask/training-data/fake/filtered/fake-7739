My mother is Japanese.  She was a chef at the old Rising Sun restaurant in the Hartford Civic Center. Some friends of the family have many years experience in managing and working in Japanese restaurants.   I know a thing or two about what makes a Japanese restaurant good.  I grew up eating this food.  ....my credentials. Murasaki offers the VERY BEST food.  Number one in what I look for when I eat raw food! The restaurant offers a very simple surrounding that actually fairly reflects traditional japanese restaurants.  It feels right.  No doubt one or two tables feel cramped, but for the most part this not a problem.  I'd say if this is a problem for you, then ask or wait for other seating or go elsewhere.  I've been in a group of six and sat comfortably. Look, I've been to pretty much all of these restaurants, some are flashy with a metro feel, some are fun with hibachi food thrown at you, some are not so fresh and therefore, questionably dangerous.  Murasaki is what is right in Japanese restaurants.  I still try a new restaurant when they pop-up, but this is the one all of my family will always return to.
