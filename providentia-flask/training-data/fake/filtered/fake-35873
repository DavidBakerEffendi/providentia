The taste of the pizza is head and shoulders above the average Brooklyn pie, but it is a dirty place or at least it was the last time I went in 4 years ago. Â Needs a paint job and a good scrubbing, new tables, etc. The price is too high as well - 4 years ago paid $ 20 for a pie, my preference is Grimaldi's for 12 bucks and now that they are in Coney, easier to access.
