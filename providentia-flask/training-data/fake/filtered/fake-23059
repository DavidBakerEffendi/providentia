Nothing like the antipasto bar at Trattoria Dell'Arte. You also have to order the Tuna Steak, with a balsamic glaze and lentil salad. If you're still around for dessert- Lemon Pie .... We'll run into each other, you can find me there at least twice a week, or more friends are in town. I've been going to this place for over 8 years!
