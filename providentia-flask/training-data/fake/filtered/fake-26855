Great food and good portion sizes. The lunch menu is great- you can get an appetizer and main entree for a total of about $7. Extremely affordable place for some great Thai food in the city. The decor is a little too much, but I guess that's just a part of it's eccentric "room service" ambiance. They deliver too! I always recommend this place to anyone who likes Thai food.
