I had heard good things about the place, but when I went there with three friends I was actually quite disappointed. Three of us ordered the Mediterranean Breakfast, which consisted of two eggs (any style), and very small amounts of avocado, pita bread and salad. It was supposed to come with labne, which is a Mediterranean yoghurt sauce, but I'm pretty sure what we get was just sour cream. The food was not bad, but certainly not special - and too expensive for the quality and quantity. The coffee was watery, and the waiters were kind, but not very adequate in refilling water glasses and coffee cups - even when we asked for it.
