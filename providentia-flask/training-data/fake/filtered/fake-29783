So me and my girl used to LOVE going here, so when last Sunday rolled around, we were like, Why not Lobster Joint? I mean, its summer right. BIG MISTAKE. Like when they say "Fish and Chips" they literally mean 1 straggly ass piece of fish and half a handful of soggy fries. No thanks. And my girl, she says her lobster roll had obvi been sitting out. Like what the hell? I mean their name has lobster in it so get that right at least lol. And like she's too polite to tell me, but I know for a fact that she had skitters within 1 hour of eating. So Lobster Joint has totally jumped the Shark!
