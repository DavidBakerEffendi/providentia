Cafe Lore is a wonderful place to dine. Its refreshing enviornment is just what sunset park needs. Service is fast and friendly. The food is fresh (including the pasta) and made to order. I bought a meal for my husband and I loved it. My husband on the other hand has never experienced culture outside of rice and beans and music so loud it makes your ears bleed. His idea of Italian is canned chief boyardee. Â At any rate, give cafe Lore a try you won't be disappointed.
