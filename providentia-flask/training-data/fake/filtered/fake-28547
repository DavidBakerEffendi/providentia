For a cafe Good Karma is as good as it gets.  I like the fact that all their coffee is organic and fair trade.  Their food is organic, the place is extremely clean, nice environment and friendly staff.  It has all you'd expect in a cafe, but the part about all organic coffee and the fact that it's fair trade coffee means they are socially conscience in how they purchase and sell their products.
