Go.  Here. Now.   This is my go-to Japanese place in Midtown West.  I've been here dozens of times, with all different groups of people, and it never disappoints.  Of course you'll want to try oodles of charcoal-grilled yakitori, cause that's what they specialize in!  Some things not to be missed: Grilled Tsukune (chicken meatballs) Grilled Gizzard (I know, I know... but it's DAMN good!) Grilled Heart Homemade Tofu Wash it all down with some draft beer.  YUMMMM!!! PS  They take reservations before 7:00pm.  I suggest you make one and keep it, or you'll be waiting an hour plus.
