The food here is good to excellent.  Sometimes things are just good.  But sometimes they are really excellent.   This is a good place to get a light dinner. or a snack if you want something to tide you over until dinner.  It is pricy though and the portions are on the small side, so it might not be a good place to go if you're actually hungry. I highly recommend the seasonal toast. The carrot and avocado salad is delicious.   And the side vegetables are reliably good.   The ricotta ravioli is good, but nothing special and probably not worth the price.  Ditto for the cavatelli.
