Great spot in my neighborhood - tried to go a bunch of times at the weekend but its always crazy busy - a friend recommended I go midweek, so I've been the last two Fridays with no wait and yet still a nice buzz to the place! Staff are super friendly, menu offers a great selection and the food and service are top notch. Hoping to make it a regular Friday brunch spot!
