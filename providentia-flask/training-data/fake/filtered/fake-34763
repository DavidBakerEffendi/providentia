We have been coming for many years ,but this is our first time reviewing Â our favorite restaurant. Since we had our wedding here10 years ago, we have had several family celebrations and Saturday night dinners. All have been a special experience, excellent food, service and ambience. We love the home made pastas, fish dishes and Connie's home made Chocolate Cheesecake. Several years ago, they added outside dining and an upstairs cozy bar area with a fireplace. We have spent many summer nights eating outside enjoying the salad specials, always with a light delicate dressing. In the winter, we enjoy the homemade minestrone soup with fresh vegetables. You won't be disappointed, and I am sure it will become a regular place for your family also.
