Sidecar is my favorite place to go for brunch. Every weekend they have a different delicious pastry available, don't get there too late or there might not be any left! Their creamy florentine is definitely a go too and their cheesy grits are are so yummy! If you haven't been to sidecar yet I would definitely check it out!
