The food is delicious and very authentic. I sat at the counter and talked with the staff, (mostly with the girl who speaks English, lol) you could watch the food being prepared fresh.  We had the tamale and empanadas, along with guacamole and chips. They fry the chips right in front of you.  The service was so friendly, the food was great, and the whole place was very clean.  Can't wait to go back again. And with the reasonable prices, I can go back soon.
