I eat here often with my coworkers and we get the fried pancake and ma la tang frequently.  The fried pancake is a Northeastern China specialty where they shred a regular scallion pancake and fry it up with vegetables and meat.  Since we are spice lovers, we get this dish with hot sauce, and ma la tang with medium spice. Lately I feel that the dishes have gotten more oily so I haven't been eating it as much.  But this restaurant is still a decent place for a bite to grab. (don't expect too much from the decor)
