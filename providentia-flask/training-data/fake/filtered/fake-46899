I went here many times eating solely at the Gujurati stall where the khandvi is a regular staple food at my household. Then suddenly when I decided to try some food at the Punjabi food stall my opinion of the place changed. The two curries were so spicy and salty that my tongue was burning all night and formed blisters. Now I love spicy and salty food, Im Indian so Im used to spicy and salty food, but this food was so much so that my Indian born mother was forced to eat no more than a bite. Then the worst part was that when I returned hoping to have it replaced, the man working there along with his peers accused me and my sister that we had eaten the food and were looking to cheat him to get more. THis frustrated me as all the containers were still practically filled and the naan barely touched! THis angered me so much so that I decided to create yelp and warn others. The Gujurati stall is still one of my fave places to go to in central jersey, but the punjabi stall is the restaurant that I hate the most. You have been warned! Best of luck.
