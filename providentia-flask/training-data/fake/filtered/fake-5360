When I don't feel like cooking and have a taste for pizza late night. Alpha delta is my go to pizza shop in new haven. I lovvvvvvvvvve there special pizza. It was a time or two when I almost gave up on them cause it seemed like there's two different cooks or something. Awhile ago when Id order my special pizza it didn't look nor taste right. But now I'm not sure if they have a new cook or what but I've been loving my pizza. Hopefully it stays that way!
