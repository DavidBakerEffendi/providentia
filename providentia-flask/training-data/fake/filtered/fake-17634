We held our rehearsal dinner here in July in the downstairs room (for 38 people) and it was perfect. The space down there is minimally decorated - candles, a few small flower vases, dim lighting, which was all fine with us, we were there for the food, but I could see how you might want a bit more personality down there. The event staff was amazing at every step of the way, from securing the date, creating the menu, and service the night of. And the gnocchi. My family still mentions the gnocchi as a highlight of the wedding weekend. The rehearsal dinner meal (branzino, pork chops, spaghetti) was as memorable, if not moreso, than my wedding meal. It's rare in NYC to find a room to reserve that is free (no rental fee) and doesn't charge an insane minimum, but Jane was totally within our budget, they accommodated us with kids meals, and we had no complaints. I just went back for a regular dinner too and whatever is in their apple crisp is addictive, it is like essence of caramelized, sweet, delicious apple. Â I like that they're making their own homemade sodas now too.
