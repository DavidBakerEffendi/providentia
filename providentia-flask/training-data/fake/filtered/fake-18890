This pizza was horrible.What   turned me off in the beginning was that i looked into the pan that the Sicilian slices were sitting in, and they were sitting in a puddle of Oil!!!??  WTF!!??. Don't they realize that bread is like a sponge, it'll suck up all the liquid beneath it.It was  also really difficult for me to taste the cheese and the sauce along with what ever toppings that were on it because of all the grease they were drenched in. ..I understand that pizza in general isn't the healthiest of foods and I generally don't eat junk food, but damn..Its like eating a slice of pure grease ( fat) with gushy cheese , so F'ing disgusting. I'm surprised that no one caught a heart attack. Now I have to go work off the 500  calories I  just  took in and I only had half a slice, I through the other half away!!  ..not to mention that it is extremely over priced..WAYYYY OVER PRICED!!!!. Its funny how all the Hipsters line up outside spending all their parent's money for a horrible slice; buying into the "HYPE". I guess if you think about it, its not Artichoke's fault because most people will buy anything if the hype is big enough, no matter how horrible it tastes, how bad it is for you, or how useless the service is. Another perfect example are those stupid Apple IPhones, completely useless devices that cost way too much just so someone can have bragging rights and look "cool".
