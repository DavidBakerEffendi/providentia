My wife and I have eaten here twice and returned the second time because the food was very good! We ate the barbecue pork, House Fried Rice, Steamed vegetable with oyster sauce I believe it was chinese spinach, and sweet and sour chicken. We will return here again on our next trip. The staff was very friendly and service was very quick. Awesome Food best authentic chinese food I ever had!!! Â I would highly recommend this place.
