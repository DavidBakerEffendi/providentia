Incredible authentic Italian food, warm, friendly service in a cozy atmosphere. My husband and I vacationed in central Jersey (OK, I'm originally a Jersey girl) so we could take day trips to Princeton, the Sculpture Garden in Hamilton, the Jersey shore and visit family. On our way back to the hotel from the Sculpture Garden, we came upon Mamma Rosa's. Being fans of locally-owned restaurants, we pulled in. We were served by the owner and his daughter, treated like family -- the perfect balance of care and attention and time to ourselves and had one of the best meals ever. My husband used to own a restaurant and worked in the business most of his life -- he knows restaurants and food. We would both go out of our way to eat there again. Delicioso!
