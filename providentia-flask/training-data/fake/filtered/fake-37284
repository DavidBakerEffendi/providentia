If you'd like to sample authentic Greek food, skip the diner or the local gyro stand and come to a place like Anthi's. A small mom-and-pop type shop located on the Upper West Side, Anthi's is a wonderful place to stop off at when you're craving Greek. Apparently, the owner is of Greek descent; he and I even chatted a bit in Greek. Note that the place is very small, though, and will not accommodate eat-in, so be prepared to grab your grub and eat on the go. I took advantage of the Yelp deal ($30 coupon for $40 worth of food) and chose several items. The karydopita (walnut cake) is absolutely exquisite--so much so that this item alone is worth a trip back! It's spicy, sweet, wet--the best I've ever tried. The tzatziki (yogurt-based garlic-flavored dip/sauce) is another winner. Speaking as someone who was raised with Greek traditions and who has even made tzatziki himself, the tzatziki at Anthi's is truly top notch. You'll never again care for that bland mass-marketed commercial-grade paste that sells elsewhere. Thumbs up, too, for the Greek yogurt--thick, flavorful, and delicious (but not the sort of thing too eat much of if you're counting your cals). I also tried the both the pastitsio (layered pasta dish made w ground beef, tomato sauce, and bechanel/custard sauce) and the spanakopita (traditional spinach pie) and came away a bit disappointed with both. The pastitsio seemed too dry and the spanakopita lacked the richness and flavor that I've come to expect from good homemade spanakopita. In all fairness, though, I ate them both cold since I forgot to request that they be heated. If you get either of these--make sure that you eat them warm. The temperature factor aside, I'd say these were about average. Overall, a thumb's up. Anthi's is an authentic, take-out only, reasonably priced (relative to UWS prices) establishment that provides friendly service and serves anywhere from average to outstanding Greek food items.
