Okay, I've heard about this place that serves terrific sangria since moving to Manhattan six years ago.  (I've traveled to Spain and know the genuine mix.) But what I witnessed from sitting at the end of the bar blew me away! This bartender--who kept referencing the fact that his accent is Long Beach, Long Island to some giggly brunette--kept leaning against the bar and unzipping his pants and  tea-bagging into the queue of sangrias. The guy was steeping his balls (hairy) into the glasses before serving them.  I noticed he did this when guys came to the bar and ordered the drink.  UNBELIEVABLE!
