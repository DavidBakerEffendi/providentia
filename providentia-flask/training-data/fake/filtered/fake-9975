I fail to see the attraction of this place. I had been here about 2 years ago and had a medicore breakfast.  This year, during the Italian Market Festival a couple of friends wanted to meet there for breakfast again so I reluctantly went hoping for the best,  Again the food was mediocre.  I ordered an omelet with 3 ingredients in it.  The first problem was that it was way overcooked.  There was a brown hard skin on the outside of it.  The eggs themselves were bland and the omelet relied on the ingredients inside for all of its flavor.  The potatoes on the side were completely bland.  They tasted like there wasn't even salt in them.  The coffee had an astringent, woody flavor.  About the only thing that tasted good was the multi grain toast.  That was fine.   Even if my friends want to go back next time I'll politely refuse, eat elsewhere, then meet them after breakfast.
