Usually the food here is great, though every once in awhile it disappoints. My complaint is the poor service. They are always slammed, but that shouldn't excuse extremely slow and majorly inattentive service. I keep going because the food is very good - but I really wish this place was better managed and had a friendlier, more detail-oriented wait staff. Especially since you pay more than most other places.
