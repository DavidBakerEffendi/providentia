This D&D is very nice.  It seems though that it is going downhill.  They don't know how to make a coffee correctly, and they never seem to have enough donuts especially boston kreme.  They only seem to have boston kreme in the morning.  They also never seem to run the same good promotions as most other D&D's in the area  Hopefully they can pickup there service.  They were so much better when they were across the street where Muncheez is now.
