Their catering service is AMAZING!  The food is really good and the portion size can't be beat.  Not to mention, they bailed me out last minute on a work event when the other caterer fell through (1 1/2 hrs before the event started!!! can you say "ready to SCREAM"?!)  Greek Olive delivered wonderful appetizers and hor'derves for 75 people with that short of a notice!  I am eternally grateful!
