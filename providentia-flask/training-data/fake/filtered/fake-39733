This is a great spot for some good Mexican food and margaritas.  The decor is trendy and cool and the bar area is the center of the restaurant.  It can get very crowded at times.  The guacamole is delicious as well as the blood orange margaritas.  I could just go and eat guac with chips and drink margaritas all night!  There is also a photobooth in the restaurant which is pretty cool.
