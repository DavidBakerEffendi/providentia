Ordered 10 boiled shrimp and cabbage dumplings, along with a sesame pancake with vegetables. Pros: - Dumplings were piping hot and freshly made to order.  You can tell everyone here works hard and puts care into the food, which counts for something. - Sesame pancake was really good - sort of like a scallion pancake, but much lighter and packed with fresh cilantro. - The price ($3.75 for all of the above) is of course unbeatable. Cons: - Overall, the dumplings were fairly bland, and the wrapping had sort of a weird, overly watery texture that was off-putting.  There is sriracha/soy sauce available in the shop to liven things up, but I was too far away when I realized the dumplings desperately needed an extra kick. - The dumpling filling was about 85% cabbage, 15% shrimp, and the cabbage was reminiscent of frozen broccoli in taste and texture. I really wanted to like this place given the price and cool hole-in-the-wall vibe, but was a little disappointed in the dumplings.  Perhaps the fried pork and chive ones are worth a repeat trip.
