I was there with my wife and sister. It was not a good experience. They left the water on the table and did not pour into the glass. There were only two servers. It was very busy. We had to always raise hand to get server's attention when we were out of water or food. Still we had to wait several minutes to be served. Servers never approached to our table and check if everything is ok. Â At the end, they gave me check and at the bottom of check there was 18% and 20% Tip guidelines. A server circled it many times around Tip guidelines forcing to leave at least 18% tip. Tip supposed to be optional and it should start with 15% or even less based on service. Such a poor service and forcing to Tip more than they deserve would not attract me go back there again.
