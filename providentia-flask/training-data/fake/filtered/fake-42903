A wonderful and much needed addition to the neighborhood! Went with a group of four girls and we thoroughly enjoyed the market sides-- so many to choose from and so delicious. The garlic mashed potatoes, sautéed kale and quinoa with feta were among our  favorites! Lots of vegetarian and vegan options for my friend too. A must is the Mac N Cheese with roasted cauliflower! The Bartender even made me my favorite drink of a Moscow mule with authentic ginger beer! Our waiter, Grant, was outstanding and so attentive. Couldn't have asked for a better meal especially for the price!
