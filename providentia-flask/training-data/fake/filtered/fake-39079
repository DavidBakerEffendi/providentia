Delicious! Missed our Friday night reservation because of a late flight and a down pour of rain that delayed our arrival at our hotel. We were able to reschedule for a Sunday night reservation and so glad we did. So many good choices on the menu that it was hard to decide. Had the rigatoni bolognese which was a great choice.
