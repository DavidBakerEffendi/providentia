I visited Bridgid's last night for the launch of the new menu and new chef. What a difference. They had a small A frame at the front announcing the new changes and I could not be happier that I stumbled upon it. The place was packed, the atmosphere great and the food a real treat. We were given to some of the best starters that I have had in a long time, I then had snails on bruschetta (fantastic flavors), followed by sweetbreads on pancetta (delicious). This was not the menu I expected in one of what I considered my local bars. I thought burger and ended up with fine dining at it's best. I am thrilled and will be back again and again. The old Bridgid's has gone and I now have the rethink my favorite restaurant. It's worth a trip. I'd travel to this place to eat and it's on my doorstep.
