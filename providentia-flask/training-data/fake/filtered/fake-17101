We returned at Sea Fire Grill again for my Wife's birthday and both of us were beyond happy. From the moment you walk in you feel the aura of elegance and professionalism, we were seated right away and our waiter was amazing. We started our dinner with cold seafood tower that was delicious, I had Chilean Seabass and my Wife ordered Halibut Special they melted in your mouth, cooked to perfection and full of flavor and I can't wait to go back.
