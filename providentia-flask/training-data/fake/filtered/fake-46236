Ippudo was one of the best ramen chains in Japan, and I have to say this restaurant in NYC captures the experience rather well. The broth (I enjoy the red, akamaru) has its own unique and elaborate flavor. The calls of "irrashimase!" (welcome in English) made me feel like I was back in Japan, and happy to be eating ramen. The drawbacks to this experience were the costs, unfortunately. Paying 13 dollars for ramen, and 2 dollars for any extras, detracted a little from the experience. Also be ready for a wait...we waited probably about an hour when our hostesses said we'd wait half that. Still, if you're looking for unique and authentic ramen this place will not disappoint.
