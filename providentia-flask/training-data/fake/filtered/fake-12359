Love this place!!! It is so nice to have a place in Williston that offers a trendy downtown feel. The cocktail list is creative and keeps me coming back for more! It is my mission to try them all :) And if your not a mixed drink lover, they also have a great local beer selection on draft. The turkey and beet burgers are my favorite but there are many others that are yummy as well. My friend had the buffalo chicken sandwich and said it was the best she has ever had. Instead of yogurt city which was our recent go to for dessert in this area, we now splurge for Grazer's milkshakes.... They are in one word amazing. I would highly recommend this place as a lunch or dinner spot!! It offers a great atmosphere to catch up with friends or have a date night before a movie.
