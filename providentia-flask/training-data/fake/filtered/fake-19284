A hungry friend dragged me here and I was prepared for a blah buffet, but found one of the most complete spreads I've found anywhere.  Yes they have some pizza, but most of it is Chinese hot table fare.  Choice of  3 soups, beef or chicken w plenty of broccoli, cheese filled fried wonton, breaded fried crab, sweet/sour chicken, lots of desert choices from jello and soft-serve custard, to puddings and cakes and fruits and sesame balls.  I can't remember the dozens and dozens of dishes.  We went in around 12:30 on a Thursday.   The bathroom was acceptable - not smelly.  The servers keep refilling your soda from pitchers ($1.50 per person. We shared on the sly, but only drank one glass between us without refill.)  Atmosphere is pretty much nil.  This was two days ago and I had no stomach problems
