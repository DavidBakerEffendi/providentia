Amada is a place for people who really enjoy food. The combinations are traditional yet imaginative-- salmon with saffron emulsion and spiced almonds paired with tempura-fried artichokes and grilled onions. Shirred eggs with shrimp and wild mushrooms and indescribably luscious crostini. (My date said this was what breakfast must taste like in heaven.) Green salad spiked with sliced figs and almonds, the whole thing rolled in Serrano ham. The only caveat-- hardly a complaint-- is that these are not small "small plates." A few-- two, three at most-- make a lovely meal. The service is delightful and this popular, yes, trendy restaurant makes you feel extremely welcome. Try the white sangria. No, try the red sangria. But go to Amada. If you like food.
