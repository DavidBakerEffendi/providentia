Not what I expected I can't say any thing good about this place it's expensive 15.95 for adults and 8 dollars for kids 3-9 and the waitress can't really tell the ages of kids from a 11 month old baby because they tried charging me 8 dollars for my 11 month old baby Â and my two year old boy there isn't that big variety of food
