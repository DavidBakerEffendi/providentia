"Worst Sandwich Ever"  Eager for a new dining experience, my friends and I recently tried out Hawthorne.  Sadly, we were extremely disappointed.  From the get go, something seemed askew as we sat down and waited quite a long time before the waitress came to greet us and give us our menus.  If you are dining at the restaurant and want a beer, you have to go up to the coolers in the back, pick it out, and take it to the cash register to be added to your check.  The problem is that they do not have prices on the beer and so it's kind of a gamble.    There wasn't much variety on the menu, but I was willing to look past that.  Many of the items on the menu, however, are smaller portions and they suggest getting at least 2-3 plates.  For instance, a regular burger is not available at Hawthorne, only a "baby" burger- which comes in a set of premature twins.  Fries are extinct in Hawthorne land- only homemade chips or a few onion rings are possible sides.  Once we ordered, we waited an extremely long time for our food.  I was starving by the time my meal came out, which was served way ahead of my friend's meals.  Each meal was served separately and one item was forgotten completely, which added to the feeling that this place needs to get more organized.  I was so hungry that I gobbled up the homemade chips- which tasted like nothing.  My sandwich was burnt so badly that the bread it came on was literally black.  The mushrooms inside the sandwich were so hard, I could hardly bite through them.  The indeterminable sauce and cheese inside was just a greasy mess.  I gave up after one bite.    I felt more than a little ripped off after shelling out a combined $30 for dinner and still felt undernourished.  I rushed home to scrounge up any loose bits of chocolate that were hiding in my cabinets and stuffed my face along with some trail mix in order to erase the atrocities that had taken place in my mouth earlier at Hawthorne.  Too negative?  The fireplace was a nice touch.
