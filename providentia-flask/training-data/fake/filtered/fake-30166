An unexpected little gem on one of the sweetest blocks in NoLita. I find myself at BarBossa at least once a week either for a sunny lunch (sit at one of the window tables for great people watching and open air on warmer days), or a cozy dinner after work. It feels like you have stepped into a small old-world cafe in Europe and is absolutely charming for a date or dinner with friends. Honestly, the food here is fantastic and so fresh! I concur with the other reviews that the Shrimp and Avocado Curry is my favorite. Served with rice, this is delicious comfort food that is light and the shrimp is never overcooked. I love the combination of spices with avocado and the unexpected nutty surprise of cashews. The kitchen is tiny, and there is no room for food to sit around pre-cooked--everything is made to order with keen attention to detail. Other favorites are the Rice Bolognese al Forno, which is like a lasagna made with rice and the most delicious bolognese sauce with parmesan cheese; the mussels are a pleasant surprise with a delicate coconut curry broth that is to die for, and so original. Save room for dessert--you'll want to try the coconut tapioca Â with caramelized bananas! A great place for brunch too (clearly, I have tried many of the items on the menu, and am never disappointed). The wine list is great and very well-priced, and I love that I can go there for dinner and not break the bank. The staff is always courteous and professional, and the service is never slow, even when they are packed. All around it is a great value and a great experience.
