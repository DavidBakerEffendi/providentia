We had a fabulous meal at Han Dynasty tonight.  I know,I know, don't go out on a Monday night, but this place was great.  Our server, Josh, was great.  He walked us through the menu and explained the heat levels.  We ordered the two apps he suggested--Dan Dan Noodles and Dumplings in Spicy Oil.  Both were delicious and reflected the heat and portion that Josh described.  The Dumplings were spicy, but not over the top.  We had the Dry Pot Chicken to share for an entree.  HOT, but delicious.  Anybody can make something too hot to eat, but this dish had a satisfying,  whole mouth heat that wasn't painful but enjoyable. Definitely returning.  Hope Josh is working.
