What a great place indeed. I love that i can come late and socialize (rather than going to a bar) as well as listen to sweet tunes eating a delicious slice of pizza all made with care. This seems like a project well started and i am soooo excited to see where things will lead for these fine gents. keep up the good work. you are such a gem for this community.
