I had the stuffed french toast and the mexi-plate which is a burrito stuffed with eggs and salsa. The french toast was gross because of the huge amount of cream cheese. The cream cheese was good but I wouldn't give anyone a bucket of cream cheese as a meal. Felt like eating a stick of butter. The fruit costs extra but you definitely need to add the fruit or else the dish becomes inedible because of how much cheese there is. And you don't even get that much fruit. 2 strawberries worth at most. The scrambled egg wrap was dry and I had to drown it in hot sauce to finish it. Especially for the price, I would not come here again.
