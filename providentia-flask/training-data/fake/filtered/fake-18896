"The best pizza in NYC" I was told by my friend. The Sicilian is trice baked for extra crispyness it was claimed. The old timer that the boys behind the counter were calling 'Bernie' had other ideas. Afronted at the suggestion the blackened mess masquerading as a pizza was a bit carbon heavy he declared "That's how is comes, that's the Sicilian, you don't like it, get something else" Several regulars on our side of the counter confirmed that was not in fact how it comes. Bernie by name, Burny by nature. Old timer just fucked it up and was serving nothing but bad attitude. The knowing looks from his fellow crew which he was oblivious to told their own story. Can't cook BS Bernie aside, the margarita was decent, although I wasn't wowed. Artichoke far too creamy for my liking but that's just personal taste I guess. Nothing to make it stand out from he plethora of dollar a slice joints in the near vicinity.
