This place sucks! After waiting for slightly less than an hour during which i was kicked off a stool twice for someones "friend" i was "rewarded" with the unspectacular mac n cheese trio, a horrendously over salted and way over cooked and utterly disrespected piece of meat on the cafeteria burger which i ordered RARE.  This place literally made me puke halfway through the meal.  If you have any taste buds or a modicum of actual taste or even character you will skip this dump or if you don't want to get fuckin' sick off of crappy old meat over-salted and overcooked to disguise its rancidity.  Also servers are indifferent and snobbish. This place sucks and everyone needs to know it.
