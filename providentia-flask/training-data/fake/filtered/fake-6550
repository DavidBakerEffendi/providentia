This place is awesome for real tacos and drinks with friends. When it's warm we go there 4 or 5 times a month and sit outside, but when it gets cooler we sit inside. It can get a little loud and on occasion I thought the tacos had a little too much seasoning, but every other time I've left so pleased. LOVE that the food is fresh and even the margaritas are made with fresh stuff.
