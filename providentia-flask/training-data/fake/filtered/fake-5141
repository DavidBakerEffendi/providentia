My family had dinner there the other night and it was fantastic!  Since there were so many rave reviews about the pizza, we ordered the Margherita and Sausage for appetizer.  We were not disappointed.  The pizza is delicious -- not greasy, pure tomato taste and wonderful crust.  I ordered the Chicken Valdostano  and ate every bite.  My very critical husband had something with Rock Shrimp and didn't say a word as he devoured the food.  Kids loved the spaghetti and meatballs and the bread.  Great service, friendly atmosphere.. I couldn't have asked for more.  I am planning to have my mother's 70th Birthday party there. I know she'll be pleased.
