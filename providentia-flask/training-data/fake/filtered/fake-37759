I had Two take out from Brick Lane and they disappointed me both time. First time I got Chicken Tikka  Masala and Alo Gopi Masala. Second  time we tried with chicken bhuna and dal tadakka. The chicken in the chicken tikka masala was soft and juicy but had only five small pieces for $18 and the gray is loaded with heavy cream and butter. It is a heart cloger. aloo gopi masla had also lot of butter and sour cream with  chilli paste. Dal tadakka was better compared with others and it  was tasty but it had lot of green chilies even though I asked for mild.  Indian foods should be healthy food and should not use so much dairy products and chilies to this extent in the name of British recipe. It is worse than fast food. Next time order without any butter and heavy cream.
