Awesome decor, super friendly hostess, good start! On a Wednesday night the restaurant was packed, we were seated promptly even though our party was not complete. Server was very knowledgable and told us about a 40 day dry aged ribeye that sounded so good we could not resist. We started off with croquettes with truffle that were outstanding, melted mozzarella cheese in the center. Kale salad was crisp and the tahini dressing gave it a nice sweetness. With the ribeye (worth every penny, we payed $90 for it, but was big enough for the 4 of us) we also shared their Mac & cheese which was super creamy and crispy on top. We ended the meal with Nutella doughnuts and there caramel budino which were both amazing. Great work baker & co, I will be back soon.
