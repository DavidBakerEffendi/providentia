I've been a couple of times and both times it was great.  Good for groups and the service was friendly and attentive. Went to dinner both times, first time with a large group of people for a friends birthday and second time with a smaller group.  Both experiences were great and the food was fantastic.  They handled the large group well (always had a drink handy!) and all the food dishes were good.  We ended up sharing a bunch of dishes and each one I had tasted good.  Second time went with a smaller group of a couple of friends and had a relaxing dinner.  Had the Pad See Ew with Mussels, which was very tasty and not an overload, which I liked since usually when you get Thai, I feel like I've overeaten afterwards. Would definitely recommend to friends to check out if interested in a trendy, upscale Thai place with great food and service!
