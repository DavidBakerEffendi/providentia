After learning that this place will deliver to Florham Park - I will never order from another pizza place again. BEST PIZZA next to Brooklyn!  Crust is fantasticly crispy!  Salads, and rolls are also delicious.  I have never been to the restaurant physically but from the quality of the food from delivery I can imagine it is also amazing.
