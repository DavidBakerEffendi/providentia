Went here today.  My daughter is a vegetarian and had pasta which she said was wonderful.  However, this place used to be a Charlie Browns.  Ordered the steak sandwich.  It was awful!!    I never complain but this time I did.  The waiter called over the manager, Brian, who was very nice.   This place has potential but really needs some work.   The atmosphere is nice but the food...well....needs some improvement.  I would go back but only because the manager is so nice!!
