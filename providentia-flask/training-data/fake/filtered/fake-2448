You can't stay in business as long as Dante's without great food and service.  Add some ambiance, and you have an all around terrific dining experience.  Dante's marinara is the best I've ever tasted.  If I could have ordered a bowl of it with some garlic bread, I would.  Actually, I probably could, but there's too many other delicacies I'd have missed.  Whatever you order will be perfectly cooked, and the portions are not skimpy like some "northern" Italian venues.  Plan to spend some time here - this is not a meal you'll want to rush through.
