We sat at the bar & had a wonderful lunch! First time there from CA and blew my expectations away...had an incredible 3 hour lunch with a Peter Michael chardonnay, champagne & coffee! Had their special w soup & their signature burger w bacon mayo! It's a 'take you're time' kind of place...which we love!
