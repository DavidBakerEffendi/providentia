I'm not sure if this place deserves one star...I went with my husband tonight to get some dinner.  We ordered two specialty rolls, chirashi, and tamago sushi.  The rolls were tasteless, the fish was tasteless (tuna was especially fishy in a bad way), and the portion sizes were very small. The tamago was not what we expected at all.  For the amount of money we spent...I couldve gotten much better at sakura express. Definitely not worthy of a return visit.
