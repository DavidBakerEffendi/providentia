First Spaghetti and meat balls you can get anywhere,so if that's your taste this is not the place. Let us begin with the appetizers Fried Asparagus in an obscene butter sauce, Sauteed Escarole and or Spinach, Mussels in red or white sauce ,or as we say here in Philly Gravy. Moving on to the main courses a Veal chop to die for,Lobster Francaise and Chicken Sicilian just to name a few of our favorites, however, the other menu selection's expose some real hidden treasures. Combine all this with the excellent wait staff and a good Chianti And this is the reason my wife and I travel to 936 South 9TH street from Fenwick Island Delaware to experience a true taste of Italy.
