Great place for a business lunch/dinner. The quality of food is great. The quality of sushi was amazing. I've never tasted fish as fresh as at this place. The stuff is more formal than friendly, but the service was great and all of us had a great experience at this place. Highly recommended. Especially for NYorkers who understand how to distinguish good from very good ;-)
