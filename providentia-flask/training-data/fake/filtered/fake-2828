Being Cuban and having heard of this restaurant for quite a while now I decided to go today with a friend and was totally disappointed. My friend had the lechon asado (roast pork) and I had the boliche (pot roast) both came with a side of the worst white rice I have ever had all sticky and tasteless and black beans that I swear came out of a plain Goya beans can. Very disappointing experience.
