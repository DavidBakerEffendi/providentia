Went here for happy hour and was nothing buy disappointed. The chicken lettuce wraps were otherwise known as "mystery meat" extremely fatty chicken if you even want to call it that. Â The garlic shrimp were straight out of the freezer, way overcooked and mushy, stale garlic bread and the sushi was below par. I have to say the $3 drafts were a good steal and the decor of the place was nice but I wouldn't eat here to save my life.
