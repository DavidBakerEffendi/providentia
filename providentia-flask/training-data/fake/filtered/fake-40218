Well what can I say that havn't allready been said for this small family owned place. Other then the fact that there is allways a line because the pizza is an amazing exp. it is as good as it gets. When you have had Di Fara no other pizza that I had at least even comes close. A real must for all newbies in the brooklyn New York area
