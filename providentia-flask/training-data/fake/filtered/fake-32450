Right off the bat we had reservations for 8pm and were told rather rudely by the hostess/waiter/owner Mario we might have to wait about 20-30 minutes I was not happy I asked if we could wait at the bar and was no it was occupied with someone eating there. This restaurant is really small and we had to wait by the front door the alternative was waiting outside in the freezing cold. Mario came back about 10 minutes later and offered a small table by the bar that had become available we accepted just to get out of the front door. We were offered the specials but never asked if we wanted drinks so I had to flag someone down to place a drink order. I ordered the stuff clams and for the entree the fruiti di mare which were good my fiancée ordered the mozzarella and the pasta with sausage and broccoli which she really didn't  care for. We needed to flag someone down for just about everything drinks, desserts and the check so overall the food was ok but not worth the hassle of having to grab someone just to get basic service. This establishment would be served with just hiring a real waiter and letting Mario go to an office hopefully off site and let someone who knows what they are doing to manage the front of the house.
