Great food, staff and service most of the time. I love the salads and the staff here loves the pizza and to eat there whenever possible. We also like that Ziggy's uses local products such as McNamara Dairy (milk and meat), Cabot, North Country Smoke House and others. Not only the best but supports our local economy.
