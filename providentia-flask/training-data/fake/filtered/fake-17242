This is my favorite place to eat!  I admit, I am a usual and just recently they started DELIVERING!  how amazing? a diner that delivers! This diner has been here for over 30 years and they are 24 hours!  doesnt get better than that! They have also recently added pizza!  The delivery and dine-in is amazing! the food is awesome. the service is great and I love that this is a family business so its always a warm welcoming feeling.  Anything you want, they make.  this place gets an A+ from all Newarkers.. Oh, and you have to try their cheesecake!
