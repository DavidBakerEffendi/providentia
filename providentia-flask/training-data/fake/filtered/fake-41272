My girlfriend treated me to Cafe Luluc for my birthday and suggested that I order the pancakes.  When the waiter came out with these two beautiful humongous fluffy pancakes topped with fresh strawberries, my mouth dropped! Those were by far the best pancakes that I'd ever had. They tasted exactly like "panned cakes" I could have easily spread frosting on top and sang happy birthday and that would have been one delicious cake! The  prices and service was even great! It's definitely a cute and intimate place to have a nice conversation.
