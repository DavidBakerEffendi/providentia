Came in here on Monday night after going to their competitor around the corner, Cavanaughs Rittenhouse. The server was not only friendly and out going, she provided phenomenal service. Â She checked on me before my beer hit the bottom of my glass, made sure my food was okay, and I wasn't waiting for a menu or a check for more than I needed to. The food was decent. Had I decided to wait at Cavanaughs, I would have probably been still waiting on my menu by the time I was already finished at the Wrap Shack. Anyone who goes here and has a choice of server, I recommend "princess patel", as the receipt states.
