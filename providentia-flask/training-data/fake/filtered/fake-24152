I am a fan! I have no idea as to whether or not the Ramen is "authentic" to the region it purports or if it's like someone's "mother" used to make. What I do know is that Â the Shoyu Ramen is delicious. The noodles have a nice bite and the broth is smooth, rich, and deeply flavorful. I like the fact that the veggies are plentiful. I've tried the others, but I find the flavor, consistency, price and the quality of the food at Minca to be unmatched. I also like the fact that the waitstaff and other employees are always very friendly.
