Love this place. It's not a typical sushi restaurant. I have been looking for the authentic, country/home style Japanese and finally arrived here. A bit pricier compare to what I can get in Japan, but for the volume, for the service, and for the fact that they even air freight some of their key ingredients from Japan, it's a great price. Unlike other Japanese restaurants, this place would please diverse clientele. hands down, 5 stars!
