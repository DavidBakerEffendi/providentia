Visited on a Monday night 6 pm and wife and I had place to ourselves. We walked up and down Mulberry Street with no particular Rest. in mind and chose Benito One by size of menu. Huge Huge selections offered-All Italian of course. Place is quaint and music heard was a tape of Judy Garland singing Broadway hits which kind of startled us, but its in diference was okay with us. Huge wine selection offered and very reasonable $7 a glass or $24 bottles offered. Homemade Sangria on menu. Whole Baked little neck clams cooked with very good seasoning and juicy. Fresh Stuffed shells with Ricotta and Spinach saw 8 come out hot and melted fresh mozzarella per order. Veal Parm nice with Al Dente Penna in homemade sauce (chunks of tomato) also very good. Wife raved about 2 meatball side order filled with garlic and fresh ingredients. A must !! The place is nothing to rave about-but good choice to save money and not get stuck at touristy New York places which are plentiful in this area. We saw gluten free on menu but we were unconcerned on that and went with extra gluten homemade fresh. Extremely polite Wait Staff and no wait problems on food, but remember, we were only ones there, until we were leaving, the place got busier. $64 bill +tip for plenty food and soda. Saved Dessert for Ferraro's around corner. Would travel back again-but might be better places to be had. Luck of the draw. 6 page food menu though offers much.
