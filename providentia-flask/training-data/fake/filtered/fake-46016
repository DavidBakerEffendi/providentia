I went to The Trading Post last night for dinner and drinks.  I grew up around the corner from this place and had my Sweet 16 party there when it was The Yankee Clipper.  The re-vamp is unbelievable and the food was delicious, only to be topped by the fabulous service and friendly staff.  I highly recommend this place and will definitely be going back soon.
