Unexpectedly walked in for a late, take-out lunch and was very pleasantly surprised.  Young man gave me a break on the timing of the Lunch Special and then offered to make my special order personally.  Even had brown rice!  Delicious food, fabulous service.  Great website ordering, too.  I'll definitely be back!!
