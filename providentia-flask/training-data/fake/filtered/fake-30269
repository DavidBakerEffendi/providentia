They just opened up here in Westville and I just had to try them out because they are pretty much in my apartment buildings courtyard, Wintergreen Apartments of Westville.   I had their grilled athenian pizza and it was amazing.  I did not know what to expect from a grilled pizza but its my new favorite!  My room mate had the philly cheese steak and said it was the best in New Haven as well.
