I will say one positive thing about BSBH; the beer selection was pretty impressive. Beyond that, I see no real reason to come back here and several reasons to flat out avoid the place altogether. The service was poor from the minute we walked in; we stood up front waiting for several minutes for someone to show us to a table. Once seated, it was quite a while before anyone deigned to take our drink orders. Everything just got slower from there, with our second beers not arriving until the end of our meal and our having to ask twice for the check. The restaurant was not remotely crowded and our server did not appear overly burdened with tables, so I'm not entirely sure why everything took so long. The food was plain old bad, particularly for the price. My fried chicken was in fact two smallish chicken tenders with sickly-sweet sauce on top. The mashed potatoes and broccoli were both soggy and cold by the time the plate showed up. All for a princely sum of $18. The strength of the beer menu might be enough for me to sit at the bar for happy hour at some point, but I will most definitely not come back here for dinner.
