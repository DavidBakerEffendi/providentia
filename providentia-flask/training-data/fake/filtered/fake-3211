This place is by far the best Brazilian restaurant in the East Coast; I'd say it is even better than Fogo de Chao of Atlanta, Philly, and Miami, not to mention the old Porcao. I had been to Fernandes probably 50 times before I moved to Atlanta and each experience had been great. The number of Â choices for meat, drinks, and dessert is great. Food and service quality is top notch. Highly recommended.
