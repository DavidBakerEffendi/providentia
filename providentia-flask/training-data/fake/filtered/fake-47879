My friend drove from NY and I from RI to meet up for a late lunch. She found it on Yelp and chose it because she saw so many good reviews. We got there around 3:30 and had to kill time because they don't open until 4:30. The language barrier IS a problem - I am from the school of thought that servers should be able to tell me what is in the dish and understand what I do not want in it and it was frustrating that neither of the 2 women waiting on us did not understand. We ordered Shrimp Pad Thai to share - it had 4 shrimp on top and was the gummiest, blandest most boring Pad Thai I have ever had. My friend enjoyed her curry (?) dish. I do not want to ever go back.
