The atmosphere had a lovely neo-soul vibe. It was a nice trip back in time to the late-nineties/New Millennium Brooklyn that so many artists who lived here at that time are nostalgic for. Â The service was very friendly, if a bit confused and disorganized at times. The food was definitely above average, but it was not the mind-blowing experience I would expect from a soul food restaurant of this caliber in this area. I am glad I had the experience, but I can't say I'll become a regular.
