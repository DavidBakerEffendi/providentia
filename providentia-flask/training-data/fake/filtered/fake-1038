I recently had the pleasure of dining at Cafe 72 with friends and family. I felt immediately right at home the minute I walked through the doors. The new owners are very down to earth and super nice guys. It is a small, quaint place with seating for approximately 60 people. It is BYOB, so we started off relaxing with a nice bottle of wine. The staff was quick to assist and were there within minutes with a bucket to keep the bottle chilled. The food was phenominal!! We all ordered something different and sampled a little of each others. I had the italian chicken which was wonderful! The crab cake, chicken parm and italian meatloaf dishes are equally as good. My compliments to the chef!! I will definitely be a returning customer, but next time I would like to try breakfast as that is my favorite meal of the day. Hurry up, what are you waiting for??? This is the place to eat!!!
