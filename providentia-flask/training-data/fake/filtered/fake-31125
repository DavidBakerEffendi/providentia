I really love Romeo's!  I am always going there for the dinner specials on the weekends and pizza and salads during the week.  I have 4 kids and they are always asking for Romeo's.  My husband and I go often to eat on the dine in side and the service is always superb.  They give you the bruschette with your drinks and bread, so if you are starving you have something to eat right away.  We went last night and there was a wait and that is a good sign.  The owner is always there walking around to see how everything is.  I love the fact that it is family owned and we always are treated special.
