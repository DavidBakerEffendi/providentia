My coworker treated me to a lovely birthday dinner at Confessional, and I think I've found my new "must-try" suggestion for friends. First, I love how the whole theme of the restaurant is sexy - from the specialty cocktails (deliciously handcrafted) donned with suggestive names, to the "confessional" board, which prompts customers to spill their secrets with some chalk. As you can imagine, this really gets you thinking and spurs some interesting conversation! The decor is also really cool - interesting art pieces scattered throughout the restaurant, neat chandeliers and a dark, candlelit vibe that pairs perfectly with the great playlist. Beyond that, the whole operation is supported by some great food. Amazing tapas and plates to share, and a reasonable but tasty wine list. While still really new, I have a feeling this is going to be an East Village hot spot very soon and I'm excited to go back to check out the rest of the menu.
