The Pilgrim Diner, what can I say!  Starting with the hostesses and hosts.  Inappropriate dress, boobs hanging out on specific two girls, one who claims she is the  owner and looks like a  transvestite, and one who looks like a hippie with boobs going south.  One hostess or wanna hostess, comes to mind.  Thinks she's at the beach.  Hell, what happened to dress code.  My waitress fell asleep before taking my order, must  be on crack.  Now lets talk about appearance and ambiance.  This rates no stars at all.  In fact I think that we shouldn't have even given one star.  The whole diner is a disgusting dirty mess.  Falling apart more likely.  The booths are all torn, the tables are worn , chairs in dining room sticky, stools on the counter, look like you'll take a tumble, especially when I weigh only 100 lbs.  Bathroom need an overhaul.  Men and woman's bathroom need ceilings.   Waitress should really stand by the customers ito see if they could service them better.  Let's go into the proper language barrier.  I never heard so many curse words, not only from the staff, but from the owners also.  Aren't they suppose to be role models.   Personally I think that the whole diner needs to be torn down, and new help should be hired.    The ones they looked used and abused. Food, wouldn't recommend it to any one.  Ordered  grilled chicken, was dry as a bone. Also people, check your checks.  One particular waitress, who does most of the takeout order, needs to retire.  How old is she?   Every one should take a bath there, everyone.  The health department should come in for a good check, even with the people who work there.
