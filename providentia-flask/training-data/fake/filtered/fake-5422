Mgmt values table space more than customer loyalty Due to the cramped space and crowds, they barely let you finish and ask you to leave the table! Incredible. Everything about it was average, but tolerable, but the worst were the house rules. They have wierd rules: you can make reservations only for 6 or more, and they expect everyone to arrive together. If some members of the party arrive earlier than rest, they do not allow to seat at the table, unless all arrive!! Stay away on busy weekend nights or be prepared to eat slow-cooked food at fast-food pace! We went this Saturday night, and faced the brunt of all those rules. Will not go back again.
