Llama Tooth has one of the best outdoor dining spaces I've spent time in in Philly. At night, when seated on the patio, strings of lights flow across the table umbrellas and it's really a relaxing and fun setting to be enjoying your food and drink. This place has a great atmosphere inside and out, as the indoor dining room has a real cozy yet elegant feel to it. I had the ahi tuna and I can't stress enough how perfectly crafted this dish was. I was thoroughly satisfied. Also of note, the beer list is quite extensive and features notable brews from around the U.S. as well as real local gems. Impressive to say the least. Â Craft lovers take notice! This is definitely a place not to be missed.
