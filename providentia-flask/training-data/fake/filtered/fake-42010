I ordered delivery to a place that had been under water during hurricane Sandy and is currently in the middle of rebuilding. The delivery guy showed up on time and was nice. But when I got back to my post and opened the bag there were no utensils.i didn't think It was big deal so I called back explained what happened and asked if they could send someone back so I could eat my meal. They said they couldn't do that even thou there delivery guy was less then a mile away.
