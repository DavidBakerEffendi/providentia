Food was OK...service was terrible and it was not crowded.  My wife made it clear to the waiter she did not want anything fried so he suggested something and it came out fried.  Told the server I wanted to see the waiter...he never showed.  My wife ended up trading her dinner with my friends dinner. They have pitchers of sangria that have no or very little alcohol...the waiter should tell the customer..we did not realize it was a BYOB until it was too late. I'll never go there again
