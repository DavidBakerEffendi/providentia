I was excited to go to New Socials after reading the reviews.  I liked the looks of the restaurant when we drove up.  I mention these things to let you know I went in with a positive attitude. There was only one other party there and don't you know they decide to put us right next to them!  This is a pet peeve of mine;  I don't want to listen to other people and  vice versa.  When we asked for another table they honored our request.   Our server, Michael, was very pleasant.  Actually he was the best part of our visit. It was Burger Day so we ordered accordingly.  In view of the fact that there was only one other table I thought it took a long time to get our order.  When we did my fries were cold.  The burgers were in such big, stale, cold buns that the contents were overshadowed by all the bread.  I had to take half the bun off for it to be edible.  BTW, I did get some hot fries when I was finished with my burger but they were soggy and over salted. When we got our check we saw that we were changed for a side that Michael had listed as an option with the burger.   When we mentioned this he acknowledged his error but did not take the charge off the check. To sum up in one word.........disappointing!!
