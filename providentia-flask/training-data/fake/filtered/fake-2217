I was having a bite to eat at gaia when lisa j and her rude fiancé were dining.  gaia is a small authentic italian eatery.  I personally think it is one of the best kept secrets in manhattan.  too inexpensive for the fresh handmade dishes.  when you order there is a sign that lets you know before ordering that the dishes come as gaia thinks they should be served as well as the fact there are only 2-3 people working at any given time... and they are delicious.  she does not offer substitutions or changes to her menu.  lisa j's rude companion asked for parmesan cheese to put on top of his fish.... a big no no in italy and gaia did not offer it.  that is the beauty of owning your own restaurant... you have the ability to say no and stand behind it.   not only did this douche bag keep saying " you don't know who i am"  to gaia... as if that mattered.  trust me when you have to say thing like that.... you are not anybody.  he claimed he ran a 4.5 star italian restaurant and that she was rude and just kept on with the rudeness.  he did however finish his entire meal and then just threw $5 on the counter... and walked out without paying for his meal.  when gaia went out of the store to ask him to pay... he flipped her the middle finger and kept up with the "you don't know who i am" .   then has the audacity to write a review skewed to make him look like the victim.  i can tell you one thing.... no one wants to "know who you are"  you are just a bully... i am sure he has probably shown that bullying side to you as well lisa.  get wise... dump this man and pay your bills. i will say that gaia has a thriving business and mostly with repeat customers... we love her and her restaurant. r.
