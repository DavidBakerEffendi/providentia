Kochi is a good place to sample Kerala Cooking.  Visited after a friend of ours recommended it after seeing it listed in Malayala Manorama.  The ambiance is subtle with Indian Chimney Lamps used for fishing and traditional Indian decor.  The Chicken Varutharachathu with the Garlic Naan was nicely done.  The butter milk here is the real thing. You can taste the green chillies, ginger and curry leaves.  We rounded off our meal with a great Payasam for dessert.  On the pricey side, but service, food, and the presentation makes it worth the money.
