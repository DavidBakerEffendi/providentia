I stopped into Wheeler's on my way home yesterday. They did a great job remodeling this place from the previous lunch spot. They have a very nice but smaller sandwich and salad menu. I think definitely the way to go when starting out. I had a nice roast beef sandwich with blue cheese on ciabatta. Sandwich came with a side item, one guy suggested the curry french fries. I found out later the guy was one of the owners. They told me the menu items are all house made and local produce used. While I was waiting for my sandwich, they offered me to try their version of bread pudding, I've never tried it before, but was definitely a fan. They topped it with house made vanilla sugar, first I've seen it used besides on a television program like Top Chef. I would definitely recommend Wheeler's and wish these guys all the best of luck for a success
