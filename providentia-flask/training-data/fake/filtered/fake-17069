Awesome food and great bar scene however I am disappointed they took a few items off the menu including the Pollo picanta which is insane!  They have made it for me recently upon request which goes to show you how good the customer service is.  Bartenders are very personable and the DJ late night is pretty good. Five stars hands down as far as Cuban places go.
