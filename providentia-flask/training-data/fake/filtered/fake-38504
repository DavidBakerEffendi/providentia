Disappointed-I wish I had spoke up this morning...My single slice of sausage was not hot and undercooked in the middle (I hope I don't get sick!) My oatmeal was good, but just made me want to made it more for myself at home-I loved the idea of figs and bourbon and steel cut oats, but for $7 it is silly. Â I could have easily made sausage, tasty oatmeal and coffee in my own home for a few dollars instead of the $18 I spent, with tip. Had to wait for my credit card to be taken too...The real plus is watching food be made and one of the cooks spoke with me and was very nice- I just wish I had been honest when he asked how everything was..
