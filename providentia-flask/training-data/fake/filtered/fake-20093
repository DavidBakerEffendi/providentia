If you value your health please do not eat at this restaurant it is absoulty disgusting!!  I went in yesterday to order dinner and as I was waiting I decided to read the free Newspapers they provide on the counter and to my disgust  as I picked up the paper two roaches ran out from underneath , I actually jumped back and screamed as I wasn't expecting to see that. One of the waitreses noticed how scared i was and I told her there are roaches on your counter!  I ran out of there so fast never to go back again.
