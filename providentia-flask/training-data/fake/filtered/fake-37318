This was my first time visiting Baoburg, and was very excited to try these unique and original Asian European cuisine. This cozy intimate restaurant located in the heart of north Williamsburg was worth the trip, the staff was very friendly and the waiter made some great recommendations, but I wanted to try everything on the menu. My girlfriend and I choose to go with the Truffle fries and glazed chicken made with a maple flavor and soy sauce combination and chicken empanadas that we shared. I know for the next time to order 2 of those dishes cause it was so delicious I really did not want to share with my girlfriend..lol. Then we ordered the short ribs, this was also very tasty and the meat was very juicy and full of flavor. We ended our meal with the chocolate lava cake and a chocolate cream crape with ice cream. I will definitely go back to try the other items on the menu, and might live the girlfriend home, so It more food for me to enjoy...:) I also had the pleasure of meeting Chef Bao, she's a young and very talented chef with some cutting edge ideas for all food lovers, I'm looking forward to my next meal at Baourg.
