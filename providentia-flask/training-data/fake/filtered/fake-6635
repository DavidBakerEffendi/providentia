It has to be coincedent (or not! hmmm..)  when this restaurant suddenly got unfavorable reviews at the same time.  Frankly... if u r looking for another opinion please visit gooutjersey.com /2007/04/114 My family have been going to Thai Essence since they opened in 2005.  Everything has been very consistantly great here both food and service with modern decor. My son loves their spring rolls and pad thai We love Thai Orchid as well.  Also Topaz Thai in Belleville... love their mango and sticky rice... can't wait to have Thai food again!
