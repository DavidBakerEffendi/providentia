The hype surrounding this restaurant only made our mediocre experience more disappointing.  We love great food and were really hoping this place would land on our favs list.  Unfortunately, it did not. A couple comments first on the decor, since many others have mentioned it.  We used to frequent the restaurant when it was Washington Square and thought the layout, outside of some upgraded cosmetics, did not appear signficantly different.  This is not to say that the atmosphere is unenjoyable (it is). At least they retained the best elements of the prior place. But now to the food.  The first course was good -- a tasty veal sweetbread.  I do not eat them often enough to be an expert, but enjoyed it nonetheless. We ordered a lobster pie and a lamb dish for the main courses.  The first big complaint -- barely warm food.  The server did not come back to check on our meals so we had no opportunity to express our issue.  They were cold before we could finish them. But even if the food would have been warmer, the actual taste was unexceptional.  The lobster pie sauce was fairly bland, although the crust was enjoyable.  The lamb was similarly bland and, strangely enough, overdone.  Its accompanying squash was not cooked enough. We had the cheese plate for dessert, which was the highlight of the evening.  The pairings were well-chosen and the layout of the cheeses carefully thought, so that the most intense flavors were at the end.  This exceptional cheese plate prevented a one-star rating. We're willing to give the place another try, but with its steep cost we're definitely going to try some other options in town first.
