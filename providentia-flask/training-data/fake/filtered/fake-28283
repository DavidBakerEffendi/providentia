Food is good but the hostess(possibly the owner) is rude. Anyway if your in the area I highly recommend it. All the fish is fresh and well prepared. They even have horta as an appetizer which is hard to find in greek restaurants around here. For apps I recommend Fried calamari, octopus, and a plate of tzatziki with pita.(note: I ordered the beets here and they sucked). I never got any meat dishes here so I cant comment on them, but if you are in kyclades and you order meat in a place that specializes in fish, shame on you anyway.(get the red snapper)
