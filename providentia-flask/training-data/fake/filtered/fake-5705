My favorite cheese steak place in Philadelphia. Real cheese instead of cheesewiz. Dalessandro's is not stingy with their meat. There is plenty of meat inside the bread so it's not primarily bread. They take the time to melt the cheese on the meat instead of slapping slices of cheese on the bread and then meat on top. The meat is well cooked. And you can ask for toppings on top.  You will get a healthy cheese steak just the way you like  it. No matter how busy it gets, they are pretty quick with their service.
