Don't go to this restaurant unless you are willing to be taken advantage of. I ordered a Veal Cutlet sandwich off the lunch menu. The price was clearly stated as $9.50. When the bill arrived, the amount on the check was $11.50 which I pointed out to our waitress. She went to check out the problem, and upon her return, informed me that "it did state $9.50 on the menu but the manager said prices are subject to change". Â She also mentioned that they are printing new menu's and that would be the price on the new menu. I was floored!!. Told her "they should honor the prices printed", her response was "I asked the mgr. and was told that is the price". Nobody came over, so I paid the bill and will not go back there. In my years of eating in restaurants, I have never encountered a situation such as that.
