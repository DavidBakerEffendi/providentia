If you like breakfast, a big breakfast, with the usual choices and some not so usual choices, Penny Cluse if for you.  You get more than you can eat at an inexpensive price. I had the smoked salmon with chevre cheese on a toasted baguette.  A large portion of salmon on a toasted, yet soft baguette coated with a good portion of chevre cheese.  Plenty of red onion and tomato on the side.  Expect to wait for seating.
