This place looks, smells and tastes like the result of an outstanding creative endeavor of three very talented and friendly people, the founders of Thirsty Koala! To say the food and service is excellent will have to be an understatement. Great deal of attention is paid to detail and not a stone unturned to make sure everything is as perfect as can be. I happen to be a vegetarian and was pleasantly surprised to see the well rounded out menu, from appetizers to deserts to serve the ever growing veggie community as well. The veggie mixed Beans Chili is out of this world and one of my favorite desert is Vegan Panacotta...... but I'm planning to work my way up all the way to the top of the list and try all of them. Highly recommend this place!
