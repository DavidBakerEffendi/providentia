IMHO "Wohoo! As good as it gets!" for Thai in New York. I generally walk by Thai, because it all seems the same, I know some die hard enthusiasts would disagree, but if you like places like Num Pang, Joe's Shanghai, WD 50, then you eat like me and will love this place. I see a lot of bad reviews for delivery, but I never get delivery in NYC (yes, my friends think I'm weird) so can't comment on that. We've eaten all over NYC (and the US) never having this type of food. Chef Hong helped us order, the menu changes, but we had corn chowder, beet broth soup (I wanted to bottle it up and take it home), fries (I disagree with the person who said they are common, they definitely have a a twist. I don't like normal sweet potato fries. I liked the shape of the fries, the ratio of batter to sweet potato, didn't really didn't need the sauces, but enjoyed the curry mayo the best, and I'm not a fan of mayo). Â  We had the beef jerky, tasty, but didn't blow my mind. Finished with the duck curry, which was not a disappointment. Chef Hong said it best last night, when we asked what to order, it depends what you are in the mood for. After sitting at the counter and watching them cook with passion, we are definitely going back for the burgers and the pot pie. I can't imagine horrible service there, so I'm guessing the people who wrote the reviews are in the minority. Everyone there was smiling and acknowledged by Chef Hong as they left last night.
