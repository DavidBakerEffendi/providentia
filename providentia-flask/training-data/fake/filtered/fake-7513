It seems every time I am in Â SOHO to shop I have to come to eat here. I simply love it! I will not venture to try anything else period. Which drives my husband even more crazy than my spending habits. We've had breakfast, lunch and dinner here and always enjoy it. The only con is it's hard to get in, you need to make reservations well in advance, but you won't be disappointed. There is also a bakery next door that has pastries and sandwiches that also gets very busy but worth the wait. If you're in SOHO it's worth a stop.
