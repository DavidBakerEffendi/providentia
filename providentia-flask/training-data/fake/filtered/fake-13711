When you think Pizza you automatically think of two places, New York or Italy. Well prepare for that to change. One trip to Juliana's and when you think of Pizza, that's all you will think of. Brooklyn's Finest! The food was savory, the atmosphere cozy and the service fast and friendly. After you satisfy your hunger with their pizza you have to make sure to top it off with one of their homemade Brookie deserts! YUM!
