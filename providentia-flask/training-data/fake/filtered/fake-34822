Snubbed by the General Manager on the phone. Their phone skills and level of hospitality are severely lacking. Tried to attend Easter Brunch but reservation was cancelled on me as there was no credit card on file (my fault). When the manager called to alert me, I was cut off from telling her I was unable to give the number at that precise moment but would call back in less than ten minutes. Needless to say, I called back to find no available spots. I hope the reason they are so busy this Sunday is because of their food, because it certainly isn't their hospitality. I understand the premise behind this and why things were done the way they were. I'm a hospitality/restaurant major. However, what this place is lacking is going above and beyond for their guests. They earned themselves a full house on Easter Sunday, extremely commendable. But in me they've lost a potential return guest. It was a place that seemed very appetizing and had they been hospitable on the phone, I would have returned at a later time had I not been able to reserve my Easter brunch seats. However, I will not be dining there Easter Sunday or any other day in the future. And to anyone that asks me about it, I will turn them in the opposite direction. It pays to take care of your guests, potential and returning.
