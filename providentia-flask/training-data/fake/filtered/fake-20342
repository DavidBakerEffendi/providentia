Stingy! stingy! stingy! What a rip-off! We are from MA. We went to Sukhadia's on Feb.19th, Sunday  at 12 noon for lunch. Besides us there were two white women. Otherwise the place was empty. We were visiting this place after three years. We were disappointed to see that there was no buffet. I ordered Gokul thali ($11.99). The food was not even sufficient to satisfy a sparrow! Then I understood why this place was empty while other places on the block like Bombay Talk and Khasiyat were overflowing!  Around 2:30 pm we went to Bombay Talk to pack some food for dinner on the way back to MA. The manager told us that we will have to wait atleast 1 hour! Can somebody enlighten us on what really happened here?
