Food is ridiculously pricey, and that old-timey aesthetic obsession, while perfectly executed, really grates on me. It's like "you know it's not 1920, so why is everyone dressed in bow-ties and suspenders. I bet they even mandate the ridiculous mustaches. The manager when I went there a lot during the World Cup was just a dick. Gave me some attitude when I asked if they could change the aspect ratio so that it was correct and I could enjoy the game, and he acted like this was an insane request. Bartender at the time was super cool/nice though.
