Food is SOOOO delicious here! The beet salad and empanadas are SO yum. Not a huge fan of the transplanted 25 and under demographic of the neighborhood, but worth the trip for such delicious food. Â The backyard is adorable but beware of the bugs that are hungry too. Maybe spray yourself down with something to ward off the bugs if you're going to sit out back.
