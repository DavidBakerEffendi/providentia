This is actual Thai food! The soups are very tasty and as a vegetarian, I felt I had a ton of options to choose from. None of the food we ordered was too heavy, all light, delicious, and obviously fresh. I ordered the Rama, which was amazing. Our waitress was the only one in the whole restaurant for lunch during the week, and she was never neglectful. I would highly recommend this to any person who can appreciate real, well-made Thai food for a GREAT price.
