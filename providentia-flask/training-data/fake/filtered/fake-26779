I have to say, the cheese steaks are good, but I have stopped there twice, for Italian hot dogs and they all ways tell me they are out. If you have it on your menu, you should have it when a customer Oder's it. I could see if it happened once but, again today no hot dogs. there is a giant Â Italian hot dog painted in the window. lol but no dogs at 4 pm. Then to say , ooo sorry this lady just bought 3 doubles. So, last time they gave me an other excuse why the had no dogs. They are very nice people and the steaks are good. But I will not be going back.
