Stay away from this place! Very very disappointing!! Not worth your time and money. Terrible service and food. Nothing great about the menu items. The pancakes...nothing special. My cup of coffee came with red lipstick on it.....GROSS! Â The mexican host was clueless. The place is a joke. It's not run by French people. On that note, you can imagine how serious they are with the business.
