Food was super yummy in our tummy, Our waitress, Jane, was excellent too. Â  The sushi rolls with the cucumber wrap was soooo good. Only down side, I'd recommend not sitting by the door because it gets cold. I keep waking up in the middle of the night after dreaming of dumplings dancing above my head, so I need to go back soon to satisfy my cravings before I go even more crazy.
