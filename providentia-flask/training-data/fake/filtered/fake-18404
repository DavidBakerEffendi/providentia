I have to say I'm in the minority with my experience at this restaurant. We walked in and were seated promptly by a friendly concierge. The section we were seated in had one server but for some unknown reason he completely ignored us and served and chatted with other guests in our section. 12 minutes later a different server who noticed that we were not being helped came over and offered to get us drinks while we waited. We inquired as to who our server was and she volunteered to be our server 'I guess I will be your server' although she was not working that section. She sort of made up for the initial bad experience which was made worse by the same server who ignored us in the beginning started coming to our table to offer assistance but never apologized for us waiting or offered an explanation. I also think they could use some better lighting instead of the candles they use, its pretty hard to read the menus; we saw some ppl using their phones as a reading light. Unfortunately there are too many good restaurants in Philly for me to return to Alma de Cuba.
