This ramen place is fantastic, esp during the cold winter months. This place is very cool and fun. The service is great and very friendly. I liked sitting in one of the big booths. Very cool. The basic ramen with pork belly really hits the spot. The apps were great too. Overall, very well done. I will be returning... hopefully sooner rather than later.
