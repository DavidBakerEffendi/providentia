This place is so cool!! I loveeeeee the d√©cor and the staff is so nice. I also love how spacious this place is! I've only been here twice and the service was always great and the drinks are seriously impeccable!! The twizzler martini has to be my favorite drink! Its soooo delicious. I'm not a big fan of their food though but that's OK. I will still continue to come here for a appetizer and a few drinks. Loyal customer here!
