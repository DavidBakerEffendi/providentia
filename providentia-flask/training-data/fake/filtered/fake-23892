Bridgids is my favorite place to eat and drink. The beer selection is fantastic. While the choices are vast, the draft selection in particular always has special beers that I'm surprised to even find on draft at all in the US. With their new chef they've now also evolved into a wonderful eatery with incredible italian pasta and other dishes. It's now a destination for great food. But really the beer is king here, with wonderful and unique discoveries. While other places have some Belgium and micro beers, I always am thinking "I wish I were drinking beer at Bridgids where they have the best selection of the best stuff." The service is and has always been great. Staff here are real people who Â love beer, love food, and it shows. They are knowledgeable about both, and are looking to help you find what you'll really enjoy. The prices for food are very reasonable, and I think for the quality of beer reasonable there too. At some "fancy" restaurants you can spend more than $10 on a cocktail, but here for less you get the best beer in the world from near and far. Strangely enough it's also extremely kid friendly, where they treat your kids as real people. My 8 year old asks to go, then gets a plate of plain pasta, a bowl of bacon, cranberry juice in a fancy Chimay glass, or whatever he dang well pleases. While the place is great, the wide variety of folks who make their way here are always interesting and fun. The big J shaped bar curves the seats around and encourages the frequent cross-bar conversations and banter that make my day. This combination of things are why you go out to eat and drink. This is a truly unique and wonderful place where I love to bring out of town guests and family...you'll love it to if you give it a try.
