The single star reflects our experience with the hostess/bouncer. We put our names on the list, and with about 50 people ahead of us, went around the corner for a drink. 40 minutes later, we checked back in. There were still several people ahead of us. So we decided to have another drink a couple of doors down. 30 minutes later we were back, and were told we "just missed" being called. Thinking "just missed" meant we'd get the next table, we took a breath, and asked if that were the case. Wrong. The hostess/bouncer informed us we would drop to the bottom of the list, which meant at least another hour wait. WTF?????????? The food may be great, but is putting up with the RAMEN NAZI worth it? Methinks not.
