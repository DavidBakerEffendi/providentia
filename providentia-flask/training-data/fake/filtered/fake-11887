I went to this restaurant with my friend last week and would like to go back for sure.  The restaurant is big in sizes and serves 100-200 people at the same time.  We enjoyed the hostess service which made us feel very friendly.  The portion of the dishes are super big and real family style.  The fresh mozzarella cheese is the best that I have ever tried.  The seafood linguine is exactly the light taste style that I like, wish the clam sauce could be thicker and better a little more salty which will enhance the flavor a little bit.  Dessert is good to share too.  Overall, both me and my friend love this first time experience at this Italian restaurant.
