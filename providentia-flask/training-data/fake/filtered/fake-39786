Excellent food! The Whipped Ricotta Schmear is ridiculous -- sea salt and honey... Â dessert-ish, but not overly sweet. Tuna Tartare w/chili salt -- also amazing. We just did small plates, and it was perfect and super reasonable. John, our handsome and helpful waiter, was lovely and took great care of my friend and her baby and me. Went *beyond* above and beyond! My second time here, and have had great experiences both times. Will come back without a doubt -- a great neighborhood joint.
