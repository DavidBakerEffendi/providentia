OUTSTANDING!!  Visited for the first time with my family and what a great experience. The balsamic calamari with hot peppers was out of this world. I wasn't expecting the crab cakes to be anything special but they were extraordinary. The meals to include the pizzas and calzones were delicious. I watched the cooks working hard and could tell they cared and had a sense of pride in their work. The service was outstanding and the owner was constantly checking to see if each and every table needed anything. The final test...as silly as it may sound, the bathroom was maintained spotless. I can't wait to go back, but may visit the sister restaurant in Denville. Thank you for a great evening of food and ambience with my family!  On a scale of 1-5, this restaurant and the food is a 6!
