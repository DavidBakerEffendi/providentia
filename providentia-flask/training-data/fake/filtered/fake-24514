I head great things about this so coming here I was pretty hyped about it. Its two carts but people flock to taste it. I tried it, and boy was it delicious! I've tried Halal food before, but nothing like this! This really is the best and tastes the best! The portion is big, the cost cheap, and my satisfaction at a high 110%! Its very delicious and you should try it out if you're ever in NYC. If you're a health-conscious, avoid this place. One serving of this food contains a enormous amount of calories, fat, and carbs. Definitely not for good for those trying to lose weight or stay healthy.
