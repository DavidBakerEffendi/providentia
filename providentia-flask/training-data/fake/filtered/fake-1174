Having been to this place many times, I always have great expectations . The food is excellent, and the atmosphere is just perfect to enjoy a great meal with friends and family. However the last time I went things seemed to have changed. The service was good and very helpful however the food took quite a long time to come unlike usual. Meanwhile I was trying to enjoy the meal with my boyfriend and the manager of the restaurant kept leaning over our table doing the job of the waiter when it was done 3 seconds before. She happened to be quite touchy and unprofessional around the customers, and to top that while we were finishing our great meal we both saw something I have never seen in my life while dining. The manager stormed through the restaurant screaming to one of the waitresses about something, making a disturbing and completely inappropriate scene. My boyfriend was so annoyed by this scene he wanted to say something, and on our way out , trying to find her to have a word about the loud scene, we saw her sitting in the bar area in the back, during what we assumed working hours, drinking a cocktail like everything is fine... This is something I have never experienced before in any place I have dined and certainly never in Pylos. As sad as it makes me say this I dont think it is going to be such a habit any more...
