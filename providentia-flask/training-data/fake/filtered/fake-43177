Came here for their grand opening last Friday with the girlfriend and friends and had great time. The transformation of the space from my old haunt in alphabet city, diablo royale, is really nice and had a comfortable but cool vibe. Great selection of beers and ales, also happy to see some locals and IPAs on their drafts. Girls loved their wine and the gold carpet outside - very classy. Will be back for food as Â it looked really good and the dining room was packed.
