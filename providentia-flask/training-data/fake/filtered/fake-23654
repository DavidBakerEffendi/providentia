Excellent decor, atmosphere and vibe.  Deviled Eggs:  awesome.  Ordered the crispy pig ear and skin salad.  The crispy pig ears and skin was great but way, way too much salad dressing; salty.  I would order dressing on the side. They should serve crispy pig ears just as an appetizer with a balsamic vinegar dipping.  Also ordered the hamburger, medium rare, with fries.  Cheeseburger was cooked perfect, love Roquefort but sandwich was salty.  Fries were the best.  The ketchup they carry was vinegary (sorry, use to Heinz).  Overall, I would say food a bit over rated, too salty but great atmosphere.  A must try at least one time. We went on  a Sunday night around 8:00, they said over an hour wait.  Went upstairs, got a seat at the bar, ordered a drink and half way into the drink was seated.  Not a bad wait. As far as being called the spotted pig... it looked like everyone ordered hamburger, which is beef... maybe they should have some kind of ground pork sandwich.
