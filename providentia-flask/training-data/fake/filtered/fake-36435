The hostess, wait staff and manager are the rudest people I have ever encountered in the city! Despite the restaurant being half empty, the hostess refused to seat us at a table with our friend (who had already placed an order). They said they would only seat us all at a table if we all intended to eat (we wanted to have a few bottles of wine, while she ate). The hostess said our only option was that we go next door and drink at their sister bar and our friend could join after she was done her meal. That would mean that us having had to leave our friend to dine alone. Ridiculous. Of course we refused to let our friend sit and dine alone, so we stood there in the doorway as our friend desperately tried to eat as quickly as possible. Even when seating next to our friend at the bar cleared up, we were rudely told, "you cannot sit there". On top of it all, the waitress was also nonexistent.  The manager offered no apology, and actually defended the hostess' behavior.  Only come here if you want to be treated like a second class citizen - they definitely do not encourage walk-in business. What a shame as the food is quite tasty.
