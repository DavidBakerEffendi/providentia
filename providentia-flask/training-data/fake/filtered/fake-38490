I almost enjoyed my dinner there very much.  The salad was good, the fish & sides were very nice, & cooked to perfection.  But as soon as I went to the restroom for a brief break, the waiter swooped in & cleared away half of my dinner!  Even if I had been finished, I would have wanted to take that kind of food home!  I was so mad, it ruined the rest of the evening for me.  It also caused a rift between myself & spouse, since I thought he should have protected my food.  But he was distracted by our guests, & it happened so fast, he missed his chance to protest.  So if you want any amore with your date after eating here, bring a sign with you saying, "DON'T TAKE MY FOOD!"  before daring to visit the toilet.  Or prepare to do battle with aggressive waiters looking to clear you out, or sell you desert.
