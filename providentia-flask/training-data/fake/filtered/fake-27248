The place is okay! I'm there every Fri and Sat I sit in the front bc i like when Jerry abuses me and Sabrina spills drinks on me but that is just me. Enough BS. For the truth I will challenge anyone to show me a place with a menu like theirs in both diversity and quality. If Russillo's is nothing else it is ALWAYS consistent, the same way it was cooked 10 years ago is the same as today. Enzo and Chris will go out of their way to make sure all customers are satisfied, they take their bussiness very seriously and try to preserve all customers. You can have something small and easy like a slice of pizza or a sandwhich or go crazy with some "Shellfish Pescatore" or angel hair pasta! Â By the way I love Sabrina and Jerry!
