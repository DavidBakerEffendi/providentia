This place is the perfect neighborhood-y nice, trendy thins pizza place. the decor makes you feel right at home and comfortable. I especially liked that although it was a small restaurant, they handle groups well and all the food is share-able and the tables are round. Delicious, comfortable, close to home, what can be better? I recommend the veggie pizza!
