My favorite thai place of all time. Love the food there so much. Only problem is when it gets busy it takes you a while to get to the waiters. But the crying noodles are so goooooooood and their mojitos are great. Theres nothing to hate about this place. Love it so much. (been here like 6-7 times) and i keep wanting to come back for more.
