WARNING!  Do not spend your money at this place.  The owner is the rudest a-hole I have EVER met and clearly does not value his customers. The place is a factory and just wants to get you in and out.  We went there so we could sit outside.   They seated us inside in a cramped and very loud room.  When we asked if we could get an outside table (and we were willing to wait)  the owner said if we don't like it we can leave - others want the table.  Clearly we left.  I have eaten there before and the food is NOT worth the long wait and why give your money to someone who does not care about your business.  We will NEVER eat there again I suggest you do the same.  There are too many other great restaurants in Montclair that go out of their way to keep customers happy.
