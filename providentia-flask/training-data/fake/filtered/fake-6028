This is easily my favorite breakfast place in Brooklyn. Great beverages: delish tea, Stumptown Coffee, a daily juice... The soft boiled egg is perfection. Great hangover cure/day-changer. I love that you can get a grits breakfast in a cup and just walk down the street with it. I used to drive my car while eating Scratch breakfast, but then I got overexcited and overly involved in my tasty breakfast and almost rear-ended someone while mid-bite. Now I sit on the bench. But seriously, best eggs in BK.
