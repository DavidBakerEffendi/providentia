Usually when I am going to Japanese restaurant I mainly care about the food. However, this time I was so intrigued about the space ( they have booth for 10 people that contains glass table with white ropes underneath it) that I felt for a second  that  I was not  in New York ( Not sure which vibe I got but  it's defiantly felt like I was part of an Asian movie) The food and the flavors are more close to fusion but the chef 's food and the noodles are defined as pieces of originality( the place is known for making their own noodles) I would suggest to bring a date or a group of close friends that feels comfortable to sit in a place that reminds a flea market and sacred temple at once.
