YUMMY!!! That is the first thing that comes to mind whenever I think about Katsu-Hama. Â My friend introduced me to this place a couple of years ago and it was love at first bite!! I had the full portion of Pork Katsu (which comes with as much rice and sliced cabbage as you can shake a chop-stick at), some hot tea (their green tea is always delicious and fresh) and a Japanese beer. Their Katsu is very light (never overly-greasy) and tender and the breading doesn't fall off when you pick it up. If you are new to eating Katsu, have one of the nice waiters show you which dipping sauce is for what, since it can make a difference in how you actually eat the food (and enjoy it). Their own homemade Katsu sauce is incredible so don't sleep on the sauce! I cannot speak for much else on the menu since that one dish has kept me "coming back for more", all of these years. All I can say is that if you want Katsu- incredible Katsu, then watsu waiting waiting for...go to Katsu-Hama! But...save a bite for me.
