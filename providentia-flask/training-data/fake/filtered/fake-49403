Went for my first time last night and I thought it was pretty good.  Nothing amazing but a good atmosphere and the food was good.  Had the chipotle chicken tacos and they were good.  They make several variations of guacamole which we had 2 different kinds of (comes with fresh made tortilla chips which were really good) and though I'm not normally a fan in general I found that I kept going back for more.  Drinks were relatively expensive but where are they NOT at any respectable place in Philly?  One thing that the girls all liked was an old fashion (beach style) photo booth that they have.  You know the kind where you get 4 black and whites on a strip.  That's kinda cool.  Overall good atmosphere, good food, and decently priced.  I'd go again.
