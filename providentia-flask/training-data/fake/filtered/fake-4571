Always walked by but never came in until a friend recommended this place.  First off, this place is huge...  Never would have known from the outside.  Sat on the second floor which was very cozy.  The waitress greeted us and after chatting found out that they have karaoke and that they serve til 2!!!  We shared a sushi platter and a couple of special rolls which were delicious.  Not an expert sushi eater but what we had tasted very good and very fresh.  Finished with a couple of sake bombs.  Overall, friendly staff and very tasty food.  Will definitely be back!!!
