This might be my favorite cafe in Montclair. The location is great (Church st. is prime) and the shop is a-dorable. The interior is so cute, but let me not stall...the macarons are SO GOOD! Creamy and flavorful, and the choices are so exotic: lavender, rose, green tea, etc. It's a bit on the pricey side, but these treats are not your everyday type. Definitely worth the price. TRY IT! If you love french pastries you WON'T be disappointed.
