I completely agree with the poster to invoked the name of Olive Garden.  I called it the Starbucks of Italian dining. Thumbs down on not having a table for us in spite of our reservation.  And then giving us a high table in the bar area 20 minutes later.  Very loud restaurant with unpleasant music.  The service was okay. Nothing we ordered was horrible, but it was all unremarkable and tasted very mass produced (bland or oversalted).  My pasta...rotini with boar and pear...did resemble a very, very good Hamburger Helper meal.  Too gloppy, no taste of pear, no subtlety.  The portions are large because they could never get away with a smaller ones with the quality of the food. We did not order dessert.  Why did my cappuccino come in a glass, particularly without a handle?  Why serve sugar in the white/pink/blue packets? Really, it is fine.  But why pay this much for Italian in Philadelphia when you can do so much better?
