The food was amazing! and the waitress was super nice and polite. We stayed way past our welcome but didn't feel pressure to leave from the staff. The pizza was extremely good and the toppings original (we ordered a specialty pizza). The atmosphere was casual and the food was extremely well priced. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
