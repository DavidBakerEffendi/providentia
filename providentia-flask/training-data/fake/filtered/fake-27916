I would have said when Eatalia opened that it is a hidden gem. But after being open almost a year and a half, this is the best Italian establishment in the city. Make reservations, just a suggestion, because they are always full when I go during the week. Authentic specials, delicious desserts, and service that is as professional, knowledgeable, and personalized as Barclay Prime and Smith & Wollensky just to name a few of my other favorites. Frank keep up the good work. Hats off to Chef Ernesto and staff. I always recommend friends and they come back raving about Eatalia every time. Try the steak special and homemade pasta. Great job guys!
