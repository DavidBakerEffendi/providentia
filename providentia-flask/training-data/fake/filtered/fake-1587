Was there last night and was extremely surprised with the food quality and amazing service. By far, the best Indian food i had in years!!! Prices are reasonable, and the service is indeed at its best. Chicken Tikka Marsala was amazing. I will highly recommend them to my friends and family. I will be going there more often!!
