I've tried different places all over the city, hands down this is one of the best! its not just that the pizza is so good, its that there is so much of it! the pies are huge so don't expect to finish one off unless there are three or four of you. The staff has always been really nice, the place is chill .but the pizza...sinfully delicious.
