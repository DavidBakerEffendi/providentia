The meat is tiptop, yes. Especially the pulled pork and pork belly. Extremely good. Congratulations, you get a barbecuing metal of honor. Also, the mayos and sauces aren't bad. But the pickled carrots are disappointing. They're not aggressive at all and you don't even taste the bitterness of the carrot. Worst of all, the baguettes are really disappointing. Even when toasted, they have a consistency that is more like pound cake. They are also flavorless -- bad flour ? no salt ? Fire your baker and get a decent one !
