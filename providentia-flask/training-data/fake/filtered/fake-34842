This is the original in the city of originals.  When people move to town they hear the three words repeated like a mantra: New Haven Pizza, and here's where the notoriety began.  For the real deal don't settle for The Spot.  Wait in line and experience Frank Pepe's Pizzeria as it was intended and do yourself a favor and order a clam pie.  Less celebrated seasonal pies appear occasionally and are worth trying.  I know that in this restaurant it is all about the pizza but a better wine selection and a few other beers (even macro Italian brews) would vault Frank Pepe's into an even higher level.  The waitresses are classic and while not exactly friendly they're unapproachability has it's charms.  The white pie with fresh tomato that is available in the summer is one of the best pizzas we have ever tried and the red with grated cheese is the traditional Neapolitan choice the way it was intended.
