I am one of the "bad ass" bikers, who along with his pilot, engineering, attorney, accountant, business owner and doctor buddies who ride motorcycles, in love the Brass Ring.  The food is outstanding, affordable, served fast and in good portion.  Coffee cups are never empty.  Service is attentive even when packed. Rat's and Le Bec Fin are for date night.  Morton's, the Palm and Cafe Aldo Lamberti are for business.  But the Brass Ring is for friends to enjoy good food and good conversations or dads to bond with their children looking at some of the unique cars and bikes in the parking lot.   Despite the unpretentious and casual atmosphere, many of the customers are seen strutting around in their $700 to $1,000 suits.  These are the latest fashions from Andy Goldfine, Olympia, Dianese and Rev'it. On weekends the parking lot is an impromptu miniature car and bike show.  You will see vintage and classic rides with fresh wax and the newest models from Germany, England, Italy, Milwaukee, Detroit and Japan. This place does not disappoint.  And, there is one waitress who has a set of legs that rumor has are insured by Lloyds of London for $1,000,000.   When you are on the road, you eat where the semis are parked.  When you are in country or suburbs, you eat where the bikes and classic cars are parked.  This is rule holds true for the Brass Ring! Why else would motorcyclists travel 50 miles to eat at this place?   A belt loosening experience can be had for $15.
