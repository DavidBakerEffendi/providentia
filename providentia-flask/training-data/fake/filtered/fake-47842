The ambience and decor are nice and get you in the mood until you get the food.  Disgusting.  The noodles were soft and passed their cooking time, the soup didn't have oomph and the chicken in it was fatty, refried, reheated. We didn't finish and had to leave and go somewhere else just to get the bad flavor out of my mind and out of my mouth.  To put it mildly, I've had better Udon.
