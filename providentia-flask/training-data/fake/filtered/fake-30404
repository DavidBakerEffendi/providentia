We previewed the menu beforehand, and were looking forward to a high quality organic gourmet meal.  We entered the restaurant and were welcomed by a warm arsty atmosphere, candles, couches, fireplace, and contemporary black accented by bright colors decor. HOWEVER.  This was quite possibly the worst meal for 2 I have ever spent $55 on.   Everything was lukewarm at best, and covered in salt.  The ricotta eggplant dish was similar to a frozen microwave dinner in quality (but colder in temperature).   The ceasar salad was wilted, and sour.  Our wine glasses contained debris and lipstick marks from previous users, and a bread plate had old food caked on it post-dishwasher.   The waiter/host was very kind and pleasant and professional, but the food just didn't make the cut.  I'm not even a big gourmet... but I think I could have microwaved something at home that was better than this.   Good luck Kitchen Table - you've got the decor and location going on, just work hard on the food and take some notes from 116 Crown next door...
