Disappointing after all the hype.  The food here is good, if unremarkable, but way overpriced.  Branzino is usually $10 or $11/lb. at the fish market; here, 1/4 of the fish (1/2 of a filet) will set you back $27.  A large order of linguine with seafood had a total of 3 clams and a tiny bit of shredded crab.  Nothing about either of these dishes was creative or interesting.  Entrees (what they call "thirds") are small, and combined with an appetizer (a "first") will leave you still hungry.
