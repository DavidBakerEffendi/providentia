I'm almost scared to write this because I work as a pastry chef on the LES and honesly I'm not sure I agree with yelp being a healthy habbit or tool.  But after spending a majority of this afternoon sitting in my air conditioned apartment surfing the web and shamelessly seeking out all that's new in the food blog world I was kind of shocked to see Matt B.'s review of th Diner.   I was a fellow patron this past Saturday evening and witnessed much of the same nightmare featuring  a couple of  wasted customers sitting a few tables from us.  These two "gentlemen" were 17 sheets to the wind and created one of the more awkward scenes I've witnessed in a restaurant.  What completely floored me was that one of the two guys was speaking so loudly about the restaurant where he worked (Mr. Chang, it's Saturday, do you know where your employees are?!).  Thanksfully they were eventually removed like a nasty little splinter and the night continued.  But it put more than a little damper on what almost always is an exceptonally fun time at Diner.  In fact, I really like going there  because I forget that I'm in a restaurant and feel more like I'm at a friend's house (if I had a friend who lived in a diner shaped apartment).   As far as our food was concerned it did seem to take a little while between courses but the four of us were way into it.  We also had burgers, which were actually  cooked perfectly.  But the standout that evening was a soup which was bursting with dill.  It had a cooling effect that soothed our nerves after the rediculous behavior we'd endured earlier.   They don't call Saturdays ammature night for nothing!  My review though is based on a sum of all the experiences I've had the Diner.
