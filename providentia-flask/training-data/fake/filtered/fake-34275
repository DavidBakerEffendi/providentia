Hands down pretty wonderful. The restaurant comes off as surprisingly casual given the price tag, but its a pleasant place to eat. Don't bother doing an omakase because its exactly the same thing as if you just order each piece. Didn't even bother to get rolls because the sushi and sashimi is so good. Be warned though - you're not supposed to use wasabi or soy sauce because each piece is delivered as it is supposed to be eaten. Great sake collection too, but also a little pricey. Definitely somewhere for a client dinner or an anniversary because you'll love it but won't be able to afford to come back often!
