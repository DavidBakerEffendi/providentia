What is there to say about Joe's other than their food is the BEST IN TOWN!! Scratch that, the best I've ever had. Joe's is a staple restaurant and deli for my family. I frequently order their subs and salads for lunch and so do my coworkers. I also have catered with them for many occasions. My family and I have been loyal customers before they added and expanded the restaurant. The restaurant food is phenomenal!! You get a HUGE portion for the price. I love seafood and go crazy for their Zuppi di Pesce dish and tilapia dishes. Every Friday night my husband is ready to go at 7pm to have dinner at Joe's, and makes sure to always order the Zuppi di Pesce and house fried calamari. Most importantly, Joe's is a family business. They make you feel like family and are the greatest group of guys. The guys there, Joe, John, Vin, Rocco, are the most welcoming people. They know their customers by name and make sure we all have a great experience. If you haven't tried their food- you MUST, you won't be disappointed!
