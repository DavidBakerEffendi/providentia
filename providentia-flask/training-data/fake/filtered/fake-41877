My daughter an I spent the day in the city...after seeing Phantom of The Opera, we had reservations at Trattoria Trecolori. Â we arrived early ....no problem... I will say it was the perfect end to a perfect day... we could not have made a better choice...outstanding food...fresh quality authentic Italian food....If you plan on visiting the city....and you love food...you will not be disappointed....Highly recommended...
