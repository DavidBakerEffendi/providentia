GREAT brunch at Diner. The menu is not extensive, maybe 5 things on the actual menu and then the waitress read us 5 other choices. Everything sounded so great when she was telling us about them but once she leaves, it's hard to remember what everything was! Suburban family of 3, the atmosphere was definitely trendy and "hipster" but we did not feel slighted when we were here. We got a table on Sunday at 12 without much wait, but that seems to be an anomaly; the wait grew immediately after we sat down. All the food tasted fresh and wonderful. They take advantage of fruits, spices, etc. that are in season. I had a poached egg with ham, some type of salad with a tasty dressing and the homemade chips. INCREDIBLE! The old diner car is so cute and quaint. It made for a great meal, if a little bit of a tight squeeze. We will certainly be returning to Diner!
