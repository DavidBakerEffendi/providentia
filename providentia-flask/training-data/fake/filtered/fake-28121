I went to this restaurant for the first time with my husband and son because it has really good ratings. However, the service was terrible! My husband and I had only been there less than 1/2 hour and they were already rushing us out the door. They tried to take my plate away twice while I was still eating! Both times my husband said that I was still eating and they did not bother to apologize either time. On the way out, my husband explained that we will not be leaving a tip because they tried to take my plate away twice while I was eating and the manager had the audacity to say "Don't come back here" in front of all the customers. This person should atleast have the sense to apologize for their poor judgement. Not very bright staff, I guess. We will never be going here again!
