Picture it: Montclair, NJ, 2014 We parked in the parking lot and it was unclear of where we should enter the restaurant. We walked to the back door and pulled and the door would not open. We found out that we needed to pull harder because the door sticks and did just that. When we entered the establishment, we found that two employees were sitting in the front lobby and had not even attempted to open the door for us on our first attempt. When we entered, we were ignored and proceeded to walk down a hallway into a room that was completely empty. Feeling frustrated, we walked back into the lobby and were ignored once again. We decided to leave and go to a different restaurant feeling annoyed with the unfriendly staff. Will not ever return or recommend to anyone else.
