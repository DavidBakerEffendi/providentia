Every experience I have here is so positive- the place just exudes happiness and guacamole and everything wonderful about life! They also have the best taco sauces- the Valentina blend is the perfect amount of smokey and spicy and delicious... getting hungry writing this. I honestly worry that I may become addicted living two blocks away! I have also found myself replacing "honestly," with "honest toms," in my sentences. Might be addicted already?
