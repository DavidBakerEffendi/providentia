ULC is a beautiful restaurant and excellent choice for special occasions. We had a birthday celebration there last night. The food was excellent which is the main point but the poor service detracted from the entire evening. The service was very slow starting in the bar as we waited for the rest of our party to arrive. The restaurant was very busy but no excuse. The waiter also kept giving the wrong dishes to the wrong person at our table. To add insult when I went to my car I had a parking ticket, thought 2.5 hours was going to be enough time .Thanks New Haven. .
