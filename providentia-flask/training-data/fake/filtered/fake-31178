My Department was looking for a restaurant to have a gathering and end of the year celebration, and Wafa's provided a warm and welcoming environment for us to gather, especially as we had the entire restaurant to ourselves. The food was delicious, beautifully prepared, and offered a wealth of flavors and textures. Each dish from the appetizers to the main course and desert were delightful. Most importantly Wafa made us feel at home, from the family style service, the courteous assistance of her sons, and the food that is rooted in tradition and prepared with excellence and thoughtfulness. I will definitely return!
