I went to dinner at buttermilk channel last night it was the worst service I have ever had in my life. the staff was rude, nasty,and just plan indiffrent.If you do not want to serve people then get out of the resturant buisness.The water glases had no ice, it was served warm the waitress never even asked if we wanted more water or are you guys ok she just keep on walking by and only when we called for her did she come over.By the way amy ruths in harlem chicken and waffles are much more tastey and you get treated like they want you in the resturant.And when I paid this other tall short dark hair waitress took my 100 dollar bill and disapeared with my change. the bill was 66 dollars. I had to call my stupid waitress and ask for my change after about 10 min.I have had better srevice from a mid town food truck.I will never go back to that place and i recomend that no one go to this place. I say again i recomend no one go to this place. just because the food network says the food is good its not so someone at the food newtwork must be getting paid to say those thins because this place sucks. and sucks royaly!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!zero stars!!!!!!!!!!!!zerosrtars!!!!!!!!!!!zero stars!!!!!!!!!!!!!sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!dont go!!!!!!!!!!!!! hell cook your own chicken and waffels before you go there.
