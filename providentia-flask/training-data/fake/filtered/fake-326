Having seen this restaurant on TV numerous times as one of the "musts" to try when in Phildelphia, I was totally disappointed with the food. Now, don't get me wrong, the cheese steak wasn't horrible, but it is HIGHLY OVERRATED!!! I have certainly had waaaaay better cheesesteaks from sub shops across America. There was absolutely nothing that wowed me!!! I drove almost hour to get a mediocre sandwich with an attitude and nowhere to sit. If you are in the area, stop through and get a descent meal, but DO NOT make a special trip...you will be disappointed.
