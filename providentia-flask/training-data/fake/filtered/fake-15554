GREAT diner food. With that being said, I would be cautious about what you order. It is a diner, and does that well, but I wouldn't order something complex from the specials menu and expect greatness. Keep it simple and you'll enjoy your meal! Monarch is certainly one of the best diners I've ever been to.
