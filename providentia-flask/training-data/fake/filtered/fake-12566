The staff at Halinka are so nice and the food is amazing! I ordered pierogi's and stuffed cabbage to be catered for my daughters birthday party and the food was so good. The pierogi's were the biggest hit...everyone kept asking where I got them from. Everything was hot and ready to serve, and super good. Their krusciki was delicious too! I wish them lots of luck in their new venture!
