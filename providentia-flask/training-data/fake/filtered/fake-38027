Awesome place for a family dinner! I got the Mac n cheese and the fried pickles for the 5 of us to share -- more than enough for everyone! I had the chicken Caesar salad topped with fried chicken and it was delicious. The menu has a southern style to it so almost everything on it has fried chicken (hopefully that's what you're looking for!). For desert, I strongly recommend the bread pudding to share. It's massive and it tastes like heaven.
