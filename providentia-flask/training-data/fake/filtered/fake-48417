Steaks were great.   I had been to Geno's twice and never to pats. So this time it had to be Pat's.   It was a long line, but a very quick one.  Got near the front of the line and I only started reading the 'how to order' sign which had hilarious comments and it was already my turn.  The order went smoothly and I was off to the fries and drinlks window.  The steak meat looked great where you could see them frying it up through the window as I passed. After I got all the food, I was glad my girlfriend was there to help me cause it was a lot of stuff to evacuate.   We thought we'd have to leave with the food and eat it in the car because all the seats were occupied on the way in.  Fortunately one opened up as we headed for the car.   First let me say the fries were excellent.  Kind of a crispy flavored fry.  Definitely a nice surprise.  After we sat down a guy who cleans the tables came around and offered us some napkins.  He was quite a character and engaged many of the patrons in conversation.  I think he is a great ambassador for the place, really liked his demeanor.  The steaks were great we had ours 'wiz wit'.  Good stuff, nice rolls.  There was a little bit of gristle in the meat we didn't care for, but you'll have that with real meat. The place was clean and nice looking.  The staff were courteous, industrious and efficient. I would definitely go back. As for Geno's I think it is just as good.  There is something to be said about going to the source and ';rockin it from the cradle', but there are great steak shops all over Philly and in the surrounding areas as well.   Gotta do it if you're there, but some local shops are just as good. Enjoy!
