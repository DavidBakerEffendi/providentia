Simply one of the best tasting menus I have ever had.  The dishes were all very well prepared and matched perfectly with the wine choices.  My 10 year old even ate every bite of his full tasting menu.  The restaurant has a great atmosphere and the staff is incredibly friendly and attentive without hovering.  What made the night even more special is that we had told our waiter that the restaurant was my son's choice since he had seen Marc on TV.  The tasting menu choice was even his idea.  Marc Forgione came out to say hello and stopped to give my son an autographed picture and pose for one with his mom.  I can not recommend the restaurant enough.
