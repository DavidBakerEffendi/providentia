This place is the best!  My boyfriend and I were regulars at Life Cafe, in its former incarnation, for about three years.  We've had dinner at 983 four times in the last couple weeks since reopening, and we are altogether very, very impressed.  Higher quality food at the SAME PRICE - what's not to like?   The decor is different but most of the staff are the same - as far as I can tell, they brought everybody back, plus a few new hires.  One of the two new owners was actually the manager at Life, a very sweet guy whom the employees obviously adore.  Everyone who works there seems extremely happy with the change-over.   Did I mention that the food is much, much better?  The old Life was the kind of place you went to for the atmosphere, not so much the meal.  Now they offer better quality, healthier ingredients - farm-fresh greens and grass-fed beef - and the preparations are more subtle, too.  Their new vegetarian burrito is as good as it gets.  And if you're anything like me, the broccoli-cauliflower dish will actually make you want to eat your vegetables. The new chairs are a bit uncomfortable - hopefully they'll put in some benches.
