Sakura Express is a mess. Cleanliness: 0 out of 1-10 rating. Taste: 2, Potential for stomach illness 10. Arrogance: 10. The true japanese sushi restaurants in Princeton are embarrassed to be affiliated by virtue of same food genre. Sakura Express Chefs/Owners wipe the fish cutting counter with disgusting bacteria ridden cloths. You can see them in plain view.This place should be shut-down by a health inspector should they come by. OK they give great portions, however, its not about quantity. Raw fish preparation needs to be respected because of potential of parasites and other forms of life threatening bacteria.
