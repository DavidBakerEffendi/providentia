Good pizza. of course, but the least you can get from a wood burning oven. In Italia you can get a better pizza almost everywhere. I really didn't understand the need to put that weird combination of cheeses. Who cares to have Mozzarella di Bufala when the taste is covered by other more powerful cheeses... I didn't like the dough neither. Fresh basil isn't an amazing add to a a pizza, is simply a basic ingredient. The place is really nice, the service is nothing more than decent but the prices are actually pretty good. we drove from queens and I don't think will do it again.
