Wost tacos I've had in upper west side. Last night I ordered five carne assada tacos and one korean taco and rice and beans. Instead of carne asada I got dry shredded beef, the beans included were black beans, not pinto, which is typical of most mexican places I've eaten at. Totally wrong, I've officially given up on getting good tacos in the city. I guess I'm going to have to resort to going out to the reliably good places I know in bk and queens if I want good mexican. Additionally, they haven't updated their website and the prices were higher than listed there. I'm from southern cali and while I know so cal mexican isn't "authentic" mexican, it's a hell of a lot better than this phoney place. Don't wast your time with this place, especially if you've tried good mexican food and know the difference.
