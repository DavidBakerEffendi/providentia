5 Stars !!! Lol I'm addicted. This is one of my favorite local restaurants it's a Great Lunch Break spot the food is delicious I mean from the empanadas the chicken the rice the bean they have this special pepper they give you for the empanadas and for the rice and it's so good and I don't even like pepper. They have fresh lemonade the food is not expensive at all and you're in and out within an hour. They have ports to charge your phone the decor gives you this amazing shack ambiance ...
