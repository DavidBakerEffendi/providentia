It's rare to find a neighborhood spot that welcomes everyone while still providing amazing drinks and great food.  My friends and I stumbled on (or into) this place last week and had an amazing evening.  The cocktail list posted on the chalk boards provided some great options and for some of my friends who wanted to go off the list, the bartender was able to whip up some amazing drinks. The ambiance is well executed.  fresh flowers and natural wood keep in the inside feeling intimate and large windows on either side of the door open to the street making this place ideal for drinking when the weather is pleasant. We ate the grilled cheese. duck wings and chick peas.  We were expecting mediocre at best but woke up craving more!  I'm excited to try brunch here as well, which the bar tender claimed was better than dinner.  This is definitely going at the top of my list for NOLITA drinking.
