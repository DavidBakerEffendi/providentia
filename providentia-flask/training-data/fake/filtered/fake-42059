I LOVE, LOVE this place!!!  When my family and I come here we eat family style so we have tried most of the dishes. I love the Chicken Congee and the Duck on rice. Yum! the green scallion/ginger sauce that they use is heavenly!!!  All the other dishes on the menu are amazing too but for me, I will stick with the Duck and the Congee. During rush hours be prepared to wait a long time for a table or share a table with strangers (I usually do).  Also don't expect a super friendly service. The servers and cashiers are so busy that sometimes they forget to smile. But if your order is not right, they always fix it with out a fuss. Go for the awesome food and not the service.
