Won't add too much to what others said. The food's good for the price, and it's standard Thai fare. While I usually don't judge restaurant's that are this cheap based on service (especially take-out, which is all I get here), I had a particularly obnoxious experience that I found worth a mention. This place is cash only, which I find a bit absurd in this neighborhood (at least have a minimum). There's also no sign anywhere, so it's not like you're forewarned. So it took me about 15 minutes to come back with cash from my bank. The lady had the nerve to scold me about it, so I suggested they put a sign somewhere if the wait bothered them. She then smugly pulls out some hand-written card from behind the register, where nobody could see it. After getting home, I also noticed they forgot something that they charged me for. So it's worth it IF: - you live very close by, - remember cash, - check your bag for stuff they miss, and - completely ignore the surly hostess. Otherwise, you're better off somewhere else.
