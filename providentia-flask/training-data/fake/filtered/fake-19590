In the words of Racehl Zoe - This place is BANANAS! I am originally from San Francisco, CA, the land of authentic Mexican cuisine.  Therefore, I have very high expectations for Mexican joints.  A few shots of tequilla, a full serving of enchiladas and tres leches dessert later, I was in heaven!  Definatley the best Mexican I have had on the East Coast.   Check it out. wix.com/violetaortega/tr…
