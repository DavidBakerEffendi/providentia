Last night we hosted drinks and dinner in Juni's private dining room.  Attendees, who are particular and discriminating in their tastes, described the entire experience as "spectacular," "great,"  "fabulous," and "wonderful."   Working from Seattle with amazing Director of Private Dining and Events, Annette Jordan, everything was planned to perfection in less than four days. Annette is creative, accommodating, responsive, flexible, professional, AND nice! From start to finish she did everything that she could to make last night's experience top-notch and memorable! I had read wonderful things about Executive Chef Shaun Hergatt and Juni and I am so happy to share this great review!
