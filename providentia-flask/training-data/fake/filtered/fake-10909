I just ate here for a repass meal after a funeral.  I was sad to see how skimpy they were.  50 people were paid for, we had 47.  Buffet style.  Even before each table got a chance to go the buffet once, they ran out of salad, chicken, bruchetta, and the "sausage and peppers" only had peppers in the tray.  It was as if they were trying to cut it close and were slow to refill the trays.  They put out salad sized or luncheon plates, again, seemed like they were trying to limit what we had.  And the cheesecake dessert was merely cheesecake slivers.  Which was probably good because they were really not good at all.  We were also rushed out, after two hours, they took everything away and started regrouping tables (yes, while guests were still there, some still eating).  Especially after a funeral, it was so disappointing.  We drove back to the funeral parlor and they were shocked that we were done so fast.   Other than the cheesecake, the food was good (although I had to scarf it down since they were clearing out when I didnt even finish my plate). I've gone to repasses before, never experienced anything like this.   I would recommend avoiding Dominics.
