The menu was tiny and so were the portions (our salads were ridiculously small). The ambiance was pleasant - I liked the little wooden bird sculptures and the service was good, but my Roasted Chicken was nothing to write home about. The prices are a bit steep for what you get. I might try the brunch, but not anytime soon.
