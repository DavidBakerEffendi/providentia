I think they have VERY GOOD sushi and sashimi at a reasonable price. One of the places that I am not afraid to eat raw tuna, yellowfin etc...coz you know its FRESH .One of the best thing about this place is they also have Korean food in their menu which is a plus especially if not everyone in your group wants to eat sushi for lunch or dinner.  The service is excellent, very courteous and attentive. Love the decor, simple but elegant. Very  nice and clean restroom. I went there twice already and was very happy with the food. Well, except for the calamari which did not live up to my expectations. Otherwise, I will definitely go back for more. Before going there check out their online coupons ($5 off your $30 bill, not bad.)
