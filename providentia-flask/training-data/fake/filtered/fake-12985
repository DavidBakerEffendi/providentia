Calandra's has always been a delicious bakery with classic Italian desserts and AMAZING cupcakes.  Whether it's at the Italian Village or their original bakery location in Fairfield (haven't been to the Newark location), the desserts and breads are always delicious. The cupcakes are my absolute favorite, and at $3 each, they never disappoint.  Their jumbo cupcakes have a great frosting to cake ratio (which is important for a cupcake lover like myself).  The cake itself is never dry.  My favorites are red velvet and chocolate fudge/ganache but the chocolate chip cannoli cupcake is also near the top my list. If you're in northern NJ, you MUST stop and try some of Calandra's desserts!
