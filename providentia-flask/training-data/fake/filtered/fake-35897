thank you roberta's for the huge pile of garbage that appears on the north side of moore street in the MIDDLE of the goddamn sidewalk in varying size and configuration every night when i walk home from the morgan L every night (see photo). your garbage pile is so meticulously and strategically placed so as to not to obstruct anyone getting into - or out of - a manhattan-bound Uber, or anyone who lives WEST of of your restaurant. after all, the only people who live east of bogart off of moore street are black or hispanic and probaby live in the projects at the corner of moore and bushwick avenue.
