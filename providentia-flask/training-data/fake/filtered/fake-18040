Ive now eaten here 3 times. and have been less than impressed. The place they own next door is much better and i will review that in the future. The smoked wings are OK and the Mac and cheese was very good But, the Brisket I have ordered each time was more fat than meat. The ribs where under cooked and tough to get off the bone. Although our service was nice they seem to be aloof and involved in conversation with coworkers or friends. The atmosphere is fun and young
