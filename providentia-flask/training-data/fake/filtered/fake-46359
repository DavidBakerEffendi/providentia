I'm not a big fan of ramen, but Ippudo is an exception. The 'Modern' ramen and the pork buns are delicious. The pork buns just melt in your mouth! I did not give Ippudo 5 stars because the 2nd time I had it, it wasn't quite as good as the first : \ Also, the hosts aren't too friendly... they actually seem stuck up... but the waiters are very nice, so that makes up for it.
