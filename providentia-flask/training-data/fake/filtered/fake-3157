Long time customer here... I and my coworkers come here a lot... we are all fans of the place.  The steak quesadillas are my favorite; they are not the best healthy option but are great tasting, so I keep coming back to them.  Others I work with like other dishes better. Another good thing:  Mariachi gives out free chips and salsa (up to 2, which is almost always enough) as well, which is a big help if you have to wait for your order or want to diversify your order. The place is small but if you order takeout, or, come outside of the 11:45-12:30 window, you should be ok without a long wait or should have room to sit at a table.
