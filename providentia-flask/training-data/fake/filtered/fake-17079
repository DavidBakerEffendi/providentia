Maybe living in Boston most of my life has made me a seafood snob.  The Sea Fire presents an acceptable menu, a nice variety, well prepared, good service but not at the level one would expect at this location and at these prices.  The experience was a little pretentious and more costly than one would expect at the $$$ level.  If you want fine dining with seafood in Manhattan, I am sure you can do better.  Or just come to Boston for the real thing.
