1st of it, i used to order seafood soup noodle there that taste really great! but we r talking about at least 10 yrs ago, i guess the chief's taste buds r already half dead becoz all i can taste from their soup noodle are SALT!  no matter what i ordered - beef stew noodle or seafood noodle-- all i can taste is SALTINESS that can give me a  kidney failure.  its too salty that i gave up on seafood soup noodles that i took a sip, and i left with a can of soda.  i tried it twice b4 writing this review, their price is cheap, but its really crappy food .  i had Malaysian food that r also salty and spicy but this restaurant takes saltiness into another level.
