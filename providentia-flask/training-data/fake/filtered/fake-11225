I am fairly sure this is the same as Cafe Zaiya. It perplexes me how fast a storefront changes hand. Well... welcome to New York I guess? The food is solid. According to my Jap friends, the buns are fairly authentic, with red bean flavors, pinaple crispy tops etc I also enjoyed the black sesame frappe! Sorry starbucks, you are just not NEAR creative as this one
