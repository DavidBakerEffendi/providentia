On friday morning I was pulling up in the lot at Phil's, and some guy with a green car was mopping his car. Is this a car wash or a steak shop???? The girl at the window was very helpful, and had a great since of humor. She was working both windows, while the guy was too busy washing his car to help, and when he did come in to help. He seemed to be very cocky, and I think he has a problem with people of color too. Even tho the sandwich was good, I don't think I'll be back.
