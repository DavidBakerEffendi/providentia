Happy Mother's Day - took my Mom out for lunch on Sunday, 5/8 - i'll keep it simple: 1. Had a reservation for 1:00 PM, table was ready for us when we arrived - excellent 2. Must have been "in between" the rush time - nobody rushed us to order - excellent 3. Service - overall I give it 1 star - yes, I set the bar pretty high, but why not - I kept having to ask for things that should be a given, like jelly for toast, and I have never liked when your server keeps changing during the meal, I like to "connect" - I did not know who to ask a question of. 4. Food - I had the Garden Omelet which was very good, could have been a bigger portion for the cost, but was quite tasty. The toast & home fries I should have sent back, but hey it was Mother's Day Â - both were cold and under cooked, and the home fries portion looked like someone ate half on the way out of the kitchen 5. Beverages - I had hot tea, how come so few people know how to pour and/or prepare a simple cup of tea - 0 stars 6. Sustainability Index - zero - using styrofoam for "to go" containers 7. Atmosphere - 4 I would say that I am leaning towards a "one and done" -
