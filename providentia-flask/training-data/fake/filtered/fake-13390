I tell everyone about this place . It's definitely a hidden gem . They have the best burgers in town! As a matter of fact, I don't even eat burgers typically. But I do when they are from here . By the way, the meat is ground on premises. Maybe that;s why it is so good . Yummy! Not to mention, the staff is so nice and friendly. They remember who you are and even take phone orders. You won't be disappointed.
