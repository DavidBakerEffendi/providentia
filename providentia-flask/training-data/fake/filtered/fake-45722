the wine shop here is pretty stellar. it's a european boutique designed to compliment the restaurants menu as well as surrounding byobs. they have everything from entry level french pinot noirs to vintage amarones. really good stuff for when youre in need of a good bottle. and the staff actually knows what they are talking about.
