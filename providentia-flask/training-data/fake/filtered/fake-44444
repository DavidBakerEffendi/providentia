This place is truly pathetic. After a 45 minute delivery estimate, which was sad considering the restaurant is a 5 minute drive away, I was still willing to give it a go. After an hour and 15 minutes and no wings to speak of, I gave the restaurant a call to see what was up. They said the delivery had left the store 50 minutes ago. 15 minutes after calling, the delivery driver showed up. He called and demanded that I come downstairs to pick up the food. I asked him to come up to my apartment (I have a broken leg, which is part of the reason I requested delivery), and he refused citing "company policy" not to deliver food to an apartment door. Hmm... I have several friends who live in this building and have ordered delivery MULTIPLE times from this joke of a place, and every single time they come to the apartment door. So long story short, this delivery driver was a jackass, and after driving my wings around New Haven for an hour plus, I didn't really trust the food any more. I politely refused to hobble down to his car. So obviously I can't rate the food quality, but with such bad service I doubt it could be worth it. Next time I'll just go with S'wings or Archie Moore's.
