Dave, the owner, is probably one of the nicest human beings on earth and his staff is just as friendly and optimistic. I love stopping in there just to chat with him. There juices are fantastic. I especially recommend their protein drink mix. Plus, if you are up for it, the staff will even make you a staff pick -- and help you choose the best drink mix. I always feel great after eating and drinking there. This place has saved me from unhealthy meals for lunch numerous times. I highly recommend it!
