I consider myself to have a palate that 90% of people would have. I live near Jackson Hole for nearly 8 years and I have to say that their burgers are very bland and have that hard core meat taste that alot of people dont like. It's like drinking milk right from the cow, it's an acquired taste. Their breakfast is good but if you want great diner food, then you can't beat Neptune Diner, 8 blocks down on Astoria Blvd., which repeatedly wins best diner awards.
