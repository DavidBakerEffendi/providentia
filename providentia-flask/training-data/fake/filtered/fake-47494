I do not understand. My friend has telled me about this place so we go one day, all of us. Now I understand that in Ukraine we do not have pizza's but I eat many a pizza since moving to Brooklyn and this one was nothing special. We all stand in line for hour or two, suffering in cold as smelling come from all over us. I must admit, it was good smelling. I was excited almost Â to the point of sexual. Finally we get to front of line and we make order for a whole pizza. Waiting a while, we finally get pizza. Our mouth's watering with delight, we each take a slice. Was like eating Totino's Pizza Roll. I was unimpressed by this Pizza. Cheese was like goat's cheese that turn sour and red meat on tops was spicy and greasey. How dare they sell such things for human consumption. I will only buy again as laxative, for this...it does job well.
