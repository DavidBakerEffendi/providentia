We want it all, decor, service and food.  This restaurant is the bomb!!  My husband and I were in NYC and had only one open night for dinner.  The place we wanted wasn't available and it's easy to go to NYC and spend an hour searching for just the right restaurant only to be disappointed in the end.  I've had that happen. We turned to Yelp to avoid that outcome.  We both used our phones to search.  The way I search on Yelp is if I find something good, I make note, then try to top it.  Once I narrow down my selections, I check out their website.  We enjoy small food quantities, high quality, with an emphasis on artistic handiwork and will pay for it.  Anyway, long story short, we both ended up with Vitae; already a good sign.  We called and made a reservation to be on the safe side.  A few hours later, we entered into a really neat restaurant that smelled delicious.  It's a very modern take on a 70's feel, perhaps with a little rustic and art deco thrown in there.  Just enough of everything so it felt warm and inviting, quaint and extremely hip. You get the picture, we were already happy at the door.  The server was outstanding!  His delivery was excellent, his knowledge of all beverages, down to the knowledge of the casks used in the malt scotches.  He knew the menu well and was helpful in our making selections.  In other words he took his job very seriously.  When he walked away, we looked at each other and said, "That's what I'm talking about."  After ordering, which was difficult in itself because so many things were appealing, the food began to arrive.  It was all fabulous from start to finish.  The meal had to have been one of our finest ever.  If you want it all too, give Vitae a try.
