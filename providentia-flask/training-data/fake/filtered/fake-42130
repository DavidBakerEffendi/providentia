Luzzo's represents real pizza napoletana from what I experienced this past weekend..their ingredients are fresh, lovely ambiance and excellent service.  The pizza is amazing I had the Arugola pie and their brutta ma buona and we were delighted with food.  I will definitely bring my family back and they earned a faithful customer. Keep it up guys :-) Omar Matos
