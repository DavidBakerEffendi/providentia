I've had pizza... and I've had GREAT pizza... this pizza would be OK if the Lucali staff weren't A-holes... and I'm being nice. I call and put my name on a "list" and am told that there is a 45 minute wait... OK, it takes me about 15 minutes to get there, and on my way I can buy a bottle of wine.. so here is where the Lucali time continuum is a bit lost on me.  I call at 6:00 and there is a 45 minute wait, I get there at 6:20 and my "place" in line was given up because I wasn't there on time.... Hmmmmm.... OK, I put my name on the 'List" again... now it's a 90 minute wait... the tables inside were full, and there was only 1 couple sitting outside... 90 MINUTES????? are you kidding me?  I wasn't too offended when Elizabeth Falkner (Next Iron Chef) shows up and gets turned away saying that there is a 2 hour wait... My name finally gets called AFTER people who arrive AFTER me get brought in first... when I ask why this happened the cute little brunette says that they were on the list... BUT, I TELL HER, THEY CAME HERE AFTER ME AND GOT SEATED BEFORE!!!!   I finally get my table... by now me and my girlfriend are famished.  Ordered a pepperoni, the crust was burned on the bottom and soggy.. when I called my waitress over, she tells me... are you ready????.... That's how the pizza is supposed to be... Really" BURNED? Is this pizza worth the effort? NOPE.. is the staff a little too full of themselves? YES... Here's a quick tip... don't take names just for the sake of taking them, especially if you are not going to honor the "place holder" Oh yeah.. blackened pizza is not served anywhere!!!
