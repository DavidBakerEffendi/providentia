Tried the Tip Top for the first time and will definitely go back again.  The menu is small and unique, but has something for everyone, including a variety of vegetarian entrees.  The meats, produce and dairy are all from local farms and the seafood comes straight from the Mass. coast.  The waitstaff is friendly, helpful and attentive.  The fries with garlic aioli and seared tuna appetizers were both excellent as were the salmon, seared scallop special and flat iron steak entrees. The cinnamon bread pudding was excellent, but the chocolate truffle cake and almond pear tart were disappointing. Would recommend reservations for a Friday or Saturday evening.
