Went with a girlfriend from college, great place to catch up with old friends. Very small, only like 8 tables but great atmosphere. Very reasonably priced for New York. It seems that the rest of the Italians in New York think that you have charge $40 and entree to be taken seriously. We got a lovely prosciutto appetizer, a glass of wine each, paninis and excellent cannolis for dessert. I am a cannoli snob and these were delish! They glass of wine was HUGE, more like two at most restaurants. I don't know about the portions being tapas, they seemed pretty standard sized to me which was great for the price. Best of all, the waitress was great and we didn't feel rushed to leave at all.
