Delicious. Tried this place for the first time with my girlfirend and I was very impressed. Coffee was excellent and I enjoyed the brown sugar cubes they provided as sweetner. I got the "Greek Fritata" and the portion was huge and came with some fantastic toast. I also got a side of bacon that was sliced very thick and was very rich and salty. My girlfriend got the salmon omelete with a side of potatoes and kept raving about it the whole time. One of the better breakfast I've had in Philadelphia.
