Why do people have to gunk decent food up with all the frou-frou extras? Pickled watermelon rind au jus or ambergris foam with morning-glory-infused pumpkin fritters or whatever the heck...can't they just serve a really nice, well-done fried chicken? It always seems to me that places who feel the need to fancify their food are just trying to cover up the fact that they can't cook and hope you won't notice. The angel biscuits are good, but I won't be back.
