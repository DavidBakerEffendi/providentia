We just had our wedding reception there last week, and I couldn't be happier about it.  Everyone loved the food, and the atmosphere in the carriage house was lovely.  Also, the staff was very accommodating of the special requests we made.  They adjusted the menu so we could bring in our own desserts, allowed us to use the garden area while nobody was eating there, and when we asked them to make mulled wine as a special offering, they made some of the best I've ever had.  Also, the meatballs deserve to be famous.
