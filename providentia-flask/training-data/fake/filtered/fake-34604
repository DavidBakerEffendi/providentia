Sharkey's in booton is a great place to watch a game and eat some wings with friends.  Lively atmosphere and plenty of TV's.  Their wings are by far the best I have ever eaten.  I highly recommend the blackened wings.  I also like how they serve blue cheese stuffed olives with their martinis.  Not the classiest place but overall a fun time.  Will definately go again.
