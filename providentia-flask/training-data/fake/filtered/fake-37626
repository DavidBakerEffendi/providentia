I have been going to Pio Pio (138st and Cypress, Mott Haven) since it opened a little while back. Its a nice place..good food...and a GREAT addition to the neighborhood. However, when you enter this trendy restaurant, you are greeted by a thug at the door, with the hat turned backwards, 10x too big jeans hanging 2 feet below his waist, gigantic oversized shirt, tattoos, and ridiculously huge Timberlands. It struck me as very odd why they would choose to have this as the first impression, and as the seating host of the restaurant, when everything else is so nice, trendy, etc. I was GREATLY DISSAPPOINTED AND DISGUSTED to learn why this thug is the one greeting you at the door. Pio Pio is paying off the local gang for some absurd reason, and this thug is the "security" for the restuarant. Basically they feel the need, for some reason, to have gangmembers running their business...much like the supposed "protection" that the mob offered all those years ago. Not only will I NEVER go there again...I am shocked that they are suporting the local thugs and will be sure to make everyone aware of what is going on. I recommend everyone reading this to not only boycott the chain but to expose the restuarant for supporting/encouraging local thugs/gangs!
