The food was ok but the service was absolutely terrible! The bartender was doubling as a waitress as she was busy stocking the bar and our waitress told us that she wasn't really our waitress at the end of our meal. The cook was the only one that really tended to us. No one ever asked us how we were doing or if we needed anything and it was the middle of the afternoon mid-week and there was only one other couple eating. We were not impressed at all.
