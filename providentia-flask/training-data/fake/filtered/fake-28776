Ok last minute deal got reservation thruYelp. Awesome there. People here are super. Very tight space though. Tables too close. We basically were talking to neighboring tables.Two order: chicken and pork chop. Both were slightly over cooked, maybe sat on the warming tables, who knows. Wine was small bottle so menu prices are deceiving. Got 750ml bottle for price of larger one. basically ok for the last minute dash to theatre, but not something id' recommend for an important dinner dtae.
