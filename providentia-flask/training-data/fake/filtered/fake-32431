Love...love...love this place! Right near my house and has great coffee. No need for a shot of espresso here, the coffee is super strong and full of flavor. Plus the chocolate croissants are amazing. Only problem is they run out of the chocolate croissants often and you might get stuck with a wheat with raspberry...which is not nearly as heavenly.
