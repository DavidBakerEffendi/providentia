Worst service in Chinatown for OK food . Chinatown service is usually efficient - (fast, no small talk, etc. I can deal with it). But the waitstaff here was downright RUDE - (i've been here a few times but this was definitely the last). The waitress was absurdly aggresive and antagonistic to my family. In all my years of eating in Chinatown - this was hands down the WORST SERVICE ever (and that's quite a statement, haha). What kind of establishment allows their waitstaff to scowl and yell at patrons when they're putting in an order? It was super weird and super rude - apparently we didn't order enough food? we don't know- either way, it was uncalled for. All in all, the food is decent Chinese fast food - but not worth the stomach churning service. Not worth it to ruin your visiting out-of-town family's meal with waitstaff who give you attitude It's worth it to trek a few extra blocks to Congee Bowery or Congee Village (most of my HK friends agree that this is less touristy - albeit less centrally located - and the food is better quality and less expensive) from now on. Better selection of authentic chinese dishes, efficient (though still not entirely friendly - but not rude either) service, and better congee (great consistency, lower price too), solid won ton noodle soup.
