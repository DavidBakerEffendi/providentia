With an eclectic menu that includes sinfully awesome pastries, fun sandwiches and salads, and best of all, Kobrick's and Intelligentsia coffees, who could go wrong and/or say no? Â The cute and hip decor of bookshelves and artwork is enough to make you feel like you're just at home relaxing, no need for anything fancy or over-the-top. The staff is as cheerful as the said cozy atmosphere. I frequent this place and will continue to do so. :)
