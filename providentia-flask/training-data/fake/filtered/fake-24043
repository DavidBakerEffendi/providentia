My family ate here once and ordered take out several times. Each time we were sorely disappointed.  The staff is very friendly. They are also...slow as molasses.  We had pork chops, chicken and fish entrées....everything tasted like fish. The fish batter crumbled off the fish and made a complete mess. When we ordered take out, we tried the fries...it, too, tasted like fish. Perhaps I'm spoiled.  My mom, aunts, uncles,  grandparents could all cook soul food. I'm sorry, but Kim's is NOT it. ...but they were nice.
