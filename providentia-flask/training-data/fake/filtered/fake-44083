Tried Dragonfly for the first time last night with my family and was very pleased with my experience. The decor is interesting although it borders on over the top. We decided to sit outside on the patio which we enjoyed; not many places in the area offer outdoor seating. I ordered the chicken lettuce wraps for an appetizer as well as the spicy fusion roll and another one that had fruit on top- I can't remember the name. The lettuce wraps were delicious and great for sharing. The spicy fusion roll had a nice amount of heat without being too spicy. It had tempura flakes which added a little bit of crunch, nice as well. For an entree I had the sea bass which I really liked. The fish was cooked perfectly- nice and moist and tender. My father ordered the mongolian beef which came out on a sizzling plate. He seemed to enjoy it as well. My sister had the crab topped salmon, again, the fish was cooked nicely. Her salmon came with a few spears of the biggest asparagus I've ever seen- we all would have preferred smaller ones. My mother had a pork shank and shrimp dish which looked wonderful. We also ordered the pineapple fried rice to share. The fried rice was acceptable but nothing that I would order again. The portion sizes were all more than generous. My sangria was dangerously delicious and my mother's mojito with aloe and herbed liqueur was tasty as well. Our server was really pleasant and attentive. We enjoyed everything that he recommended. We will be back and we are definitely trying their table top bbq next time.
