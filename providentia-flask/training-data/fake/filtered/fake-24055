My sister found this little gem when looking on-line for a place to have lunch following a show at the Union County PAC.  Upon entering it is bright, cheery and spotless. There were 5 of us in our group ranging in age form 12 to 70.  We all ordered different menu items and were all happy with what we had.  I ordered a Granny Burger which was described as having cheddar cheese, fried onions, mashed potatoes and gravy. Not being a huge fan of mashed potatoes and gravy when I placed my order I asked they hold the mashed potatoes and gravy...they didn't do as asked and boy I was I happy they didn't.  I thought the mashed potatoes would be served as a side with the burger but instead they were right on top of the burger and infused with the fried onions and then the gravy was a white gravy that was poured over the entire thing.  I didn't quite know what to make of it but figured what the heck let me try it. OMG it was absolutely delicious. My sister had pulled pork which was served on fried cornbread which she found to be equally good and my 12 year old great niece said that her Swiss cheese burger was the best she's had in her life. As one other reviewer noted the service is a little slow but it is so well worth it. I will definitely be returning.
