This little place makes very good, but relatively cheap Italian food. I am very picky because I lived in Italy for a while and I only want Italian-Italian food when I eat it. This is the place to go. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because while it is small and charming, it is sometimes complicated to get a seat and squeeze by people eating.
