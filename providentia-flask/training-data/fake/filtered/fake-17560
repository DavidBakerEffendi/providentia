This is the place we dine with my husband's Japanese family on special occasions. It is truly authentic, and as such, you MUST allow a minimum of 2 1/2 hours or so for your meal... it is meant to be a slow-paced, relaxing, enjoyable experience, and not a place to go wolf down some chow. Try the beef negimaki, the abalone sashimi, and the black sesame creme brule for desert! Even simple, homey food like karaage and agedashi tofu are elevated to a fine art. The service is attentive and knowledgeable; you will be pampered by some of the best waitstaff in New York City, in my humble opinion. It is not cheap, and it is not fast food, but I promise one of the best dining experiences you've ever had. We are loyal customers!
