Cozy Italian spot in the East Village. It's so popular you'd be waiting quite awhile for a table. They will redirect you next door to the wine bar for a drink and to chill out. It's dim and romantic. The food at Supper is very good. they have some specialty items like lemon pasta and osso buco. Prices can get steep. Bring your cash.
