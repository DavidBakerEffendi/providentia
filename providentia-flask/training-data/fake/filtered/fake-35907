I went with a few friends to this place and I have to say it wasn't at all what I was told. they made us wait for about an hour by a makeshift bar in what can only be described as a dirty backyard. When they finally sat us it took forever to get served and the waitress acted like she couldn't be bothered when we inquired about some items on the menu. The pizza is decent but at the prices they charge you can get better pizza elsewhere, Keste on bleeker st. comes to mind. Save your money for a meal worth it; McDonald's is a better value.
