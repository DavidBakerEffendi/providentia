There are way better and heathier options than this place.  The food here is over salted, and not flavorful.  They also dont know how to get an order right.  The whole point of the Kiosk is to personalize the order yourself and make sure there arent any mistakes.     Maybe before they opened the chef and owner should have gone over the menu a few more times and tasted the food. (The shrimp was rubbery)  Clearly they are rookies at this or even worse havent trained their staff properly.   Although,  I am not a food snob, I do like good food.  Yes the Ritz is down the street and I could have a fantastic SIT DOWN meal that wont be messed up several times. ( thank you Alyssa K., you must be related to the owner some how)  The reason I went the honeygrow is for the healthy salads (which arent) and the quick service.   First impressions, and second impressions ( a month apart) are very important.  After 2 months or so they should get better not worse.   I consider this place more like McDonalds/burger king except Burger King wont mess up the part "have it your way"
