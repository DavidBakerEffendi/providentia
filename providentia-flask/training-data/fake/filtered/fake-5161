Bistro Les Amis was introduce to us by our niece who was graduating from NYU.   This place was amazing.  It was a crazy busy day and I just needed a place to unwind. I had a mint lemonade with a spike of vodka which was refreshing and a tuna nicoise. The tuna was cooked to perfection with a pepper coating.  Got to sit back and watch the sites.  Great place to people watch.  The waitress was sincere and funny.  Plus I got to practice my French.  Merci!
