Tried Centro for the first time this weekend. We ate the food, and drank the wine (sangria martini to be exact) and it was excellent. I don't know what the others on this board are talking about. Every new place goes through growing pains, so give the staff a break. We did have to wait a while for our table, but it was 7pm on a Saturday night, so it was expected. Now onto the important stuff..the food! We ordered the spinach artichoke dip app which was very tasty. For the meal I ordered the baby rack ribs which just fell off the bone and my wife ordered the Tuscan chicken which looked and tasted like something my grandmother used to make. Washed it all down with a few Sangria martinis and a newly discovered Belgian wheat beer called "312" and all was good. Overall a great experience. I will defintely go back, but will probably go on a weeknight until the crowds thin out a bit.
