I've been to Roberta's twice now.   The first time was a more pleasant experience and the pizza's were delicious.  The second was not as nice.  On busy nights, it might not be the best place for a date.  The room gets rather noisy and the music is a little loud.  Their entrees aren't fantastic, small-ish portions and not perfected as much as the pizza menu.  Our server didn't know the menu very well and the table spacing isn't great- tightly packed in a way that you have to ask others to move if you want to use the restroom. I would say go for the pizzas, but not the entrees or ambiance.  Their outside area is nice, but I could see it getting packed in the summer time.   Also, be sure to wear clothes that you don't mind smelling like a wood-burning oven at the end of your dinner.
