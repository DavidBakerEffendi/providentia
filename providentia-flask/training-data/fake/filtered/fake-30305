The food was extremely mediocre for the price.  There was nothing special about the lamb and the risotto was extremely over salted, extremely.  I like salt, but this felt like a a tablespoon was dumped into my portion, I am still bloated from last night's meal.  I must say the staff were great.  The waitress and the hostess were gracious and went I believe the waitress was sincere.  Her timing was impeccable with everything.  I just wish the kitchen could compliment the outstanding servers, but I guess you cant always have everything.
