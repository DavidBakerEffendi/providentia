This place was amazing.  The food was delicious... Trust me when I say don't eat lunch that day!  The ambiance was very fun too.  My favorite part was the bellydancing though... the dancer was one of the most amazing performer's I've ever had the chance to see.  Here's her website,  you should check it out: alimahamani.com
