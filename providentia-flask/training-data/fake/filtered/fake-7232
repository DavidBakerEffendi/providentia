Sat at the bar and had dinner one hot Thursday night. Service was ok. There were a few order errors. The bartenders were a bit cold as we sat at the bar for two hours. Then as we were leaving, the one bartender starting chatting because she recognized that we also worked at a bar (odd, right?). The highlight of the evening was the Arroz Bomba, a bomba rice with asparagus and lemon oil. It was buttery and delicious. Xangurro a la Vasca was also quite tasty, jumbo lump crab meat with a sliver of avocado Â (I only wish the avocado slice with a tad thicker). There was also a Braised Short Rib sandwich that was superb. The meat was so tender; it just melted in my mouth. I will definitely have to make a reservation next to to try the rest of the menu.
