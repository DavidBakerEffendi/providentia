Amazing food. Coming in to visit New York, I was recommended this place. The service was great. The ambiance was lovely. From the bread to the water they serve , I loved it. Â I had steak and fries, and it was done exactly the way I Iike my steak and the fries were delicious. I highly recommend for a NY experience. I will be back next time in the city.
