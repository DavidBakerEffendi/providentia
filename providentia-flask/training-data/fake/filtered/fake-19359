First off, I have to state that I'm not a vegetarian, and frankly I know very little about vegetarian cuisine. I do however, know a great dining experience when I have one. My wife and I dined at Revolution Kitchen for the first time last night and we enjoyed the experience. Nice atmosphere, attentive staff, good selection of regional brews - everything I like. We had the nachos and the miso sake glazed Brussels Sprouts to start (probably too much) and followed with the Revolution Tacos and Diablo Tacos. Everything was well presented and delicious. Our waitress was patient and answered our numerous questions about the dishes and their ingredients. The dessert was also great. In closing, don't think you have to be a vegetarian to enjoy Revolution Kitchen, it's a really good restaurant, period.
