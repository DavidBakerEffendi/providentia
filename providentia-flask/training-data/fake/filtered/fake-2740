I agree that the sandwiches are great, but I'm not ever eating here again. Several times, I've seen employees eating while preparing food, wiping noses while preparing food, operating the register while eating (way to multitask!), and once dropping sandwiches on the floor, then bagging them and giving them to a customer. I guess hungover college kids don't care about stuff like that, but it seems pretty skanky to me.
