The La Va panini (tuna with hot sauce) is quite good, but the coffee is pretty terrible. The space is always jam-packed and isn't really conducive to a productive afternoon. Worst of all, though, are the blank-faced, seemingly disdainful baristas. Some of the male baristas are perfectly nice, but the female baristas (and I hate saying this about my fellow females, believe me) - watch out, you will get ATTITUDE.
