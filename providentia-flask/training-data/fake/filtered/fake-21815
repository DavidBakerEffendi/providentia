Great Variety.... Crowded Weekends. Wow what a selection of different foods!! Great place, great atmosphere. It can and is usually crowded, especially at lunchtime and on weekends, and with it being in the heart of center city definitely helps with this. All in all the crowds are well worth it.... Awesome place, Great, great foods!!!
