So I went to Valentine's dinner tonite at Trumbull Kitchen. I never ate th.ere before but me and my fiance had one of the best experience, we ha..d at a restaurant  in a long time.  Everything was perfect from service to drinks to appetizer to entree  to dessert.  We are a younger  couple in mid twenties and I guess I never been there before cause I thought it was too high class, but I felt comfortable and everything was reasonably  priced.  I have been to all the restaurants in the max group and i can say I found my favorite.  Trumbull Kitchen
