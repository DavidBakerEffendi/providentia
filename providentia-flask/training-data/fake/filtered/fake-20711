I don't typically go to sit down restaurants when I eat alone, I'm more of an easy-at-the-bar type of diner, but this place seems to do both well.  The bartenders were friendly and make a great house cocktail (I decided to try the rye one while I waited for my food).  I ordered the snapper and it was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  Someone down the bar ordered some fries with mussels and gravy (Poutine?) that I already feel like I need to go back to try.   I had a pale ale beer on tap after my meal that I don't remember the name of, but it hit the spot.  The hostess thanked me for coming in as I left and really made the whole experience pretty great.  I would definitely come back with a date, or with a group, since the booths toward the back looked comfortable.  Well worth the trip from Williamsburg to give this new restaurant a shot.
