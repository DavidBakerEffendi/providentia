Nice location , unfortunately The food is overpriced for the portions your receiving, I gues your paying for the location.  I had the churrasco, my wife had the chicken... Steak was way over seasoned and very small for $24... (if you have had churrasco, you know the steak is supposed to hanging off the plate).. My wife's chicken wasn't bad...  We also had 1 beer and 2 drinks, plus dessert and in all came out to $86 without tip. ($100 with). ( the drinks were good). Just to compare, At don coqui 4 of us ate with 1 drink each and we paid $86 with a doggy bag to take home.( the portions are huge)... if your thing is a nice view, then its cool. But if your going to get your grub on, this isnt the place for you... and all they played was bachata while I was there.. ugh..
