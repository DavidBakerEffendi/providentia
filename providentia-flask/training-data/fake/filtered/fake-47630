I was friday here, with some friends and I like it. I'm not the biggest fan of pizza, but this one was good. Greg, one of my friends, I think is the biggest fan for this place, he suggested to come here. Overall, it was a very good experience. I gave 4 start, because I'm not a pizza fan, but I will sure come back if Greg wants it!
