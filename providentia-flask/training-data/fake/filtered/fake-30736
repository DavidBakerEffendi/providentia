After deciding that having my grandmother's 90th birthday party here at home would be just too overwhelming we decided to have it at a restaurant instead. We had already been to the "new and improved" Leone's 3 or 4 times over the past 6 months or so and were really impressed with the food, service and value so we decided to give a call and see if they could work within our budget--which to be honest was meager. Mike, the owner, took my call and was very friendly and helpful. I was so pleased to find that he was able to work with me to devise a prix fix menu that was well beyond my expectation for my budget. On the day of my event he set aside a lovely area of the restaurant for our party; everything looked beautiful when we arrived. The staff was friendly and attentive, the food was delicious and there was MORE than enough. It seemed that every single guest came up to me and raved about something or another. I couldn't be more pleased with my experience with Leone's each time I've been there, either just with my small family, on a date night with my husband or at the big 40 person birthday party for my grandmother. Mike and his staff very obviously strive to make the customer happy and give them a positive experience. Last but not least...I can't review a restaurant without telling some of my favorite dishes! I always have the warm olives and a stuffed artichoke to start. The artichoke is to die for. The ginger calamari is also fantastic. We love the pizza. I personally love the pasta e fagioli. My husband always orders one of the fish dishes and raves about them. The chicken francese is great and so is the chicken savoy. So there you have it. Leones = great food, service and value!
