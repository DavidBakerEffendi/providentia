If you want a cheap and reasonable brunch, and just decent food, come here... If you want to have a romantic dinner, with slightly above average food, and not break your bank account, come here, and enjoy special attention by the manager as locals do.   You have that old time local feel when you walk in and are treated like they have known you a long time.   The Italian fare is decent some dishes are above average, service is good, and the setting is nice with candlelight and festive decorations.  The salmon dish is good, and the Chicken Parm is average.
