bottom line is you have to know what to get at Rockys... if its any sort of plain pie or with toppings(jimmy has to be making these pies).. best chicken vodka deep dish pie in jersey anytime.. best stromboli in jersey(whichever one has american cheese ham salami etc).. good cheeseteak pie or buffalo chicken pie..stromboli pie is great.. again you have to know what to order, some of these negative reviews who knows what these people ordered...stick with me ill have you farting through silk..
