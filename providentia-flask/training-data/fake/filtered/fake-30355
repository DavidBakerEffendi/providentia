When I first moved to Bed Stuy one of the big complaints was the lack of a really good pizza place. It was a total relief when this place opened up. It's the best in summer when you can sit outside. Table sizes are pretty flexible as well, which makes this a great place for friends to meet up. The house wine is good too!
