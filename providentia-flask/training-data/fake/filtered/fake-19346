For anyone looking for that perfect outdoor restauran this summer for deliciously appetizing food, a nice selection of wine, and great service, this is your place. I came down from Manhattan to visit a friend for the weekend and was very impressed with this restaurant! It will be my first stop back on my next visit to the area. Â We only waited for about 10 minutes without having a reservation on a Saturday night and were seated in the beautiful outdoor space. (they have a chic and open inside area as well that we walked through which was beautiful too). For appetizer we shared an awesome pork dumpling dish that I couldn't get enough of- myfriend and I were talking about them all night! I also really enjoyed the salmon with peaches for my entree. It was perfectly cooked and tasted so fresh- the perfect summer fare before a night out on the town. Our server did such a great job recommending wine to go with our meal and was always there to top of our glasses. For anyone who has not been yet, I highly recommend 20 Manning Grill!!I can't wait for my next visit to 20 Manning Grill for another great taste of Philadelphia!
