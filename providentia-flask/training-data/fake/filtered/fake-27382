My husband and I went to L&B Spumoni Gardens for dinner tonight,. We ordered rice balls for appetizer, and I ordered a large seafood salad for my main entree, while my husband ordered a Pasta Eggplant Sciliano as his entree. We also ordered a carafe of red wine. This was going to be our last meal at L&B as we are moving soon from Brooklyn to a state out west in a few weeks.   We waited and waited for our appetizer to come--more than 20 minutes, and drank half the wine and ate all the bread from the bread basket as we were really hungry.   My husband's pasta is served to him by a bus boy but no appetizer, no fish salad for me. We call the waiter over to ask what happened to our appetizer and as he apologizes the bus boy brings the rice balls.  We tell him to take them back, as it is now too late and ask where my seafood salad entree is, as my husband already has his entree.  All of a sudden a man comes out, grabs my husband's dish and says "I OWN THIS PLACE --GET OUT!!!!"  We were totallyy shocked!  They make a mistake and throw us out of the restaurant???  What kind of crass people are these that treat theri customers this way?  We have been going and enjoying L&B for years and this is our goodbye send off??  We don't know what happened to this place but it has gone downhill when they treat their customers this way.  GO AT YOUR OWN RISK AND DON'T EXPECT GOOD SERVICE IN THE RESTAURANT!
