Falafel has a new convert! Vegetarian friends have tried for years to tempt me with the various incarnations of fried chick peas and fava beans, all without success.  Then, a chance 23 mile bike ride just happened to accidentally end right in front of Mamoun's around lunch time.  I was both skeptical and suspicious of my companions, but upon seeing the prices ($2 per falafel, if memory serves me correctly), I was persuaded once again to invest in expanding my taste horizons. And thank the food gods I did!  I'm not sure if it was the texture--the combination of crisp and wrap and fresh tomato chunks--or the flavor (is that sauce to die for, or what?) or how it filled my stomach but left me feeling light and active.  Whatever it was, it was a little piece of deliciousness. I had to have a another one, this time with hot sauce, which was so spicy I almost had to lick the sidewalk to calm my tongue down.  Although it could just be undertrained.  Hm.  I wonder if there's a market for starting a boot camp. My ambitions aside, I would make the trip for a falafel from Mamoun's anytime.  And I can, because it seems to be open 'til the wee-est of hours.  Guarantee it's worth your time.
