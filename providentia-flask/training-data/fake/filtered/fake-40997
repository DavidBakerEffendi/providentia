If you like New York style pizza, this is the archetype.  It's as if the platonic ideal of pizza, the very pizza that existed before time in the mind of God, somehow made its way to a restaurant on the east side. I've been to all the renowned pizza joints in NY.  I love them all, but this is still the one.
