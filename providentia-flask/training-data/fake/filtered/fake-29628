Yeah the wait is longer than I would like and the price is a bit higher than Brooklyn should be charging especially an out of the way spot. That being said the fried chicken is some of the best in the city, trust me it can go really wrong. Everything I have ate there is solid, a dense satisfying brunch place. Have a hangover, woke up late, take the time out for Pies and Thighs. Its cramped and they don't offer there namesake, but the biscuits and gravy so good my mouth is watering just thinking of it.
