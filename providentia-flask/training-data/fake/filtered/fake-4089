I have been a regular at Caseus for a while and this is definitely one of the top three restaurants in New Haven. The staff are friendly and attentive without being overbearing, food is truly delicious every time and well-curated drinks list. My go-to is the moules frites or side mac n'cheese and greens/veg, but the daily specials are almost always worth a try. Truly a gem.
