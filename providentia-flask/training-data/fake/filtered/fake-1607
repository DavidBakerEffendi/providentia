One of the best places around to find pretty much everything. Go on an empty stomach and you will probably find exactly what you want to satisfy yourself. From sweets to savory you really can't go wrong. Forget the Liberty Bell or any of the other stuff, this is one place that has to be a stop for anyone who visits or lives in Philly.
