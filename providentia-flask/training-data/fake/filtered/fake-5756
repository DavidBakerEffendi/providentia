The Waiter was rude and the food average! DO NOT GO HERE. Much better Italian restaurants in NYC at this price point. I ate at this restaurant last Saturday night with 2 friends. Not only was the waiter rude to us throughout the evening with non-humorous put-downs, but he actually added on an automatic 18% tip to our bill! The food was very very average. I had the pre-set menu which had steak as one of the entree options. The steak was horrible quality - probably one of the worst cuts of meat possible. The other dishes were ok. If you must eat here - grab the gnocchi and the chicken entree off the pre-set menu. All in All - DO NOT GO HERE as THE SERVICE IS HORRIBLE.
