Meh.. I do realize that they just opened, but it's not like there new at the business. Served my table of 4, had only 3 of the dinners, every one was finished by the time I got mine,20 minutes later (just a steak with mashed potatoes) Waitress did what she could, manager was rude, non-caring and dressed like the maintenance man. Would I go back, maybe I'll give it a year.
