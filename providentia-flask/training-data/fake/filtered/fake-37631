I'd say the food was around 4 stars but the experience more a 2 so I'm averaging it out at 3. Perhaps it's part of the whole shtick but i'd peter Â not to have to eat with the feeling that there is a timer letting me know that I need to be done asap. I think that + the wait + the price would deter me from coming here more frequently. There are other great Ramen joints in town that i'd be just as happy with without feeling like the wait staff is breathing down my neck whilst I ate.
