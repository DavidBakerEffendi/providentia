We have been ordering take out food for a while now. We finally had the chance to come in and dine...not pleased. Music is a bit much. And I'm Hispanic and love my culture. Not to mention the MULTIPLE pieces of hair I found in my food while dining for lunch. Â Very disappointed. Food is decent minus the hair. Decor...cheesy. But what do I know.
