Great stylized for foreigners Filipino food.  The taro leaves cooked in spicy cocunut milk, 'laing' was authentic in flavor with a good portion of shrimp and jalapenos (stylized) makes its price reasonable.  Altho' it had a bit too much coconut milk compared to what I am used to from home. Their pork bacon, 'tocino' was well flavored, well portioned.  The fried spring rolls @ $8 for an appetizer, I thought is a bit overpriced until I tasted it, yummy!  For dessert, I had their fried bananas, 'turon' was good enough...The portions, flavor and presentation make high marks.  The service, my waitress was Hannah along with another charming lady, was very pleasant, attentive without being oppressive.  The restrooms were kept clean, the surroundings and kitchen visible from the outside were generally clean, as well.  Overall, I would go back to Grill 21 and bring non-Filipino friends!  I can't wait to have their pork barbecue in skewers, I would order the 'laing' again, and go for their custard, 'leche flan'!  I had all my leftovers, including the rice, taken to-go.  All were very well wrapped and packaged.  I was impressed by how they run their business very professionally.   Actually, I'm thinking of going back now!!!
