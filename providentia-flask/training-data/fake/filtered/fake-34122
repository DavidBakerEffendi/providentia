Stopped by this evening with friends for Tapas....the service, atmosphere and food were all well presented.  The price was extremely reasonable and in fact for the quality of food, taste and service it was a bargain.  Will definetely go back....the mozzarella and parmesan croquettes were to die for....the butternut squash soup was light but had flavor...you won't be disapointed.
