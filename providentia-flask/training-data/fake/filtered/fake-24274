My lousy experience after dining with two friends at Ngam this past Friday evening prompts me to write my first-time review. I was actually swayed by the positive reviews on this site which I now know to be totally inaccurate. Upon entering the restaurant, it has a rustic feel so I had a good feeling my two friends and I could relax, chat and enjoy a good meal after a long work week.  Unfortunately the waitress was completely clueless about the entire menu. We were seated in the back and she had to continuously go to the kitchen area in the front to get answers. I started with the Royal Trumpet Mushroom "Tom Kha" Soup ($6.00). The mushrooms were slivers and very sparse that I felt like I was just having warm coconut broth. My main course was papaya pad thai with shrimp ($18.00). The serving was an appetizer portion at best and consisted of four medium-sized shrimp. I mentioned to the waitress about the portion size and the owner/chef Hong came over and told me that the ingredients are fresh. It was extremely nice of Hong to bring over a dish of regular pad thai with chicken to make up for my small entree portion. Unfortunately, I don't eat chicken so was unable to indulge.  It is odd that she didn't give me more of the dish I ordered.  Neither of my friends were impressed with the food they ordered but did enjoy the ambience. Instead of leaving relaxed, I was actually quite disgusted with the entire experience since I chose the restaurant. I had high hopes for this place because I live in the area but I will definitely NOT be returning.
