Everyone should try each of Stephen Starr's restaurants at least once. The atmosphere is really what the selling point is where his restaurants are concerned. Each restaurant is themed and has amazing decor. That said, this place does not disappoint on decor. Of course the margaritas are fabulous but the food is the highlight of our evening. The seafood is always fresh and cooked to perfection. Our favorite menu items include the Indian Red Lopez guacamole, the diver scallops, and mojo grilled shrimp. Â The only reason i dropped a star is because I feel portions are a little small for the price...I kinda like it when my margaritas are the size of my head.
