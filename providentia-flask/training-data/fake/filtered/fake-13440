DO NOT EAT HERE!!!! HORRIBLE SERVICE!!!!!!!!! The manager yelled at me as we were leaving! First he pestered us multiple times to leave because he wanted to seat other people at our table (I'm sorry, is this a French restaurant?), mind you, it's late on Thursday night, there are 7 other tables open (yes, I counted them). We said, "That's fine, can we have the check." He then came back numerous times because he didn't think we were paying fast enough! Then as we were leaving he pulled me and a friend aside and demanded to know what I had said to my waitress! He said, "If you have something to say, say it to me, I'm the manager!" I answered him, "I told her the tip was strictly for her, because you were rude" He then proceeds to scream at me in front of all his other customers, calling ME rude and finally culminates in him yelling, "Good riddance!!!" at me as I am trying to get the door open and get away from this giant buffoon. Needless to say, horrible experience and I would never recommend it. The pity too is that I was with a MoMA curator and we had been thinking about planning an after party at this restaurant. Thankfully we were saved from any future embarrassment! I can only imagine this giant asshole screaming at my poor mother, "Drink your coffee faster!!"
