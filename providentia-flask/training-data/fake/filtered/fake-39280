. As I have had experience with authentic Mexican food and love it, I was doubtful that any authentic Mexican could be found in NJ. I had the quesadillas.... They were perfect: Just enough cheese, great "taco" outer, not too salty, great hot sauces--both green and red are excellent, and a big plate of lettuce. Perfectly seasoned..not the gooey, not too much sauce, no overly salty stuff that often passes for Mexican. I'll be back!
