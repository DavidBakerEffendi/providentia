Met two friends here for dinner/drinks.  The atmosphere is very cute.  Great decor, outdoor seating available and the host even offered to hold an outdoor table for us while we waited for the 3rd person in our party.  Unfortunately, it took forever for our drinks to come and my friend's margarita was incredibly sour. The guacamole is not made to order -it was watery and cold (had just come out of the fridge) and the chips that came with it were stale.  Our group had the fish tacos (grilled), ears of corn, friend plantains, hongos (mushrooms), quesadilla and the shrimp tacos. Everything but the plantains was absolutely smothered in some kind of chipotle/spicy mayo which was very hot.  It was really too bad because you couldn't taste the other flavors at all.  Not to be left out, the plantains were also smothered - in guacamole (weird!).  Servers were kind but the experience just wasn't the best.  We didn't stick around for dessert.
