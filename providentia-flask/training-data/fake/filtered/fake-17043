I was at Cubanu recently for a birthday party and was disappointed considering all the hype and good reviews. The food was average at best and the service was below average. I am huge on service but unfortunately that was the worst part. Hope they get it together cause Rahway is on the verge of a revival and if they want to be part of it they need to get their shit together!!!
