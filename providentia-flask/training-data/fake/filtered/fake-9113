I wanted to check out this so called Boqueria all these reviews were rather farfetch, today in fact I was there for brunch.. The waitress was very attentive, she got a plus for this.  However after I order it was pass 15 mins, there was another customer that arrived after me, she somehow order the same item.  Then all of the sudden this customer got my order, I approach the waitress then asked her what happened( I knew the other customer had my order instead of me) waitress couldn't give me an answer so I left.  After I stepped out side a employee came running after me to say he was sorry and that he was going to pay for my brunch I simply gave a piece of my mind and said get lost I don't want your brunch
