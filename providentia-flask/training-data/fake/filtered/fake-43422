Just went there for lunch with my wife and daughter. The atmosphere is nice, but that's where it ends.  I ordered the lunch special , broiled salmon. I started eating and towards the middle the texture was jellylike and I had to spit it out.  I cut through the middle and it was raw. I called over the waitress and she said she would take care of it.  About 10 minutes later they returned with the same piece of salmon , now cooked thoroughly. I was already disgusted of the thought of raw fish in my mouth. Secondly, I couldn't believe they actually gave me back the same piece they took away. They actually put the food in my mouth back on the grill. Lastly, they should've taken it off my bill, which they didn't. Not that I wanted something for free, but at least acknowledge the fact they made a mistake and ended up ruining my appetite. I actually told my wife if they don't apologize and take it off the bill, I would write a review . I don't make scenes, I just won't return and will tell the world my bad experience there. This restaurant should be called Petering Out.
