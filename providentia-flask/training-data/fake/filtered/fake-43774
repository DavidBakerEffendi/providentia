i went in here after reading all the other reviews. as a traveling south african I try and sample new eateries with each trip to new york and this was enjoyable. I sat at the bar and ordered a pinot grigio, which was a delightul discovery. I coupled this with a delicious calamari and a warm salad. both helpings were generous and fragrant. yes, I will be back on my next trip to the big apple.
