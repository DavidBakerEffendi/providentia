Came here last weekend with a few of my girlfriends for dinner, and we were really impressed! The atmosphere was great, the service was speedy and attentive, and the food was great! None of us had been there before, but we definitely agreed that we'd be coming back again.. and soon! We really enjoyed ourselves in all aspects, and the staff was very friendly and pleasant - especially our waiter, Zach! Had a lot of patience with our questions and indecisiveness, but he knew a lot about the menu to point us in the right directions. This restaurant is very well operated - a little small and a little pricey, but totally worth every penny! Highly recommended!
