My husband, girlfriend and I were actually in the middle of eating our meal tonight and we were asked to pick up our plates and move to another table so they could put a few tables together to make room for a larger party......however, the other half of the restaurant had numerous tables available.  The waiter did not once come over to refill our drinks.  Very disappointing and will not be going back.
