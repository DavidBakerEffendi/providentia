Quality food and nice presentation.   Excellent service.  Loses a star for two things.    One, while the experience on the whole is just fine, it's not memorable in the way a high end restaurant should be, e.g. Jean Georges and Daniel.   Second, for a downtown middle of nowhere off the beaten track restaurant like this to require jackets for men is quite ostentatious and a bit snooty.
