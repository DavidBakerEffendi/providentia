I decided to try Primo Pizza and I still can't get over the food it was wonderful, the chicken francaise over angel hair was five star, My girlfriend had a small specialty Pizza ( grandma pizza) now she wants to go back every week, the restuarant is small but cozy and clean the manager was truely the best checked on us through the meal to make sure we were happy. I am making it a regular stop.
