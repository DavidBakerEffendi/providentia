Wow what to say about this place. A beautiful place but thats the only reason i even gave it a star. The food is mediocre at best and expensive for what your getting. I dont mind paying for something a bit more pricey as long as its worth it and this is def not. The food isnt great, the service is even worse. We tried planning a party here and the sales manager actually had the nerve to roll his eyes at us because we wanted a bigger party then he seemed to think was appropriate. He was beyond rude and when we spoke with a manager it just got worse, the manager who was none other than mr knowles himself was a complete jerk. we understand taking your employee side but this took it to a whole new level. Â Nothing was resolved and we had to leave and take our party elsewhere. Mr.knowles must have been high as a kite as he didnt even bat an eye when we walked out. Actually now that we think about it they dont even deserve the one star.
