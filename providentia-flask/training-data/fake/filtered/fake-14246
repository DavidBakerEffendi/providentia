This place has all the bases covered. The whole place is clean. prepares wear gloves and food prepared in front of you. quality of food is top notch. jalapeno chedar and french toast begals are great. the small pizzas are better than the renouned pizza shops. Boars head meats are very good and fresh. service is very customer centric and friendly. no charge for beverage refills. I rarely go anywhere else to start my day. They just extended their hours until 5 pm on most days and added free wifi.
