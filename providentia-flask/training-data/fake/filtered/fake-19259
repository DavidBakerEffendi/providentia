Would have been happy to put 4 stars - the brunch was excellent and the waiters very kind. Unfortunately the host was incredibly rude to us when we entered the restaurant, showing no common courtesy and then even making a flat-out condescending and very rude remark when we inquired about seating somewhere else. We were very close to getting up and leaving because it was such a horrible first impression. It was rainy and we were hungry so we ended up staying, and I am glad we did, as we were able to see that the food, ambiance and most of the staff were all an extremely positive experience. But wow - there's nothing better than entering a restaurant and being treated like crap from a host! Will go back for sure, but management should be aware.
