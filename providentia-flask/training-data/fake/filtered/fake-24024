Woodrow's has become one of my favorite bars!! The bar scene is lacking in FiDi, but Woodrow's is worth commuting for. The downstairs lounge is one of NYC's best kept secrets!! It has great ambiance--- low lit, couches, aged brick walls, and a fireplace. Like an active speak-easy. The bartenders are attentive and make strong drinks--- especially Elaine, my favorite NYC bartender, who is a sweetheart!! I can't comment on the upstairs, I'm sure it's solid, but the downstairs is awesome!! As a NYU grad student, we have chosen this as our post-class hangout, after having gone to numerous FiDi and Village bars. I can't say enough good things about Woodrow's!
