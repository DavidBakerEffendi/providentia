The bartenders at Minetta Tavern make the most incredible Tom Collins.  For the Tom Collinses alone, I'd give Minetta 5 stars. The food is solid too.  The black label burger was as delicious as they say, but I thought the veal porterhouse was the star of our meal.  Veal porterhouses were new to me, but I'm now a convert- so tender and flavourful.  I admit, I had a little trouble wrapping my head around the theme of the menu- it seems the restaurant can't decide whether it's Italian or a steakhouse, but in spite of that, all the dishes (italian and steaks) were really delicious. I really like Minetta.  The space is alive with energy and warm and the people that work there are great.  If you do plan on going though, I suggest requesting a table in the back room or the front room.  My party was seated in one of the booths connecting the bar to the back room and it was just too crazy with people walking through. Will definitely make my way back to Minetta Tavern soon and until I do I will be dreaming about those Tom Collinses...
