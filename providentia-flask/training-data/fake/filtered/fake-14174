Went to entreé byob with my girlfriend just to try a new place out and I was starving, so a place called entreé sounded fitting. Boy was I wrong. The appetizer salad was amazing and so was our desert. Fried Oreos were to die for. But the entreé was an absolute joke. Easily one of the worst I've had for the price. The salmon that I ordered I could've made better at my house for free. As a mid 50 year old man who used to be a chef when he was in his 30's this is garbage. The salmon tasted like saw dust that was fresh out of a lake. I've never had a worse meal. My girlfriend ordered her steak medium rare and it was black as fireplace char. She didn't get halfway through it. I didn't wanna insult the chef further by telling him. I feel sorry for this place and furthermore their innocent customers. This is a WARNING to anyone looking for a good meal.
