Tried the just opened Amelie on 8th Street  drawn by the cute theater seats in the cocktail area.  It was amazing.  The ambiance is sleek but welcoming.  The wait staff were attentive and informative and the food was great.  My companions had the tartare (fresh and traditionally served).  The flat bread was a delightful surprise and the scallops and steak were outstanding.  And to top it off, the prices were reasonable.  This is surely a place that we will frequent
