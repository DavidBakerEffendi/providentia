Delicious food prepared in a healthy and appetizing way (no fried food here).  The vegetables and other dishes were seasoned to perfection and the "sauces" were light and delicious.  Our waiter (the owner, I presume) was really friendly, but not intrusively so, and took the time to answer our questions and carefully instruct us on their spiciness/hot spectrum.  There were a variety of meat dishes as well, but our group didn't try them this time.  The tomato-based soup was wonderful!  All of their desserts were amazing!
