The food is consistently very good. and there is a wonderful selection.  Every top Greek item in the gourmet ranks is represented. Service is professional and attentive. Pricing has gotten a bit steep over the past years-  but still a good time. Wine list needs some help and pricing is is over the top at 3-4 times retail.  I never hesitate to return.
