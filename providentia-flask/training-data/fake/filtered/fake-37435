We happened across this fun little place while out enjoying the fall cool and colors this mid October.  In search of a late lunch (after 2PM), so we drove into Claremont. My wife spotted the storefront promising "comfort food."  We found to our delight a simple menu of southern style cooking (subtly modified for the Yankee venue).  Prices are reasonable, and the pot roast I enjoyed, along with southern green beans and mashed potatoes and gravy were as good as you will find anywhere.  All of the items tasted truly home made. My wife partook of chicken and dumplings, broccoli salad and peach cobbler (crowned with a dollop of vanilla ice cream). She sparred playfully with our server about the better choice, biscuit or corn bread.  She (and I) were treated to both for the trouble. The owner is friendly, generous and good humored.  Though a NH native, some time spent in the south (Alabama) has bestowed on her a charming accent. Perhaps I appreciated it more, having lost mine after years living in the north. The soft strains of Conway Twitty in the  background, and a few memorabilia from the local antique mall added to the simple atmosphere. The restaurant itself as bright and clean as any. The bathrooms are the cleanest. The food is presented on paper and plastic, so it is hard to serve up 5 stars.  If taste, homey company and surround is good enough, then five stars is deserved. In any case we will be going back. Do give it a try if you are in the neighborhood, no matter which side of the line you are from.
