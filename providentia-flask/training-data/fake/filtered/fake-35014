Thoroughly enjoyed my first experience at Agricola.  I had several drinks from the bar menu, mushroom flatbread, salad, halibut and cheesecake.  All very good...two complaints though...bread needs improvement, sliced more evenly and different olive oil as the one that was served was bitter. Will definitely be back
