Ate a perfect meal here last night. The Moules frites featured the most delicious mussels. Scallops were meticulously prepared; sweet potato gnocchi was amazing. Meyer lemon upside down cake was dense and delicate all at once. Finished with a perfect french press. Service was artfully attentive without ever feeling intrusive. Ambiance was especially charming. Please disabuse yourself of another reviewer's ridiculous suggestion that this neighborhood is unsafe. The restaurant is moments from numerous art galleries and remains one half mile from Frankford Hall, Johnny Brenda's, Barcade, Lola Bean, et cetera. Great food; great service; great decor; great location.
