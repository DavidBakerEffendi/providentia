I have yet to be disappointed with Melograno after years of dining here. Came here last night for my one year anniversary and as usual...amazing!! Had the Sea bass with couscous and my fiance had the squid ink risotto. Both dishes were melt in your mouth good....tons of flavor...and always prepared the same. No sudden changes or surprises. The mussels were very bland however... not much going on there. Ah well my entree was amazing and Melograno is very high on my list :)
