My wife and I count this restaurant as our favorite ever visited! The great news is that it is in our home town! We have visited there on many occasions and tried almost everything on the menu. All of the dishes are prepared to very exacting standards and are just amazing. I happen to love steak Tartare and since I travel globally, I am always looking for the best and freshest with a traditional recipe. To date, there are only three restaurants that I would consider this a favorite, Bistro Mediterranean, The 21 Club in New York and Sardi's in New York. The seasoning is outstanding, the presentation is beautiful and it is the best of the three. My wife loves the empinadas. What we also love is the attentive nature of the owners and the staff. They really understand that fine dining should be enjoyed. There is no rush and there is always some little surprise at the end of the meal that will always leave a smile on your face. You will love this restaurant and you will be surprised to see diners from all over the region there! P.S.--Don't forget the Bananas Foster--Simply amazing!
