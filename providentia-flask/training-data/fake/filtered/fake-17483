The waitresses were not helpful in explaining the menu. We had some fatal communication errors and she brought out a dish with peanuts despite me telling her that I am allergic, and asking if there wasn't anything nut related. Glad that my date tried the food before I did or else I may have had a serious problem on my hands. The ambiance is great though, very traditional feel about the place. I know it's weird to compliment the bathroom, but it was actually really cool with some appliances that seemed to have come straight from japan! I think this place is as others have mentioned, exceptional. I may have had a bad experience due to the server, but this is something that the restaurant must be very cautious of, in order to avoid allergic reactions. I would hate for this issue to repeat it self again.
