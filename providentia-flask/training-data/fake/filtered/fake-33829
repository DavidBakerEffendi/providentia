An awesome addition to the Northern Connecticut dining scene.....the atmosphere is wonderful as in warm, inviting, and exciting. The staff is very eager to please and the menu has great choices. The dishes have great eye appeal and the quality Â and portion size left me totally satisfied. All of us enjoyed the pizza that we shared as an appetizer and the choices of "wines by the glass" were excellent and reasonably priced. We each sampled eachother's entre and it just made us decide to return soon to try more. The experience lacked nothing.....a wonderful addition to my dining out circle. It just recently opened so I suspect that things will even get better which is hard to believe. *( The pasta dishes are super ! )
