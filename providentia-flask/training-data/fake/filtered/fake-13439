I'm not sure I understand why this place often has a long line outside when there are so many great places in the area.  I've eaten there 3 times. First time was actually ok. They were not too busy and the crepes are nice. Second time I went for coffee. Horrible coffee and even more horrible service. This male server slammed down around 20 packs of sugar in front of me when I asked politely for some more after I had my coffee.  3rd time I went to meet 5 friends there. a couple of us had mussels first to share and then main course. I told the waitress I would like the mussels first and then my risotto dish. EVERYTHING then came out - about 50 minutes later by the way - everything EXCEPT my risotto. So 20 minutes later when we all were done with our food - I was not the only one having more than one thing - I got my risotto, after asking for it 2 times. First time I asked a waitress who pointed to someone else and said 'Talk to her'. Then when I got her attention she simply said 'Well you wanted me to bring it out AFTER the other stuff'', clearly trying to blame whatever went wrong on me. Apparently it was perfectly normal for her, that an entire table had finished their food, starters and mains, before 1 person then gets his. They had clearly forgotten about it and didn't even have the balls to admit that they made a mistake.
