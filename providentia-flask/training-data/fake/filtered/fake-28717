I went here a couple of weeks ago and was very disappointed with my visit. The food was bland and the prices were high.  We asked the waiter how much Naan came with an order.  He told us 4 pieces of naan, which seemed like a good deal for 3 bucks.  Turns out it was one piece of naan cut into 4 sections.  I ordered the Lamb Vindaloo, which was 13 bucks, and received just enough for one meal.  Most other Indian places I've been to tend to give you two meals worth of food for each order.  We also had to order rice separately, since 13 bucks was not enough to cover some rice apparently.  This place is definitely a pass.
