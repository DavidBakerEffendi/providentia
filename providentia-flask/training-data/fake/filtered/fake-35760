Just had the most delightful meal here today! Amazing snails- and lots of them. Yummy crepes, and short ribs for the gods! A very nice Malbec to go with the lovely food. Our waitress Maria couldn't have been nicer, too. Overall the luckiest food find I have had in quite a while. I would definitely go back. Thank you to our chef Philippe!
