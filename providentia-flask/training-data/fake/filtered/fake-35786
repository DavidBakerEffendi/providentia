Cnydia's is as good as it gets!!!!  All food is homemade and absolutely delicious.  I am a regular and have tried Eggs Benedict, Eggs Oscar, many of the specialty sandwiches and salads.  The mac & cheese is just yummy!  You're missing out if you have not been.  I've always been greeted with a "smile" and the service has been great!  I look forward to my next visit and trying something new - all tastes homemade!
