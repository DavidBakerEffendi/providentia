Honestly, this is some of the worst, unauthentic Japanese food I've ever had. Maybe I should have stuck to rolls or sushi, but if you put something on the menu then at least know how it's made. I ordered nabeyaki udon, a traditional udon soup. They served it with no choy, no mushrooms, no fish cake, but they did offer plenty of halved onions and full length red peppers... you'd never see this in Japanese food restaurants in the south. I like sashimi, but didn't look fresh and the shrimp tempura was so floury I couldn't even eat it. I hate to give a review this bad, but the only thing palatable was the beef teriyaki, which was good. Guessing this place would be ok... after 5-6 hot saki... avoid.
