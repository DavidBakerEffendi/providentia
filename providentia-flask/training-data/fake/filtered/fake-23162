New Yorkers, please stop embracing mediocrity!  I have lived in Alphabet City for 7 years and have never had a more displeasing food and dining experience.  I have walked by Cornerstone a bunch since they opened (I used to love the place that was there before it) and seen the crowds, and after eating there, I truly don't understand it. Perhaps everyone else in the restaurant was a tourist or not from the neighborhood, but there are many better restaurants even within a block of this place at around the same prices.  The food was bland, but the service was worse...don't go here just because the food is a little cheaper than Cornerstone's competitors.  Clearly they have to make their food cheap for a reason, and its not even a compelling enough  reason to eat there.
