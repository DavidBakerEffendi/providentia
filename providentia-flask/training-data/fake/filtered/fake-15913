We SKI VT so we stop here on Sundays for breakfast.  Krissy's Cristo is the best!  French toast, with baked ham, cheese and maple syrup.  Out of this world!  The soups are always great.  The food is fresh, primarily organic.  Great coffee too.  The atmosphere is very laid back.  Unique.  They are housed in an old building on the "town green" and I would describe the decor is Tibetan/Organic/Hippie. . .very comfortable!  The baked goods are outstanding.  They have little gifts too - fancy soaps, great smelling moisturizers, fun canisters - just a really neat, funky place!  Larry and Sue are the best hosts!
