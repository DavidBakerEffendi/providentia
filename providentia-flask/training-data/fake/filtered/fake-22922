I went to Mezetto for dinner with my boyfriend last night. Wow! The restaurant is warm and inviting. The food is Mediterranean tapas. Everything was SO good! We especially loved the Mezetto Trio, beet and tofu salad, skirt steak, and scallops with cauliflower and raisins. We had chalva for dessert. It was heaven on a plate!! We will definitely be back. :)
