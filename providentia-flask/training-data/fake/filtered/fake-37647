We just left the store, Normally we go there twice a week for sandwiches, and we spend between 35-40 dollars each time. The secretary from our office went in to pick up our Order. I gave her a $1.00 coupon off of one whole sub. The owner threw the coupon at my secretary! and he said " you probably photo copied hundreds of these!!!", they are always RUDE and have a Bad Attitudes , especially the owner and the guy that makes sandwiches..the girls are sweet, a lot of turn a round with them, I wonder why. NEVER GOING THERE AGAIN!!!
