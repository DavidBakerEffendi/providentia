Really enjoyed the service, atmosphere and food. Only issue was the image of the spicy potatoes is different from what is served. What I got looked more like seasoned french fries then the round balls seen on the website. Also, any food with nuts in it should be specified on the menu. Although most foods were listed with nuts I got one that did not specify that and with a nut allergy; could have been an issue. Fortunately, it was not an issue this time. Overall I enjoyed my afternoon of tapas at Amada and look forward to returning for some Paella.
