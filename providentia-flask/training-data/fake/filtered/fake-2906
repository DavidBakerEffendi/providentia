HORRIBLE PLACE!  Worst dining experience ever.  Have you heard of the soup nazi?  Well, there's a CUBAN NAZI in Montclair.  Music too loud then.. NO CUBAN FOR YOU!!!  Really, it happened.   After waiting an hour to be seated, our table was next to a column with 4 speakers blasting.  My husband asked the owner if it could be lowered and were told this is Cuba if you don't like it leave.  Then he said in fact I want you to leave and we  were basically kicked out.        Perhaps it is because the owner Dominick Restaino is a little man that he needs to prove his manhood by being so obnoxious.  Whatever the deep rooted reasons don't waste your hard earned money in a this place to be treated like dirt by this PSYCHOPATH.
