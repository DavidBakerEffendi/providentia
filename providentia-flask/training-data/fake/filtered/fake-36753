Look, regardless of what people say about the service, the burgers are gooooooooooooood. Special sauce ALL THE WAY. I have had poor to amazing service at P.Y.T., surprisingly I think the service gets better the later in the night (earlier in the morning?) you go. The chicken burger (T.L.C.) is fantastic. The P.Y.T. burger is amazing. The have great toppings, no doubt. Definitely go for the cheddar cheese. And if you ask your bartender to make your drink dirty, they certainly do. P.S. the interior design in the back room is LOTS of fun. Wallpaper of velveteen bulldogs in blood red, anyone?
