This is my first yelp review. I guess it is true that we tend to remember the bad more so than the good. Mac's is a pretty cool, laid back bar with a decent draft selection, fair prices and a friendly staff. It has the vibe of an upscale dive bar, which is my kind of place. Unfortunately, the positives stop there. I would highly recommend NOT eating food at this establishment. I had the steak sandwich. Put simply, this was the worst meal I've ever had in my entire life; not just the worst steak sandwich or the worst bar food, but the worst thing I've ever put in my mouth.  A loose calculation says that I've eaten roughly 40,000 meals so far in my life. This one was the worst.  To add insult, I had done a long run earlier in the day, was starving, and was unable to eat more than 1/4 of it. It wasn't just me. My two buddies also tried the sandwich and both found it equally horrendous.  It wasn't just the steak sandwich, either. One friend had the chicken cutlet sandwich; after he couldn't finish it I asked if he'd give it at least a 3/10 to which he replied "I definitely wouldn't give it any more than that. I'd rather go to McDonald's because at least I could finish that." In Mac's defense, my other friend had the buffalo wings and said they were good. Despite my two star rating I'd highly recommend coming to Mac's if you're only planning on drinking. But if you're even remotely considering getting food, please stay far, far away.
