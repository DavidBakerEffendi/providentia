Great restaurant week, the portions wore just perfect I love the taste of the entrana and my fiance love the chicken The fish tacos wore amazing and the chifa ceviche as well Â  I wasn't to crazy about dessert but they wore good I will return again But do way get the wine special $25 dollars battles.
