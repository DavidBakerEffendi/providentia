Went with a groupon . 8 tables full when I arrived. Â Everyone but my wife and I were offered bruschetta and same waiter serving all. We liked what couple at next table had in front of them and ordered same. Veal in my dish was 1/2 the amount of next door. Only 4 Shrimp in wife's dish vs 5 next door.
