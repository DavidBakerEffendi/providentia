Bad, bad, bad. The whole experience was horrible. The waiter was so rude to us. We were four of us, 2 adults, 2 kids. First they showed us to sit on a table for 6, then asked us to move to a table for 4, as the waiter said that if a larger group walks in, he would need that table, which is understandable and was fine by us. Then there were not enough glasses or napkins on that table, which we had to ask for. Even though I was still eating out of the appetizer plate the waiter took it away, I had to ask him to put it back. The food was brought out, without the naans. What do we do with the curries without the breads? I moved the knives and forks off in the middle on another table, as my kid was touching it and the waiter told me to watch the glasses, which I told him to just take it away, to which he said, "Dont talk to me like that, this is not your house". We left without finishing our dinner. There was no manager in sight, and I am not going back there again. They might be the best eatery in Princeton or in the whole world, but they are not kid-friendly and very rude.
