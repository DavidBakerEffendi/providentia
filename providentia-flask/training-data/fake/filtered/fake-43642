Went there on Oscar night. Good atmosphere. Very good cocktails! Ordered two appetizer specials and a side of truffle fries. Kale-Chorizo soup special was unbelievably bland; the prawns (special) were smothered in pepper (it must have been an accident, seriously) and at least 5-6 other ingredients/competing flavors; the truffle fries...the one dish that I had hoped would save the evening, turned out to be stale. I think it'll be a while before I go there again.
