There are only two "go-to" low-to-moderately priced sushi places in the neighborhood - Kansai and Sakura. Umai and Doma are wonderful, if a bit overrated, but their quality and ambiance are far superior. That said, the quality of the product is better at Sakura than it is here. Don't get me wrong, Kansai is a great little spot to get takeout, too (both are better than most I've had elsewhere in the city). The problem I've always had is that their sushi just doesn't seem as fresh or full of substance as it should. The big but, if you will, is that Kansai is a much better place AT which to eat. It's much bigger, it's well decorated, and you can bring a group here, no problem. I probably wouldn't take a date, unless you both know that it may be a little empty, which I've found tends to make things a bit awkward. The takeaway, if "a-ok" is a three-star review, I'm happy to throw my a-ok recommendation behind this place.
