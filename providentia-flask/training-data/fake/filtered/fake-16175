I love this place.  The hand-pulled noodles are just the right consistency and it is delicious.  You have an option to choose the type of noodle that you want so you can mix and match with your friends.  I also recommend the cold cucumber appetizer.  It is very refreshing!!  A little hidden in Chinatown, but definitely worth the trip.
