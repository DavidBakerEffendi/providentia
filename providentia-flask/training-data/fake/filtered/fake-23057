We were there on the 9th of July and had the First Call Luncheon. It was amazing. Both appetizers were great and then we had the crab cake and the cod. It was a great time and experience. Be prepared to spend a little $$, but we felt it was worth it. The staff were on their toes and we didn't want for anything.
