I loved the food, just a little dinner with my best girl friend, we had 2 salads and they were both so good ( Love Kale Salad!) and a dessert that was very fresh but the noise in there is quite ridiculous and you have to yell to hear yourselves out... Too bad cause the crowd is fun ( look at me! look at me!), the food is good and the location is perfect to hit the Meatpacking clubs afterwards!
