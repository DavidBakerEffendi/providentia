After waiting 45 minutes late night for this spot I was delighted.  Never even knew Raman restaurant existed on my block if not because of the long queue every day... and for my first experience I was quite happy. The place is beyond small.  Expect to be seated directly next to people... just like your sharing a table. Sit at the bar if you can, watch the chefs.The place is cool and hip, but if the line is too long don't bother.  Also as much as I like this place... Ippudo is immensely better!
