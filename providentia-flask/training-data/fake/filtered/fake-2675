Graffiti is a great experience. After reading an article about it's kitchen space (approx. 40sq. ft.), and then learning more about the chef, I decided this place was worth a visit. While it is true that the portions are small, the dishes are well thought out - all very flavorful, well-seasoned, and with a touch of uniqueness (e.g. pork dumplings with grapefruit). This is also a restaurant where you can learn directly from the chef what he was trying to achieve - outlining flavor profiles of each dish. He came over to our table numerous times to tell us about the dishes (despite being busy for a 16+ seat joint). Being able to eat at a restaurant where the chef is well trained, and interact with him during your meal makes Graffiti a must visit. A bottle of wine and 5 plates, plus tip can get you out of there at about $100.00 And just in case I was there on a night when the chef happened to be there (though I suspect he is there almost every day), it would have still been worth it. Don't forget to stick your head in the kitchen - that is about all you can fit in there!
