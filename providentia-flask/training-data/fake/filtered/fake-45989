If you want to leave with a full stomach for a great price....visit Tops Diner. The staff are wonderful....always good fun to interact with and the food is wonderful. My husband and I go here often and have been going here for about 8 years together, and as long as the place is there we will continue to be regular customers! We always try to order something different each time, but I highly recommend their steak and their burgers.  Great good quality meat and always fresh. If you have room make sure to order one of their many amazing cheesecakes......or be like us and order it to go.  We never have room while we are there but you sure do find room a few hours later while your home and comfortable.
