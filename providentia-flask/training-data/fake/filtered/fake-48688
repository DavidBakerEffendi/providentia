We were looking for something away from the tourist trap crap and happened upon empanada mama. So far the best meal we have had while visiting here. My wife and I sampled many different empanadas, plantain chips, and quacamole. Delicious. Everything was fantastic. We didn't care much for the Greek spinach and feta, it wasn't bad, just didn't seem to fit well. The sauces that came with the empanadas were incredible especially the green sauce. It was very crowded and not much seating but we were seated right away at 11:00 pm. The people behind us weren't so lucky.
