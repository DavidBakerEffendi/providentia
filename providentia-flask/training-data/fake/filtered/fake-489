I have been to Pat's many times. Every one seems to rave about  there steaks. I have driven there numerous times with friends and still feel that i can get a better steak  at any pizza place in the city. I would love for Pat's to live up to the hype but for me it just doesn't. I feel bad for anyone who visit's Philadelphia and wants to try a cheesesteak and are directed to Pat's. These people probably leave our city thinking I don't know what all the hype is about these Philadelphia cheesesteaks. Do yourself a favor stay home and order one from a local shop---- they are better
