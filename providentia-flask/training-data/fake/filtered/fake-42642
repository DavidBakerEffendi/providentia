Place is in need of Desperate updating, seats are torn, Tables are worn out,  dishes are chipped and DIRTY, place smells.... Food was cold and Gross...  I would NEVER recommend this place... the Restaurant should be condemned.  I'm surprised the health department hasn't closed them down yet. .  This was my FIRST and LAST time going here....
