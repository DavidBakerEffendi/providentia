I loved my Crab BLT!  Such a fun and friendly place. Casual and great prices - Alaskan King Crab Leg platter for $21!  There're no waiters to tip. You order at the the counter and find a seat. When it's ready, pick it up and chow down. I loved the owners, Gwen and FeFe. A great place to hang out. Music was good too.
