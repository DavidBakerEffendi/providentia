I don't know how this place gets 4 stars. The service they provide to the customers is unfriendly,late and horrible. I don't know why the servers are unfriendly. They totally don't care to their customers. Our water glasses were empty and our empty plates were on the table untill we left the restaurant and it was not busy night.The food was ok thought but the merely one star is for their service. Sripraphai Thai Restaurant should promptly improve their service. Certainly I would not come back to this restaurant..
