I am a local and would love to see this place improve.  Food is really good, service ranges from awful to not too bad -- but always extremely slow.  Worst of all, the ventilation in the main area is non existent and the whole place smells like cooking smoke.   This could be a 5 star breakfast spot if they would just learn how to turn tables and install a large exhaust fan!
