If you love meat I guess this is meat heaven.  I ordered the fish, shrimp and scallops. It was awful, the fish was soggy , scallops, soooo salty,  no taste at all. The only thing only thing on my plate that was okay, were  the two shrimp. Oh, and the potatoe chips........ When I ordered my meal, the waiter said, "good choice"..... So, if you like good fish do not order any from here, stick to the meat.   Would not go back.
