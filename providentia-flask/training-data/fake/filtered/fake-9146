Uncle Pop Pop's is located in the back of a large red complex off of Susie Wilson Road across from Oil n Go. Though it's set back from the road, it's definitely a great find. I went in to check out the menu and ended up ordering some lunch. The restaurant has really good sandwiches for reasonable prices.  I'm a huge fan of the honey smoked turkey cheese steak, which was unlike anything I've ever tasted. It was cheesy and sweet but savory, surprisingly complex when comparing it to  cheese steaks I've had before.  While waiting for my meal, the waiter let me sample the potatas bravas (fried potatoes) with a red pepper sauce. It was very good. I'd definitely order that in the future. There is a bar that serves wine from Spain and rum as well. They also have Orangina! Since I was there for lunch, I was able to sit in a quiet area in the back on this long wooden bench. I'd definitely bring a date there next time.
