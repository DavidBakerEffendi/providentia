I have been there several times before, and the food quality generally good, but a bit expensive. The kicker is this; you never enjoy it. As the service mentality of the ownership (totally indifferent if you bring it to there attention) and staff alike is more on the style of a fast food establishment. Within one minute of sitting down the waiter is telling you the specials, even if you are intensely engaged in polite conversation with the people at your table. The pressure to order never seems to abate, matched by a rapid fire food delivery to your table that would envy even the likes of McDonalds. The stop watch mentality continues throughout your entire meal. The overriding concern of Stephanie's seems to be to turn over as many tables as possible, at the expense of your supposed relax night out with love ones or friends. A relaxed and pleasurable experience Stephanie's is not ! ! !
