I have tried many Halal carts in NYC from Brooklyn, Manhattan and Queens with the highest rating. I have to say, this place tops all of them. The meat and rice just compliment each other and is not blend like many other places that need their sauce to create taste (like 53rd in Manhattan). I certainly recommend!!
