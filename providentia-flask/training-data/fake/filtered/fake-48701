Went here for the first time and I must say I'm definitely going back. Its cute and small but yet a comfy place. Althoug it was busy upon arriving they were very attentive in making sure to get us seated as soon as possible. We ordered the chicken empanada and the cheese empanadas...can you say delish!!! Can't wait to try out the others. I dont even eat guacamole and I literally chowed down the plantain chips with it....once your start there's no stopping lol. Everything was cooked to perfection....thumbs up Empanada Mama!
