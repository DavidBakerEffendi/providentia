The food here is fantastic! The other day they had a special: slow-cooked ribs, warm potato salad, coleslaw, and of course...a biscuit. Delish! Normally I only get the sausage gravy biscuit and chase it down with an Ithaca Flower Power. But they always have great specials! Also try: cheese grits, pancakes, root beer & rum, beer flutes (choose up to 5 different beers), and their fried pickles. They have endless amounts of beer! Fun to go during the day when you can sit outside, as well.
