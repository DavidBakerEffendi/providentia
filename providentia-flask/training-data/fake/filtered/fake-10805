We happened to be at CHOP today, taking my son for a doctor's appointment, and decided to so something fun after and checked out how close this place was to the hospital - we were in luck - right around the corner. We all had different burgers - they all were up there with some of the best we have ever had.  The fries were just awesome - crispy, not greesy, just perfectly salted.  My mouth is watering and I want more already.  I loved the fries!  The onion rings were good.  Milkshake was good. A few different sauces at the table to try on the fries and burgers - I expected them to be spicy (they were not) but they were tasty and I liked trying them all.  The burger sauce was the best, to us. It was spotless, the service was super friendly and nice.  Trendy decorations.   It was about $45 bucks for 3 burgers, 2 fries, 1 onion ring, 2 sodas and 1 milkshake.   We would certainly go back.  It was worth it - it was much better than average.
