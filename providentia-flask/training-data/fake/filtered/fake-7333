This is one of those places that's a total dump, but a great dump.  We found a place to sit quickly and ordered the bacon cheeseburgers.  They were just a tad overcooked, but they were great.  Lots of flavor and really juicy.  The tomatoes were a little under-ripe, but hey, it's only March.  Overall, a great find.  I'll definitely be back!
