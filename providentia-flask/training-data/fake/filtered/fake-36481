I've had to wait 5 minutes when I was the first person in line as the door opened at 5pm.  Now that's crowded. I go at off times to avoid the wait.  Like the minute before they close or just as they open.  But it's worth it.  The classic and modern ramen is insane.  Like liquid pork. But  definitely add the extra pork belly.  Yummm.  And do yourself another favor and get the pork buns.   This place blows Momofuko out of the water - but I still go there because I don't have to wait so long.  If only they opened more of these around the city...
