Well I ordered from Sitar yesterday via Grub Hub for delivery. My husband and I were in the mood for something different and decided to give Sitar a go. Let me say that according to the reviews that I read it swayed my decision however having ordered I can't agree with what I read and believe that some of the reviews may just be fictional. We ordered at 6:40pm we did not get our food until 8:30pm....2 HOURS Later!!!!!!!!!!! We called the restaurant two times and were told that the food was on its way and the third time we called that they would call the driver because the food should have been delivered. Our concern was as to whether or not it would be hot. When the food arrived it was warm but definitely not hot which of course is not want anyone wants when ordering take out. Being that we were hungry we ate it but I can tell you it was not worth $32.00 at all. In my opinion it was just okay. Perhaps it would be better in person but I will never know because I do not plan on finding out. Sad that my experience with a new option was not a good one guess I will stick to basic take out in the future....
