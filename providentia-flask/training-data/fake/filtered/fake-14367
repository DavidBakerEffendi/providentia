A great ending to a great day.  Tried Rita and Joe's after reading reviews as I wanted a place close to Ellis Island attractions without having to go into NYC.  This is a little known gem on the Jersey side of the Hudson that competes with Little Italy.  Rita still works in the kitchen and greets guests.  The marinara sauce is out of this world.  They need to patent the recipe.  Everything has the taste of homemade freshness.  Service was outstanding -  attentive, efficient, friendly and quick.  As a family of 5, we did not have to ask for anything.  Go early as it starts to get busy after 5:30.  And don't be afraid of the neighborhood - they have their own parking lot across from the restaurant.
