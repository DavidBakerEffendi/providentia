I have been here several times and have never been disappointed. From the great food and service, Nai does not disappoint. I recommend their mango sangria, which I have never had before until I tried it there, along with the octopus and ham croquettes. Their desserts are just as good, with the creme brulee ice cream or the almond tart.
