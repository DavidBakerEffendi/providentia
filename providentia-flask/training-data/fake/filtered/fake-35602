I was so happy when Café Boca Ciega opened a little while ago. I work a block away on Broadway and have always wanted to try different coffee shops. The walk up window makes it super convenient to grab a cup of coffee when you are on the go or in a hurry. The guy behind the counter is very nice and makes an excellent iced latte.  The Cuban coffee I tried was also delicious.  They recently started selling Cuban sandwiches which I am very excited to try.
