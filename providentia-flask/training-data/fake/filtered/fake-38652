Perfect place to meet up with a friend or a group if you're craving home cooked Italian. It's not pricey and the portions are just nice. Great location too so never get the touristy vibe. Thought I really recommend Galli more for lunch; dinner gets a little over crowded so make sure you have reservations on the weekend.
