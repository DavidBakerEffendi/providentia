Barbara's Hungarian is a wonderful restaurant. The food, service, and hospitality were SUPERB. We drove from Philadelphia and we weren't disappointed at all. The portions were large and the prices were very reasonable. The cucumber and red cabbage salads were very tasty and refreshing, the stuffed cabbage and pork paprikas was excellent, and the cherry strudel and crepes were yummy. We would recommend this restaurant to anyone. The food was authentic and reminded us of our trip to Budapest.
