I go to Fuel a few times a week.  One of the better Center City lunch options.  The "High Protein Grilled Cheese" panini is a winner.  You have the option to go gluten free with any panini if need be.  Keep one thing in mind though if you are on a diet -- bread is NOT factored into the calories and Weight Watchers points.  It says it real small on the back of the menu.
