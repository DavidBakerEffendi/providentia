I have been eating their buffet lunches since they opened it in 2005 (?).(It use to be a pizza place.) Their price is reasonable. I have probably eaten there for around 200 times! I keep going back. I am vegetarian and they have a lot of veggie options. On weekends they have more options on their buffet. I am leaving New Haven soon and I will miss Sitar.
