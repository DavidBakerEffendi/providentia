So I was glad that it was just your average pizza shop experience after reading some of the reviews.... I had been there for slices before and it was great !!! Just ordered a calzone and although I like my calzones to  be less like a folded over white pizza and more like a calzone that's just my opinion . To most there is no difference between the two.  IMHO this place is tied for second place in pizza with Sophia's..... can't wait for bite me to reopen.....
