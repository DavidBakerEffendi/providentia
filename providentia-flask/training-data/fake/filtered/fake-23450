Lunch breaks are never long enough but Cabana really understands the intricacy of a business lunch. So I'll keep this review as short as my lunch. Cabana has a great and delicious lunch selection. We had our food out minutes after ordering and the cuban fried chicken with the rice dish I had was amazing. I don't remember the last time I had Cuban food, but I'm hooked now. Would definitely come back here for a sit down lunch.
