What has the world come to when these "cute" little breakfast joints think they can charge 12 bucks for some bread, a slice of cheese, a hardboiled egg, a pinch of ham and some lettuce. Don't forget the "large" 12 oz. coffee. Outrageous. I understand overpriced food in brooklyn heights is easier to come by than dirty hipsters in williamsburg, but come on. Actually forget the price, even with the price this place would have gotten 3 stars, but what really kills me is the try-hard hipster who grabbed my sandwich with her dirty bear-claws (no gloves) and threw it down on some brown wrapping paper. Did wrapping up my take out sandwich in brown paper and some fancy string make it worth the 12 bucks? no. and I nearly threw up watching that greasy try-hard manhandle my sandwich. Worst part is i spent so much time waiting for them to piece together this simple snack that I was hungry enough to eat it even after seeing that buddy holly looking chick nearly ruin my sandwich. Good thing the kitchen is completely open and you can see all these wooly-hat wearing clowns piece together simple "creations" with their grubby hands. if you love over-priced, try-hard food, with "creations" like "hungarian breakfast" (not hungarian at all by the way, just sliced apples, a slice of cheese, and some cold cuts), then this is the place for you. If you are a normal person find a place with just as much character that isnt highway robbery.. or just stick to dunkin donuts.
