I can't speak to the quality of the food here, as I've never eaten at the restaurant and my story is slightly unconventional, but I can't compliment the staff for their kindness and dedication enough. I actually am living next door to the restaurant for the summer. During a late night out, I let a friend borrow my keys to store something in my apartment; he told me he left the keys for me to pick up in the plant outside the apartment. The plant happens to belong to Bistro Le Amis, and when I returned home at 3:30 am, they had taken the plant inside, so I was locked out of my apartment for the night. The next day, I went to the staff of Bistro Le Amis and asked their help in locating my keys. It turns out they have six plants, not one, and three or four of their staff helped me search through every one of their plants (including shaking them vigorously in front of some amused patrons). Finally, we found them. Not a word of complaint from them--in fact, just smiles and sympathy. Oh, and the food smells from the place that waft to my apartment are always great, too.
