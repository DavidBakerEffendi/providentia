My girlfriend and I were looking to try a new place for Sushi last night that wouldn't break the bank...  We decided to try Doma.  It was delicious.  I started with the Tartar trio with Salmon, Tuna and Yellowtail.  She opted for the seaweed salad.  Then we split 3 rolls.  2 simple and the soft shell crab special roll, the name escapes me.  I really like the fact that you can add spice or crunch to any roll!.  I will definitely go back to try some other specialty rolls!
