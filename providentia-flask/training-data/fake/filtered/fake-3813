Great place!  Tonight was out fourth meal in the last 12 months at Mes Reves and I had to write a review.  My wife and I had the mussels, the gnocchi and a salad as starters.  She raved about how light the gnocchi was.  For entrees I had the Steak Au Poivre and she had the pork tenderloin.  Both were done to perfection.  We also ordered a peach souffle and creme brulee for dessert, also perfect.  (The soulffle was peach heaven...)  The chef/owner also graciously brought us a small portion of the sauteed skate, free of charge, just because we were curious and asked about it.  Tonight was pretty much like the other times we dined at Mes Reves, that is, an upscale dining experience at a reasonable Bloomfield price.  We will definitely be going back.
