Shocked that a sit down eatery had NO REST ROOMS!!...Was furious we were told NO,we have no public bathrooms...Isn't that illegal?...we now get our cheesesteaks across the street at Chubby's whose sandwiches are actually bigger AND better...Great fries too...Besides that they provide restrooms for their customers,who they obviously appreciate much more than their ungrateful neighbors...Also open on Sundays...Chubby's RULES!!
