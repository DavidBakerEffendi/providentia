Hudson Clearwater was recommended by a friend and what a great recommendation it was. Let me say first that it was not hard to find at all, despite several reviews that stated it was. When you enter you find yourself in a delightful outdoor patio area. I chose to sit inside at the bar and was pleasantly surprised with the friendly attitude of the entire staff and especially by the bartender Grace, I took her suggestion and had a cocktail she called the Lila Jane. What a delight! I started with a salad, burrata cheese and followed that with a snap pea appetizer which was delicious. At the suggestion of Grace I tried the ribeye steak which was fabulous. My surprise was that I could find absolutely nothing to complain about! Everything was cooked perfectly! To conclude this meal I had the berry shortcake, wow! Price was average everything else was above average!
