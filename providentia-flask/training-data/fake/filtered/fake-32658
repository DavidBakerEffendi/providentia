I always heard great things about pub but i was optimistic so i finally decided to check it out for myself on a Saturday night and let me tell you it was as advertised the atmosphere was great the bartenders were very uptempo,friendly and most importantly fast. They also have a great menu full of different things, you dont really expect great food at a bar but you should expect it here they have everything from finger foods like chicken fingers to full diners such as chicken parm with pasta (which was great by the way). Also the music was AMAZING! the dj's name was freddie z and hes there every Saturday he played mostly house music as well as classics. But overall you cant help but give this place a perfect rating they nailed every aspect of what a bar should contain and i will deff be going there on a regular basis.
