Well, I am sorry that I have to say that there is nothing else can be worse than their service is....... Even though the food is good, the beverage, such as Thai ice tea and coconut juice, is extremely sweet to the point you can barely tell if it's tea, juice or just a glass of sugar syrup..... 2 stars is the most I can give..... If you are practicing patience, or training for a peaceful mind, go to this restaurant.
