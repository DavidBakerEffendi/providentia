Visited Brooklyn recently and stopped by House of Small Wonder. Everything was wonderful including coffee. I ordered French toast which came with fresh fruit and the best syrup and real whipped cream. Everyone in our group loved their selections. Staff was very friendly. Very unique atmosphere with a tree growing inside and lots of natural light. Can't wait to return on my next visit!
