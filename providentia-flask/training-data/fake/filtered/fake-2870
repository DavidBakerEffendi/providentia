I'm very, very disappointed to say that I was turned down on Saturday after being told that they would be able to accommodate a party of 25 people when I called twice the week prior. The hostess was extremely rude and quiet racist, she flat out told me not to cop an attitude when she was the one who was obviously dishing it. Needless to say, I don't plan to come back an provide them with business, which is quiet the shame since I do like the food and ambiance. Damn shame the management SUCKS!
