My friend and I went to Fogo for restaurant week. This was our first time there. I enjoyed peple watching and gazing at the chandeliers and wine. It did get a bit too noisy in there at times. As for the food, everything was great except the bacon wrapped filet and chicken were way too salty and not tender. The mashed potatoes were instant, yuck. But I LOVED the plantains! I also enjoyed the mozzarella and salami, oh olives too on the salad bar. Key lime pie was tart and refreshing after eating all of that meat. I would only return during restaurant week or another promotion. Not sure I want to spend $50+ regular. My mojito was way too weak also, skip the cocktails.
