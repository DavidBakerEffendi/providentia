We came there yesterday and were agreably surprised. The place is very nice and the food and the wene were just perfect for us, french! If you want to have a clear overview of french cuisine, you should totally go there. The brie with black truffle and the foie gras were delicious! Good chat with the chief-cook/owner who took time at the end of our dinner to tell us the history of his restaurant!
