The food here is awesome. There are a few EXTREMELY busy periods throughout the day, typically around 1 and 7 from what I've noticed. The line does get very long sometimes but it tends to move quickly because they have a lot of employees. My only gripe with this Chipotle is when you call ahead to place an order you usually still have to wait for a little while when you get there, but I'd say it's somewhat understandable considering how busy it can get.
