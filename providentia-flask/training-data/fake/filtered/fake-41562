the food is great, the place is super loud especially for a Monday night. The waitresses try to hurry you along since there are no reservations and the more they serve the more they make. A server spilled food Â on my dress...that sucked, thank God I was with my husband and a good friend. If this was a date or a business meeting I would of been horrified. They gave me a glass of wine...I think I should of received at least a bottle of wine for that but I did not want to make a scene since the food was soooo good and I wanted to enjoy it. I would definitely come back only for the food...not the service.
