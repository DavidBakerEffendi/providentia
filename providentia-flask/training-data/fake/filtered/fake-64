Perfect Flamenco performance. Good food, but not enough. It's ok just order more, more more... Delicious Sangrias. This place is not good for a first date..., I guess it's obvious. The music is loud and there are too many distractions. Else, it is a perfect place to chill either solo or with a group of people.
