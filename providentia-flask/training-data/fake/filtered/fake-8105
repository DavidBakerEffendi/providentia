They staff was out of order, confused, and mixing up orders. They seemed annoyed at the customers for the staffs own incompetence. It just doesn't seem like rocket science to make a sandwich, what's going on here? Â  In the end the food was okay, but the wait screwed up my palette. Might only try it again when they had no costumers.
