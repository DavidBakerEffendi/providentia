Simply the best for Ramen in the city. Ask for Kae-dama when you run out of noodles. I used to live down the block and this was my go to spot. If you are persistent, you can be seated at the bar after 9 relatively easily, and watch all the action in the kitchen go down. If you are with a large party, come early and expect to wait. Hit up Decibel, Angel's Share or McSorley's for drinks before...it is worth the wait.
