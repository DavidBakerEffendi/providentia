This place used to be our favorite until it's recently fell into a decline. The attitude is horrid. Last time we were sternly told that we could not sit at the table we've sat as that was spared for 3 people. It was laughable as the two twosome tables were opposed and could easily be detached. Besides it was 6:00pm and 75% of all other bar tables were empty. Riposo was elevated to a fine restaurant not a bar anymore although all they offer is bar setting and bar food. Unacceptably arrogant for a place of mediocre food and wine...Cheap attitude comes with not so heap menu. But, thanks to the attitude we discovered Sambuca wine bar next door which is a few levels up with similar prices, better food, civilized treatment
