I tried the cheddar and bacon sandwich and my husband had the tuna melt. Both were amazing!!! The quality of the ingredients is top notch!! We wanted to try everything so we also made room for the tomato soup and  tater tots!  Grill cheese and tomato soup takes me back! It's comfort food only better!! Finished off with ice cream sandwiches!! All fantastic!! Can't wait to go back!!
