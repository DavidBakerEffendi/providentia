The best place to meet someone for a drink. I suggest snagging a seat at the bar and flirt with the staff over martini's and oysters. I always meet my dates there before heading out into the night. The best pub crawl I have ever been on started at Balthazar, then moseyed to Raoul's and ended with a bottle of Rose at Bar Pitti.
