Stumbled upon this place when trying to find something less expensive and "healthier"  in the area on a Saturday night. The food was really quite good and the staff was amazingly friendly and attentive. The owner even checked in twice and let us sample some cheese and spinach puff pastries for free which was a nice touch.   The steak stix was by far the winner of the night between the chicken and other dishes but I must say everything was pretty delish.  While the cocktail I had was good, it was lacking some booze, so I will just skip that next time and get a drink down the street.   For the price of the meal though, it was a good deal considering the quality of the meat and sides. Just be sure to order more than one skewer to avoid leaving hungry.
