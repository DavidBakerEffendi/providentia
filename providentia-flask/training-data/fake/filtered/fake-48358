I grew up in South Jersey, and as kids, my brother and I would beg my parents to make the 35 minute round-trip trek to Pat's at least once a month. Those cheesesteaks were awesome, so my parents usually complied with our request. That was in the mid-1970's. As I got older, we continued to go through the 1980's. Fast-forward to 2013, my wife and I were passing through near Philly, so I decided to take her to the famous Pat's King of Steaks. Boy were we disappointed. The meat was bland and even the bread was tasteless. It absolutely isn't the same great cheesesteak that made them famous. They're basically just mailing it in at this point. Sorry Pat's, but we won't be coming back anymore.
