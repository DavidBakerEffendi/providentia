originally we wanted to go to Totto Ramen, but because of timing we were not able to go there and found this place on yelp! =) my friend and I are glad we gave this place a try! the wait was not long. the place is busy and loud with music and the shouting from employees about dishes? it got a bit annoying, but eventually you can learn to ignore it. anyway, there were many choices on the menu and everything sounds so delicious! my friend and I ordered a lot of food for two people, unknowingly that you CAN NOT doggie bag any food! so please make sure you can eat all the food you ordered and not waste food! ;) the appetizers of fried shrimp was ok normal cocktail kinda dish, the pepper could have been better, but the BUNS! my friend had the veggie and i had the pork, man they were delicious!!! we even craved the buns everyday for 3 days! it was that good. Though the pork bun was a bit too fatty- at least the ones i had, a bit more lettuce than one sheet would make it 200% perfect! I'm not a ramen fan, so the ramen was alright, but the soup was very tasty! ahh, dessert: we had the green tea brulee and anin tofu w/ green tea ice cream, both were delicious! i cant wait to come back again!
