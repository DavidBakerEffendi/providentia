Fish Market I went in on a Friday to order a 6 lb. side of wild salmon for Sunday...it was $29.95/lb. When I went Sunday morning to pick it up I needed to ask for ice. ....OK....then I asked for a cold bag.....he said I could buy one ....and that they where out at the fish dept. and I could try to the meat dept. I was spending $187 on a piece of fish and they could not give me a cold bag!!!? When I was more insistent he asked if I wanted to speak to a manager , yes I said....then he walked over to fetch someone. The 'manager' apparently told this guy to give me a bag. Finally I go to the checkout counter where the kid says ' do you want this delivered?.....all orders over $150 have free delivery " So I could have avoided $20 in cab fares and had this delivered on Sunday morning had they on Friday asked or informed me of this possibility. While the fish was very good the service was Â quite marginal and I will never buy fish there again nor recommend anyone going there. I wrote to the web site after this happened and never heard anything from them . Very poor service/very high prices
