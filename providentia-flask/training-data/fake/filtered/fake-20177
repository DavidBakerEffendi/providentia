This place seems strangely over-rated.  I mean, 5 stars means top-of-the-line.  I like Cafe Katja, but its not top of the line.   Its a small, narrow place.  Very prone to over-crowding quickly.  Decor is nothing to write home about, and service is a little too casual.  The food comes out quickly however.   Our server was from Down Under, not Austria, Sweden or Germany.  My goulash with spaetzle was quite good.  You don't see spaetzle often, and when you do, its rarely authentic.   The beer selection seems pretty big.  I enjoyed my time at Katja.
