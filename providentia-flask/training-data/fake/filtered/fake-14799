I recently celebrated my birthday at Centro and had a really wonderful experience.  The service was impeccable and they seated us immediately even though we had additional people join our reservation last minute. The food was delicious!  We started with an order of antipasto and oysters and both were awesome.  I ordered the scallops and they tasted excellent and I was really surprised by the large portions.  Other people at our table ordered the salmon, steak, and crab cakes and everyone was pleased with their selection.   I highly recommend Centro Grille and look forward to returning again soon!
