ooooverrated!! waited over an hour to be seated.  waitress was a bit...not rude, but certainly condescending.   was with a table of 7 and we ordered a ton of stuff to share.  most dishes ranged from "too salty" to "not bad".  really, nothing was BAD but nothing was INCREDIBLE either. for the wait, the hype and the price - this place was thoroughly unimpressive and i would say NOT worth the trouble. if you're in the area and have money to spend, i'd recommend Diner, next door.
