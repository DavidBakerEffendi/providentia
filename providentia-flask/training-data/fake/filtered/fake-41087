I arrived with a classmate who I have not seen in many years at 4:30 PM on Dec 28, 2010. We did not have reservations but were promptly seated by a courteous staff, at a table of our choice. We ordered wine while we browsed the limited menu. Soon thereafter we were asked for our orders. We requested an additional 5 minutes since we were indulged by the excellent wine. We placed an order for pizza with the selection of topping recommended by our waiter.  The service was excellent but the quality of preparation of the pizza was poor; it had the consistency of cardboard under some very decorative and delicious toppings. The music selection was too loud and unsuitable for conversational dining. This cafe clearly emphasis rapid turnover of customers and is not meant for leisurely dining. This is another establishment where you pay for atmosphere and not selection and quality of food. The deserts are of small portions and overall the café is an overpriced fast food café with fine wine.
