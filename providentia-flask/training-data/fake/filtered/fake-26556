We ate at Mesob after walking past this restaurant for years on our way to our favorite movie theatre. We were initially attracted by the interesting appearance of the place from the street, the interesting cultural decor, etc. Also it seems to be always crowded with happy diners. So we decided to pay a visit on a date. The food was interesting and very tasteful, and the staff was just suberb, very friendly and helpful, considering there are no knives, forks or spoons, you eat what is served Etheopian style, by picking it up with a spongy-bread that is made from wheat and 'teff," a type of grain. I loved the experience, and I would not hesistate to return. Also important, the coffee was great. I am a fan.
