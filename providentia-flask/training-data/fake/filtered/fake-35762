If you are looking for a place to go watch a FIFA match while enjoying a meal do not choose this place. I was extremely disappointed in the service of Bleeker Kitchen & Co. First off, they advertise outside that you can come watch the game, while you eat. We were constantly rushed through making a deicision in what my friends and I wanted to order and on top of that rushed through our meal. We weren't even done eating and the server came up several times and asked us if we were done to take our plates. Our server was extremely disrespectul to us and kept getting annoyed when we told him to come back in 5 minutes. There were two italian people sitting next to us who also were irritated by the rushed service and kept telling them to relax and to come back in 10 minutes. The worst part about the dinner was after we were done and paid the server, he came up to us and told us we had to leave because people at the bar wanted to sit at our table and I made reservations in the morning to get that table. It is unfortuante that they mislead their customers into believing that you can enjoy and relax while watching an exciting soccer match but instead they kick you out during half time. I highly reccomend to avoid this restaurant. It looks like an amazing place to eat but the service is awful!!
