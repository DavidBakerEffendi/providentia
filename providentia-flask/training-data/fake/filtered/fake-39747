My husband and I went here for our anniversary. The space is very nice, different, and interesting. I loved the decor. The outside space was very nice as well, We started with the Gnocchi, it was fantastic. I got the only vegetarian entree which was the Roasted Winter Vegetables, Farro Risotto, Bitter Greens, Black Walnut and Pomegranate Crunch. It was also delicious. There were many layers of flavors and textures. My husband had the Lamb, which I did not try, but he was very happy with it. We got the mini cupcakes for dessert which were fine, but our entrees and the gnocchi starter far out shined the dessert. All in all, our meal was exceedingly delicious. We will definitely be coming back!
