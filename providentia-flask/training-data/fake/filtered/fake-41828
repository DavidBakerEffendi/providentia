I'm really not sure why everyone raves about this spot, it's always a huge disappointment to me. There are many better halal stands in the city and even more in the surrounding boroughs. The chicken is dry and flavorless and the texture of the lamb was not appealing to me. The rice was ok, but again, I've had much, much better. The prices are slightly higher than others as well.
