My boyfriend and I walked here for their Happy Hour. We were so happy we did, it was such an enjoyable experience. They only had one kind of oyster for the happy hour and we didn't mind that at all. The appetizers I saw other people ordering looked so delicious. The man behind the bar was like a magician with how beautifully he was preparing these dishes. They give complimentary popcorn seasoned with truffle oil or butter? (I can't remember which exactly, I just remember how much I liked it) I ate it all. A different bartender came over and I asked if he could make me a sweet kind of cocktail. He was the best, he brought me back something he said he was working on. It was the most delicious cocktail I've ever had. I ended up ordering another. The decor was really cool. There is one table in a sort of alcove that I wish we had sat at. I'm definitely coming back here.
