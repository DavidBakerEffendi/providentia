Disappointed!!  I am an Ippudo fan.  I go to Japan every year to visit my friends from Waseda, and to eat my Ippudo ramen in Takadanobaba.   But this Ippudo is not what I imagined. * Where are all the extra ingridients that are usually readily available on the table?  I talked to the waiter and he said that they feel in the US people will just abuse it by taking too much of them.  I disagree.  I am paying $15 for a ramen (when in Japan it's like 700 yen), and I would expect to at least add as much garlic I want.  It just doesn't taste the same without all those special ingredients. * Where's my cool Jazz music? * Where's my special Ippudo ice tea, that washes away the slightly oily Tonkutsu taste after the meal? * How come I can't choose the hardness of the noodle like Japan? * The noodle tastes differently. Overall, I mean, I don't except it to be exactly the same, but I would expect at least the same kind of service, where these essential ingredients are available to customers.   Buttomline, go to Japan to have Ippudo.  It's too bad I still need to do this.
