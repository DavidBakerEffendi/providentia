Crap.  Pure crap.  From the moment I walked in to the moment I walked out, this was one of the most horrific restaurant moments I have ever had. The staff was rude and unprofessional.  The food was something I wouldn't feed to my dog.  And the prices were out of this universe. Don't get me wrong, I love Cowgirl in the west village, but this new place is shit.   Unless you enjoy emptying your bank account for a plate of shit, and get insulted while you're doing it, avoid this place by 25 city blocks.
