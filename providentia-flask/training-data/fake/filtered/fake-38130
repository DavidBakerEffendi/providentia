They think that they're super cool people, but actually being very rude to customers. I don't care what kind of 'cool' attitude you guys have, I just need a good coffee and nice customer service. The same day, I experienced great customer service at Starbuck in the morning, then I walked in this place hours later, and it completely ruined my mood. Conclusion: If you wanna act cool(like you don't give a damn) at work, do not work in a customer service industry.
