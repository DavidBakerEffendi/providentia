First of all, my real name is Jorge Menendez Esteban-Zarzuela. I have traveled and Bogota "Bistro" serves the worst chimichurri sauce I have ever tasted. Even worse than my ex wife-sister. I came with my brother and we had not seen each other since "operacion masacre" in '56 (or '58, my memories are drowned in the authentic chipotle of my ancestry). The mango margaritas was fantastic and our server (a cute red head of Polish decent -- a very proud people!) delivered the pitcher with great smiles. We did not have the bunuelos or the tacos de pescado or the french fried or the octopus (which was not on the menu, but would have been wonderful) but I cannot recommend for he with taste of travel. My brother had not eaten in many year and loved it! We will be back, but to a different restaurant of a similar contextual. Love Always, Roger
