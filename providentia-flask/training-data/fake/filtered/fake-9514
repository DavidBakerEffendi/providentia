Gave it a try after a couple year hiatus after disappointing visits but the NEW MANAGEMENT seems to know how to do it right.  We had a scallop platter for two which includes scallops for two, fries for two, cole slaw for two and two small beverages.  Not only was the portion perfect for two, it was all DELICIOUS!  I would give 5 stars except it seemed like a long wait for those who ordered after us.  Our order was up pretty quickly but others waited a half hour or more.  We will most definitely go many more times over the season!
