The lobster roll here is to die for!! My go to at this place was always the Salmon Crepe or one of their daily specials but this completely blew me away last time I went. Seriously, the best Lobster Roll I've ever had. It combines all of my favorite parts of eating lobster on a warm summer- fresh corn, a small amount of mayo, big pieces of lobster claw, lemon and some herbs to add a dash of freshness. Unfortunately, I think this dish is probably seasonal which means I only have a few weeks left to enjoy it.
