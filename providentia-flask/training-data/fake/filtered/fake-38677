I am the owner of several restaurants in Florence, yesterday I was invited to this Restaurant by some dear friends from Chicago and others from New York. I appreciated the kindness and professionalism of the staff. I love restaurants that have "open kitchen", where you can see all the staff that works, for me is like being in the theater! Our table ate some good mixed starters, and after I had a steak, excellent in cooking and presentation. We ended with dessert, I recommend the olive oil cake , amazing! The wine list is very good, we drank "Soffocone" IGT Toscana, will be back soon!
