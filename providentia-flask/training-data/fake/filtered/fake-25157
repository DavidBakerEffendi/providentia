We were just here hosting a 30 person birthday party. We had a great, great time and haven't heard one bad word from any of our guests. The staff, especially Sal (the owner) and Aaron, were extremely hospitable and welcoming. They made us feel at home and passed that comfortable environment onto our friends. We had a prefixed menu, which was delicious and priced fairly. The restaurant is completely accommodating and a perfect place to have a party. The only complaint I have is that they didn't wrap the left over food for us to go... but we were having such a great time that our mind wasn't even there. I would definitely come back here, for both small and large parties, and whole-heartedly recommend the place. I can't wait to come in the summer and enjoy the hookah :) Thanks to Sal and his staff for making us and our guests feel at home!
