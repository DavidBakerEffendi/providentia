Not the worst food out there, in Dos Toros's defense. The prices are good and the food is decent. However, I have the fortune/misfortune of being from Texas, where the Mexican food is homemade (if you go to the right places) and phenomenal. It's really tough to beat. The chicken quesadilla isn't horrible. The smokiness in the chicken is pleasant. There isn't a whole lot of cheese, which isn't necessarily a bad trait. There's just no kick to it, like proper chicken quesadillas ought to have.
