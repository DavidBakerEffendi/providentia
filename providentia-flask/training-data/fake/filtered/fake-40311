Cheryl's makes my absolute favorite brunch in the whole entire world. There are a ton of reasons I'm sad I moved away from Brooklyn, but looking at the pictures of the gorgeous wood-paneled walls and unbelievable pancakes makes me wonder if I miss Cheryl's to a truly unhealthy degree. If you find pancakes more fluffy and incredible than Cheryl's, please tell me where! Everything I've had for brunch there is delicious. Notably: salmon hash, french toast with caramelized apples, a brie-and-apple omelette, a brie-and-fig baguette sandwich, and did I mention the BUTTERMILK PANCAKES with mixed berries and chantilly cream?! The staff are always kind, funny, and attentive. The space is beautiful (although too small for the crazy-busy brunches! The wait can be long). The patio in back is such a lovely surprise in the summer. Dinner is also delicious (and not crowded!), but ideally I would wish the vegetarian entrees were a little more interesting. They have moroccan vegetable stew and a portobello burger - both are delicious but underwhelming creatively. Overall: Pure love.
