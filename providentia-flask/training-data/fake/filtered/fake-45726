I went to GTC last week with my sister, we had such a great time. We had heard lots about it, and are both great fans of Jose Garces. We were greeted promptly by our waitress, NINA, she was very helpful and enthusiastic. Our options were a little limited, my sister is a vegetarian, but she helped us pick the perfect meal and was vey patient with all our questions. The food was amazing as we expected from chef Garces, however some of his other places don't have such friendly service. The wine store was a perfect place to browse while we waited for our table. I was a little dissapointed with the dessert selection, it looks more like a pastry list not a dessert menu. Although they were good, I don't think they match Chef Garces food. All in all, I will be back for the amazing food and friendly service!
