For as many times as I've gone I still can't pin point what I like most about it. For some reason my mood totally changes when I walk in the day. I'm always on the go and usually eat to fill my stomach but this place makes me want to chill out and enjoy my company. On a typical sunny day this place brings in a steady crowd. If you happen to go at a really busy time, don't shy away because the wait. It's always shorter than what they say. I'm a pasta guy and there you can't go wrong. Their flat bread pizza works perfect for a mid day stop with a glass of wine and good conversation too.
