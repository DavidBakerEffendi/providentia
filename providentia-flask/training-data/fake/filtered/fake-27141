Everything here are amazing, my favorite are the lamb skewers, squid and shrimp! They are so tasty and fresh! Some other people mentioned that the price are a little bit higher than other restaurant but when you compare the size that other restaurant offer, you will think the price is very reasonable. Beside of the skewer, you must try the hotpot here. The broth of the hotpot has so many favor! You cannot find a hotpot restaurant in Philadelphia taste as good as TT Skewer's. Definitely recommend this place to everyone. It is worth of the money.
