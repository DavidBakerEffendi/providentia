Having travelled globally including Paris, London, Rome Dubai, Shanghai etc thus will rank as one of my favourite understated meals. Having been in New York fir 5 dys the food has till new been awful to mediocre usually confusing Â quantity with quality. Tonight we were so pleasantly surprised to have perfect sized portions of well cooked and presented, what I feel is equivalent to 2or 3 star Micelin rated. As well as excellent food, pork belly and exquisite cod and cinnamon and apple, plus a melt in the mouth chocolate box. The service was genuinely warm friendly and helpful, not the insincere have a nice day we have had until now! Till today we had exhausted our good will towards New York food, cuisine and good manners, now they have been restored to the top table, well done Vitae!!! Joe from London
