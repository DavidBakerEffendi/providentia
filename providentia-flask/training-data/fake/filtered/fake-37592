I've been to Falansai twice, and really like it. The ingredients are fresh, the portions are generous and the place itself is very welcoming. They've done a nice job of selecting wines that complement the menu, and the wait staff are very helpful. I'd highly recommend the Dad's shrimp rolls, which were cooked to perfection. The lemongrass pork chop was also delicious and full of flavor. I was skeptical about the catfish, but it turned out to be fantastic. This is about as true Vietnamese home cooking as you're going to find in New York.
