The waitress was very nice, but not personable. She mumbled which kills me but did her job. The margarita, ehh, definitely had better. I had the taco and enchilada combo. The taco shell tasted stale and whoever rolled the enchilada made a mess, then tried to hide it with cheese. I liked the salsa selection though, and the chips were really fresh. I didn't like the rice, no flavor. And I asked or refried beans and they only had black or pinto which is okay. Not blown away, had better. El Torero even after it's moved to West Haven still takes my vote on Mexican food.
