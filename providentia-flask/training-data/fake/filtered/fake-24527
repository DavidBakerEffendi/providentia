I laughed a bit to myself when I read some of the earlier reviews of Joe's with tales of food other than the dumplings... Who tries the food other than the dumplings at Joe's?!?! Well, I guess a bunch of people did, and that's what we have these reviews for! Joe's is actually a chain, and the Chinatown restaurant isn't the #1 store... I'm *told* the location in Flushing is the one where the reputation for soup dumplings came from. This one in Chinatown is obviously more accessible (and infested with tourists) and has great dumplings, and then there's the red-headed stepchild of Joe's, up in midtown... Maybe there are more, but I haven't been to them. Go straight for the dumplings. They're fun and challenging and delicious all rolled into one, and it's enjoyable to go with a group of friends and pile up the steamer containers towards the ceiling as you gorge your senses and tummies with those little soupie dumplings!
