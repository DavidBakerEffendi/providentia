Can't beat the $15 beer and burger on Sundays.  And what a good burger it was too.  They give you an unbelievable about of fries but they are perhaps a little overly salted.  The table we were sat at was pretty much too small to actually be able to look at the menu but that didn't matter as we both knew we wanted the burger.  Service was good and very friendly.  Will definitely go back.
