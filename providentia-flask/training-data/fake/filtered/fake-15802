The Food was pretty good, not great.  I had a brisket sandwich with Mozzarella cheese, peppers, and onions.  It was pretty good, though the brisket was a little dry.  Had a good tasting matzoh ball soup to start off with.  Sometimes its good to get the food quickly, but in our case, it wasnt.  As we were halfway into our soups which arrived five minutes after ordering, our dinner came.  We had to send it back because we werent ready for it.  I wonder if the brisket was affected by having to sit for 10 minutes.   I was unsure of the Cheesecake because of the cake-like crust.  I have to say that the cheesecake part is outstanding.  It was one of the best plain cheesecakes I've ever had.  That being said, I definitely prefer the graham cracker crust for a plain cheesecake.   Overall, Id give it a 6.5/10
