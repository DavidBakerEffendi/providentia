The food revolution in NY is over. I just had a totally mediocre dining experience at Minetta Tavern. It is so boring I felt like I was dining in a room with a bunch of extras in a movie that would never be made. The much over-hyped Cote du Boef for two reminds me of the worst meal I ever had (in Hawaii on the Big Island near the volcano) it was totally devoid of any beef flavor and had zero meat texture. It makes me wonder if Bruni got a fat envelop on his way out. The apps. and dessert aren't even worth mentioning. Amicable server but really didn't know much but a very good looking store.
