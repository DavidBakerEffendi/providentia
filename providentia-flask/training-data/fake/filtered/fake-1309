Nice family restaurant located off of 206. It was a little hard to spot at night time when we were driving in. It's located in a house looking building on the first floor. The seating is limited, and when we arrived looking to be seated, we were confused as to whether the line was for individuals who wanted to order at the counter or for those who were waiting to be seated. There was also no host to greet us or provide direction as to how to go about being seated. We finally had to flag one of the waiters down to seat us. We ordered the buffalo chicken pizza, which was amazing. It's LOADED with pieces of buffalo chicken, with real bleu cheese interspersed. It was extremely filling, so I could barely eat more than 1 slice. The service again was lackluster, as our waiter didn't return to check on us or refill our water until the very end of the meal. To their credit, the restaurant was extremely busy as we arrived on Friday night for dinner. The restaurant itself was quaint, with packaged Italian food items and desserts lining the walls for purchase (including Nutella, of course). The restaurant seemed like a great place for family and friend gatherings, as there were numerous large parties seated around us that were enjoying their meals and drinks (as we discovered, this place is BYOB). Overall, despite the service, I thoroughly enjoyed my dinner and would definitely return. I look forward to trying the Brooklyn pizza next time, which other patrons were raving about around us. Great restaurant for date night!
