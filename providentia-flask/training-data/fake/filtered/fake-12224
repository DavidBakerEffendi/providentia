This place is incredible!  I can imagine Bun, (the chef) appearing on Iron Chef and winning the competition.  I ate at Cafe Americain, Bobby Flay's restaurant in New York two days before going to Miya's.  Miya's was far better.  Sushi at its most creative and delicious.  I can now die a happy woman!
