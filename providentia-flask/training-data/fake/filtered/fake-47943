My husband and I just love this restaurant.  We have been dinning here since it has opened.  To us Tapas (small dishes) means each small bite must be perfect!   Ibiza never fails to deliver in either the taste or presentation of each dish.   I love the quaintness of the restaurant, the vibrant colors on the walls and the artwork.  The staff never fails to welcome you warmly whether it is your first time to Ibiza or if you are old friend.  The menu offers a great mix of hot and cold, modern and traditional selections as well as daily specials. .  Tonight one of the  specials was a pumpkin and butternut squash soup that was outstanding.   This is a wonderful neighborhood gem.  If you are looking for special dinning expierence please give them a try, you will not be dissapointed
