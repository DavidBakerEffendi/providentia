the workers are rude especially the owner. u have to wait too long for service even though there will be a worker standing there dong nothing. i went to order a cake ans i showed a picture of exactly how i wanted it to look, the lady quoted me a price and Â paid then i get a phone call from them saying the price is now TRIPLE what i was quoted and paid. i tried to explain to the owner that its not my fault that the lady who took my order didnt understand me. i have been going there for 5 years and spending LOTS of money on cakes and pasteries BUT NOT ANYMORE!! the owner treated me like garbage and said she didnt care about all the cakes i have purchased from her! so i told her i will come and get my money back and talk to her but when i got there she ran out the back door!!!
