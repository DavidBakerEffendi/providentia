I took my mother there a couple weeks back.  We both ordered the tender combo with the health salad and the creamy cilantro sauce.  The amount of food was more than we expected and was a fair amount of food for the price we paid (I think it was $7.75 per meal). As far as service goes, I was impressed when one of the owners waited for us to get out of our car so he could hold the door open for us.  He asked if it was our first time there and explained the menu to us.  When we were looking at the menu, the girl behind the register offered to let us sample the dipping sauces to help us decide on our order.  While we were eating, the co-owner came out and asked us how the food was, took our trash, and chatted with us briefly.  We felt very welcome there. The space is small and intimate.  It has a very home-like feel to it. We're happy to see a new, small business open in Hillsborough.  It's great to have eating options that extend past fast food chains, pizza, and Chinese food.
