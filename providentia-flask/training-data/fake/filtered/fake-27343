i really want to love the food, is good but do not order from this place unless you want cold food that you wait for one and half hours. first time, ok , it took over an hour but we ate it, second time it took 1 1.2 hours and i had ice cold dried out rice with cold shrimp, eww . Cold food for 2 people at 10;10 pm for 40 dollars, not worth it. If i wanted crappy food, i could order for half of the money anywhere in NY.
