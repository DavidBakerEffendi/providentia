Whiskey is my drink of choice, and as you could guess Village Whiskey has them all. Great atmosphere to go relax, sip a fine whiskey or scotch, and talk with the local crew. The burgers get all the attention they deserve, and yes, they are on the pricey side, but you knew that before you walked in. It's Garces, you pay, he delivers. -John Wiederman
