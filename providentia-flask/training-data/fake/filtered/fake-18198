Decoration is nice and pleasant environment, food wise forget about it, terrible quality and very pricey, used to be good food but it seem that they are more concern about the decoration that the food quality, not reccomended, try elsewhere if you want real thai food, elmhurst have tons of good thai restaurants. beware of only cash polcy they have there.
