I've been here a couple of times..and ehh, it's okay. It's not the best sushi BUT it IS affordable with their half off specials..which is pretty much everyday! My fav is the Ashiya Special Roll..mm! I really dislike the staff though. I went there one night with my cousins..and apparently there was about less than 2 hours before closing. They started to rush us to the point where we couldn't fully enjoy our meal. Once we received the check, pretty much all the employees were near the door getting ready to leave AND by the time we left..they already turned of the lights and was locking up. Seriously. They were pretty rude too.
