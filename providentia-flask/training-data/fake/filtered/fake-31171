I can not stop raving about this place!  Food is delicious and fresh!  Service is very warm and attentive.  I ordered the falafel as an appetizer and wow, they are fresh, you can taste the parsley and other spices with the minced chick peas.  I had a vegetarian platter with babaganoush - good and smokey tasting, mujadarah - lentils and bulgur - very hearty and tasty, and the cauliflower which has been fried to tenderness but not too soft.  Everything was wonderful.  My companion had a chicken shawerma and loved it, said it was very flavorful. Oh and you must get the baklava for dessert -  freshly made and with lovely rose water in it.  I will definitely be back soon.
