There is no other place that I would even consider buying Spinach Pies than South End Bakery.  For 40 years, I've been buying the combo pies, spinach, potato, sausage, ever since my grandparents took me there during the Italian festivals that were held during the summer.  Being raised on spinach pies made by Mr. Salvatore and now his grandchildren, I look forward to stopping at every opportunity possible, even if I'm an hour away!
