Go. Now. Get the lamb over rice. Here's your sauce line up - smother it in white sauce, put some BBQ (yes, I'm dead serious, it's bomb) and literally this much ( Â ) of the hot sauce. WORD OF CAUTION - the hot sauce here is the hottest thing that I have ever experienced. More than literally a drop the size of the spout it comes out of will destroy the food and your mouth. So please, please, becareful. Now go. Drunk or sober (drunk preferred).
