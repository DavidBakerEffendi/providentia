I am a little iffy on this place - if you know exactly what your spice number is, you may be ok....but apparently I did not!! I enjoy spicy food, but this took it to a whole new level.  Food was good (from the tastebuds that survived the spice), service was good, and atmosphere was pleasant.  Btw, I had the spice level 8.  All the other guys at my table seemed ok, but too hot for me....going for a 6 next time.
