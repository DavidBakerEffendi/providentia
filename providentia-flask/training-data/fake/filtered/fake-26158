Awful customer service! I called to see if there was waiting list. The man said no but suggested I make reservations. I then asked if he had any reservations left for the night and his answer was "there are several, the first availability being 7:15" I then said ok and went on to give my information for a reservation. It was at this point that he interrupted me to ask whether I'd be using any promotions like Groupon. I answered "yes" and his reply was that he couldn't honor any more Groupons as they already limit themselves to honoring 7 Groupons a day. With that said, I mentioned that my Groupon would be expired tomorrow and thus needed to use it today, unless he would be willing to honor it tomorrow. His response was that I should've planned better and not have waited to use the Groupon on the last day and that now it was too late to use the Groupon $40 promotional value. Again I asked him how he could turn away and refuse customers that minutes ago he had offered a 7:15 reservation. I was supremely disgusted with the horribly rude host and customer service.
