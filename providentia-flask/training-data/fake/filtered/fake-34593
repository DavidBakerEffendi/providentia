I can only say great things about the lovely fellows at Philadelphia Chutney Company. They had already closed the kitchen upon our entering on a wet and cold night, but graciously opened up again to serve us a hot dinner (it certainly helped that we expressed our lackluster experiences with Spice End). The dosas are delicious, amply portioned, and affordable. The service kind and friendly. We will return in short time and are so glad we decided to stop in. Thank you!
