Terrible. I waited over an hour for a burger with barely any standing room. My burger was so raw and uncooked that it was cold in the middle. Who eats white bread anymore??? Wish the fire marshall came in Â to see the crowd and\or the health inspector to see that there was a dog inside the place while we were eating... it was a pretty cute dog though.. the dog was the only thing that made this experience somewhat enjoyable..
