I had just an egg for breakfast, skipped lunch and waited about 2 hours before finally sinking my teeth nito the Margherita at about 9PM this past Saturday night. Given how hungry I was, you would have expected me to gobble up the entire pie within seconds. But something was off about the pizza. The crust was delicious but and the sauce was good but I think there may have been a bad batch of cheese or something. It just didn't taste right... I will definitely go back in the future because all of my friends say this is the best and maybe I'll bump up my rating if it's better!
