My husband and I have been wanting to visit this establishment for about 2 years now. This evening we went........... NEVER AGAIN! Once we walked through the door there was NO ONE to even realized we walked in. After looking for someone we flagged down a busboy who seated us with no menu. We waited for a few minutes when a waitress came by and asked us if we wanted menus? REALLY?! After receiving menus we decided on our dinner which was Linguine with white clam sauce and Chicken Savoy. After waiting again she came by and took our order and never asked us about our drink order, right before she walked away I ordered hot tea. We got our appetizer in a few minutes which was pretty good (shrimp beeps). No hot tea. No one came by to ask if we needed anything, bring the drinks, refill water, or take our dirty dishes. Waited an hour to get our dinner and we were only one of two tables there. Once we got our dinner my pasta was cold on top, mushy over cooked, clams were canned and the whole dish was dry, barely any sauce on the bottom. My husband's chicken was ok but came with nothing, just chicken. I ate a couple of bites of my pasta and pushed it away. No one asked if our meal was ok. Terrible service, terrible experience all together.
