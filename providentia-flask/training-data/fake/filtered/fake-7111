A friend of mine recommended I check this place out. I usually go to the lower lower side of Manhattan for good Indian food so I am now thankful to have found a good Indian restaurant so close to home. The food is good and consistent. Never had a disappointing dish. Pricing is fair for what you get. They also have a great lunch buffet for $9.95. My wife and I go to dinner here at least once a month. If you are a fan of Indian food give this place a try I don't think you will be disappointed.
