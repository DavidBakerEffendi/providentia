Decided to try mexican food in this restaurant. We ordered tamale of the day, that happened to be vegetarian. Tasteless... Arepa with grilled chicken - dry and bland.. . and we still wanted to give a chance to tacos with beef and pork. The meat was dry, and the whole taco was tasteless... Is really mexcican food without spices and salt and overcooked? Disappointing visit... We won't come back .. and do not recommend to anyone. And surely overpriced... All I mentioned above plus one glass of beer and the bill comes to 30 bucks...
