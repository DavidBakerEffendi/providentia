My wife and I went for a meal at the Peacock Inn thinking we were in for quite a treat. Unfortunately we left with a bad taste in our mouths, and not from the food. We both ordered the 21 day dry aged Sirloin medium-rare. When the steaks came out they were cooked well, so we both sent them back. Our table was near the kitchen door and from where we were sitting we could hear the chef banging on the countertop and screaming how we were "Fu*king idiots" because we didnt even bother to try the steak yet. Well needless to say these two fu*king idiots will NOT be returning to this establishment again! F- for terrible customer relations!
