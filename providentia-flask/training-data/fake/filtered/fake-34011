Modern is the place to go if you want unbelievably good pizza without the wait of Sally's or Pepe's.  They also have other food, which distinguishes them from the other places.  And takeout takes no longer than 20 minutes.  In my opinion Sally's makes a slightly better pizza, but Modern is a clear #2 over Pepe's.  If you want an enjoyable dinner go here, but try to take the time and try Sally's.  You won't be disappointed with either.
