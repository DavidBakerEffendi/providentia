2 hours notice, only 2 hours notice and this place pulled off an engagement party with 100 people.   Not only was the food out of this world but the service was unbelievable.  Thank you so much for not letting my future daughter in law's heart be broken.  Granted with the crazy winter snow storm on Oct. 30, 2011,  thus no power in so many places,  LUCE in Caldwell could not help but cancel this party.   My friends and family said this was the best food they had, better than many weddings.  BRAVO !!!   Grazi ' !!!!!
