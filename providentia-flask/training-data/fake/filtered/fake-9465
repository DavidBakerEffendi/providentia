I walked in and ordered a couple of roll combos to go. U1 had one table occupied--a couple. I waited a while to order, and ordered with the sushi chef. The chef reiterated my order and asked me to come back in a half hour. I thought that sounded odd, but I agreed. 30 minutes later, I was told that the order had not even been started. But no one else was eating in the restaurant. WTF? For whatever reason, these people were not interested in actually fulfilling orders or serving customers. Why not just close early? Had I known they would be this lazy, I would not have waited 30 min for nothing. They did nothing to make up for it. What a *waste* I will NEVER go back!
