I have been to Blue Elephant Trail countless times. It is my favorite thai restaurant in the Hartford region by far.  Prices are fair. I cannot commend them enough for a baby shower for my sister we hosted at the Blue Elephant Trail.  They were so accommodating.  Great atmosphere not to mention amazing food. Thank you!
