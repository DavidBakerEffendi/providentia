Geno's definitely has the best steaks Â in Philly. I admit that the prices are high, the xenophobia is off-putting and the location is tough to park at but the steaks are perfect! I always take cheesesteak newbies here so they can compare to other steaks they have around the city. It's a fun, touristy kinda place. The staff is all Philly....kinda rude but they love their steaks, As far as a day to day place to get a steak I would def not go through all the havoc of coming to Genos but its a nice treat once in a while. Just dont go on the weekends when the tourists are waiting in an hour long line. I prefer to go later at night after the bar, nothing is better than a cheesesteak at 3am.
