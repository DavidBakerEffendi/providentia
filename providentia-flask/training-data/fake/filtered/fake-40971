Absolutely the best pizza I've had in the United States! Second is little joes in santa Monica. The crust was perfect, the sauce obviously freshly home made, the mozzarella freshly cut slices not shreaded, and the pepperoni obviously sliced thick from a log of artisan meat. Simple, fresh and perfect.
