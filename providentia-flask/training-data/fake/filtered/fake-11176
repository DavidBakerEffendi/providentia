Being from an Italian family both myself and husband our grandparents were born there. We have been to Italy many times and have always loved the charm of the big open markets. Not only in Italy but all over Europe. This place is more hype than true to cultures of European style markets. It felt more like an over sized lunchonette than an open market. Sorry to be a downer but from someone who loves to cook and experience new tastes this is far from appealing. If you have good markets by you, you can find the same imported quality offered in this place and even with more ambience. I still cannot believe such famous chefs, restauranteers and cook book authors agreed to the style of this place. I am sure anyone anywhere given one glance at a real European market would be surprised this was hyped as one
