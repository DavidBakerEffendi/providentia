We travel from Lancaster to dine at one of Phillyl's best kept secrets.  This place is fantastic.  House made pasta, creative salads, melt-in-your-mouth veal, and BYOB.  Not only is La Viola a bargain, but it's GOOD!, i mean really good.  It's been on our list whenever we visit Philly.  Presentation is creative and excellent.  The wait staff has been there for years with little turn-over.
