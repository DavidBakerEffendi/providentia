I had  heard of lines lining outside of this place and was lucky enough to arrived just before the rush.  The plus side, the servers are pleasant, the burgers are juicy, presentation wise, clean, not oily, crispy fries, and air-conditioned.  The price is great for what the burger was, $5.25-5.75 depending on the type.  I opted for the classic.  The lowdown, fairly well priced burger, but not something a burger aficionado would dream about.   milkshakes are nice and creamy, and fries are crispy but are just fries.  Go to Whiskey bar for a huge amazing burger, I dub it the best.
