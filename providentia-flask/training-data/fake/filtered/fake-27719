This used to be a great pizza shop, now its been taken over by tourists. DiFara used to make a big New York style pizza with more upscale ingredients, now their round pie is half the size. I went here a few days ago and it was packed, pretty much all out of town tourists, took me 1 hour to get three slices. Their prices have gotten ridiculous. Its now 28 bucks for a pie that is half the size it was four years ago. This is not a good place to take a date because seating is a pain in the ass.
