I just looked at the current menu, and see they took the chicken mole off. Good riddance! Drinks were good, but drinks anywhere are pretty good. The chicken was a Â bloody leg, I have NEVER been served dark meat when I've ordered mole. Dark meat is cheap meat and for 25.00 I expected a breast. I ask for it, and they said they only make it with a leg. It was a bland bloody leg for 25 bucks. awful!
