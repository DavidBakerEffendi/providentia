This place is delicious, I absolutely love it. It is amazing to find a restraunt with such high quality concious ingredients. However sad it may be to be thrilled to find a restaurant that makes food out of food only. But and a huge horrible but is they do not post and i have not been able to find the caloric content or nutritional info for there food items. It is ridiculous and concerning the way they speak of the necessitiy of counting calories. If you are at all athletic or an athlete this info is very important, I am a serious athlete and medical professional that believes in exercise and healthy eating as the first step to curing ailments. And calories and nutritional info of food is extremely important to the process of being and staying healthy. Disappointed by the ignorant and arrogant response on the website to calorie counting, make me think they have something to hide.
