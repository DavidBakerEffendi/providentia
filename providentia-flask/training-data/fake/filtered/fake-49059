Food was amazing!  The restaurant is brand new and I was able to try Hibachi as well as items off the sushi menu.  Everything was top notch from the exceptional service, the skilled and entertaining Hibachi chef and other staff to the amazing interior decor and koi pond.  I have had Hibachi many times and this is by far the best I have had the pleasure to experience.  I am now a future repeat guest.  Thanks!
