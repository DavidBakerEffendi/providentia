Really was excited to try this restaurant - love that it's 100% vegetarian.  But our meal was nothing special. Service was good, seating area pleasant.  It's on the pricey side which I don't mind if food warrants it but I found both mine and my husband's meals to be no better than average..  I think I may be spoiled by my hometown palace, The Bee's Knees in Morrisville , which although not 100% vegetarian, offers absolutely delicious, creative food and supports many local farmers. I don't know where all these reviewers have been eating but in my opinion, there's much better food out there:)
