I have been coming to Baja's for over 5 years now. I often go there with my boyfriend because the food tastes great, is reasonably priced, and the helpings are very generous. This is the type of mexican food that has a rich flavor and authentic taste. Â We both really enjoy the salsa bar and freshly made tortilla chips, and I love their carne asada burritos. All in all its just a place to go to or take out from if you love amazing authentic mexican food without the frills or gimmicks of mexican chain restaurants.
