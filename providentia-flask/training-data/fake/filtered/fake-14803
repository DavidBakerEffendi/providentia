I am so happy after 2 failed restaurants, finally something opened up worth trying and it is amazing!! The food is excellent and offers something a little different Â to our area other then the usual Italian restaurants. The menu is reasonably priced for the quality of food and presentation. Also - the atmosphere is great. It's so nice to be able to come to an elegant, hip place for a drink after work or a Friday night, rather than another dive bar in the area. Some other reviewers have said the service was not good, and it does need a little work but they have only been open for a month so I am confident it will improve! Good luck, Centro!
