We have also received a menu in the mailbox and figured we would give them a try and we have always had a great meal. Â all food has been fully cooked and hot as we did pick it up. we have never seen this place dirty at all. the woman who manages the place is not so customer service oriented but the american workers there are always friendly and courtous. we used to be Baos customers but have favored this place for the past year on a monthly basic. i will continue to order from them !!
