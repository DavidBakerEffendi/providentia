Great meal. We ended up there on a whim this week and were quite impressed with the menu. We were further impressed when we realized it was restaurant week and there was a 3-course menu for $35. You would never had known it was restaurant week, there were 8-10 choices in each catagory (appetizer, entree, dessert). Food was excellent, portion sizes a bit hit or miss. My boyfrinds salmon tartare was literally laughably small, about a shotglass full. My mushroom consomme was giant. I would give them 5 stars but they gave us a table in the bar area instead of the dining room as we requested and we were told they were 'fully committed.' Normally I wouldnt care but we were the last table that came in the whole place, it was Monday night. Anyways, big credit to Riverpark for not cheaping out on restaurant week and giving us a true idea of their menu. We'll be back
