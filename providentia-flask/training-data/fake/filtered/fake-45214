The service here is implacable. Everyone at Rosa Blanca is so nice. The host greet you with the most warmly smile. But, one particular host stands out from the rest. I recall his name as Toney, as he kindly greeted and seated us. He gave us a welcoming tour of the new place and he was very thorough and informative. At first we assumed he was a manager. The way he dressed and presented himself was very stylish yet, professional. Very knowledgeable. Very attentive. Overall, the food was amazing and the decor was breath taking. Also, there is a lower level for private affairs. This is the exact thing we needed here in the heart of Philadelphia. I wish everyone at Rosa Blanca and The Graces Group all of the best. Thank you!!!
