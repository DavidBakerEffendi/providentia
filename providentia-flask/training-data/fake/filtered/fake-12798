I absolutely love this place! I have come here a few times now, and there hasn't been one thing I didn't like. Everything has been delicious and fresh! The staff is always super friendly, and I love trying all the different dosas. They have so many! My favorite is the pondicherry dosa :) Today I went in to get a pondicherry dosa to go. While I waited (which was not long), I had a sweet lassi. It was delicious! Very yummy on a hot day like today. Will definitely be returning :)
