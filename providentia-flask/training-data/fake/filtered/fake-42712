Tonight a friend and I had dinner at Campania Coal Fired Pizza.  We were accommodated by the seating we preferred by the manager Arnold.  The staff were polite and helpful.  My friend and I shared the Fried Calamari Platter with the delicious red sauce along with the Ortolano Pizza covered with tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, portobello mushrooms, artichokes and spinach.  The calamari was tender and fresh.  The toppings on this pizza complimented all the flavors of the vegetables as your taste buds differentiated each vegetable blending in with the fresh cheese and delicious tomato sauce. We each had a glass of Proseco wine served in a regular glass and not in a traditional wine glass.  This was a subtle hint that this restaurant is trendy, yet casual and wants their customers to feel at home.  The dishes of food are served  family style, which means just like an Italian household, there's enough for everyone at the table.    I recommend this new addition to Bay Ridge and wish it much success!
