Ramuntos definitely has one of the best pizzas in the area.  Their specialty pizzas are awesome but they've even managed to make cheese pizza taste better than any place else in the area.  They also have a large variety of other items like calzones, salads and subs.  I definitely recommend their garlic knots and cinnamon knots too! Their staff is very friendly and the atmosphere is fun (and includes a big screen TV).  When you go in their restaurant, you can tell the staff all really enjoy what they do and want to make sure the customers have a good experience.  My department at work purchased 4 different pizzas, garlic knots and cinnamon knots to try last week and they all said this incredible pizza.  Try it for yourself!!
