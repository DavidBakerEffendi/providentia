I am at the Steakhouse right now, and I don't think I would ever come back. I have been to the one in Nutley,  which I enjoyed and thought that this would be comparable. I was terribly wrong. I ordered a cobb salad which tasted sour and came without any dressing. There was also minimal chicken on it. Plus it came pre-tossed. Also we tried to order ribs, but the waiter informed us that "the ribs needed to be smoked and wouldn't be ready for another 2 hours." This place opened up a week ago,  so there are some kinks that needs to be worked out. But when the second weekend you are open there is a big football game on, there should be enough staff and the kitchen staff should be prepared to accommodate a large crowd. Very disappointed. Also, we had to get our own napkins and silverwear. Terrible.
