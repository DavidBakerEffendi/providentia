If they could stack up chairs and table, they would. I came here with a group of friends (7) and when we arrived there, of course there was a line. We were told that we have to wait 15 min and we ended up waiting 45min... They even let another group of 6 people that were behind us in the line go first. Still wondering why. Once we got in. We tried our best to sit without hitting every other people around us. This place is so cramped, unbelievable. Then comes the menu. A lot of french names, just because it sounds better... But does it taste better? Hell no! I had a basic salad. My friend's meat was overcooked. And two of my friends that took the chicken (the same dish) got food poisoning the day after... The service is really poor, no smiling please... They did not have enough wine glass, so we had to drink wine in regular water glass (the same you have at the school restaurant). This place is a total rip off, never go there!
