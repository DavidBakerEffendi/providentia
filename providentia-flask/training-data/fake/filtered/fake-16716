I moved into the neighborhood three years ago and this place has had more than a few changes in ownership, management and chefs. This time all three aspects have come together to score a home run! Chris the chef makes his own hot sauce in the kitchen and has new breakfast specials  that challenge my boundaries every day. The baked goods are really taking off in exciting directions. Today I had am almond joy cupcake that was mind-blowing.  Deep chocolate devils food cake topped with a thick schmear of decadent coconutty frosting with a sprinkling of slivered almonds and a drizzle of a vanilla sauce. SO damn good. The menu is heavy on breakfast meats, and bacon in general but for those who are Vegetarian please consider the veggie burger. The menu description does not do this burger justice. This is not some prefab boca burger on a bun. This white bean patty was at least 1/2 an inch thick, studded with carrots and other veggies, seared crisp on both sides topped with fresh al dente broccoli rabe and fried red onions. I had requested a smear of tomato jam to go with the burger and would highly recommend it as an add on. If tomato jam isn't part of your food universe yet, please get introduced ASAP.   Stop in more than once or twice and the staff will know you by name. Delivery is available from open to close and the owner has been amenable to setting fixed price brunch menus  and late night catering gigs to help support West Passyunk neighborhood activities. Seemingly overnight Grubhouse went from the kind of greasy spoon that serves hashed potatoes from a can to a culinary showcase locals can afford.
