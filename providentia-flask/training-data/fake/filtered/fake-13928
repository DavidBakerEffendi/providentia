Amazing food..  just cudn't get any better taste..I ordered chicken tikka masala and my favorite gobhi kofta.. which was recommended by the owner.. I just loved it..  every single person praised about the food.. so over all i will defiantly go for Punjabi Rasoi again and recommend more people as well..
