This place needs to expand.  I was there once on a Friday afternoon and no waiting.  Fresh everything.  I mean the pizza is still a pizza, but when all the ingredients are fresh, including the tomato sauce and the cheese, it taste refreshing, not to mention very thin crust.   The table is super small and extremely close to others.  You'll feel like you're going to start a conversation with the stanger sitting next to you.  And the waiters are not shy to give you the bill as soon as you're more than half way though the pizza, so they can seat other customers. I've try to get in on the weekend, it's mission impossible when you look at the line.  No matter what time of the day, if it's the weekend, stand in line.
