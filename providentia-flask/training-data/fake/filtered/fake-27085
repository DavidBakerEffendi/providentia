mama rosa has excellent food i love to eat out due to my busy schedule. i have brought many friends and co-workers to dine at the restaurant and all have highly praised the food. their menu speaks for itself as well as the many week end specials. believe me when i say i have experienced many itlian restaurants in philadelphia, new york and surrounding areas. it is not a fancy place but a "family style" atmosphere. the owner is very personable and professional. you do feel at home!!
