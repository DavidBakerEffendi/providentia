My boyfriend and I were in town for just one evening, and I was craving oysters (badly). Some friends recommended this place to us, after they had had a great time at the 99-cent oyster specials. Since it was 8pm, we had missed the special, but decided to go for it! Here's what happened. 8:00 We put our names on a waiting list, and were told we had a 15-minute wait. We explained that we just wanted oysters, and would be happy to sit at the bar. 8:15 Three tables were cleared, but we were not invited to sit down. 8:25 We were seated, along with 2 other couples who had also been waiting since 8. After we had been shown to our seats, the hostess ran off without speaking to us. 8:30-8:35 One of the other couples got frustrated and left. Someone brought us water, but did not speak to us. The hostess was on the phone. 8:40 I was so hungry that I couldn't wait anymore, and was so insulted by the silent treatment that I did not want to be waited on by any of the staff. We left and had the best ramen of my life instead. While we were waiting (and...waiting), another customer told us that she often eats at Wild Edibles earlier in the day, and that service is usually faster in the afternoon/early evening. She continued to sit patiently at her table after we left, but said she would be coming earlier from now on, and we joked that we should have called in a delivery and intercepted it as it left the building. It may be that the kitchen is too slow or small to cook large amounts of dinner food for crowds, and so they deal better with customers who just need oysters opened. However, that does not excuse the poor service. I might return during the oyster special, since they seem to have great variety--but if I recognize any of the wait staff, I'm leaving.
