My husband and I had dined at Fin twice before and absolutely loved it. So we were excited to return again a third time, and had super high hopes. Unfortunately, the service just was not up to par. We were seated right away for our 7pm reservation; the restaurant was quite busy but not full. Actually, my main complaint was how FAST we were moved in and out. The entire dinner was over before 8pm, and we had two appetizers and two main courses. The main courses were ready before our appetizers had even been cleared away. We had a bottle of wine and had to ask repeatedly to have someone refill our glasses. Somehow it seemed that only one person was able to do that, and that person disappeared. He finally came to refill our glasses after we were completely done with our entrees. On the food front, we were disappointed as well in comparison to our two prior trips. Previously we found the food to be delicious, innovative, and super interesting. We ordered two appetizers: "screaming oysters," which were actually quite tasty, along with tuna tartare (misspelled on the menu), which was fine, but nothing exciting, even though the server had recommended it as one of their best appetizers. My husband ordered the whole bronzino, which arrived overdone and bland. I ordered salmon, which I hesitated doing since I usually try to be more adventurous when eating out - but the description sounded so tasty. But it too was nothing to write home about - no real flavor, overdone, and atop underdone quinoa and black barley. On the whole: food was fine but nothing special, the service definitely left something to be desired, and we felt so rushed and disappointed - trying to turn over tables SO quickly and not paying attention to the ones they had. Off night, or growing too popular too fast?
