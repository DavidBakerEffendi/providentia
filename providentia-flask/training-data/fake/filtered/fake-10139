Bad comments and reviews? I don't understand any of them. I went to Beanas last night with my wife and  my two young ones and we had a great night. As soon as we walked in a young lady noticed our children and offered to sit us by the "kids section" (which I didn't even know they had). It was great for my wife and I cause it gave us a little chance to talk and relax. Lots of fun. The decorations are out of this world. There is so much to look at. I don't think anyone could take it all in in one sitting. The kids had chicken finger and french fries and my wife had a salmon dish that she loved (there was a great tasting yellow sauce on it but I can't seem to remember the name of it). I had a pork -pineapple marinated burrito with a side of this green spicy sauce that had a nice kick.  Towards the end of our meal the owner came over to make sure everything was okay. I asked him how long Beanas has been around and he replied with "over 17yrs" and I understood why.  My family and I had a great time and left full and happy.
