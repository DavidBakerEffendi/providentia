I like this place for certain things, such as their oysters and clams, and their whole fish.  Also their fried oysters are excellent.  Rest on the menu are hit or miss.  Lobster roll is pretty decent but pricey.  Linguine with clams was way too salty the one time I ordered it.  I recommend whole fish grilled and fried oysters.  Can't go wrong with that. Place is tiny and from time to time you are bumping into other people's elbows.  But servers are friendly and accommodating as much as they can be given the tight space they have.
