A few weeks ago I had lunch here. I got the chicken dish and it was truly terrible. I could taste that - instead of making fresh chicken - they used old pieces of grilled chicken which they dumped into a sauce.  The chicken pieces were stale, hard, and chewy.  It was one of the worst meals I had in a long time! I also have to say that very often the staff is unfriendly - they will make you feel uncomfortable if you are not refined enough to order wine with your meal. They have a haughty air about them, which I find very off-putting given that this is a restaurant in Princeton, which specializes in pizza; it is not  "Le Bernardin" in NYC.
