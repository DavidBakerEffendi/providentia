To paraphrase Ferris Bueller, if you have the means, I highly recommend dining here. The menu features a prix-fixe menu, consisting of twenty+ small plate courses. It is such a delight and each little plate is decidedly superior in each successive course. It's a savory way to spend time with friends or lovers imbibing in glorious morsels and wine, which you are allowed to bring with no corkage fee. The attire is upscale meaning you will see no baseball caps or flip flops. The expense is out of reach for some, but that is a good thing. There are very limited reservations and must be done in well in advance. Each night, the courses are different and you will never have the same combination of flavors again. This is fantastic as you never know what to expect and any preconceived thoughts of not being able to try everything on a menu quickly disappears or being stuck with only having the same item over and over as you really like one dish that prevents you from exploring the menu. There is a lot of seafood throughout, so be prepared for that or skip entirely if you have an allergy. Undoubtedly, one of the best experiences of the evening will be watching the preparation of the food. It is kinetic and the fervor which with the food is composed is passionately tasted in each bite. It is meticulously clean and all the details are in place as a quality restaurant should have. I would give more particulars but I wouldn't want to give away the surprise of it all. Please, do yourself the favor and experience the culinary experience that is Chef's Table.
