I've visited fernandes regularly whenever we have family celebration and this is our favorite restaurant.  I love to spend my money in a place where i get good quality food, good service, great atmosphere and plenty of parkings.  I get all of these qualities right here.  A plus about them, is that you get plenty of food with a great taste and a reasonable price.  If you're a good observer, you notice that the food is not frozen like many other restaurants. The meat that is fresh keeps it reddish colored and the vegetables are also fresh.  There is plenty of valet parking and a security guard is at the entrance of the place which make me feel secure in the Newark area.  If you are a wine drinker, their wine selection is huge. I can't say enough about this place, let me also mentioned their rodizio If you are a meat love get a group of friends with a big appetite and don't let me forget to mention their tasteful sangria, OMG!!!.  The location is not the best but it has its advantage because it ls located  at the beginning of Newark, close to the exit Holland tunnel, parkway, or 1 & 9. Great atmospheres and great service. my family favorite waiter is Valentine. Nice people and nice place!!
