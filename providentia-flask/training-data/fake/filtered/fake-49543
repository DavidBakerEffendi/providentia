The pizza is delicious! Fresh out and even if it has been sitting for a bit. Sandwiches and dinners are amazing as well. The cashiers provide good service and they're very nice, helpful, and respectable. Everyone working there is very nice. They're also open 7 days a week 11am-10pm! And, they have free wi-fi. It's a cute, quiet little spot that I recommend trying for yourself!
