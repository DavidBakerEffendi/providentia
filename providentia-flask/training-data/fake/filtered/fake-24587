This place should be 5 stars. The xiao long bao here is as good as the street vendors in shanghai. Lots of soup inside the dumpling, which is the authentic way to do it. The pork is the best but the shrimp is also ok. I've been here every time I'm in NYC, which is about 7-8 times in the past couple of years. There might be a line outside since the place is really popular. I haven't been to any of their other locations but this one is enough to satisfy my cravings. One more thing, the seating is combined tables, so you'll probably be seated with strangers unless you are in a big group of 7-8 people. Check this place out!
