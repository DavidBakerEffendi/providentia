I have been to Osteria several times, and have always enjoyed the pizza and very good attentive service, but...on my most recent visit on Thursday night with my sister I've decided never to return nor will I ever recommend Osteria to another again (as I have in the past),  being in the restaurant business I like to recommend other good restaurants to my customers. I have no complaints about the service, but the food aside from the pizza is bland and definitely NOT worth the price.  We split a pizza which being her first time there she was very pleased with.  For our main course we ordered the ribeye to split as we normally do in restaurants because portions are always a bit too large for one and leftovers never taste as good as when it's freshly cooked.  Well, they charged us $35.00 each to split a steak that we only ate half of our half portions anyway (the other half was pure fat).  After complaining to the server about this they said "sorry that's the way it is".  I didn't make too big a stink as my sister and I had a few glasses of wine and it would be inappropriate to fuss but WARNING the entire menu is over priced for the mediocre food that is being served and if you do have to go there I say stick with the pizza.  Being in the business and at a time when you would love to have as many return customers as possible that was BAD business practice!
