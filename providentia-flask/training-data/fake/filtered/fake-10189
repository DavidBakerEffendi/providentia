Amazing food and drinks (although a little pricey)!!!  The service is some of the best I came across in the NH area.  The pretzel nuggets that come with the cheese sauce is to die for.  Drinks are also one of their stellar attributes, with the barrel drinks being my favorite.  Although the menu changes often, the duck breast was probably my favorite meal there.  Definitely a must try.
