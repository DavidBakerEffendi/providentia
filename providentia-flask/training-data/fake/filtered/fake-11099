this is a GREAT restaurant! The food is amazing and the staff were top notch. My waitress Tina was surprisingly knowledgeable and polite and even the owner came over to my table to check how everything was, that really impressed me. The atmosphere is very relaxed, it felt like I was at my familys house having dinner! I would HIGHLY recommend Mafaldas to everyone.
