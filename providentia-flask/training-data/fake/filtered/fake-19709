The pizza was great, I shared the margharita pizza with my sister but I wish I had gotten my own to eat all by myself. The overall atmosphere was pleasant, and Saraghina is definitely a place both where the family can get together and have a fun meal and two people can have an intimate date by themselves. My only complaint is that while the staff was friendly, they definitely did not cater to their customers' needs during my visit. It took forever for our waiter to even notice we had finished our meal, and only then did he tell us that the place only took cash payments. We did not see any signs or indications that this was the case, and my sister had to leave and get cash from a nearby store. The waiters and waitresses seemed to rush between tables and overall Saraghina seemed very understaffed.
