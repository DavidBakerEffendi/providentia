Been here three times in 2 years. The ambiance is very cool. Bar is beautiful. Service was great. Server was very attentive. My lobster (85 dollars) was rubbery like a dog chew toy. I sent it back but after waiting 20 mins, I was starving and ordered the chicken which was very dry. I filled up on creamed spinach and drinks.....both very delicious. Left a great tip, the server didn't cook the food. They should just serve the spinach. Will not be returning unless they have a drive thru with the delicious spinach to go.
