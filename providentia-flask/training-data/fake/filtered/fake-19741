Our daughter and fiance selected Butcher Bar to cater their wedding at Galapagos in DUMBO last Saturday evening. From the get-go, Butcher Bar delivered, starting with a tasting of their out-of-site, up-state NY farm to table grilled pork and beef with terrific array of sides. The St. Louis ribs, pulled pork, and burnt ends were universally enjoyed; the baked beans, pastas, home-made mac-n-cheese, and salads made for a 5* buffet. Guests went back for 2nd's and 3rd's. Working with Catering Manager Kathy was all a client could ask for, she was accessible, responsive and cared that the event went off without a hitch regardless of any obstacles to navigate. PLUS, the PRICE IS GREAT, Butcher Bar does not rip its clients off and that is the reason they are a great business. Â Thanks Butcher Bar for helping make our daughter's wedding the wonderful, amazing event that it was.
