My sushi was awesome.  Still, I wasn't that impressed. First, lunch was really expensive.  Second, my friend had a bug in her food (NOT a "bad fish" bug, it was more like a mashed up fly)  Third, they got my order wrong - I think a language barrier issue.  This is a very traditional sushi place.  Not much in the way of "creative" rolls or offerings.  If you are looking for straight up missionary sushi, and you don't mind paying more than you would at other local places, give Ajihei a shot.
