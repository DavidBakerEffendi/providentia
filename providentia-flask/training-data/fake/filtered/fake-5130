A quick update that I do feel is warranted- The CEO did reach out to me to reference my email and this yelp review (to which he was displeased about). The gentleman offered his apologies, and shared with me the steps he was taking to rectify the situation with the staff at the Philadelphia location (new training, ect). He also offered a free dining experience, which I do greatly appreciate but declined. I wished him good luck in his efforts and moved on. Customer service at the top level seems to be quite responsive, a great plus but I do intend to keep my rating the same as it is based on my initial experience.
