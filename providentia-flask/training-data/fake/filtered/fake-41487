I dined at Fugi Mountain last night on the first floor. As I entered the restaurant, the sushi line greeted me with a yell. I was the first to arrive and as I waited for the rest of my guests I was asked if I wanted a beverage. I had called ahead and there was a nice table for 8 set up. However, I did notice that there were several walk-ins who were immediately accomodated around prime dining time (7:30 p.m.). I ordered the unagi maki (eel roll) and their special for the night, which was a lobster salad roll topped with walnut and almond crumbs. For appetizers, our table split their shrimp shumai which literally melted in your mouth. They were easily the most satisfying that I have ever had. My sushi was delicious, very fresh, and flavorful. Other members at my table had the sea bass, yuzu chicken, and beef teriyaki - all with positive reviews. The restaurant wasn't overwhelmingly loud so we were able to have decent conversation, but by no means was the restaurant empty. I would recommend this as a place for lovers of japanese cuisine - sushi fiends or otherwise.
