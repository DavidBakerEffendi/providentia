I would've never imagine that little corner restaurant to be so packed with people.  The restaurant is super small and tight. You literally  will bump elbows with the stranger sitting next to you. But the food here was great. I had the eggs benedict with canadian bacon (which tasted and looked more like ham) and it was amazing. The home fries that came with it was delicious, a little on the hard side though. For just $14.95 prix fixe brunch, you get a a choice of coffee or tea, orange juice and your choice of brunch entree.
