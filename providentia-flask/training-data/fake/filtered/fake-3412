I got the breakfast special, french toast was undercooked and soggy, scrambled eggs were OK. My girlfriend liked her chocolate chip pancakes. On my way out the door, I bought 2 stale old ass cookies as big as a frisbee for $2.15 each, what a jip, took one bite and threw them away. I'm not going back.
