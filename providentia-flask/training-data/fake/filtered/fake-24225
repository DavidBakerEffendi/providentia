They have good and bad. I try not to let the small things bother me at to-go places like this, because they may be having a rough day or whatever. I've been there about four or five times in the last year  (I don't go often, as there are better places in town, but it's closer to my house), and each time the service is atrocious. I wanted a slice, but I needed to pick it up on my way somewhere, as I was tight on time. (Plain slices, by the way, are VERY good. Any other slice I've had has been overpriced, and not exceptional. Just fine.) I couldn't wait in-store for it to cook, so I wanted to call ahead and have it waiting for me when I got there (I was about 3 minutes away). The woman put me on hold, which was fine. When she picked up, I told her what  I wanted and she wouldn't do it, they would need to re-heat it again when I got there because it would be cold, etc. I was three minutes away. Here's a customer, with money they want to give you, and you say no? A few days later, I wanted something to hold me over for a while (garlic knots). I stopped in, and there were about three people behind the counter, milling around, doing nothing, while there was one person at the register, one in front of me, and then me. The people behind the counter didn't ask if there was something they could get started for us, or aknowledge our presence at all. I decided that not going back because they wouldn't make me a slice is a little much, but I have never seen a lack of trying like that. They didn't pretend and make it sloppy, they couldn't be bothered to pretend at all, and that's unacceptable.
