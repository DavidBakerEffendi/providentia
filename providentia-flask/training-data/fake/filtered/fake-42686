If you are reading this... save yourself, it's too late for me, but save yourself. Chiang Kai-shek and Chairman Mao could agree on this... hideous. I can only assume that it has changed hands since the glowing reviews, or that the writers were suffering from MSG induced hallucinations.  OK, in case I expire before tomorrow, here are the details.   Cold Sesame Noodles... at least they were in fact cold.  Other than that, the closest this "sauce" came to sesame was if the cook said "Open Sesame" as he opened the lid on the jar and spooned this stuff on. General Tso's Chicken would make McNuggets ashamed to be chicken.  Some kind of ground up ersatz fat and chicken mulch that were liberally coated in some day glo red sauce, probably left over from a jar of Marachino cherries, with a pepper thrown in for "heat"... so  flavorless that I can't even comment on the taste, only the texture which I will undoubtedly relive in countless nightmares. And as reported previously, the "brown" rice isn't.  Unless tumeric or Soviet toxic waste counts.  Fail... utter abysmal fail on all counts.  Fail even by food cart standards... fail that makes the Edsel look like a triumph.   I walked the fine line between not wanting to go to bed hungry and not wanting to offer my thanks to the porcelain altar but the rest has gone in the dumpster... with a skull and crossbones on it lest a desperate homeless person be poisoned. Ugh... need to wash my mouth out... honestly.
