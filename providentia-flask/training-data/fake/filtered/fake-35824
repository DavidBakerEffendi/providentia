I've been coming here for years, and it has made me a total fan of East African food-ways. The flavors are robust and hearty and the atmosphere is warm and homie. Best place this side of the Hudson river. It's like a great family meal every time (at an Ethiopian household, anyway). The owners are great people too, so nice. I'll recommend this place to anyone. This is some serious home-cooking. Warning: First-timers, get ready to use your hands.
