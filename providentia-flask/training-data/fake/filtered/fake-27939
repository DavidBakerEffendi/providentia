This is one of the best restaurants in Nutley.  The garlic bread appetizer was delicious and the steaks were great.  We ordered the banana split for dessert which had the best vanilla gelato my husband has ever had. We had ordered the crab stack for an appetizer, which we didn't care for and the waitress removed the charge from our bill (without us asking).  I have never had a restaurant do that and it was much appreciated! This is a great little hidden spot in Nutley and we will definitely go back!
