Lupa's food has impressed me in the past.  But never its service.  And tonight was absolutely embarrassing.  My boyfriend made reservations for a 9pm table for two, and we were turned away at the door told that "you aren't in the system."  Of course, there is little we could do to argue with their apparently infallible "system" (and the people who use it), and the smarmy attitude of the boy at the door and the woman on the other end of the reservations line insinuated that we were trying to pull a fast one. Thank god that this city has plenty of excellent Italian, so we won't have to bother with the attitude at Lupa again.
