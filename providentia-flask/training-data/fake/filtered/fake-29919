Decided to call in an order and pick up some Chinese food last night. I dialed Big Wing Wah in Hillsborough placed my order and then was told, "You know we moved, right?" Â No, I did not. She then continued with "We are now part of Jumbo Palace." Oh No! I was pretty sure that I had Jumbo Palace ONCE and that was enough but it had been a long week, I was tired and hungry and decide to just go for it! Maybe the cook moved too? No such luck, never again!
