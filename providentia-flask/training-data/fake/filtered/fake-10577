The food was 3-4 stars and the service was 1-2 stars.  We arrived around 7 on a Monday night and the bar was pretty active with a happy hour crowd.  Nice atmosphere and my party of 4 was seated in a comfy big, leather booth.  By the time we left at 10, the place was completely empty.  Our waitress seemed pretty bitter from the start and refused to let us hold on to one menu after we ordered our first course.  She said they were short on menus (always annoying & especially odd because the restaurant was less than half full).  Anyway, it took awhile to get our food.  Ultimately, the meal was nothing that spectacular, but pretty good (we had a bunch of apps, flatbread, steak, burger, pasta).  It's definitely an extensive menu which is nice.  Finally, we were bummed to order the special creme brulee dessert only to find out they were out.  That left us to choose the only other option of a relatively mediocre apple crumble.
