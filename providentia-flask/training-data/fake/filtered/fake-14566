I have a gluten allergic kid who was dying to eat out. They advertised a gluten free menu. Yes, they have one. But you're pretty much limited to a gluten free bun and burger and a side of vegetables. They caused quite a bit of problem for me listing those "gluten free" fries on the menu with an asterisk noting that they weren't. Not really. They fry them in the same oil with every other flour coated substance. My son was not happy. The food, however, was good. Not great though. And the wait was rather long. Better just to drive home and make our own.
