The food was ok.  We were somewhat disappointed in the Berkshire Pork Chop.  The pork was cooked well but the flavor was fairly bland.  The staff was good but not great.  If you want a great meal, head the Scarpetta at 355 W 14th Street.  For roughly the same price, you will be treated to food that doesn't disappoint.  Maybe we just went to Locanda Verde on a bad night, but it was at best just an ok experience.
