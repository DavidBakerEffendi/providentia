Really bad service. Food was good, but the workers were so awful. They had bad attitudes and were rude to my table. One of the servers also handed me a fork by touching the part you eat with and then giving it to me. That's literally disgusting and once she did that, I was done. Would give zero stars if I could just because of the service.
