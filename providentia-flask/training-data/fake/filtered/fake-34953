This is my favorite place in New York! And it's not so much about menu or cocktails, but more for an atmosphere, and decor, and idea of a place "not easy to find"!  It's pretty crowded and loud, but you don't have to go there for a dinner with your fiancé. Just sitting at the bar with a glass of Pappy Van Winkle 12 or 15 and my favorite "Devils on a horseback" makes you feel great!
