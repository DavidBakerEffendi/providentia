This was the last spot we hit for our Pizza tour last weekend - and I have two words for you.......CLAM PIE. I never, ever thought I would ever say those two words together, and I was frankly scared to try it. After everybody was raving about it.....I decided to be brave......and HOLY CRAPPIN CRAP was it DELICIOUS!!! Â BE aware that they are cash only! They do have an ATM there just in case you do forget!
