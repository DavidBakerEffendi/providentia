Ended up here by accident and will be coming back on purpose - and often! Happy, clean, friendly atmosphere. Fresh, healthy, Â AMAZING food ranging from traditional favorites to more exotic ones. Very reasonable. The grilled calamari was light and delicious. The dolmades are hands-down the best I've ever had. Went with 7 people and had appetizers, main courses, and desserts and everything was perfect. Also loved the table visit by the owner!
