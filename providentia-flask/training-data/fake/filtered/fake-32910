Perry St is the best restaurant of Jean-George's. The food is delicious and simple. My favorite dish is the poached lobster served with lemongrass and kaffir lime broth. The decor is beautiful and romantic. I love the ambiance and the view of the river. Everytime I go there, the food and the service were exceeded my expectations. I highly recommended this restaurant
