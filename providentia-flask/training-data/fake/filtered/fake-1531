I've been to far better Chinese restaurants. Though there's not very many in Hamden, this is not as good as it gets. I got shrimp lo mein from China Chef not too long ago, and in my food, there were three long, black hairs. The shrimp roll I got was extremely greasy, yet all my food was bland. It is safe to say that I am never coming here again.
