Came here last night for the first time since friends recommended it to me.  The service is great.  Alyssa was our server and she did an outstanding job of walking my friend and I through the menu.  She took the time to explain everything, and her knowledge of the menu was remarkable.  Ask for her when you go.  As for the food, well it was everything my friends had raved about.  High quality food, fresh ingredients, and craft beer.  All of my favorite things in one place.  This place is a must if you like a high quality burger any day of the week.
