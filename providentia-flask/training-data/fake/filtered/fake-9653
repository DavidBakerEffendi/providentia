I came here with my friend a few weeks ago. There is a single Chef with his two kids, who from time to time help out with the serving and so on.  I must admit, I did some research and found that the food is actually rich in nutrition.  I am amazed at the quality of the meals. Organic and very rich in the needed nutrients. Will definitely be coming back here with friends and family. Very tasty meals.
