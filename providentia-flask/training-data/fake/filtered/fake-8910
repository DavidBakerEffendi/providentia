YES!!!! I'm two for two now with the chopsticks.. they have included them in the last two orders I have placed. Â I have noticed that they do not include the free soda for orders over $20, HOWEVER, they do give you a 10% discount each time I order through delivery.com. So that's pretty cool. It ends up being more of a discount than the price of two cans of soda.
