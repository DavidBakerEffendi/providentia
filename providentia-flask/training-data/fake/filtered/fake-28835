I visited this little gem on Saturday and was treated to some really good eats. I had the Creme Antiques French Toast and it was to die for.  My friend had the bacon, egg and cheese which I sampled and the flavor was phenomenal.  I did have a little wait for the food but it was well worth it to have all the items cooked to order. I will definitely be back for more!
