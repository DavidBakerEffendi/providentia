I love the pho at this place it def. has a lot of favor and it's quick. I am giving 4 stars for the service and because I like the flavor, but there are other pho places go close by that i think are just as good and the soup is less fatty. But hey if you don't mind fatty, this is a great place because there is plenty of parking!! The chicken pho is not suggested however because they are dark meat!
