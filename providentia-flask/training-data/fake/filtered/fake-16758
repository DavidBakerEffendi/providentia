I was totally over the moon. I'm from Baltimore, and have been looking for places like this here without much success. The food here is great, the smoothies and coffee are delicious, the atmosphere is perfect. I sipped on my amazing coffee drink, which made me over the moon by itself, and read through some of the articles in the magazines on a shelf nearby - articles about green alternatives, and a very informative one about how inventiveness may be squashed by the patenting process. There are lovely decorations around the place, it's very well-kept and friendly. As I was reading, a family of a couple adults and some kids walked in and were excited to order. The people next to me got vegan Philly cheesesteak. I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone - not just vegans and vegetarians. Delicious food and Great atmosphere meet!
