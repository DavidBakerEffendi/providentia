If I'm in NYC this is a must go for me even if Italy is much closer to my home. A Italian Food Market in an old Skyscraper Lobby. Huge, fresh and tasty. You will find a smalltalk market and grocery here, try the tomatoes, fresh like bought on the farm in Italy... When hungry start with the starter sampler on the marketplace, good prociutto and cheese served with figs and honey with a great white wine to start. Then move on as your taste is, Fish, Meat or Pasta. For each you'll find a outlet. But reserve your table before taking your starter, otherwise you'll have to wait an hour... Dessert is served at the bar area, espresso is great but not the best in NYC. They have a Rooftop restaurant also but never tried it. All in all a great place to go! You can even take Italians here and they will go out with a big smile!!
