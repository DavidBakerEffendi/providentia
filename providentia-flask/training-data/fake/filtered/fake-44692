What a wonderful place! The space is intriguing, peaceful, and lovely - tables, chairs and art from Material Culture create a unique and charming room.  Combined with the high ceilings, there is an Old World feel. And the food is special, the kind that delights your palate while making your body happy with all the goodness it's getting.  I had the San Francisco Cobb salad once, and the Mezze Plate another time (so much more than just a hummus plate!), both of which I've tried all over, and these were probably the best ever. Their gluten-free bread is also the best I've tried. If you're doing lunch on a weekday and meeting a friend, leave a little extra time to find parking.  Weekends, parking is easy.  But just GO!
