When most places are going out of business, Beana's lowered their prices to give people that extra helping hand . You walk into beana's Para Siempre and feel like you took a trip to mexico. Great people and service. I feel like they just invited me into their home for dinner. There are fun games and toys to entertain on their tables. The salsa is out of this world ( I wish they would bottle it and sell it in stores) When my food was served it looked like enough to feed me for a couple of days and then the taste was amazing. They serve everthing from mexican food, to fish preped to your liking and the ribs seem like they came out of a five star steak house. All I can say is that if you like small cozy places that has good food and makes you feel at home try Beana's Para Siempre (forver). Its been in Rahway for over sixteen years for a reason.
