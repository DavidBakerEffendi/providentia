I read through the reviews and was actually thinking of not going to Trattoria Rustica.  I'm glad we made the decision to go anyway. The price was good for Montclair.  The staff was very friendly and helpful with making dinner suggestions.   It actually felt like a very authentic Italian (Italy italian) restaurant. Great meal!
