THIS PLACE IS NOT KID FRIENDLY! My toddler was hungry and fussing and the manager told us that if he did not stop making noise right away, we had to take him outside! DO NOT EVEN THINK ABOUT BRINGING YOUR CHILDREN TO PERKINS! IF THEY MAKE ANY NOISE, THE MANAGER THROWS YOU OUT! HOW RUDE!!! It is illegal to discriminate against children, shame on you Perkins for hiring such a jerk! I complained to corporate and even though the woman on the phone apologized profusely and agreed that it was out of line, this was the only response I got "DEAR AMY ,AFTER SPEAKING TO THE OWNER OF RESTAUARANT WE HAS TOLD US THAT HE IS SORRY YOU FELT THAT WAY BUT HE FEELS IT WAS HANDLED THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE, THANK YOU LENNY". I was so unimportant as a customer that they could not even be bothered to spell check or use proper grammar to respond to the improper treatment that my son and myself received. Do not waste your money on these scum bags!
