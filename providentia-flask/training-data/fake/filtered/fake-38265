A Hidden Treasure. Delicious Food, A welcoming ,knowledgable staff, Nicely decorated interior, A great outdoor patio for nice weather, Ample free parking... This is a well run Family owned restaurant  / wine bar. We have now been there 4-5 times.. and have brought friends who are equally impressed. If this were in West hartford Center, there would be a line to get in every night. This Gem is nestled behind the main st buisnesses in Newington Center.   You need to look for it to find it... We are glad we looked !!!
