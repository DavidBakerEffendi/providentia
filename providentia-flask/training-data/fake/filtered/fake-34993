I tried Agricola Eatery for the first time on Saturday October 12.  The decor is excellent. However, the service was less than adequate.  It appeared they were understaffed for the afternoon.  There were plenty of open tables, but we were told they could not seat us, so we sat at the bar.  While we were waiting, another couple was seated by the host, next to us, and given menus.  We had to ask for menus at that point.  We were not provided with silverware, the waiter/bartender forgot what we ordered and had to ask us again, and we did not receive the appetizer we ordered.  The food is very good and I would try it again for lunch, as I don't mind paying for good food and bad service, but to spend more on dinner...not so sure about that.
