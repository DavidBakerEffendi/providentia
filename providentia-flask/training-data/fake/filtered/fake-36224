We go to Isabella's when we visit New York with relatives and the experience is always good.  The food is very  good but not out of this world and seems like the menu is more limited than what I remember.  When you are in New York you expect the food at this price to be awesome and although good, I think there are more places out there to eat at.  Portion size is decent but like I said, I felt like we overpaid this past time so going to try something new on my next business trip out in January.   The one other thing that really is annoying is sitting by the patio doors, people come in and out all night and it is noisy.  We asked server to lock the door and she did but they kept opening it and unlocking it all night.  Drove us crazy.   Wearing jeans is cool and fashionable but not for the wait staff, expected more for this place, like I said it has changed a bit but still decent.
