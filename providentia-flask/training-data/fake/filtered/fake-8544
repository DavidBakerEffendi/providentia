As a restaurant, G-Heav is certainly passable. The store's deli makes decent sandwiches; however, they sometimes cut-corners when busy Â (by microwaving the meat instead of grilling it). The mini-buffet has a wide array of delicious food... however, I doubt that it is very fresh (for those who care about the freshness of food; I can barely discern it, that is why I wrote in the subjunctive) as it stays in buffet table for the entire day. The grocery store carrys a disordinately wide array of items (a plus), but the items are over-priced. Overall, it is an o.k. eatery.
