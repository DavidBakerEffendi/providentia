My friend and I were visiting from Australia and really wanted to be recommended a restaurant that had good food but most importantly friendly/welcoming service. We were recommended Distilled and it was perfect, great food to share, great flavours, amazingly friendly service and really welcoming. Shane the chef was fantastic and has done an amazing job setting up such a fantastic restaurant. Would recommend to all ages Thanks for a memorable night Distilled
