When I left Birra, I would have probably given it a 4.  Food was good, staff was friendly.  a few days later I noticed that my credit card was charged for $31 instead of $20.  This wouldn't have been that big a deal, mistakes happen, although that is a pretty weird mistake when you think about the layout of a key pad...  However repeated calls to the bar over the past week and the only answer I got was "the owner knows you called he will call you back" have led nowhere.  At this point I have had to bring in my credit card company to dispute the charge. This shouldn't be a hard thing to fix, and the lack of respect on the behalf of the owner for his patrons will result in a lost customer and me telling everyone i know not to frequent his bar.
