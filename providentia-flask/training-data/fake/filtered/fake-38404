somewhat disappointing dinner. nice ambience and design of the restaurant, but: Sushi dishes are overpriced (28$ for an 8-piece futomaki role? Surely you jest), which drove us towards the "bowls" with set menu. fried pork or chicken over a lot of rice... Really nothing more than just OK. Misu soup on the side was good, egg custard dish Â was interesting as a curious. Nice presentation of dishes but left us unimpressed in terms of taste, texture, etc. disappointed to see that nothing of the subtleness and minimalist approach of Japanese cuisine came through these dishes... Service tried but could not make up for the rest.
