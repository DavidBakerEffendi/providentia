My best buddy and I went for a girls' dinner out, and she wanted to try Southwark because she had heard good things about it.  First of all, I love a place that uses purple well as part of its color scheme, and the exterior of this restaurant is trimmed in a dark purple, offset by a beautiful purple orchid in the window.  I found it a very welcoming introduction; followed by a friendly person behind the bar who greeted us and sent us in the back for seating for dinner.  We were promptly seated in a lovely corridor type of room that looked out onto a lovely courtyard where I will definitely eat in warmer weather.  Our server couldn't have been nicer.  The best part of the dining experience for me was the dinner.  We actually shared a  delicious  small plate of scallops that melted in our mouths, and then my favorite dish--liver!  I only order this dish rarely because I only love it when it is very well prepared; this dish was perfect! The liver was tender, not too well-done, and blended with, I think, apples or some fruit that just gave it a little bit of sweetness.  Oh, I could have ordered seconds and thirds!!  Anyway, I will definitely be back to this very, very pleasant establishment.
