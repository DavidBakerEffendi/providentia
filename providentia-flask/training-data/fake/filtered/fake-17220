I have lived in Boonton for over 30 years and have eaten in every establishment in town many times.  Delizia consistently offers a good selection of great food and they have a very courteous and friendly staff.  I think they have the best pizza in town. I highly recommend them.  I notice some negative reviews.  However, if they were truely as bad as those reviews state, they wouldn't always be so crowded.
