This spot is hands-down off the charts.  We found Hummus and Pita Co. about a month ago, after a deliberate search for good mediterranean food in Chelsea.  We have ordered from here several times since and also visited the location.   This is apparently the second location that they have opened.  First good sign, the restaurant is staffed by young people who seem to enjoy what they're doing - and the restaurant itself is surprisingly warm and inviting (for a fast food type place).  The food itself is even more surprisingly good - hence, the third or fourth time in a month that we've eaten from here.  I can assure that either stopping by the location - or via delivery - you will not be disappointed (save that delivery did take a while).
