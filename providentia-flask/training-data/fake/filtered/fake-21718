Fantastic place to come for a quick bit to eat.  Far from fine dining, just a quiet and quaint place but who cares?  You come here for the fantastic empanadas.  Some bars in the area even keep them and have them on their menu they are so darn good. And they put out a table during the 9th Ave food festival so look for it.
