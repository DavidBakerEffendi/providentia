I have heard wonderful things about this restaurant and decided to finally give it a try. My mother was nice enough to give us a certificate. It was my husband, my two children, and myself. I called a few hours ahead to make sure we had a table readily available. We get there just in time, and they have our table ready, which is a plus. We're seated and its literally right underneath their a/c. I kindly ask the hostess, may we have the other table in the corner or we'd gladly wait for a table, becuase the a/c blasting was freezing. She states she'll turn it down and leaves us there. We order appetizers and the kid's meals and our drinks. The food gets there and withing minutes it is ice cold. The plates are even cold. I kindly get the server, and ask her to please pack up our dinners to go and she looks mad/aggrevated. She doesn't even care to ask if everything is okay. Well it was not. Beautiful restaurant, food was delicious while hot, but service there was a zero. Still have a certificate for the restaurant and it will be going to waste.
