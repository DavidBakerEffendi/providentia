The food was flavorful but I have to say that the food is more fusion Mexican than authentic Mexican . From the salsa and guacamole to the quessadillas and sauted prawns that we ordered Â the flavors were leaning towards Indian. Prices are steep though but the ambiance is lovely and the food is definitely flavorful.
