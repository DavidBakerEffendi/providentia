Some friend drag me there for a pizza driven by all this good reviews: decor is the typical shabby cliche` New York place not Italian feeling but it works here. pizza??? I was quite exited and had great expectations, the place was busy and we wait quite long for our pizza, finally here it comes: The crust was thick crispy and chewy not a good sign,  the real pizza should be thin, crispy or soft not chewy, it also was quite small in diameter maybe that explain why it was thick! mozzarella left much to be desired. It was waxy, gummy, test and felt chip mozzarella from curd and not really a milky fior di latte that should go on a "real Italian" pizza, quality of that cheese was at the same level of an average pizza by the slice place.   I'm really don't understand how this place is rated so hi and had so many reweaves, or maybe I do but I want say it. Service was OK in line with a pizzeria/trattoria. Unfortunately it was not a good experience.
