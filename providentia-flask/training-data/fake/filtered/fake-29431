I used to frequent Adobe quite a bit years ago. Loved the place, food was great and the beer selection was unreal. However, the last 5 times I either ordered take home or ate at the restaurant, the food and service was sub-par. Now I point out 5 x's for a reason...like I said I used to frequent the place, so I didn't want to believe that one of my favorite places was not living up to my fond memories. Of course every restaurant has an off day...but this was ridiculous. Yesterday the food was just bloody awful and it was the last straw as far as I am concerned. NO TASTE whatsoever! I purposely ordered different dishes the last couple of times with the same result every time. Doggie bagged my steak and fed it to my dogs. Shame really...my friends and I will never go there again. RIP Adobe Blues.
