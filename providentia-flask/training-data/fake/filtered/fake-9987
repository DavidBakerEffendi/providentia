We were there Tuesday and liked it very much. The coffee was good and strong, and the portions more than sufficient. We arrived just before 12 pm and did not have to wait but there were many people there. I had a special  Brunch of The Irish and my husband had the lox & onion omelette  which we both enjoyed.  The quarters are tight but the wait staff is very nice. We thought the food and service were very good. We would certainly return.
