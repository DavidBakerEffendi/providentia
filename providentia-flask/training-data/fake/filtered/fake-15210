So I was on my way home after a long day and its usually impossible to find vegan food in Astoria past 9 pm and I had remembered my friend told me about this place. Let me just say. AMAAAAZING. I had never had Australian food before and wasn't sure what to expect but I must say I am pleasantly surprised. Not only was the food great but the service was lovely.
