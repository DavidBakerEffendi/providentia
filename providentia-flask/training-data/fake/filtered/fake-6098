The place has a good ambiance. Certainly very romantic, incase you are looking for a place to take your date out this holiday season. The food was good, especially the pho. If you have somewhat of a sweet tooth like I do, I highly recommend the spiced apple cake. I walked in around 7 and the place was packed, so definitely make a reservation for dinner if you don't want to wait 30 minutes like I did. The server was friendly. He recommended the drink Fig-a-tini for me, which was good. All those didn't cause me an arm and a leg like many other places in Manhattan would. That is always a plus. Bottom line, I will definitely come back.
