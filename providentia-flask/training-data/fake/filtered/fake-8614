Sought out Noodies based on the strength of Yelp reviews while in NYC. The great reviews were spot on. We were looking for great food, convenient location, and reasonable pricing. The first trip consisted of Mushroom Dumplings, Pad Thai, and Thai Fried rice a straighforward lineup that would tell the tale in short order. We found everything to be delicious, fresh and well prepared. I did this as a take out order and was pleasantly surprised with that very nice atmosphere of this small but stylish resto. The staff was very friendly and we enjoyed the first meal so much that we closed out our trip with a dining room visit. This time we had a couple of noodle bowls, again fresh clean flavors and excellent service. Very satisfied.
