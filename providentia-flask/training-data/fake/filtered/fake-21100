While I have enjoyed the food at Molly's many times, people with food allergies should beware of the whole family of Molly's restaurants (Molly's, Lui Lui's, and Jesse's).  On two separate occasions, after telling my waitress that I am allergic to tomatoes, my plate arrived with tomatoes on it.  They were unapologetic.  Recently, my boyfriend ordered gluten free pasta at their sister restaurant, and it was not gluten free (despite advertising a gluten free menu and the waitress writing down that it should be gluten free).  It is clear that this line of restaurants does not understand the seriousness of food allergies.
