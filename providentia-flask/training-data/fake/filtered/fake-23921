I agree with the other reviews.  This place is disgusting and it seems the employees don't have a clue what they're doing.  The place is confusing...is it a bar? a restaurant? a buffet?  Maybe the people who own this should pick one and try to clean the place up.  My table tried the "famous wings".  We too experienced cold middles and they were soggy.  After looking around at how filthy the place is, I'm surprised we didn't get sick.  Do yourself a favor peeps, go to McDonalds!
