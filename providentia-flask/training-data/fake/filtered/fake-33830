Fifth visit since they opened was New Years and it was excellent.  It keeps getting better.......service was perfect, food was awesome, totally enjoyed. The adjustment period of a new restaurant takes some time and effort and Carbone's Kitchen has resolved any small issues and tweaked where necessary........it was great previously, it is better now.  The atmosphere, the presentation, service, food, are a joy. You won't be surprised........you will be REALLY surprised. Love this place !
