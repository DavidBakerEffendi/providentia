I will never go back to this restaurant. I didn't think the owner was that friendly of a person. she looked and seemed like she didn't want to be there.  There was only one other couple there and we still waited 1.5 hours for our food. I ordered ravioli in vodka sauce and the sauce was watery and really wasn't that great.  I dont know what all the big great talk about this place is unless I didn't try the right thing, but I thought it was just okay, not enough for me to want to go back and try something else
