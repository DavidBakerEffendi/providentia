This whole in the wall offers great sushi at a reasonable price. (its Princeton and rent is high). The soup is hot all year around and the owners are two of the friendliest people. The walls are decorated with photos of their customers. The wait for food is short. I recommend the soft shell crab roll, one of my favorites.
