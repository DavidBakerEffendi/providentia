Just got finished eating at the "Counting Room" on N.11th ,wanted to watch the AFC game and it was only place on my block that had room for  viewing. While sitting at the bar I notice the nice decor and beautiful exposed factory beams.   I'm not a huge wine drinker really, but prefer hard liquor and beer, so instead my date and I order the grilled cheese. Once it arrives I notice the cheese melting out nicely, but once I bite into my expensive $12 sandwich I realize there isn't any in the middle, it's not really hot,  and two cloves of raw garlic sit lonely next to it. I'm not saying this place isn't good for wine, I'm sure it's excellent! It's has nice atmosphere, next time I'll have to try some of the other food items. Also be prepared they min $20 on credit cards, and the possibility of it being a bit brisk inside. (This could have resulted from their enormous grand ceilings).
