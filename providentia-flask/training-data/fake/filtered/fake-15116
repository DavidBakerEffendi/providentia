Freakin' Awesome!  Food, service, atmosphere; they have it all!  Props to Jen (mgr), Amanda, Sophia, Ashley, and if I forgot anyone please forgive me.  My cousin Ron (wine and spirit rep for Opici) said "If you like risotto you gotta go here!"   My wife and I were in town from the "left coast" for the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, it was a dark and stormy night and we had just finished watching them inflate the balloons in preparation of the next day's parade.  Wet, tired and cold we took the train to the restaurant and were quickly moved to the warmth of a cozy table and cordial table mates.   The staff was friendly and attentive.  Great wine selection (of course Ron was on top of that) we had a bottle of the Badge Pinot Noir!  Then we got to the food...great menu selection and they said "if you want you can create your own dish".  I built a risotto with Italian sausage, calamari, spinach and gruyere.  My wife had the vegetarian risotto.  We finished off the dinner with tiramisu and some espresso.   It's been 5 days now, we are back in Oregon and my mouth is still watering from the memory of our dining experience.  We can't wait to go back!  It's definitely worth the trip... and tell 'em Ron sent ya!
