i guess im not a distinguished ramen eater but nonetheless i was really disappointed with this place. very hyped. the broth was too porky and murky. the spicy ramen was better but still lacking a clear flavor. i felt like both of the broths were a mixture of too many ingredients and they were competing in my mouth rather than blending together in harmony. i also really didnt understand why the pork buns are so popular...it basically is regular piece of roasted pork smeared with mayo in a steamed bun. nothing special or extraordinary. the baby octopus was very pleasant though. full of flavor, clean, and a nice texture. i wont return, it isnt worth the wait!
