Without a doubt the worst restaurant we have ever visited!   We read the menu being offered for New Haven's restaurant week.  When we arrived we discovered that the menu being offered was NOT the one listed on the web. Two of our group ordered the Chicken being offered.  We received a large half chicken, two small potatoes and 3 small carrots.  We thought we ordered well!  The chicken was UNCOOKED, not just a little undercooked, but RAW inside.  We sent one back, the other looked OK on the outside, but when cutting into it we found it was also uncooked.  We waited for 15 minutes until we were able to get the waitresses attention to return it, and by then we just told them to throw it out.  Many several minutes later the first chicken was returned and by that time everyone had finished dinner so we asked for it to be wrapped for home.  At home we find that it is STILL bleeding!  The chef should NOT be serving food!   The other food was poor at best.  Do NOT waste your time nor money at this place!   Zero stars woiuld be my vote!
