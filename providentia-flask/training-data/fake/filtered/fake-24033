Woodrow's is a great place both to grab a bite or to relax with drinks.  Recently we went to Woodrow's for Oktoberfest and had a great time...they featured special Bavarian food, which was wonderful, and have an amazing selection of beer on tap.  It was packed that night, so the servers were busy, but still friendly. After dinner, we went downstairs to the lounge + whiskey bar.  We sampled some of their excellent Scotch and Bourbon selections, and found it a great place to hang out. We will definitely be back again!
