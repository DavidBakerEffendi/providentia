food was fine...not great but not bad...good burger and beer place...what was completely off putting to me was the staff...just WOW...i seriously dont think im a difficult customer...i worked retail and restauranst through high school and college, sometime shit just happens...i saw they had a lot of different beers on draft and asked the bartender for a recommendation...she said she can't because she doesn't know what i like...there were 4 people at the bar...she had time to take 30 seconds to talk to me about it...its called customer service...i picked a beer, paid for it, then 5 my friends arrived, sat down for lunch only to have the waiter put me through a thorough cross-examination about whether or not my $4 beer was paid for...i answered the question more than once...if it was such an issue there were 20 people in the place he had time to go check with surly bartender if my answer was insufficient...possibly sensing my annoyance he then became super overly-familiar...just odd...like i said food was fine...burgers and beer, nothing fancy but decent food...just very odd experience with the staff...it just felt like they were confrontational from the second i walked in the door
