We visited Sweetwaters last night with my parents and their friend.  We used to love eating here as the ambience and food was always nice.  Unfortunately this is no longer the case, they have changed the menu and the food was awful.  I have been sick since our meal last night.  Our waitress seemed bothered every time we asked for something.  My husband asked for a glass of water as he was finishing his margarita and the waitress brought over the pitcher of water and poured it in his left over margarita.  Poor service and poor food.
