Hands down, this was the dining experience I have ever had. Everything from the appetizers to the salads to the entrees to the desserts was phenomenal. I would highly recommend the $39 tasting menu, as it allows you to sample a wide variety of their dishes all of which were delicious. You also get a ton of food with the tasting menu. You will not be hungry or disappointed by the end of your meal. The best dish was the Haloumi Cheese appetizer. It was melt in your mouth good. We asked out server for recommendations Â for which dishes to choose for the tasting and we were so glad we did. The service was exceptional. There was always someone there to fill your glass or fold your napkin if you got up from the table. And while I cannot remember his name, our waiter who is from Turkey and was recently promoted to manager was probably the best server I've ever had. Very knowledgeable and took the time to explain each dish and how to eat them. If you only have a day or two in the city, go here!!
