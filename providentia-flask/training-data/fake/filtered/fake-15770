I am brasilian so I know what good brasilian food is and believe me, this is some GOOD brasilian food. There is a buffet style, small but good or you can choose from getting meat from the meat rotator. The natural drinks are all very good too! Clean place but the waiters are terrible which is why I am giving it four stars and not five, but it's worth dealing with.
