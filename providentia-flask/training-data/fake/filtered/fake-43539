Service was terrific and friendly. The space is beautiful. The food is quite good and very reasonably priced. The appetizers were delicious (Dan Dan Noodles and Spicy Cucumbers). Our Double Cooked Fish was too salty and didn't have enough sauce, but the texture was great. Two appetizers and one entree was plenty for two forty-something adults.
