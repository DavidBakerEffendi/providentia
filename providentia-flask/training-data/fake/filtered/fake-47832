extremely disappointed by the rude behavior of the lady who was the manager i beleive! I went in on saturday afternoon at 3 pm, the restaurant had only one more table with customer apart from us. I went in with my 14 month old baby and husband. As she was seated in the high chair she started playing with the belt and it snapped her little finger, so poor dear started crying. While Â I was trying to see where she got hurt the rude lady came and asked me to 'quiet the baby'!!!...i mean are you kidding me?? I even looked at the other table and said sorry...but the gentleman there said ..oh no no even my daughter would cry..is she ok?...but the lady came again and i simply move3d out of the restaurant. My husband was courteous enough not to cancel the order but to pack it ! NEVER GOING BACK!!! EVER!! Only because of them being so not kid friendly and rude!!!
