good, friendly service prices are too high for the quality of both the cooking and ingredients, and there seems to be no care for portion sizes and presentation would recommend to the management (owner) that they have a hard look at what they actually have to offer as there is a huge discrepancy between the appearance of the place and what is ultimately delivered on the plate we had two of their most expensive dishes (seafood stew and fish of the day) and were really disappointed by the quality and disregard to execution and ingredients (seafood stew was clearly made with canned tomatoes and the fish was poorly prepared)
