I visited Zahav numerous times after they first opened and loved it - loved the food, loved the service, and loved the atmosphere.  After some time away, I had the opportunity to return there this weekend and found that while the food is still quite good (though the too much salt was used and the dessert menu has veered toward TGI Fridays), the service was overbearing and intrusive.  Waiters and busboys constantly hovered over us, first pushing us to place our order and once the food had arrived, harassing us into finishing our food as quickly as possible. Several times, we had to stop a server from whisking a plate away before it was finished.  Finally, as we were approaching the end of our meal two servers arrived, one on each side of our table, and began clearing our plates.  We were still eating and they did not even bother to ask if we were finished.  It was not the relaxed mediterranean pace you would expect from a middle eastern restaurant.  Personally, the food is the most important piece of the dining experience but if the service makes me feel uncomfortable and unwelcome, I do not return.
