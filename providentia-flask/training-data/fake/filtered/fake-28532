I love everything about OT! From my Saturday & Sunday mornings with Eddie to random weeknights with the rest of the crew this place is a top notch good time. When it comes to the food it's hard to say what I haven't eaten there. It's ALL delicious. The pot pie is spot on but the one thing I always go back to is the chicken salad, I get it in a wrap instead of open face. Overall it's a brilliant space with lots of indoor and outdoor seating for you and whatever army you're with.
