My husband and I are fans of Scott Anderson and we have had many fine dinners at Elements, but with my first try at Mistral, I was very disappointed with the food. I went in Sunday morning at opening, 11 am. Two other people came in after me , so it wasn't crowed or overly busy. The servers were pleasant, but meal was served haphazardly and the food was bland. Not at all what I was expecting. My first dish was the Onsen Egg, it was served with the egg white undercooked and gel like. Very unappealing! I did mention it to the waiter and he apologized and took it away, but neglected to take it off the bill, which I think he should have offered to do. Â  The Squid it self was very tasty but the broth and other food elements were tasteless. The Trout dish was pretty good but at that point I had lost my taste. None of it sat very well in my stomach, and I do have a strong stomach for unique foods. The meal set me back $53.( which I feel is still very high) including the 18% tip which is on the very low end of my tipping scale. Sorry to say I won't be running back there, but I may give it another chance after they settle in.
