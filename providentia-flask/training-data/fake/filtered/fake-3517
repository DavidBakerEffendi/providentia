I've been to most restaurants in the Ironbound in the past 10 years, and I can affirm without a doubt that here you'll find the best food there is! On top of that, the price is amazing! Whenever I have a chance, I stop by for lunch or sometimes only for a good cappuccino. The owner treats every single guest as if we are the only ones at the restaurant. Great service! I highly recommend Sabor Unido.
