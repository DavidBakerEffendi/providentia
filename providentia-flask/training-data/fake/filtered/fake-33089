The food here is super fantastic and I love the fact that it is out of annoying Northern Liberties with its throngs of penquin hipsters who all seem to think and act the same way. I love the fact that The Hinge is a jewel island tucked away from annoying Hipster Land. Linda the waitress is the best; who doesn't love her? I wish the owners were more friendly--too often they seem grumpy and unsmiling and they never say hello even though they "know" you. What's up with that? I will continue to go despite this, however.
