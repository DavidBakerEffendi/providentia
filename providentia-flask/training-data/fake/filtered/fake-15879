I'm fed up with Taim. There is always a huge crowd everytime I go. I guess the owners don't care about their customers experience. Ordering is a nightmare. If you can manage to squeeze into the restuarant, good luck finding the end of the line. If you decide to eat in and you're lucky enough to snag a seat, you'll most likely have to scarf down your food because someone wants your seat asap or as you are eating you're likely to be smashed into or elbowed constantly as people jostle inside trying to place an order or simply get to the trash. On times when I have eaten outside (still crowded onthe sidewalk), people constatly walk by and decide not to eat there because it is too crowded. Why Taim doesn't get a bigger space or expand to another location is beyond me. They are losing customers.
