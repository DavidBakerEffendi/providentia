Monte Alban is very dishonest when taking credit cards. Long story short I ate there last week and paid for the bill with my credit card. When I checked my statement the next day I discovered they took way more than what they were suppose to. When I called the restaurant I was told that the company they use holds more money on your card than the total bill to make sure you have enough money on your card and the difference should be returned in three days. It's well over three days and the money has not been returned to my account. I am on my way to the police station to file a report because the restaurant refuses to accept responsibility. Also, if this is something that often occurs with their credit card vendor, why wasn't I told this when I handed the waiter my card? There also weren't any signs in the restaurant. This restaurant is unethical and if they did this, imagine what else they'll do.
