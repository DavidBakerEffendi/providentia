Sure, it is a bit pricey... but, worth every penny!  I have always found the pizza and customer service to be top-notch! They also have a great delivery radius and, more importantly, have supported every community service project I have approached them about. Each time I ask for a donation of some sort( e.g., Girl Scouts, softball, Me & My Guy Dance for CY Mentoring) ...you name it, Ramountos has made a generous donation; that alone keeps me coming back!  Plus, it's the closest thing to a real NY pizza that you can get here in VT...delicious!  Thanks, Ramountos for supporting your community!  Keep up the good work!
