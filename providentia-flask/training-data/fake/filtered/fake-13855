Authentic, fresh, inexpensive Thai food.  New (as of Fall 2008) chef Yada (formerly of Bua Thai in Belleville) is an exceptional cook.  I love noodles and all of her noodle dishes are excellent.  Her Pad See Eiw is the best I ever had.  The atmosphere is casual, BYO.  By far, the best of the Thai restaurants in Bloomfield or Montclair. Plenty of parking across the street at the A&P lot.
