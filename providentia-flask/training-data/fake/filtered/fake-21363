One of the hottest Latino restaurants in New York City. The friendly staff is dedicated to excellent service and the Colombian and South American food will satisfy the pickiest appetite. The red beans threaten perfection and the Mango Mojito is my favorite drink in town. The restaurant is beautifully decorated with accents of Latino culture and history. The amazing murals can stand alone in any art studio and the music selection caps off the overall Latino experience. (From a blog post earlier this year -  philvelez.blogspot.com/2…)
