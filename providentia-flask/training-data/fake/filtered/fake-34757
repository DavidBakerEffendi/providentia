Hold onto your wallet.  The food was good, but not fabulous, and the issues over pricing were a major turnoff.  After hosting a large family party here, we were very disturbed to find the total bill way over the price discussed.  The bill for the wine not only included the full customary 3X markup on each bottle (unheard of for a large party), but also included an automatic 20% gratuity on the wine.  Mysteriously, there were no partially empty bottles at the end of the party.  What a really nasty experience.  Would never go back.
