It was good, there was lotsa lobster meat, although the roll seemed kind of small.  Also, I expected the lobster to be warm, not chilled (although the roll is warm).  I've had lobster rolls in CT several times and they were served warmed, but maybe the Maine traditional lobster roll is cold.  I would prefer warm, if I got it another time I'd take it home and nuke it for about 10 to 20 seconds to warm the lobster.  But not sure I'd shell out $15 again for this.
