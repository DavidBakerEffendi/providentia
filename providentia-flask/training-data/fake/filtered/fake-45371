I came here for the first time for an impromptu bday dinner with the girls on a late Friday night and that we were seated immediately. The drinks were good as well as the food! The bbq half chicken was moist and flavorful. My friends had the steak and salmon, of which all were great! Friendly wait staff, good customer service, nice background music, quick service. I'd definitely return!
