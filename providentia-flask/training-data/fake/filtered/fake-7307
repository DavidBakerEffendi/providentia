I finally made it there, after trying twice. We went in for dinner on Tuesday, and I figured that it would be pretty mellow, but it was a mad house - the hostess announced that it would be an hour wait. We were ready for it and went to the bar where I felt I'm in a Times Square bar full of tourists. The drink was pretty good and the Â hostess miraculously got a table for us within half an hour. We ordered lobster risotto, half chicken and duck confit. The risotto was delicious, but the chicken and duck were mediocre. They weren't bad, but I expected so much more. Maybe we got the wrong thing because every table around us got the seafood plate, and after reading the reviews it seems to be a great brunch spot. I expected more from a famous Balthazar, and kind of see why this place might be over hyped. The best part of the meal was dessert! We got creme brulee and chocolate tart - the creme brulee was superb! i guess I'l go next time for brunch, drinks and dessert
