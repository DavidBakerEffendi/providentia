Visited Siam for the first time this past weekend because I had purchased a Living Social voucher (paid $15 for $30 voucher).  Loved it!  They were offering a prix fixe menu that included a choice of soup, a small salad, a choice of appetizer, a choice of entree, and a choice of icecream (for dessert) all for $18 so my boyfriend and I each ended up doing this option.  Their entrees and appetizers are reasonably priced as well.  The food was all fresh and very tasty and the portions were perfect.  There was only one waitress (along with another woman who I believe may have been the manager) and the service was still fast and friendly.  I will definitely be returning and would highly recommend Siam! :)
