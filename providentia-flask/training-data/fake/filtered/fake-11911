Winter Storm Nemo is hammering the Northeast USA but we had events that were still going to happen on Friday afternoon and were searching for a place close to the hotel.  Tony's popped up and we got a reservation on line.  Showed up early and were warmly greeted and seated immediately.  I guess there were lots of cancellations tonight due to the weather.  Our server asked if it was our first time and since it was explained the Family Style servings that could easily feed two if not three adults.  She steered us away from ordering a redundant appetizer and entree and let us chose better alternatives that were awesome.  A half block off Broadway in Times Square area and the Theater District.  Highly recommended and I would go back with family and friends anytime I am back in NYC.
