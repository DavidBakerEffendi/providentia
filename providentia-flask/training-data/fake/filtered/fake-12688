The food was amazing, the buser, so kind, but our server, arrogant and insincere.  Another example that great food does not make a great restaurant.  This was a special occasion.  We entered into a very cozy, rustic, candlelit room.  We enjoyed our appetizers and wine to soft R&B, and the voices of Les Nubians in the background.  Suddenly the main course arrived to "Eye of the Tiger" , and then "Super Freak".  The volume had been raised several decibels.  Hey, love Survivor and Rick James, especially at a bar, but not while trying to enjoy a dining experience in a dim-lit room.  We asked our server if the music could possibly be changed back to what played earlier in the evening.  Her response, "...to be honest, I like this music.  Our restaurant is known for loud music but I'll send the manager over." The patrons seated beside us and behind us all complained but were too intimidated to say anything to the staff.  By the time the manager appeared, we had already asked for the bill, and it was pointless to voice our complaint.   Our thanks to the buser for being so humble and gracious, and to the chef for preparing such an amazing meal.  These two factors were the only reasons that our experience at Lupa was not a total disappointment.
