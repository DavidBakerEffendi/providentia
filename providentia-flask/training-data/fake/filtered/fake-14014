YUMMYYYYYYY!!!!! A colleague recommended this place during a recent trip to Philly AND I must say I am glad we took the 15 minute walk to this restaurant. The restaurant is very chill. We got there exactly at 5pm (the time they open for dinner service). By the time we left almost every table was taken. The food was amazing. Everything we Â ordered left us wanting more. See my order below: - Vegetable Board - AMAZING - Puglian Style Greens - Nothing better than sauteed Kale - Wood Roasted Sardines - Okay, honestly I didn't know what to expect. I was Wowed for sure - Grilled Spanish Octopus - I am allergic, but my husband can't stop raving about this dish. Definitely going back the next time I am in Philly.
