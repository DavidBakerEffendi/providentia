I have been to this place many of time and its good. There bagels, spreadings, salads, and sandwiches are great. I have to disagree with you Deilia with one thing the Reuben is on the menu. You also probably went during a really busy hour that's why there was six people behind you. Everyone is nice there except this one lady, shes in here thirties it looks. She is very very rude to me and started to speak Spanish about me to this older women who is also behind the counter and i know Spanish. She was very nasty. The younger girl who works there is so nice though.
