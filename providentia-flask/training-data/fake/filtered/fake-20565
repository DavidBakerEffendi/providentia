I've been to Blue Point Grill at least 30 times.  Every time is was great.  I love fish and there are very few places where you can go and get a simple piece of fish.  The mussels are AMAZING.  I love the mustard sauce - I strongly recommend you share this with someone as an appetizer.  I strongly recommend you try Blue Point if you are in Princeton.  It never disappoints.  I love to bring other couples here - everyone always raves.  The food is delicious, consistent and affordable.
