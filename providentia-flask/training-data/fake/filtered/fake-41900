I've eaten at this restaurant many times. It is located near the theatre district. The food is delicious and the service is excellent. They serve authentic Italian cuisine. The staff will go out of their way to accommodate all customer requests. The red sauce is awesome! The bar scene is quite welcoming as well. I would highly recommend this place...
