This is perhaps one of my favorite restaurants in the city. Their food is always fresh and their service has always been quick. I've yet to have a bad experience whether it was going out with another friend or with a group up to 8 of us for dinner. They offer both low and mid priced items, kabob sandwiches (quite large and filling) to full platters that come with salad, hummus, rice, etc. They offer the traditional meats from chicken, beef, to lamb. All are delicious. For those who love grape leaves this is the place to go. They are freshly made (and vegetarian) unlike so many places that dump them out of a jar. I was never a fan of grape leaves until I ate here. The wait staff does tend to leave you alone once you've been served but each time I've flagged one down they've been prompt and easy about getting what you need which I prefer. I've also gotten takeout from them a number of times and I've found all of the staff in front of and behind the counter to be very friendly. They've even on the -rare- occasion when they were running behind put more into my order to make up for it without extra charge. So while they don't wait at your table hand and foot, I truly do think their service and personalities are excellent. Just ask if you need something!
