One of the best chicken/gyro plates I've ever had. It's also convenient that the sauce is on the side so that when you get it to go, the container doesn't get soggy. You get a great amount of food for the right price. Depending on the time of day, the line can be a bit long, but it moves along well. It is so worth the wait. Definitely would go back over and over again.
