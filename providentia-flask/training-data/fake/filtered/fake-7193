I had an awesome time at Testo! I met with my friends, who live in the area, and they have just recently discovered this neighborhood's gem. We stayed there for a long time, talking and enjoying our night out, and even long after our delicious meals were gone, we did not feel pressured to leave or to order more. The staff spoiled us rotten, being very friendly and attentive, but also giving us a lot of space. The decor of the place is simple yet charming and so soothing and cozy that we just did not want to leave! Now food...super yummy! I had squash raviolis that were so soft and fluffy, just melting in my mouth, hmm...I want more just writing about it. Too bad that I live in Queens but I will be back for sure. Summarizing: this place is a MUST! Outrageously good food, great atmosphere, super friendly staff and reasonable prices, should I say more? Highly recommended!
