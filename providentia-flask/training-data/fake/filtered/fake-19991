So we decide to bring my sis in law here for a bachelorette dinner. Service was friendly with a smile. We ordered the pad thai (this was okay), Asian BBQ Pork (it was delish to me, had nice flavoring), Hot & Sour Scallops(delish also nice sauce) lobster fried rice, and crab sticky rice (dungenes xoxo? I forget the exact name. This was okay). The decor is nice just thought that the chairs which had head shots of people were eerie. We had brought our own cake for the bride-to-be and of course there's a plate fee which is fine but they said it would be served with ice cream and chocolate. The ice cream was literally a spoon and the chocolate were just lines squeezed out of a ketchup bottle or something making diagonal lines on the dish. For the most part we asked our waitress to take a picture for us so she procceded to. When she finished the "boss" (or whomever) came over and I happen to hear him say to her right in front of our table something like "why are you taking pictures" and I could hear clearly from her saying that "I don't mind" so of course you could tell he was displeased with her taking a picture for us. I assume because he thought the music was loud that I couldn't hear. So our order was brought over to us and we thought it was the wrong one. We decided to ask whoever we saw first to see if it was our order. Quickly our waitress came over and said is there something wrong I seen someone here. I'm guessing that the "boss" quickly told her or something or he's just on the prowl for finding one of the workers doing something wrong. I don't know what's his problem but he needs to relax. It's understandable if your trying to keep the restaurant looking up to par and no mistakes or whatever but I really dislike how he tried to down the waitress (especially in front of us) BOO to you.
