I have been coming to Yoshi Sono for over 10 years and it has continued to be my favorite sushi place in NJ.  Vicky is incredibly sweet and attentive, and the fish is always fresh.  I've never tried the teriyaki or noodles, but whenever I get sushi it is absolutely delicious!  Reasonable prices, great atmosphere, friendly wait staff.  I truly don't understand how this place got bad reviews.  I come here once a week, sometimes for take out, sometimes for dine-in, and I've never had a bad experience.
