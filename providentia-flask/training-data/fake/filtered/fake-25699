my fav spot in Manhattan.  this is one of the best in Japanese food. I absolutely LOVE this place. My girlfriend  and I used to go there EVERY Sunday right after office. Oh my god, so good. They do japanese/korean fast food - as in they do awesome dumplings and buns and zutto rice and brussel and noodles and the best ramen you will ever HAVE. Whenever my girlfriend and I go, we get an order of dumpling with ramen (Mmmmmmm), some kimchi fried rice(zutto rice), and an order of pork katsu (thin sliced pork cutlet). It's seriously as good as my mom making it. But I have to say, *in a whisper* (ssssssssh), sometimes better than mom's. On cold days we always add in an order of ramen with dumplings. SO GOOD. i like the decoration its so romantic and peaceful. host and server are so friendly.. finally i found a great place for dinner. direct 5 star... *****
