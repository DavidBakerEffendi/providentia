I don't usually (or ever) write reviews on Yelp but my experience at Jeepney definitely merits one. Note that they are still in their soft-opening phase so the menu offered is not the full menu. We came on Saturday night at around 7:00pm. It was a 20 minute wait for the table, not too bad considering it was an hour or so wait by the time we left. The ambience and decor is perfect, what you would expect from a Filipino Gastropub. Lots of kitschy Â Pinoy pop culture items. Though I do hope they plan to change the sign in front as the single "J" isn't too inviting. I ordered a Cubao X (Lager, tang orange juice, black walnut bitters) which was on the sweet side, but loved it nonetheless.I had the Ayala Ave (white wine, elder flower cordiel, lime, ampalaya) too later in the night but I preferred the Cubao X. For our main dishes (which are meant to be shared), the Pancit Malabok came first. A twist of the Pancit Palabok and Malabon, it is a noodle dish filled with squid ink and shrimp paste, topped with chicharon, calamari, oysters and shrimp. I am not a fan of Palabok personally, but this one was probably my favorite dish of the night, and made me reconsider by apathy for the dish. Really tasty. The Spicy Filipino Bangers and Mash (5-meat embutido) was delicious as well. I was with a big meatloaf fan and he said this was probably the best meatloaf he's ever had. And the mashed sweet potato was very good. Next came the defeated chicken, pretty much adobo, mindanao-style. This dish was okay, still good, but not as exotic or surprising as the others. Last but definiely not least, the Chori Burger (chorizo and beef patty with several condiments). The burger itself was so delicious we did not even bother putting condiments on. Overall, a great experience and I look forward to coming back. If this is only the soft-opening, we can expect even greater things from Jeepney in the future!
