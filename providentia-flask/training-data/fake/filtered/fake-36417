The food here is absolutely astounding-- my favorite place to eat in the neighborhood! The sandwiches are absolutely amazing with delicious, fresh ingredients. Had the pasta for the first time (gnocchi quatro frommagi) which completely blew my mind. You've got to go to this place (whether or not you live in the neighborhood). Waiting staff is also incredibly nice, attentive, and quick. This is literally as good as it gets!
