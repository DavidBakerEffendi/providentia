The best kept secret on the UES. Up Thai has quickly become our favorite Thai place in the neighborhood. Every dish we have tried has been fantastic! Pad Thai is my usual measure of how good a Thai place is and this one is definitely 5 stars. Â Whether you dine in (the restaurant is beautiful) or take out - Up Thai is not to be missed.
