The pizza here is great! In my opinion this is my #2 favorite pizza in manhattan. My favorite is the fungi pizza, I'm not sure what kind of mushrooms they use but its delicious. If you want to eat here, order it for pickup or stop by and eat at the restaurant. Â Don't bother ordering it for delivery, they're very slow and the pizza always shows up soggy. Another tip is to not order dessert. They claim their desserts are made fresh but every time I've ordered it, it was always stale especially the tiramisu.
