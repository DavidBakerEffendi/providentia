This is my favorite new place! Just around the corner from home it offers fantastic authentic Mexican dishes, very well priced, and a good size (it doesn't kill you like Chipotle or other chains, but leaves you full and satisfied). The wait staff is very friendly, always striking up conversation about anything, which is even better if you speak Spanish.  Also, the fact that it's BYOB makes it perfect. Sometimes they'll even make you margaritas if you provide the tequila!  I'd recommend that anyone who wants authentic Mexican without the overly trendy crowd (and high price) of places down near the Piazza. This place is my new go-to spot!
