Of all the restaurants in Philadelphia our daughter chose this restaurant for her "going away" dinner. She had read about the opening of this restaurant but knew very little about it. Well, we are so excited about having found this place. We loved everything about this restaurant-location, ambiance ---even the bathrooms were beautiful---and the attentiveness of the wait staff. It was difficult to make a choice from the Â menu as everything sounded delicious. All three of us raved about out chosen entree even the second time around (we had each brought home a "doggy" bag). Can't wait to go back.
