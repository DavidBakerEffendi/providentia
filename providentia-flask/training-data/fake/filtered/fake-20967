My family and I all love this restaurant. We probably went there like 50 times already. The beef noodle soup is the best, no surprise. They did a really good job on the broth. Those little spring rolls with lettuce thingy are really good too. My family and I always get those. But each of us can only get 1 spring roll since we only order like 1 order. Another tasty dish is the BBQ pork chop thingy with rice. I don't know what they sauce they use, it must have had morphine in it xD. That thing is addicting good.
