Ilili is great. Went there for dinner last night and had a great meal, which was no different than my last my many previous visits. The hostesses were very pleasant, and quickly seated me to my table. It was pretty full for a chilly Wednesday night. The decor is very nice and it has a very nice ambiance. It is Lebanese based food with their own little twist. I've have had a bunch of things on the menu and recommend Highly recommend: Humus with meat, Babaganough and Fattoosh salad. The spicy eggplant and taboolah was also very good as well. For entree I've had the chicken sish taouk and the lamb kabobs, and although both have been great, the portions aren't the largest. The Ilili candy bar for those that like chocolate is an excellent dessert. For excellent middle eastern food, with a nice ambiance, good service and a decent price this is the place for you!
