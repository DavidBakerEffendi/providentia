Came here after leaving a bad restaurant.  This place is incredible.  Ambience was perfect for a good night.  They were playing live music with a jazz band.  For a small place I was very impressed.   Definitely come here on a good night out and stay for the food and atmosphere.  The service could have been better for a small place but it seems that there was only one server so it was understandable. Definitely coming back here again.
