The food here is amazing especially the general tos chicken, veg rice, and sweat and sower chicken! I am a Chinese food lover and have gotten those items at countless Chinese food restaurants and this place is at the top of the list every time! My only problem is the price. The items I like are about two or three dollars more expensive then all other restaurants but it's for a obvious reason, the quality! When I have extra money or I'm not paying I defiantly order from here Â haha that's what happens when you have a part time job! :D great for movie night :)
