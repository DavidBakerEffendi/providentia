Unfortunately my experience here was the worst!! I ordered a fried dough with powered sugar and received my fried dough with flour, that they argued was powered sugar. When i asked some one about the powered sugar being flour they insisted that what they were tasting was powered sugar. I asked for my money back and they stated that they didn't do refunded and stated that they could give me another fried dough. What i got in return was my same fired dough, they just shook the flour off and add powered sugar to it. Customer service was POOR and i will never do business with this restaurant again.
