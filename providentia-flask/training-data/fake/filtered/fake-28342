Absolutely stellar authentic Greek food, like being in the Greek isles only noisier . We waited( you usually do) but what a great place. We had the Greek salad, the feta was beautifully creamy and dusted with oregano and bathed in olive oil. In Greece lettuce is unusual, so the salad had some romaine, cut small, but was filled with tomato,cucumbers, sweet red onion, excellent olives and pepperocini. The simple dressing was excellent. The lemon roasted potatoes were simply incredible. Tender and flavorful. The grilled octopus was butter tender with a great charred flavor. Even the bread was excellent. I only wish that I lived close so I could return again soon, but alas, I live 6000 mile away.
