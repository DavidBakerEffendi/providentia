This restaurant is the reason I am signed up on yelp in order to be able to write a review to share with you how wonderful food they make at Izakaya. We were really taken by surprise, we were looking for another japanese restaurant and suddenly walked by Izakaya and was immediately intrigued to get in. The atmosphere Â is cosy and simple. People, food and love. What else do we need in life? We were three hungry people, one swedish, one belgian and one new yorker and we ordered a lot. The chicken was definitely a favorite for all of us. I personally think the sashimi was wow-wonderful, perfect. Then all the side dishes were delicious. Writing this is making me hungry... and being in Europe at the moment I am truly jealous of all of you who will actually have the chance to go to eat at Izakaya. It would have been nice to have some sake with the meal but it's BYOB which is also great... however looking forward to when they have license. Oh and not to forget, the service is really nice, personal, loving and helpful. This place is made with love and care for food and eating. Only good words for this place and I wish them good luck with the restaurant!
