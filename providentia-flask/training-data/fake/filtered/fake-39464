I like Pure Fare! I work near by and go there and get a juice or a salad. I love carrot ginger for my juice! it seems a little dark and the service is slow sometimes but the staff is always friendly! When i went the other day i noticed they started selling my favorite coffee: Reanimator!! it is the best coffee so naturally i had to stock up and buy 3 bags!
