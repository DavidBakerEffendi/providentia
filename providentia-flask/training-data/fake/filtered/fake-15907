I experienced a drastic change in my life recently, and it had something to do with a sandwich. Sweet Christ this place is good. Who had the brilliant idea of putting potato sticks on a sandwich?! Well if I ever find this prodigal son of our lord, I will make damn sure he knows just how much respect I have for him. I mean that. It's hard to find good food in midtown. I spent $8 on a Cuban sandwich at Tina's and nothing else matters anymore. Like the monday after a weekend of raging partying, everything looks a little less colorful after the ecstasy that was this sandwich..  My performance is slipping at work..  my roommates are worried about me, but all in all..  worth it.
