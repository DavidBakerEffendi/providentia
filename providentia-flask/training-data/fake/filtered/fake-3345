We came in and owner was sitting at the bar with a T shirt on. Friendly service but unprofessional. Orange juice was supposed to be freshly squeezed but tasted old and for $4 a small champagne flute I would expect to hear oranges being squeezed. Sausage cheese croissant came with out cheese. The feta cheese omelette came with a hair so we returned a couple minutes later owner came to ask if every thing was to our liking. Really! New feta and spinach omelette had egg shells in it. Nice place burnt he owner needs to work on performance.
