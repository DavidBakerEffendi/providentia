Came to Upstate on a Tuesday night for a get together of six people at 8pm. Three of us arrived early, and we were greeted by an attentive staff and the owner himself.  We didn't know which local brew to choose from, so he poured us a flight to try - first time getting a flight of beer! We expected a wait of about 45 mins for a table of six, and the wait was about right. It was worth the wait.   Menu was just the right size, a good variety of oysters, and the softshell crabs were very lightly battered, with little to no oil or grease. And they were sized very very well! Service was excellent, and the owner and staff took their time to explain the menu and interact with us. Upstate is a repeat for sure!
