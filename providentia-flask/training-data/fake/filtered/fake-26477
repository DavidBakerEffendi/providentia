While the food was good and the Sangria delicious, the service by one of the waiters was horrible.  Just dined at Chateau Madrid with my husband and two sonsl.  The head waiter Frankie was absolutely horrible, rude and pretty much ignored us throughout our meat.  The only saving grace was the server Samantha who attended to us also and was absolutely fabulous.  She checked on us, engaged in conversation with my sons, decorated our dessert plates above and beyond and just had an energetic lively personality.  While Frank took our order, never spoke to us, checked up on us, never told us his name, never smiled and when he took our payment did hot even say thank you or come again or anything.  I would not go back here again to get that kind of service.  He needs to go and they need to hire more servers like Samantha.  It was our first time there and will be our last.  Service does matter.
