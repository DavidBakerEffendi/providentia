We were warmly greeted at the door even being 10 minutes late for our reservation. Ordered 3 drinks which were delivered to us immediately & before we could toast were escorted to our table. Our server was awesome as we were in no rush & did not open the menu for 20 minutes. Started with a tray of 12 oysters / 6 from the East coast 6 West coast. Cold -fresh- perfect.! 3 fantastic meals were delivered 10 minutes after ordering arriving on hot plates / perfectly prepared & looking spectacular. One of my guests had the bone in rib-eye on a sizzling hot plate & was huge / perfectly cooked / melt in your mouth good. Another guest had the wild striped bass which was reported to be fantastic. I had the halibut which arrived perfectly cooked on top of a buttery light sauce. Could have licked the plate clean. I know my guest with the steak would have picked up the bone & worked it like a dog if not in mixed company. All three meals were so good no one wanted to share or even allow others to taste! Â & left no room for dessert / just one more glass or wine. We over stayed our welcome as we were the last table to leave & never felt pressured to move. Service was exceptional / always there when you needed them but never over whelming / never felt rushed. Will definitely return ASAP & recommend to everyone. GREAT JOB CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK
