Love it. Parking in the lot adjacent to it is fine, not always room though but you do get a tiny discount if you show that you bought items in the RTM. Wish the ailes were wider & some of the stands kinda smell. But I wouldnt trade it for the world. Really enjoy it. Great sandwhiches. Always get my produce there. Love the coffee.
