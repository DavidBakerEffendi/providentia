The service was awful. We waited over thirty minutes for our food before it was brought out by what appeared to be a manager, who then took the food back into the kitchen and scolded our waiter in front of us before he finally brought out the meals. Apparently the manager had put the food back under the heater because my shrimp were overcooked and dry. The lobster in the lobster bisque was not very good quality and I spent most of my meal thirsty because the waiter kept forgetting to bring me water. The rest of my party was equally disappointed and annoyed; that was the first time I actually considered getting up and leaving halfway through my meal. The ambiance is great but it cannot make up for the service, food, and overall experience.
