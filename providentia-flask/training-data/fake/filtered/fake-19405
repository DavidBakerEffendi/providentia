Very much enjoyed the trip, I went there after work with a colleague. The waiter Cory was excellent, very attentive and helpful! I had the Skate special which was likewise excellent, cocktail drinks were also, well, excellent. Had nice selection of whisky also. Overall a great place to grab a bite to eat in a fairly upscale setting, I'm a fan!
