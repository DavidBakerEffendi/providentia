Went with teen.  Had pork with green peppers.  Very good, spicy enough to know its there, but not enough that you could not taste the food.  We also had chicken on a bed greens, also very good.  We liked the complimentary chips, beans, and salsa.  Salsa was liquid but vey good with nice favors, cilantro maybe. Service was very good, without being intrusive. No alcohol and the total was $35 for two full tummies. Friday night at 7:00
