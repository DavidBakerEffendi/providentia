I have no idea why some people have written negative reviews of this place. It is awesome. The service was friendly and prompt, the ambiance comfortable and in keeping with a Mexican flavor. The food was not only really, really good but there was plenty of it. The salsa was outstanding as was the Guacamole which was prepared right at the table. The rice and re-fried beans were among the best I have ever tasted and the drinks were big and very well prepared. I will go there over and over and this was my first time there.
