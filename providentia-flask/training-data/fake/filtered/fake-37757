Last night was my first time to Brick Lane Curry and I was rather disappointed the ambience is beautiful and although it was a busy Saturday Night the waiters was friendly and attentive...The price is a little pricy for what we normally pay for Indian food, but I don't my paying if the quality of food is tasty and flavorful, I had the Lamb curry and I specified that my dish to be made medium spicy, my dish came out sweet and bland my son had the Tandoori Chicken that was also bland, after eating still trying to finish our wine the waiter asked if we can hurry up cause there was other people waiting to be seated to eat...after paying $75 for bland food then asking you to hurry with your wine is not very professional....
