I truly can't figure out how this place has such good reviews- I was craving a burger, and ordered the barbecue burger and potato salad. Despite being starving, I ended up actually throwing most of it away. The barbecue sauce was really sweet and watery, and the potato salad was so bland (and also kind of sweet) that even after trying to fix it up with my own condiments, it was still inedible. Maybe it was just an off day, or I made a bad selection, but there are so many other places to order from around here, I'm not going back!
