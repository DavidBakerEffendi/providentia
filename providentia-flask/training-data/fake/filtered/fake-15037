Let us first say we couldn't wait to return for New Year's Eve this year since we had raved about our 2012 dinner for a year!  We didn't even balk at the 10.00 increase from 65.00 per person to 75.00.  The "for the table" course consisted of a tiny portion of store bought ricotta (at least serve what you serve at Barbuzzo) and two lukewarm pieces of grilled bread. For the uninspired appetizer course, we were unpleasantly surprised to see the very large heads of the three grilled shrimp. Our entrees were somewhat better, though again, not even close to our expectations. For a special night, and a special menu, the food and service couldn't rival a mediocre night at a run of the mill Phila restaurant.  It almost seemed like the place had changed ownership as we know and have long enjoyed their other establishments.
