I know I live in New York, but I love Italian style pizza.  The crispy wood-fire oven baked crust, the fresh cheese and herbs, the individual tastes of each sparse topping complimenting one another.   I've been trying to get into New York pizza the three months I've been here, but Roberta's was a divergence and I was finally truly satisfied.   This is Italian, wood-fire oven pizza done well.  Great, fresh topping ingredients, they even grow many of their own vegetables in green houses surrounding their patio (if I'm not mistaken).  There's a nice (and warm) little outdoor tent bar while you're for your table and the service was straight forward and helpful.  Just the kind of restaurant you want as your neighborhood pizza place.
