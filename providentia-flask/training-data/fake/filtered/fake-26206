Ate here on a Monday night, around 7pm.  We had tried to dine here once in the summer last year, but it was simply too hot inside for comfort and we left without ordering.  We came back on a cool spring night, excited to try this place because we heard great things and it is close to our home. The atmosphere here is pleasant and the staff was very attentive. But the food... the food here was simply not good, especially considering the prices.  The bread served before dinner was cold and unremarkable.  The calamari was not exactly cold, but certainly not hot, although the mediocre temperature reflected the flavor of the dish. My entree was the Arrabiata, "chicken chunks" in a spicy wine-lemon sauce.  While the chicken was adequately cooked, it was not hot at all.  The lukewarm chicken and sauce made for a disappointing pairing.  The only hot item on my plate was the mashed potatoes, which were pretty tasty.  My wife ordered the salmon with quinoa and barely.  The salmon was overcooked, and I don't know how else to describe the flavor of the barley other than "off-putting". Again, I thought the staff here was great, but there is much better italian food in Montclair.  I do not believe I will be dining here again.
