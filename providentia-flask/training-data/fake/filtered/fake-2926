Poor customer service.  I called on a Thursday to find out if I could make reservations for the following day, Friday, for 17 people.  I was told they don't take reservations it's a first come first serve basis.  I asked if it would be a problem with 17 people and was told depending on the time it may be a bit of a wait.  Something I was expecting.  I got there at 6:30 on Friday and went to sign in, expecting to wait.  When I approached the hostess I was told they don't seat parties greater then 12.....really?!?! I had called the day before and explicitly asked....Happy Birthday to me....had to make make other plans last minute and call all my guests with the venue change....
