Had dinner at the White Dog Cafe last night and it was delicious.  I have been to the one on Sansom Street a bunch but finally was able to try the one in Wayne.  Oh my goodness!  Everything was amazing.  First off the setting is beautiful both inside and their outside seating.  Secondly the food was so so good.  Calamari, Trout, Scallops and wood grilled vegies.  Very good across the board!
