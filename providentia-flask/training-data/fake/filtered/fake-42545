We were excited to have dinner here because it was considered some of the finest dining in Philadelphia, and we loved the idea of eating on a 100-year-old ship. Our waiter was very courteous, our service was prompt, and we enjoyed the ambience. At first we enjoyed the experience as our wine was delicious, we received a complimentary baba ghanush amuse bouche, and the rosemary wheat rolls were warm. Our letdowns began when we asked to share a beet salad with goat cheese. The salad was good but had only four small beets, plus when diners at a fine establishment ask to split a salad, it should be done in the kitchen, not done by the diners, as we had to. Then the entrees came. My husband ordered the Peking duck, which was supposed to be in two pieces, but came in a giant hunk of meat that was tough to cut and full of connective tissue. I ordered the pasta with crab, and was surprised at how average it was, and also how spicy as there was no mention of the red pepper flakes in that dish on the menu. To add insult to injury, we went for a walk on the deck afterward and right there on the floor was a piece of wood with five nails sticking out of it, which anyone could have stepped on! Seriously, save your money and go elsewhere.
