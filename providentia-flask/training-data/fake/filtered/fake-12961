This was positively one of the worst experiences that I have had in a restaurant.  The service was not just incompetent, but outwardly rude.  Arriving at an otherwise empty outside bar for wine should not be an encroachment on the territory of a grumpy, vapid wait staff.  The staff at Calandras seemed to be able to make our short half hour interaction into a confusing melodrama that followed us right out the door.  AVOID AT ALL COSTS.
