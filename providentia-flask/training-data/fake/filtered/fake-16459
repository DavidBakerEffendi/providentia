We went for dinner, w/out kids so we were hoping to enjoy dinner. We each ordered a burger well done. Both burgers came rear, very very pink and they were both sent back. Â While we waited the waitress brought us some deviled eggs?? It's a very weird appetizer to offer and I can see why they give it away they did not taste good at all. About 5 minutes later out came our burgers mine being fine, but my fiances was still raw at this point we called it a night. The manager comp his burger and we left...Sorry Republic but that was horrible service. We will not be returning...
