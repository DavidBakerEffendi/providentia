Tonight we were ecstatic to find out that we had the most awesome Middle Eastern cuisine right here in Bucks County!  We had the Falafel sandwich and it was so absolutely delicious, fresh ingredients.. SPECTACULAR!  And the baklava was out of this world.  I cannot wait to try every thing on their menu.  Finding this gem was the highlight of my stressful week.
