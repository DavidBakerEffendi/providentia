Stopped at Better Bites for their Bison Wrap. I was absolutely blown away by the quality and flavor. The wrap had lean ground bison, fresh avocado, tomato, lettuce, shredded cheese, all topped with homemade chipotle sauce. It hit the spot to a point where I crave that wrap on a daily basis. For a lean healthy filling meal, Better Bites is by far my choice. Just wish they came to DC! Great work guys!
