Definitely 'hole in the wall' but that's why the food is so inexpensive. I'm hesitant to write a terrific review because I'm afraid if this place gets 'discovered' the prices will go up, so I'm just going to keep it short and hope no one reads this. There chicken biscuit sandwich is TO DIE FOR!!! I don't know what they put on them, but OH. MY. GOD!!! I ate one. I was full, but I brought a second took it home and even though I wasn't hungry, I thought, 'oh I'll just have a little bite' and ended up gobbling that down too! HMMMM!!! SO FRIGGIN GOOD! Â (Now I'm hooked on those chicken sandwiches) The cold ginger tea is also incredible (has a wonderful back throat 'burn' that leaves your throat alive with a minty feeling.) This place is a real find! (I wish I could marry the cook!!!)
