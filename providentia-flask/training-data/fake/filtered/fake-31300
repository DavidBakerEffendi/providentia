This is my favorite Thai curry fix in Connecticut.  I have manufactured reasons to go to Hartford in order to eat here, I love it so much.  I had a terrible experience at a place not more than a mile away from this restaurant, and it got me regretting not coming here instead.  As others have mentioned, it is the ground floor of the chef/owner's home, and you are made to feel like a welcome guest there.  The hostess is the chef's daughter, and she provides just exactly the right amount of attention, never making you feel hovered over or neglected.  Since to date I have only had the various curry dishes, I can only comment on those, and they are very very good.
