We came in on a Friday night at 11:30pm and got seated very quickly upstarirs, we wouldn't have minded downstairs, but maybe they had aleady cleaned up. Our waiter was very nice and friendly, very unusual in NYC, I'm so used to brusque unsmiling, brisk service; he suggested the ricotta/meatball and pepporoni/mushroom--it was delish! The pizza came out maybe after 10-15 minutes, quite fast; it was brick oven I went by the kitchen and saw it myself -a large hole surrounded by white bricks--this is the real deal; for all those whiney whiners, you have been having lousy pizza all your life which is why you cannot tell the difference; this is oven cooked thin crust pizza people!! The topping s were terrific. The ricotta melted in your mouth, I loved the meatballs, you can tell it was developed with a flavor that melted in your mouth. There's no comparison to our $0.99 pizza round our corner or dry corner pizza in our hood, it's far more superior-let your tastebuds absorb it--maybe also you guys come when it's too crowded better when there's less people you get great service and food is excellent they can take thier time,  I told the waiter he was very nice and unusually friendly thank you, he said oh, where are you from, I said NY. But my hubby and his friend had British accents, but friendly waitstaff is nice for  a change and a breath of fresh of air our waiter was a young guy who looks Italian--kudos to you; we left a nice littel 20% tip, great food, great service, great company! Sure it's going to be touristy, it's all in the tour guide book, but they are worth their salt, go late at night when there are no lines, looked like locals dined late too, it didn;t have that tourist feel late at night, felt like a locals place wher you can grab a bite when you're hungry late.
