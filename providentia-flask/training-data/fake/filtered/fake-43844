I used to work a couple of blocks from here and would go here a few times a month for lunch.  My standard order would be a small jerk chicken with rice & beans and plantains (or some other side if they didn't have plantains).  Their food is delicious and their staff is so friendly.  Call ahead because they are popular and you may have to wait!
