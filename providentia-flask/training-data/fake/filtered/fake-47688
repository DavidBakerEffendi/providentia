The battle over the 'Best Pizza' seems trivial to me. A great pizza is great. And there are a few places that can make a great pizza. So I'll enjoy all of them. Seriously, how can you nitpick among two great pizza places? Grimaldi's I is good, Grimaldi's II is good, and when someone splits and opens Grimaldi's III, it'll be good too. I know those aren't the names of the joints, but it's the family name that just has it going on in the pizza business. I'm from the west coast. I thought of thin pizza as lacking ingredients and flavor. Well, I obviously hadn't had NY style pizza in New York. My whole pizza world has changed. And it all started as a tourist visiting Grimaldi's under the bridge. Now I can't get enough. I'll say that if I'm down at Grimaldi's I or Grimaldi's II for pizza, I'll pick the line that appears to be moving faster. Actual names of the pizza places have not been given so that you can decide which is which for yourselves. Really, they're both great.
