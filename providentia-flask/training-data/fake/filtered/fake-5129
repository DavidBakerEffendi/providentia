This place is great.  Good quality food at very affordable prices in the city.  My family has eaten here a few times and we are never disappointed.  My kids love the spaghetti and meatballs and my husband and I enjoy the classic meatball sandwich and chicken broccoli rabe and provolone.  We have also taken advantage of the "grab and go."  My husband stopped on his way home from work and picked up meatballs from the cold fridge at the shop.  This comes with a pound of uncooked spaghetti and bread.  All we had to do was boil water, cook pasta and heat the meatballs and it was like a tasty home cooked meal in a matter of minutes.  I would recommend this place wholeheartedly.  My family will be back again and again.
