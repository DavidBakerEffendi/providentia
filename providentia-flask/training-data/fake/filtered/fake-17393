I had the most amazing experience here. my best friend took my here for lunch one day and my mouth literally watered from the taste of that salmon, with pistachio scattered on top and spinach on the bottom. Talk about food porn, the kindest service I've ever received with beautiful outdoor seating. Cant wait for the winter, to have dinner by there lovely fireplace :)
