Eventually... My burger was very good, as were the truffle fries.  The staff, not so much... Hostess was on the phone, and we had to wait to be seated.  Table next to us was seated a few minuets later, was served drinks, and bread, before we were even greeted.  Our waiter forgot one of the drinks, and my order came out wrong.
