Ok, after going here now for 8 years I have beef with this place.  My family thoroughly enjoy the food here still every time however there is so much attitude with service!  Is the staff that miserable and bitter?  From the hostess (that can barely eek out a smile and makes it seem so painful to do so) that's been there forever to the older waiter and the middle age waitstaff- there is no thank you or greeting???  We have gone there so many times and no recognition or welcome back?...  Gone are the original owner Benny's thoughtful ways and warm smiles....  I thought it was a prejudice thing the last time we went (there were a few minorities at the table) but I took a good look around today and it was to everyone!  I think I will start going across the street and tell my family/relatives/colleagues and friends to as well!
