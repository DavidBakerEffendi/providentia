how could you not love this place? They've really turned this large, urban, historic indoor public back around after some down years. It's been thriving with lots of tourists, conventioneers, and locals. Most everything you'll get here is delicious. They've previously had a cheesteak venue that was horrible get replaced, which made me feel good because out-of-towners shouldn't have a horrible first cheese steak. Great selection of foods in separated stalls. There's also some diners (Amish one is my fav), produce markets, deserts, fresh meats and cheese shops, some specialty and foreign goods. It's also very close to Chinatown and it's markets. I've seen Food Network special events shot here and culinary exhibitions. A few of the shops and diners have small seating areas, mostly at counters. There are also a good number of public tables in the middle with a high turnover rate. This place has people in it all day long but really is packed around lunch time. There is some metered street parking and nearby expensive lots, some reasonable a little ways away, but lots of foot traffic here from center city business district, convention center, and hotels. You should have no problem finding something delicious to eat or cook here.
