Truly one of the best restaurants around. Jimmy Cosgrove defines excellent customer service, as well as all the people he is surrounded by in Salute! I've never been in a restaurant that really makes one feel welcomed like this one. Even at their busiest time, the wait is never long. I love the food and my favorite martini is always perfect! Alas, the only problemis the parking... But hey, my husband drops me off and parks the car! PS.. The garlic bread is to die for
