This place was AWFUL!!! We went there with the intention of having a quick drink and then got a 60 dollar bill for 15 minute stay! They rudely informed us that we had to pay a cover charge even though we were only there during intermission, there are no signs anywhere notifying people of this charge. It's a real dive. I would never go back or recommend anyone go there!
