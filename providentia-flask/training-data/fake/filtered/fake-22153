We came to Cafe Orlin for brunch on Sunday and managed to arrive before the crowds.  We started with some wonderful spiced hot apple cider, which was perfect for a cold winter morning.  I had the breakfast sandwich on a challah role, yum!  It came with tasty hashbrowns.  My friend had the pumpkin pancakes with cinnamon yogurt and liked them very much.  Love this place for brunch!
