This restaurant recently opened and it already seems to have already established a clientele.  They were quite busy both times we went.  The décor and atmosphere are great and the waitresses are very helpful - especially since I wanted to order off the Chinese menu and I can't read Chinese.   The Chinese menu, which many Chinese restaurants have is a few pages and you have to ask for it.  I asked the waitresses to please explain the dishes and make recommendations.  The Double Cooked Pork (Hwei Gwo Rou) when done in real Chinese style is great!   We also had spare ribs and bitter melon which I really liked.  Having bitter melon with anything really doesn't get me too excited, but I'm so glad we tried it - I will definitely order this dish again.   We frequent Flushing and my wife commented; "This place is great and so much closer than Flushing - let's come her instead of going to Flushing". We will definitely be back.
