I came here a few times and each time it did not disappoint to disappoint me even more! The service was terrible, the food (omg) it took forever and when i got it, it was cold. one time there was hair and something else in my food i could not believe it ! i am not a picky eater or picky about anything but this? come on ! Please, i would never recommend this restaurant to anybody.
