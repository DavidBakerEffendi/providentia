My boyfriend and I just left the counter and we had an amazing experience! We both made our own burger and everything tasted great ! My chicken did not taste rubbery like red robin ! Got greeted quickly, we sat at the bar and the bartender was extremely nice and recommended a bunch of things !! After we left the manager was at the door and was very nice too !! Will be back very soon !! (: -angelica
