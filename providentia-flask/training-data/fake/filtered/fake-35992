I will first say this place is CRAZY hipster.  However, if you get past that, it's a very cool and unique place, with amazing pizza.  Cheesus Christ is my favorite pizza they serve with hot pepper cheese, with honey on top (optional).  They also have a great selection of beers, and a tent in the back with another bar as you wait for your table.  The place feels like a campground tavern that's hidden with only one door to a rundown wall of graffiti.  It's literally a hole in the wall, that opens up to this bustling giant restaurant at 11PM.  It's a little pricey, which you could find yourself spending $20-$30 on 2 pizzas and a drink, but if you go with friends, it evens out.  They also deliver.  Recommended to anyone showing a visitor to NYC the chic restaurants of the area.
