Cannot say enough good things about Supper. We're low maintenance folks, so my wife and I sat inside at the bar for dinner. Watching the chefs in action was like seeing a well-choreographed dance show on a 10 x 10 stage. The small bowl of cold white beans salad served with the crusty bread was perfect, and the saut√©ed calamari was the best we've ever had, period. We opted for one of the specials, can't remember the name, but it was the only fresh pasta dish on the menu tonight. A wide, thin noodle served with mushrooms in a butter and garlic sauce that was much, much lighter than a traditional butter and garlic sauce. We also shared the Monday night risotto; made with bits of zuccha squash, speck (fish), and pancetta. Everything was on point, so thanks for the great meal.
