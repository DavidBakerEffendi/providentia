In a city full of exceptional brunch places, Calle Ocho is my very favorite. Whether I have something to celebrate or am just looking for a casual brunch with my boyfriend, this is the place I go. Great food, attentive, friendly service, UNLIMITED SANGRIA - what's not to love? I think I've managed to work my way through most of the menu. My favorite thing to order is the vegetariano, a well-flavored wild mushroom paella. Most paellas (paelli? paellae?) I've found have seafood in them, so it's so nice to find a veggie-friendly version that's super delicious to boot. I also get the calle ocho omelet, a simple but heavenly omelet with tomato and manchego cheese. Yummmmm! I'm salivating just writing this; Alright, it's decided; I'm definitely going there this weekend.
