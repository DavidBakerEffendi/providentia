Went to the 14th street location once. Didn't have to wait too long to be served since I went there on a weekday during lunch. The slice of pizza I ordered  consisted of  too much greasy, tasteless, fattening substance and not enough artichoke/spinach. The margarita basil pizza looked more appetizing was thinking of  trying it but the person who waited on me was so rude, I decided against it.
