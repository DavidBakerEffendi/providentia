Oh, Trading Post how I love thee!!       I went there for brunch last Saturday.The restaurant looks spectacular with its 3 floors. My admiration aroused with the elegant interior, gorgeous design and architectural details. There are huge rooms or private nooks  in where you can discreetly have a business meeting. The beautiful old clock welcomes all  quests  entering the vestibule of the restaurant. Trading Post is the place for a true foodie. If you are one, this is your spot. The heirloom tomatoes were the right one, picked at the correct moment, served with watermelon and feta cheese were deliriously delicious! Ricotta cheese was perfectly paired with lemon zest and caramelized bananas into an airy pancake. Finger-licking good!! My last dish was a grilled skirt steak with 2 eggs and colorful Argentinean chimichurri sauce.  Absolutely juicy and scrumptious,  cooked to perfection was striking in appearance and flavor!! The talented team of Trading Post made my brunch an unforgettable gastronomic experience. Let them surprise you!!
