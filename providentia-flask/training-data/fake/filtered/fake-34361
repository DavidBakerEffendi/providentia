I ate at Injera on a Thursday night.  It was my first time experiencing Ethopian food and I am glad that I lucked into starting here!  The staff were warm and welcoming and the food was outstanding.  I had the veggie combination, which was more food than I needed, but the flavors were bright and complex...the veggies were fresh, and I was over the moon! I would be remiss if I didn't add that the sangria was divine.
