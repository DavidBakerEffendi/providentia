Everything on the menu is pretty fantastic! I adore the fried chicken and the bibimbap. The place is small and cozy, so expect it to get a bit crazy at peak hours. my only complaint would be that they are CASH ONLY. Whomp whomp... I will definitely be going back though as the bibimbap is delicious!
