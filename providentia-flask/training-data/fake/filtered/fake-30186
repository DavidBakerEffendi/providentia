Lovely atmosphere.  I wish the bar section was a little bigger because when it gets crowded, there's no where to stand without being in someone's way.   Walla walla suicide rings are an excellent spicy snack/apptizer to accompany a selection from their awesome offering of beers.  The burger was good.  I've gotten it twice and the buger patty itself is very tasty, but I wish they had some more interesting topping options; royal tavern still wins the best burger contest for me.  And the fries were average.   I reccomend the ace pear cider for a refreshing, sweet, alternative to beer.
