I'm so surprised to see such mixed reviews on this site!  I have to say, this was an amazing experience for my husband and me- we loved everything about it.  And everything was so original!!! I don't know anywhere else around that we'd be able to go to and feel like we were getting a real german dinner.  I loved the vibe, atmosphere was amazing, food was INCREDIBLE and we had no problem at all with service- maybe actually letting the restaurant be in business for a couple of weeks to work out some small kinks helped- who would expect perfection right away from any new business just opening there doors???  And i think the best part- the part that really amazed me, was that restaurant was created by a couple with no previous experience owning a bar/restaurant- that they were everyday people taking a chance and not a corporate company.  I say bravo Brauhaus Schmitz!  I will be returning!
