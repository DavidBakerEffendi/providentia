A colleague suggested my husband and I check out Inatesso for dinner after a meeting in the financial district. We couldn't have hoped for a better recommendation. On arriving, we were greeted by folks who were warm and casual yet still professional. Not knowing much about Italian wines, our server recommended a wonderful bottle that did not break our budget! And the food was fantastic. The meatballs, arugula salad, pizza Toscana, Â and broccoli rabe have become instant favorites. We will make the trip downtown again soon... And next time head straight to Inatesso!
