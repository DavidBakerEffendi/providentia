Excellent happy hour. Amazing wine and cheese pairings. Â The food tastes absolutely delicious and is surprisingly cheap! Great ambiance - the place is a little small but it is perfect for you if you are looking for an intimate yet fun setting for your experience. I think this is the perfect date spot. They also have a great selection of wines and beers. My friends and I like to catch up at this place. It's one of those rare bars where you can actually hear each other speak. The staff is accommodating and very knowledgeable. I have nothing bad to say about this place. I am a fan! Two thumbs up!
