Small place with outdoor seating and nouveau-Peruvian cuisine...  Went with my two Peruvian cousins to support and explore the new spot...   We ordered eggs benedict, crispy oysters, salmon anticuchos, ceviche, ceviche mixto, tuna tartar, grilled corn, papa a la huancaina, lomo saltado, tilapia entree with cilantro rice and a tuna entree (I think it was tuna, it had a puree, rather forgettable dish), espressos, beers, prosercco and churros... Benedict and tacu tacu was delicious, I love eggs with rice and beans, we devoured this but the home fries were to typical and reminiscent of a diner... Crispy oysters (3 oysters) and salmon skewers were delicious, (two skewers per order) Ceviches were innovative and FRESH. The lomo saltado did not disappoint... The tilapia with cilantro rice was a great dish, great sauce,  so tasty we ordered an extra side of the rice... Waitress Andy was sweet, Chef Miguel said hello to patrons, churros were ok, espresso was bueno... I enjoyed the Chef's vision and new presentations of classic Peruvian dishes and his exploration into new flavor profiles...  I look forward to trying this restaurant again in a few months.
