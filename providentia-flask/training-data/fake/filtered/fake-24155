Coming from the city of the Ramen noodles, I think Minca's ramen is the most authentic "tonkotsu - pork broth" style ramen you can get in Manhattan. On a good day it is the best.  It is said that the chef studied the art of Ramen at one of the most famous Ramen outlets in Japan called "Keika Ramen" so it's based on the Keika style. The only problem is that the broth is not constant, sometimes it is watered down, and the broth is luke warm. I think it depends on who is the cook that day. Ramen Rule number 1) never eat luke warm Ramen Rule number 2) never eat ramen with noodles that are over cooked.  In Japan if a ramen comes out like that, you can generally send it back. People in Tokyo are serious about ramen, and I hope the trend picks up here.  I know there are a couple of authentic ramen outlets getting ready to open their shops in NYC.
