I'm pretty sure I've died and gone to potato heaven.  I've tried several of the things on the menu and have shared some others from friends.  The result is always AMAZING FOOD. You can choose to add a protein like chicken, bacon or egg if that's what you're looking for.  I always get the small size because the small size is actually very big.  I always leave full and satisfied and have never been disappointed by the decently friendly and professional staff as well as the food. There is a seating area, but it's not very big so there have been times when I had to wait for a table and seat.
