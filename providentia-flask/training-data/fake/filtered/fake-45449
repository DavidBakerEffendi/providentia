I can't say enough good things about the helpful folks at the Tavern.  My wife and I held our "rehearsal dinner" there last month and were blown away by how well it went.  I was a bit nervous to hold our event at a bar known for its happy hours, but Alexandra (the Special Events Coordinator) and Bernie (the General Manager) went above and beyond to make the night extraordinary.  The prices were very reasonable for a group of 80, they drew up a custom beer list for our party, they let us play our own music and video, and the food got RAVE reviews (especially the lobster mac n cheese, the blackened shrimp and the BBQ ribs!!) from our guests.  They did a great job putting our event together and making it run smoothly.  I want to especially point out how helpful our bartender, Rich, was for the evening.   Great time, great food, wonderful customer service.  Many thanks!!
