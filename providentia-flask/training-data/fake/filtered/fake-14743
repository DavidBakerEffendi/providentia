I recently read an article in a local Hamilton paper praising the restaurant and expected a great experience.  I arrived on a Wed. around 4:30; there were only 2 other occupied tables.  I ordered the house chardonnay (Flip-Flop) and a lettuce wedge salad with ranch dressing.  The wine was warm and I was going to ask for a chilled wine but didn't.  Next, I was served snowflake rolls with seasoned olive oil presented in a mini carafe.  I poured a small amount of the oil on the plate and dipped a piece of bread into the oil.  I could only taste olive oil.  The waiter came over  and asked how I liked the bread.  I told him frankly that I didn't care for the oil because I couldn't taste any seasoning.  He said he could bring over another carafe, but I said it would be the same thing.  He then suggested I mix the oil and seasonings for a better flavor.  I stirred the oil and seasonings with my knife, but when I poured it the second time, I still only got olive oil on the plate.  I did not eat any more bread (if the bread was high quality, I could eat it plain...it was not).  The waiter did not ask me if the oil mixture improved with the stirring.  The wedge salad was refreshing and I asked to take the half I didn't finish home.  When I got home, I saw that no dressing had been included.   As I was leaving, the hostess asked me how everything was.  I told her I was very disappointed with the oil and seasonings for the bread.  She said she would tell the cook.   I will not be coming back to this establishment.  I'm glad I didn't bring any family or friends here.  I understand that the owner  here is also the owner of Acacia  in Lawrenceville; what a world of difference between the two restaurants!
