An amazing culinary gem!!! Cafe Fulya is fantastic on several levels. First, the food is delicious. Their baklava is so tasty, as are their various soups. The staff is really friendly, professional, and fast. The seating and decor is really intimate, so it's a really comfortable venue. And finally, the prices are totally reasonable, especially considering the neighborhood. I absolutely recommend wholeheartedly.
