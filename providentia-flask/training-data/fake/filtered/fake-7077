Cheap and (relatively) healthy food in midtown is hard to find.  I was hoping a $5 kati roll would be the answer, but the size is far too small.  My little sister weighs 95 lbs and probably wouldn't be satisfied by only one of these little guys.  The quality is heads above a street meat cart's lamb in a pita, but those are much bigger and the the prices are the same. The wrap is paratha, an Indian bread that is dense and foldable but not as fluffy as naan.  The fillings are very good.  I had one mutton roll and one paneer roll.  The paneer was large and firm and the onions it came with were delicious and had a hint of spice.  The mutton had simple seasonings and some burnt grill flavor.  I preferred the paneer. Summary:  Ultimately, you can't call a single $5 roll from here light, only small.  The greasy bread and heavy-n-your-tummy fillings aren't light fare but the small size leaves you hungry anyway.  The flavor is tasty though.  I call this place a snack not a lunch.
