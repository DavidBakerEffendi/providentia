I have been here quite a bit and have always had a great experience. I'm also thankful they deliver. Maybe I've lived in west philly too long, but that is among my top 5 places to go to. I get the pork burrito. It's big and the price is very fair. The family-recipe sauce they use is really fantastic. Hot chocolate and churros is a great way to end...
