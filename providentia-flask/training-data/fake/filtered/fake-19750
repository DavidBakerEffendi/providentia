Read the NY times review and thought this was going to be a very nice place for lunch before Â a show we had tickets for. We were seated promptly and our waiter very pleasant came to greet us. He asked for our drink order we were told they ran out of Grey Goose vodka and suggested house vodka. My husband requested something else. I ordered a specialty drink and was told they did not have all the ingredients, the made something else. We asked about an entree on the menu and was told they did not have it. What we did get was very salty. The waiter took our coffee and dessert order and the dessert came before the coffee, way before the coffee. The only good thing I can say it is connected to the theatre. Oh by the way, on our way out my husband spotted a bottle of Grey Goose vodka behind the bar. Would we go back, I think NOT?
