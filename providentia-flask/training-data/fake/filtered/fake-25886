I love this restaurant. It's a neighborhood joint that is always crowded on Saturday night and the food was delicious.  I had the spaghetti and meatballs and the meatballs were the best I've had in years. The service was very good and since there was a waiting list we sat at the bar and had couple drinks before the food. This is an unpretentious Italian restaurant in the heart of South Philly  rich with the basics
