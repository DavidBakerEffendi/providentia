I really enjoyed Vesta.  The restaurant is lovely to look at and comfortable. The service was great.  The food was delicious, with one proviso --  it was all oversalted (and I love salt).   I had the Rigatoni and my friend had the "grass fed" steak with polenta with blue cheese.  The polenta was over the top salty and really only detracted from the dish.  Mashed potatoes or polenta sans blue cheese (and excess salt) would have been much simpler and better.  Vesta, please take note!!!
