If you're someone who is interested in opening your palate to new and exciting tastes, this is the place to go! My best friend made reservations at this restaurant for her graduation celebration, which up until that day I'd never even heard of the place, much less ate asian cuisine before. The atmosphere was beautiful and the service was excellent. Albeit a bit pricey, for family size servings, it was worth it compared to more commonly known restaurants like say, Outback Steakhouse, in comparison with serving size ratio to price range. Im not sure of exactly the name of what I ordered, but it was shrimp with horseradish, tiny lime slices and glazed walnuts...something I'd never Â thought i'd like, and certainly a combination of food I'd never consider married on a dish, but it was absolutely delicious and after tasting small portions of food ordered from the other three friends I dined with, I was full and satisfied! You must try the wasabi mashed potatoes and the lobster! Everything was really good. The only negative thing I'd report, although it was more akin to funny than anything else, is the fact that as soon as your finished eating your food and drinking your drink, there is someone right there to wipe off the surface of the table immediately....i mean.... immediately. Their almost on top of you to make sure they grab your empty plate, glass and wipe down the place where your plate once was. Otherwise, i truly enjoyed my food, the drinks and the atmosphere and plan to go again for a special night with my cousins! If you're looking for the same old, this is not the place for you but if you're looking for something very different then defenitely dine at Buddakan.
