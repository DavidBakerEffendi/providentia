This has to be another one of my favorite places in NYC. Coming directly from Japan with over 28 small restaurants, Ippudo NY is serving traditional dishes that will blow your mind. The first time I was not sure it was worth the wait, because during the weekend it can be up to a 2hr wait. Believe me, its worth it. The best times to go are before 5pm which would be their lunch service. So if you are a freelancer, or have a flexible schedule, go during the week. Get pork buns, get shishito peppers, and my favorite ramen would have to be the Modern. The portions are large and the ambience is awesome. You will feel right at home after you go into the dinning room area. Staff is attentive, and very nice. Go for it!
