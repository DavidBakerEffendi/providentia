This business is very positive for Ditmars and Astoria. MP Taverna ilcontro and S-prime steak house are helping to upgrade restaurant status in our neighborhood. I love the experience at MP the seafood was delicious is a Greek American fusion restaurant. The octopus and the grandma meat balls are my favorite. Do yourself a favor, Make a reservation, This place is hot thing is Astoria and walk-inns must wait Â a lot. Ditmars is becoming in such a great area I'm so glad !!!
