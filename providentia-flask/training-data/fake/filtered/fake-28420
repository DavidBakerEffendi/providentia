Worst place ever!!! We went for lunch and the food never came out for like 90 minutes and when the food came over it was not worth the wait at all. The waiter didn't know their special soup for the day had meat in it, while he was reading out the menu saying it was a vegetarian dish. We were terribly disappointed with the service and food, we were trying to get together to celebrate a colleagues birthday. After mentioning it to the waiter, he said he would help us make it more special for our buddy by bringing over a piece of cake which never came!!! We had to remind the waiter 4 times and yet left the restaurant with no celebrations. Worst place ever, I would not go back even if they pay me for having food at the place.
