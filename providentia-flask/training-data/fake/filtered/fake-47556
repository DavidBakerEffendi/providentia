We were there yesterday and waited outside for about 25 minutes.  The pizza was ok...1/2 was burnt but in reading the other reviews, that seems common.  The thing that got us what how RUDE the staff was.  Not our waiter, he was fine, but there is a kid with long hair pulled in a bun that was beyond rude.  He brought our pizza over and asked how many pizzas we ordered and I thought he asked how many people (someone was in the restroom)) and he yelled at me...full blowed yelled. And that was the same kid who screamed at my kids because they went first up the stairs and kept going up to the third floor by accident and the same person who was rude to me while I was waiting for the restroom and I was in his way.  RUDE person...the pizza was ok but it was so cold outside and it wasn't worth the wait.
