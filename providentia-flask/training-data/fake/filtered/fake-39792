Home away from home. Service is always great, whether I'm there with one or two other people or manage to drum up a whole party. The bartenders and servers always add that extra step (such as placing a kitchen order 5 minutes before the kitchen closes) that makes it feel like I'm not just some other customer they're trying to gleam a couple dollars in tips from. For bar food, nachos are where it's at. They're a great price for a huge pile of molten cheese, salsa and sour cream. I was skeptical about a burger being served on an English muffin, but it actually came out as something pretty unique and quite tasty. I work nights, but I've been meaning for a long time to come in and actually sit down for dinner. Don't roll in expecting a sports bar when you see their big flat screens on the walls. Don't expect the same kind of service you'd get at a TGIF either. The drinks, food and service are always worth it.
