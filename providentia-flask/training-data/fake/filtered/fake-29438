Definitely a great find in the middle of a rough patch of town. The atmosphere was great, although I did have a strong Â urge to play Red Dead Redemption... The food was spectacular, especially the corn nuggets. My blue tortilla enchiladas were perfectly spiced, and to top it all off they had the best beer list I've seen. Not only that, but they had my favorite beer that I had only been able to find in New Orleans! Hoorah!
