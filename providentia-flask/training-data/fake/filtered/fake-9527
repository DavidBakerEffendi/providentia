Pretty storefront - I'm glad someone finally put it to use! We had an excellent meal here. The service was great, the food delicious. It was packed, which is good on a Saturday night, but not so packed that we had to wait and wait. It was pretty loud in there, as others have said, but the rest of the ambiance is very peaceful and I would definitely go again!
