We greatly enjoyed our meal at Cavos. My daughter and I shared the Hommus and pita as appetizer and had the Chicken piccata and eggplant parmagana for entrees. Huge proportions and quick service. Our waitress, Tracy, was quick to explain the dishes we were unfamiliar with. Alas, we were too full to give the desserts any real attention. Cavos will certainly become a favorite.
