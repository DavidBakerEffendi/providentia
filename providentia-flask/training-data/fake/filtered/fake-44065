A group of us went to Pier 76  this afternoon after my granddaughther's dance recital at the St. George Theatre.  We went there because they serve gluten free pizza which my granddaughter needs to eat.  Delicious!  The rest of the party had regular, sausage and pepperoni pizza...absolutely delicious and as good as any Brooklyn pizza I have eaten.   Although I don't mind a thicker crust at all, the thin crust they make was soooo good.  We all thoroughly enjoyed it.  The wait staff were all extremely pleasant and helpful.  Jeremy, the chef/owner was so sweet and kind and gracious and seems to be really concerned about gluten free needs and no cross-contamination.  Thank you for that on behalf of my granddaughter!   I can say with certainty that we will be back...gotta taste the cinnamon french toast that someone, who shall remain nameless, but should know who he is,  gobbled up before I could taste it... I was told it was awesome.  I can't wait to try other offerings on the menu.  Thanks again, Jeremy and staff, for helping to make dance recital day a special memory for us. Marsha K.
