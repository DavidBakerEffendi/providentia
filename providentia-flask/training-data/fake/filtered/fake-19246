AWESOMENESS Food - best Thai food in NYC area, hands down - and yes I've been to many restaurants and to Thailand too Decor - nice but not over the top, perfect to sit in for a simple date, or an easy and quick dinner Service - good, but you don't go to Tuk Tuk for that Recommendation - Roti Massaman, Chicken Green Curry (wow!), Pineapple Duck Curry, Pad Kee Mao
