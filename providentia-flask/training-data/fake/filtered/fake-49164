I fell in love with this small shop tucked away in the heart of the financial district that has a soul straight from Italy. This is NOT like any of these stores in New York City that claim that they sell italian food and always disappoint you. Pisillo imports EVERYTHING from Italy. The sandwiches are huge (it can literally feed 5 people) and worth every penny. They catered to my needs and wants. I told them that I didn't eat pork, and they already had a suggestion for what would be best for me. They suggested the FIRENZE and I fell in love! The Firenze has roasted chicken, provolone cheese, arugula, sweet peppers, and thee BEST balsamic vinaigrette dressing I have ever had (I've worked in the food industry for years). It beats anything I have ever tasted. AMAZING. They make the dressings themselves and I almost asked for the recipe! Besides the great food, the service is phenomenal. It is truly a mom and pop shop that makes you feel right at home. Soft music is playing in the background while you're given a warm smile and a list of their specials. They ask you what bread you prefer and call you by your name when your order is ready. I definitely recommend this place to anyone who likes to eat well and wants to enjoy a slice of Italy while trying to shut out the noise of NYC.
