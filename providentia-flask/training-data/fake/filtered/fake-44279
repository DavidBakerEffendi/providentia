In 2007, I was deployed to Afghanistan to fight the war. It was incredibly difficult to leave my family, my friends, and my community once more, after returning from Iraq less than a year before. Now, you may be wondering why I'm posting a review for Lee's. Growing up in West Philadelphia, I have been a regular since I was a child. And let me say that Scott, the owner, is a genuinely caring fellow. Last year during Christmas time, while I was stranded at my base in the deserts of the Middle East, Scott sent me an unbelievable surprise: a Lee's signature buffalo chicken cheese steak, barbeque chicken wings, a carrot cake, and letter from the neighborhood. I cannot tell you how much his gesture meant to me; how much it means to me, even now. Yes--the food at Lee's Deli is superb. But--the customer care is unmatched.
