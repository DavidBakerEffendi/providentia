We had our first visit this past Saturday night and the four of us thoroughly enjoyed our experience. The food, the server; Dan who was terrific, and Albert, who took the time to come over to explain the Bourbon Project, made it a perfect evening. We had the flatbred, the Sushito Peppers were AWESOME!!, the steak, scallops, risotto and veggies...nothing else to say except we're going to go back to experience their Brunch. We left hoping they continue to do well and wish them all great success. P.S, My family lives in Boston and go out frequently...they can be tough to impress....not that they are food critics, but honestly, it was nice to take them somewhere new that they really appreciated.
