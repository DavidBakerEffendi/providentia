Love the food! Enjoyed the one in Mt. Arlington and was so glad they opened a location here in Wayne! Not your traditional greasy Chinese food. Very flavorful & fresh. Doesn't make you want to go to sleep after eating it. Also doesn't leave you feeling gross afterwards, or hungry again soon after eating like Chinese mysteriously usually does. My husband loves the sushi. I always get the chicken & broccoli and we share the pineapple fried rice. No reg white rice, dishes come with steamed brown rice as a healthier substitute. Even my picky kids like the food! They did say they thought the pineapple fried rice was spicy. I personally didn't think so. The only thing that would make this place better is delivery!
