Had the pleasure of stopping in here this past week on St. Patty's Day for an after wedding get together with friends from the area.  Great local bar atmosphere, if you enjoy green beer with peanuts on the floor kinda joint :D  Standard bar fair for food, would suggest the wings if you've not had them, they were pretty tasty and reasonably priced but definitely not hot enough for my taste, heck very rare to find a good wing up to my measure of heat, but they were meaty and a good mix of drums/wings.   Can get a little crowded but service was amicable; but that may also be due to our friends being patrons :D  All in all, if you are in the area I would say do a check in...
