I've ordered delivery from Kabuki a number of times since they opened, and I'm rarely disappointed. I'm a huge sushi lover; unfortunately for me, the last time I had a raw fish feast (at a different restaurant, when I was visiting home in DC), I happened to come down with a stomach virus right after. Needless to say, it's going to be a while before I'm ready to go back to the good stuff. So when I was craving Japanese for lunch today, I ordered a California roll, eel nigiri, and some edamame. Ok, so it may have been the most boring sushi order I've ever placed, but it was absolutely delicious and satisfying. The eel was cooked just right with not too much eel sauce, and the edamame was perfect - not overdone and limp, but with just the right amount of bite. In the past I've ordered tuna avocado rolls and yellowtail rolls from Kabuki - both great. I have had some not-so-great items, however. First, their seaweed salad; I love a good seaweed salad, but this one just doesn't taste right to me. Almost fishy tasting (not in a good way). Second, their chicken teriyaki bento box was completely unimpressive - chicken was chewy and bland, shumai was soggy, and the miso soup was completely bland (I had to add a few tablespoons of soy sauce to give it some flavor). A rip-off at $19. Overall, though, a great choice if you're craving some sushi. Super quick and courteous delivery, as well!
