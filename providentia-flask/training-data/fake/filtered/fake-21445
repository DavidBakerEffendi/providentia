Having lived in Israel for a few years, I have become very picky about my falafel and hummus. I am giving three stars because I found more wrong than right with this establishment. My friend suggested we meet up there for a bit of nosh and I was gong-ho because I could get my humus on. At first I was happily surprised that they served burekas ($2.50 a piece!) and ordered a piece, what I got in return was something much smaller than how it looked and it was barely luke warm after having them throw it in the oven. Secondly, we decided to share a large red pepper roasted humus. The humus was so so, nothing to rave about, but they only gave us 1 piece of pita (and it was whole wheat after I had said white). You need more than 1 piece of pita for a large serving of humus. On the bright side, they had ample seating and the place was very clean. However, I don't think I will go to this establishment at another time.
