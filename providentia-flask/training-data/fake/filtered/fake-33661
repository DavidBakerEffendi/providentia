Not worth the super long wait. The food is mediocre and the atmosphere is terrible for socializing. It is VERY noisy. My last experience here left a bad taste in my mouth and I will not be back. My friend who is 22 tried to order a beer before realizing he did not have his ID on him then when our other friend ordered margarita (she's 30!) they treated her like her ID was a fake and had to have it double checked. Finally she was given the drink. During dinner she asked us to try it. We all took a sip and the waiter immediately RAN over to our table and yelled at us for underage drinking because he hadn't seen two of our IDs. We said no prob we just tried it we wont drink the drink. Next thing we know the manager is At our table YELLING at us a bunch of crap about liquor license. At least I can say our table was complimented on our youthful looks but I can do without the lecture, loud noise, average food, rude service and very long wait.
