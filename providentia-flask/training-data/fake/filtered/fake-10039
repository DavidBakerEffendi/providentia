I had a fantastic experience this past Saturday night at Soba-ya!  The hostess said the wait was going to be 30 minutes and even took our phone number to call us when our table was ready.  The wait was about 20 minutes and she called as promised.  Everything we ordered was delish...from the Shrimp Shumai to the Tempura Udon (hot.)  The black sesame ice cream was to die for...I cannot wait to go back!
