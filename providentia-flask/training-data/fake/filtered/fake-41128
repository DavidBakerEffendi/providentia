ONE RUDE AND ARROGANT RESTAURANT. They may make some really good ramen noodles (not the best I had anyways), but i wouldn't EVER go back just because how arrogant and rude they treated their customers. I saw this server yelling at a guy who was just trying to charge his 5% battery-life iphone, which was approved by another guy. And this server, using his horrible Japanese accent screaming "Yu cunt do dat! Yu cunt do dat!" Who wants to pay for ill treatment anyways. One more place blacklisted.
