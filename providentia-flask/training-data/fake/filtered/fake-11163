In one succinct word : FREAKSHOW. I tried sitting in the "fish restaurant"... the service was so slow that the people behind me were literally drinking themselves into a stupor waiting for their order. Wine waiters (they have specialized shmucks who are trained in the upsell track) were actually comping good customers entire bottles to apoloogize for the delays. I'm looking over the counter into the undersized kitchen at a tatooed dude who looked like he spent his share of time in the greybar hotel downstate for car theft or the like. So I picked up my stuff and moved to the, ummm... "pizza restaurant" where, in their kitchen, a bunch of semi coherent guys are mumbling and grumbling.... I do get my pizza... soggy on top and CHARRED BLACK on the bottom.... one bite and I thought I was eating a relic of the World Trade Center... the burned taste stayed in my mounth for the rest of the night.... Never, ever again will I spend a dime in this shlock shop...,
