The food is OK. I don't usually order anything besides Pho Dac Biet when I eat there. This should be very fast and easy to make. (SMDH) That is the biggest issue with this place. They are S L O W! I suggest to only get take out from this place. Order the food about an hour in advance. Especially large orders. You might be lucky if it's ready by the time you arrive.
