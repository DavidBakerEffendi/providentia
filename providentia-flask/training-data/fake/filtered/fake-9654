This isn't the 1st time I've eaten at Andrews, and won't be the last My favorite is his Falafel Sandwich which I can not have enough of. But today I ordered his Vegetarian Salad, which is out of this World. All fresh Ingredients and very tasty.  I would give this man a thumbs up for all the work he puts into all his cooking. His soups are excellent and all gluten free and creamy, Again I have a favorite of his soups. Butternut Squash, and before I started eating at Andrews, I never had this soup. It's simply delicious!!!!!!  This item alone I would give a 5 Star. I heard that he was Bill Clinton's private chef, I don't know how the man let this owner of this Cafe go. I agree with Riss H. He does deserve a Nobel Prize for his delicious gluten free healthy cooking.  His ideas are Fantastic!!!
