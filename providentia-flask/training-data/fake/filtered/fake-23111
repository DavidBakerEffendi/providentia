Food is excellent and so is the atmosphere.  This is my favorite place to go in the area, everything on the menu is amazing including the burgers.  Beer selection is fantastic and the service is always excellent.  Love going here either for dinner or to watch a game.  If you have never been to a Wood N Tap location, you are missing out.  This one provides the same excellent food quality, atmosphere and beer selection as the others I have been to.  Great Place to Go to.
