Every aspect of Galli is beyond amazing. The menu, moderately priced and delish hosts a bevy of fresh and flavorful dishes. The kale salad and the shrimp/asparagus/goat cheese salad are divine. The integrale pasta is also really yummy. The meals aren't laden in sauce or too heavy (as what you'd find in Little Italy), the portions are great for the price, especially considering its location. The space is cool and striking but still very inviting. There is a really rad boxing theme going on, with family photos scattered about to reiterate the intimacy of the vibe. There are a few outdoor tables a front room, the bar and a back room. The back room has floor to ceiling exposed brick and makes for a great dance scene after hours. Good for private parties. Derek Lam hosted an after here during fashion week. Lastly the Gali team is amazing, cute and crafty mixologists, and a lovely waitstaff. Most importantly, Â the owner Steven Gallo and his fabulous wife (creative behind the restaurant) are phenomenal hosts. Their hospitality makes you feel right at home. For a great space, better atmosphere and delicious fare...Go to Galli.
