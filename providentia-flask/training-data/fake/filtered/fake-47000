If only Agno's environmental practices matched up to the quality of the food they serve. I ate a delicious salad out of a compostable dish (but there was nowhere to compost it afterwards), was given two dressing containers (both plastic), served water out of a small plastic dixie cup, not mention the plastic utensils. After I ate everything I had no choice but to throw it all away, just like the countless people whom I watched do the same. Â Just container after container discarded as people walked out the door. Agno would be much better served if they provided eat-in customers with proper glassware. The amount of plastic and waste generated from Agno is truly maddening and does not seem to coincide with a 'healthy eating' perspective.
