Le Barricou is hands-down my favorite brunch spot in the Williamsburg area.  I've been going there for a once-monthly brunch religiously since I discovered it about a year ago.  The Eggs Benedict are the best I've had and my roommate swears by the Croque Madame.  I went for dinner the other night, which was equally delicious.  Think rustic, cozy French comfort food.  My companions and I shared the Coq au Vin, Bar Steak and the fish special, steamed Black Bass.  We all had a hard time finishing the hearty portions. There is rarely a wait, even on the busiest of weekends.  The prices are totally reasonable (for both brunch and dinner).  The atmosphere is lovely--a good eclectic mix of music playing and quirky, rustic French decor.  The staff is equally exceptional.  Our favorite waitress knows what we usually order and usually chats with us for a few minutes.  Last night she brought us a complimentary Creme Brulee. I've also been to Le Barricou with large groups, and they are very accomodating. 5+ stars!
