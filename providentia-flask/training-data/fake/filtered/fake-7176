I have to say this is the best ramen in town.  I had the the Shiromaru and I must say this is real traditional Japanese pork based broth (you must drink the broth too coz this is the soul of the ramen).  I took off one star for making me wait such a LONG time (2 hours)!  But the ramen is definitely a 5 star!
