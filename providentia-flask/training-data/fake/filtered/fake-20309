Boi na Brasa is a Brazilian Steakhouse where they serve not only the Traditional Brazilian Rodizio but other Brazilian national food. When in Newark, I always prefer to stop at Boi Na Brasa and have something to eat. The price is right for the amount of food, but, not enough if you are the type of person that likes to have enough to take home to eat in the middle of the night :o). The service is okay, I would suggest additional staff to make ordering a little smoother but, if you dont mind waiting 5 min (at times) for someone to come to you to take your order you will be fine.
