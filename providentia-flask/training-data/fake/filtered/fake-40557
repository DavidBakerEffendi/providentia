To Allie D--  This is your opinion - that a cafe must have an epresso machine - but not always as important to others as you -  are you aware of how much a professional expresso machine cost over 10,000$- lets give these sister a chance to get it thru the first 3mos before we bash another small business that is trying to make a go of it---thanks I think Tiny Elephant will grow into the space - what I have eaten so far is yummy-I wish them all the luck !
