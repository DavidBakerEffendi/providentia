They sat us right away for our 8 oclock reservation. The pastas took forever to come and they gave us a free appetizer as an apology. The mushrooms were delicious, the polenta was not. the pastas were tasty but not amazing. The entrees were simply bad. I mean really bad. The stuffed chicken tasted like a microwave dinner. The duck was overcooked and bad, and the rice with it was one of the worst tastings of food I have had in a long time. The Salmon didn't taste right and the sauce it came with was not a good fit in my opinion. We came here thinking it was a possible Malatesta trattoria closer to home, we were sadly mistaken.
