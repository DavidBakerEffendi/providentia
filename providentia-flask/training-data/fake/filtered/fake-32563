Nick and his brother are among the kindest, most courteous, and friendly proprietors of a food truck you will ever meet. Going to Gussy's Greek food truck even once a week is an absolute joy, and when Nick or his brother greet you, you feel like you're amongst friends. Order anything over the yellow rice, and you won't be disappointed. My favorite is the pork souvlaki, with the Greek-and-Mild sauce mix, over rice. Get a baklava dessert or two to go, for that lovely cinnamon, cardamom, ambrosia honey, and toasted walnut taste on a light, deliciously flaky filo crust, and the rest of your day will be amazing. 51st and Park almost every day. Be there if you want a FANTASTIC meal, served by a great team. Also to Jessica Y. who stated that the food got cold from a 5 minute walk, remember, April was a cold month this year, and it makes no sense if the food was aromatic while walking, but was served cold. The scent would not permeate through the bag into the open atmosphere of the city and reach your nostrils if it was cold. You either have a severe problem with your olfactory or taste senses, or you forgot a major detail that you waited 2 hours to open your lunch bag.
