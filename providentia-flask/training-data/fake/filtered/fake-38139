Nice decor but very overpriced beer plus expensive and limited menu.  Coffee and beer selection is great but still priced too high.  When you walk into this place you dont know whether to wait to be seated, order at bar, or sit and wait to be waited on.... Good place for the brooklyn hipster vibe If you are into that but how often could you have grilled cheese for lunch.....  I will add that the one  salad they serve is actually very good but still on the small side for the price.
