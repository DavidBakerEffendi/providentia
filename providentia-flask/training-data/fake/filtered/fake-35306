Great place, great beers, great atmosphere.  All great, except for the red-bearded ZZ-top looking jerk behind the bar who basically told us to quiet down because we were "the loudest ones in the bar".  DUDE IT'S A BAR.  Get over yourself.  We immediately left.  I would have made this place one of my top spots if it wasn't for this rude jerk.
