I went to Salugo, Saturday night, March 1, 2014. I was seated and placed my order. After approximately 1/2 hr I questioned where my appetizer was after seeing two couples who sat down after me receive their food. I was told "we are very busy". The owner/chef then came out of the kitchen and wanted to know why there was a problem. When we tried to explain to him he, rather then take any responibility, he told us if we weren't happy we could leave". I've never been treated like this in a restaurant and think it was very unprofessional. If this is the way they handle Â a problem in their kitchen I would never recommend their restaurant to anyone.
