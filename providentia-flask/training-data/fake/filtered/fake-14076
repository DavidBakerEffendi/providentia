This is my family's go to sushi place and we go there fairly often. We have tried many other sushi places in Connecticut, but we keep going back to Ginza. The staff is phenomenal and friendly. The server's and managers remember us and greet us warmly every visit, which is another reason why we keep coming back. Although I love nearly the entire menu, we do have our favorites. Their edamame is delicious, as well as their miso and tom yum soups. Their signature rolls and special rolls are awesome. I would highly recommend the Angry Dragon Roll as well as the Paradise Roll or even the Ocean Garden Roll. We have tried many typical and signature rolls here and have never been disappointed. While a meal here can get pricy, especially the signature rolls, they do have a fantastic happy hour menu as well as a rewards program. I believe their happy hour occurs M-F 3-6PM, where they not only have great drink deals, they have great deals on sushi too. Not only are the regular rolls about half off, but so are some of the signature rolls too. If you plan to go there regularly, sign up for the rewards program. You earn points for every dollar you spend, and they have double points promotions every so often. I've gotten many $50 gift cards off of this program.
