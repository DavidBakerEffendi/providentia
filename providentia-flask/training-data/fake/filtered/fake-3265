Let me start off by saying that I made this Yelp account because I felt that everyone needed to know about how great this place is! Came in here a little while ago and had one of the best experiences I've ever had at a bar.  I am new to the city and I had heard about Local 44 from some new friends who live in West Philly.  They're all vegetarians and vegans and swear by this place, but I figured I'd give their carnivore options a go. Anyway, I stopped in for lunch and grabbed a seat at the bar.  What a great list of beers!! The awesome bartender, Sara, was able to point me in the right direction with some delicious recommendations.  She really knows her stuff and made me feel welcome.  I ordered the burger with bacon.  This thing was insanely juicy and cooked to perfection.  House made pickle? Yes, please.  The fries were seasoned just right.  All around an amazing experience.     I'll be back soon!
