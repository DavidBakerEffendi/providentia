Almond was awesome. I went here for a graduation dinner hoping for the best and that is exactly what i got. Im a big fan of dim mood lighting to set off a calm and relaxing experience and their lighting was on point. So if you are looking for an intimate setting with great food this is your place. The service was superb and the waiters were very professional. Â I would reccommend the cheese burger with fries, delicious! The only complaint would be thay the lobster pasta was a little too watery to enjoy the true flavors.
