you are a diner phenomenally. phenomenal diner, that is you. toms. i dream of the blueberry pancakes with fresh cinnamon butter melting in my mouth. i feel the crunch of crispy tortilla in the huevos rancheros in perfect juxtaposition with the broken egg yolk and buttery black beans. feeeeeeeed me! feed me orange quarters in line! serve me delicious, freshly brewed coffee as i wait impatiently to be seated, staring a hole through some poor hipsters french toast. Â seeeeeerve me in your quaint little atrium. i love you, toms.
