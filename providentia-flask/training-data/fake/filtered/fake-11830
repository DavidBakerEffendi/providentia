We found De Legna on one of its first days.  The pizza was exceptional.  We ate three pizzas (Scarole e fagioli, Salmon affumicato, and the Rustica) and really enjoyed all three.  My daughter loved the Scarole.   I loved the Salmon and both my wife and son-in-law enjoyed the Rustica.   The choice of small plates was interesting, extensive, and reasonably priced.   All of the staff was friendly, professional and attentive.  They actually stocked some good port wine as well.  I enjoyed seeing their wood fired oven.  It takes guts to open another pizza restaurant in New Haven.   These young people have carried it off with some interesting food that goes beyond the traditional, heavy offerings of the past.  We will go there at every opportunity and suggest that you do so as well.
