I have never had any Vietnamese food before going to this place.  A friend of mine brought me here.  I had the pork sandwich. OH MY WAS IT GOOD!  I loved the carrot and cucumber slaw type mixture that they had on the sandwich.  It was so refreshing.  I hope I can find a place like this somewhere back home!
