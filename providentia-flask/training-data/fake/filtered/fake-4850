How can you advertise that you offer smoked meats and the meat is not smoked?  I ordered the brisket plate, it was about 60% grisel fat and not smokey AT ALL.  It was tender and I could tell it was slow cooked in an oven and no way shape or form barbqued slow smoked.  For $12 a few chunks of fatty non-smoked brisket over a soggy piece of bread and hardly edible "pickled" onions and that's it was a complete let down.  Also, after we ate we were still sitting at our table enjoying a few beers and our waitress walks up to us and tells us we have a "5 minute warning" and need to get out for a party coming in.  How rude is that?  Pretty sad when you go out for dinner you actually have to go to another restaurant after your dinner to get good food and get satisfied.  I will never come back nor will I recommend this place.
