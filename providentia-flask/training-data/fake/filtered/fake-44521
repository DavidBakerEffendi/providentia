My family and I visited Karma last week and I have to say if you're looking for authentic north and south Indian food, this is the place to go!! The naan is the best I've had and the Tandoori shrimp and chicken tikka are amazing. The staff was helpful and courteous...and the food was fresh and delicious! My parents who are from India originally were extremely impressed with everything!
