Easy to find location. UP SCALE sports bar/ lounge, not your average restaurant. The inside is beautifully decorated. One word for the food, AMAZING. I have visited The Lobby about a dozen times and the food is absolutely top notch. Delicious. Perfection. Service is amazing. The bartenders look very pretty and well dressed, as so do the servers. Pool tables, FREE! Just have to be buying drinks/food. HUGE TV screens by the bar area (4) and many throughout the restaurant. There is a VIP area for birthday parties which is very spacious. As for the the nightlife here, the DJ's they have play really good music. A variety from all types of spanish music to hip hop and dance/house. Love the music at night!! There is a dress code, which keeps the low lifes away! Very classy, like I said UP SCALE! All in all, I give it a 5 STAR rating. I will, and have definitely already, recommended to many of my friends. No complaints at all. Keep up the good work!!
