I'm an Orange resident, and was thrilled I heard the Wood N Tap was coming our way.  Now that they've been open, my girlfriends and I are so excited  to have such a great place to go that's close!!  The food is always fresh and delicious.  Service is always top notch.  And the beer selection keeps us coming back for more! I highly recommend the Wood N Tap to anyone that will listen!
