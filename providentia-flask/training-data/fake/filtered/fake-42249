I never write reviews but, as this is one of our all-time favorite restaurants, I am baffled by the few negative reviews and want to be sure everyone knows how amazing Traif is.  We have probably had dinner there about 15 times and brunch 5 times - I have to admit, we've even been in on a Saturday night and then back Sunday morning.  For dinner our favorite dishes are the tuna tarter on top of tempura eggplant (just the right amount of spice and great textures) and the short rib sliders (they melt in your mouth and the sweet potato fries with smoked paprika aioli are far and away the best we've ever had, and are the only sweet potatoes my husband will eat) - I think of both dishes constantly and they are consistently out of this world every time.  The scallop dish changes regularly but is always delicious and the scallops perfectly cooked.  The bacon doughnuts and budino are both incredible for dessert and I love their house Sauvignon Blanc, Mudhouse, and now even buy it to drink at home.  Our daughter even asked to have her 11th birthday dinner here!  While it is a bummer for us that Manhattanites are now onto Traif and it's getting tough to get a reservation, they really deserve it and we've learned to just call in advance!
