I was attracted initially to this deli eatery that was clean and made a good sandwich. They use high quality condiments and don't buy the cheapest special of the week. I know when I order my turkey, swiss, lettuce and tomato, plain wrap with cranberry sauce and extra mayonnaise, that is exactly what I get each and every time, no special of the week mayos. Only the best, meats, cheeses and breads are used. It is consistent, The main counter chiefs,Rich and Janice are experienced and fast with a smile and friendly comment that makes you enjoy coming back and referring friends. Recommend their extensive  sandwich platters for meetings and parties  You'll be happy you did.  Smoothly orchestrating this professional staff and preparers is the owner of many years of experience and new ideas that keep you interested in the menu. In additional to great homemade soups that I started on before graduating to their custom sandwiches, there are counters of Shepard pie, spicy Max Bibo breads, potato and salads to name a few to make sure you are getting all of the essentials. Then there are the jars and platters of irresistible homemade deserts, big enough to fill the void without making one feel guilty .The soda racks are filled with not only coke and chips, but hard to find Blackberry, Orange and Root Beer sodas. This  is all backed up by friendly, hardworking staff. Finally....the piece de resistance in my mind are the best half sour pickles I have ever had with each sandwich. It's family, made by family. Go. you'll enjoy it You go to the fast food chains and you lay out 7 to 10 dollars easily. I never escape from whole foods for less the 10 or 12. Max Bibo's, a good buy for your money, local, fast and friendly.
