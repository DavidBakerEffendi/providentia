I haven't been to this place for a while, and as such, this review is based on what I remember.  Their shrimp shumai was OK, although it was a bit chewy around the edges.  The curry soup was plenty hot enough for me, although  they supply chili sauce for even more kick if you find their curry not hot enough (or if you just like pain).  I also tried their mango bubble tea .  The mango flavor was very subtle, perhaps because on top of the ice cream, they added milk to the mix.  All the same, it was refreshing and I spent a few minutes idly sipping, and sucking up wonderfully chewy pearls of black tapioca.  It's the sort of drink that is most welcome during the summer. I remember I couldn't get in one day because there were SO many people.  I think the line actually went out the door almost to the corner!   The location is good, although the restaurant is not immediately seen should you be walking down Chapel Street.  It may take a bit of searching to find if you're not familiar with the area. I have recently been informed that Dee Asian Kitchen's quality has dipped, perhaps due to cutting corners to keep prices down.  I will have to go someday to see for myself, but for now, I would recommend this place if you're looking for steamed Chinese food, or something that you may not find elsewhere downtown (for example, the Vietnamese Beef Combination Noodle soup, which contains beef trip, tendon and omasum- part of a cow's stomach, for those who are wondering).
