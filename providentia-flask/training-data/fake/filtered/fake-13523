Please do not waste your time and money here. The beer was warm and tasted bad. My po' boy was made with cheap, tasteless, and stale bread. There was coleslaw all over it, which added no flavor and just made a mess. The "blackened" catfish was not blackened at all, because it was not spiced nearly enough. I've had a lot of blackened fish in the south and this was nothing like that. It was tasteless and had a pronounced gross fish flavor, like fish gone bad. The sandwich was just a sloppy, watery, tasteless mess. I could make WAY better at home. The gumbo tasted like it was made with a spice mix. It had that flat, fake flavor i remember from beef ramen flavoring pouches. And the shrimp was so overcooked, it no longer bore any resemblance to food item I am such a fan of. I'm sorry Catfish, but you really need to up your game. Your food is not just not good, it's actually bad.
