The beer is cold but the service can be colder; bartender John spent time talking with his friends at one end of the bar and then got mad when we pointed to our emptey glasses. He seemed to think he was doing us a favor by gettting us a new round. Brick burger is tasty and curly fries are good but John(?) is not the most attentive or friendly barkeep
