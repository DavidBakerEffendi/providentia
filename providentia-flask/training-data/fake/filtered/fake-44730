I went to Yerba Buena for dinner with a friend early on a Monday night, after finding the wait time 2 hours for two people on a Saturday. We were pleasantly surprised by the very friendly waitstaff and excellent food. Carlos was our waiter- giving us wonderful recommendations on our cocktails and even promising that we would like the cocktails he suggested otherwise he would take it back and make us a different one of our choosing. Needless to say that didn't happen because they were all delicious. The Pisco Guava was amazing and the Jalapeno Cucumber one had the perfect amount of kick and the fresh cucumber lightness to it matched with the Gin. We had the blue corn calamari and the potato croquettes to start, The potato croquettes were delicious and creamy with a truffle dipping sauce and the calamari was crispy and perfectly breaded and seasoned. Next we tried the Ceviche which was ok but  I would try something else next time.  I would definitly want to go back and try the brunch. Great overall experience, highly recommended.
