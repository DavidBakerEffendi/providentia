This place is so overrated.  A bad hamburger in a crowded room that takes an hour and costs too much.   You would think that they would have had time to pefect the hamburger.  I think its the same way they made it one hundred years ago.   My burger was well done, dry, on dry toast, with some sort of yellow edible oil.    Seriously,this was one of the worst hamburgers I have ever had.   Go to Five Guys, short lines, fries, and good juicy burger. I am really having a hard time understanding the good reviews..
