I've eaten here twice and was disappointed both times.  The service was just ok .   The steak was overcooked and the fries were quite salty and cold.  Vegetables also soggy.  Not fresh.  Overall, I think that this restaurant is overpriced.  It is in a desirable location.  That's the most I can say about it.
