Amazing in every way.  It takes a lot to get me to log in to yelp and actually review, but I just had to do if for Salinas.  I work in the city quite often, and stay in the neighborhood, and this place has become my go to , never let me down favorite restaurant.  I've had so many great meals here, and have so many great memories that I just can't stop visiting.   The owner is amazing, friendly and attentive in every way.  And the staff are simply the best.  I honestly don't think I've ever read the menu...I trust them that much and have never been disappointed. The ambience is incredible, extremely romantic, and very cool even if you're not going for a date night vibe. Highly recommend this place, and to everyone at Salinas...thank you!!!
