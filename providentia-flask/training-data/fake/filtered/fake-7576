Super nice place in the nabe!!! Small, clean and the panini's are very good. I got the P18 Prosciuto,mozz,tomato and pesto, my husband got the grilled chic,mozz and tomato and put balsamic on and it was very good. Served with a little salad of spring greens and grape tomato and a basil dressing. He also got the beef barley soup which was very good too. we shared the apple cinnamon crepe with caramel sauce and it was also very good. We just love it and it's 2 minutes from the house. Try the cafe frappe, yummy! so nothing bad to say about this place AT ALL. Go and enjoy. they also deliver.
