Owner does not care about retaining his customers. Food and service are ok to great, but came for a 1/2 off "customer appreciation" night and was overcharged. Asked to speak to the owner who did not resolve the issue, yet told me he "won't lose any sleep" if I didn't come back. I have been coming since 2009, but will no longer be giving that place my business. Â  Unfortunately, there aren't that many choices in Rahway so if you understandably MUST go, the tres leche cake, mariscada, and wings are pretty consistently good.
