Found this place on my android yelp after getting off the High Line. Went to Pinto with my girlfriend for lunch. We had the lunch prefix for $8. We both had the salad and pai thai noodle and the CNU noodles. The salad was very fresh and delicious. the pai thai was very mild by delicious. the CNU was slightly sweet. overall for $8 it was a pretty good deal.
