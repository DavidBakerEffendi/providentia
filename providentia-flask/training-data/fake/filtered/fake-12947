My wife and I nearly breathed down anticuchos. I never had peruvian beef heart kebabs before (everyone else has, right?), but the dish I got here was seasoned beautifully and had me hungry for more. My entree was the Atlantic Cod. It could've been cooked more but the flavors still came through and the texture wasn't too "fishy". Service was great and I will definitely return.
