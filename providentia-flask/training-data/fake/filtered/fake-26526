This restaurant serves the best Mexican food in Connecticut! Both the guac and the tacos are outrageously good! The menu was out standing and had a great selection of specials. The was a excellent atmosphere there and the service was impeccable. Superb beer and mix drink selection. The Oaxaca margarita is to die for!
