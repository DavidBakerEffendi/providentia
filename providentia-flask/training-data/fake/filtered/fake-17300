First of all- kudos to this place for serving all diets, vegan, veg, carnivoire. Yay! Sometimes as a vegetarian, I want to go somewhere reliably veg with someone who is not veg-- places like this are the perfect compromise. The cheese nachos were... well, just wayyyyy too cheesy. Gave me digestive issues :-/ But hey, they were DELICIOUS! The little green jalapeno salsa? Amazing. Small side of chips w/ salsa Â + sour cream with every order. Veg chili was absolutely fantastic and perfectly hot even after my lengthy stroll to a bench in Central Park. Don't count on being able to dine at this place, very busy and cramped.
