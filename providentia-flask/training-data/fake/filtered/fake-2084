Went to this place based on yelp reviews and I have to say ...the yelpers are on the right track. I went for breakfast and had baked eggs with bacon and toast. While some salt on my eggs would have been great... and salt on the table so I could have salted my eggs would have been great , everything else was nice. The seltzer was amazing !!!!!! The atmosphere was chill. I plan to try it again for dinner soon
