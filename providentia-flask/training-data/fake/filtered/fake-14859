Went here for the first time because of the restaurant.com coupon and had a really good time.  Was really disappointed that they wouldn't accept my coupon because we chose the 2 for $22 special. Our total bill was almost $50, so what difference would that make?? It has a casual atmosphere. Everything we ordered was good!  The garlic wings were great! The waitress was very energetic and pleasant.  We had driven by Bill's for years and never thought to try it, but having done so we will go back again.
