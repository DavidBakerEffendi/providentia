Ate there on Friday, Oct 1, 2010, party of two.  The tables are large so we had plenty of room.  Our waiter spoke with an accent and was difficult to understand, but he was attentive and helpful.  We started with their complimentary breads, which were delicious.  Next was an order of calamari, also very good.  Our dinners were the medallions of filet mignon, and the queen size sirloin steak.  Both were ordered medium-rare.  The medallions were tender and delicious but cooked a bit unevenly.  The sirloin was juicy, but overcooked, and the large bone prevented me from getting to much of the meat.  I'm noticing now that another sirloin steak on the menu is listed as "boneless", so I should have asked about mine.  The sirloin had a lot of charred, black crust on the edges, and more fat than I would have expected.  The portions that I ate were tasty, but in all honesty, it wasn't a good steak.  We decided to skip desert and coffee.
