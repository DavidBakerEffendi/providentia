Well...In new haven...Korean restaurant...? I would just thanks God there is even korean restaurant here.  There are not many korean people live here to enough to support korean restaurant business. Im very suprised they doing well in this area.  When i went there first time  i never expected good taste. I thought it would be just soso...since this is not in new york.  But it was actually very high quality of presentation and taste. So impressed! They renovated place 2 months ago. so very nice and clean with highend would floor(didn't liked carpet before) and sparkly music stage(you should see that is very cute). I heard man owner was popular koean musician. I had big party there with my friend..and she let us use their karaoke machine attached with big giant screen. We ordered drink and food amount of what she asked to use karaoke. Sounds was cool. It has korean and american songs. Also we go there when world cup starts to watch TV together to cheer korean team if we make advanced reservation. So far I love this restaurant so much...As korean...i would never survive here without seoul restaurant.
