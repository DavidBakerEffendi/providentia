My girlfriends and I met here on a Saturday for brunch.  We were impressed by the beautiful decor and cool atmosphere right away.  We were immediately seated and greeted by our waiter.  The staff did a great job of being attentive throughout the meal and making suggestions for menu items.  The menu is expansive offering everything from small plates to breakfast items all day. I definitely recommend the guacamole, cheese empanada and for dessert the guava pastry.  I am already looking forward to going back to try everything else!
