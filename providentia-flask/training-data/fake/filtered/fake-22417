I loved the whole look and the feel of this place from the moment I walked in. The waitress handed over the piece of paper menu which had very few entrees so I had to assume all the entrees had to be delish.  When I think comfort food I think fried chicken, So I went with the chicken/eggo and Boyyyy was I disappointed. The eggo came out crispy and the chicken came out even crispier and was dry to the bone ... oh wait  the chicken wasnt even on the bone it was a small filet. Hopefully they will get a solid weekly menu and a new cook because this place has potential and wish it all the best but boy did that fried chicken suck.
