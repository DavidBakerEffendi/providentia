Like this place, went here with my wife to celebrate our anniversary. Didn't have our reservation even though we called it in.  No, I didn't confuse you with Loucas in Edison.  Very nice and cozy décor. Young servers, perhaps college students, a bit amateurish but good natured enough.  We both opted for the specials.  They were pricey, about $35 each.  Waitress should have mentioned the prices. They serve wines from a local vineyard and the white was fine.  Canoli was a disappointment. Since I'm Italian American I'm fussy about Italian food and rarely eat it out. Pricey at about $130 before tip. This place was good enough to go back.
