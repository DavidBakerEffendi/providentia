One of the finest bars in Brooklyn. One of the best lattes I've ever had. It's rare to find a place that's at its best at all hours of operation. You will never once see any member of the exceptional Heavy Woods staff waiting around for prime time to strike and treating you as an afterthought in the meantime. You immediately feel that these people love their community and will slake your thirst to the best of their ability. I'm just a few blocks away and, whether it's for my morning coffee or closing down the bar, I find this place to be a true credit to the neighborhood, though I would travel long distances for the same experience. Brilliantly planned and kept, the only thing the owners have proven incapable of is hiring a single inept or unfriendly bartender. Everyone is phenomenally attentive, skilled and friendly. It's the kind of bar where the bartenders will call out the window to you as you're passing by and welcome you with a kind shout when you stop in. Grumpy Coffee is the house brew and the original cocktail menu is the best I've seen in a while. Excellent music, warm atmosphere and the occasional film choice is always unexpected and enjoyable. The only downside to Heavy Woods is how it prevents me from discovering new bars. See you there tonite!
