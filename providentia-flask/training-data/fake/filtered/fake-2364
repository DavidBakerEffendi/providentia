My sister's favorite thing to eat when in NY! We share chicken + rice with lots of white and hot sauce! We generally leave out the pita (it kinda gets soggy gross), and bond while shoveling the deliciousness into our faces while Belgian tourists look with mixed expressions of impressiveness and horror.
