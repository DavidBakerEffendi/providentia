Recently went for my third visit to the Front Street Bistro. The bar and dining areas are bright and modern with large windows. The happy hour prices are excellent for both drinks and bar bites. Â The chicken fritters are my favorite, tasty risotto and kicked up chicken fried into delicious spheres. I have also enjoyed the BLATO (bacon, lettuce, avocado, tomato and onion) without the bacon. It comes with a chipotle mayo that is perfect for this sandwich so I asked for extra. My compliments to the chef and staff. Bar staff was attentive and the beer choices good. If you are daring, try the butter popcorn flavored vodka, then you will really know you are at a restaurant connected to a theater (Spotlight Theaters).
