LOVED this place food was amazing and service was great we were attended by a yaoung gentleman he would always check on us to see if we needed anything at all. Everything was cooked right and the tortillas were warm and taste great with the salsa. the guacamole was very good. def a good place so far. only issue I had was that people bring baby's to restaurants i don't know why but leave them elsewhere we were seated next to this family who brang a baby about 5 mo old and this kid was crying her a** off , Â was very aggravated with this.
