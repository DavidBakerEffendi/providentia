Great Gastropub! This place is a high recommend and a definite plus for Bloomfield. I have been here multiple times(drive around Plan B to get there and I really like Plan B). I love the Au Poivre Burger with the cognac creme sauce - becoming my all time fav. The kitchen has a french bent and the tastes and plate presentation are excellent. Â BTW they have a great little happy hour menu as well. It is simply a must go. Enjoy.
