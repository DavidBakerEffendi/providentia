I have to say that I really don't agree that this place is "terrible."  It's falls into the category of fast food that is not processed (sort of like Chipotle).   So far I've only tried their bowls and rolls... I stick with the bowls, as the rolls have too much rice and are simply not satisfying if you're used to good sushi.  And hey, we live in NYC... we all know what good sushi is. However, the bowls are great!  Hearty portions, nice mix of veggies.  I definitely do NOT agree with another reviewer that says the veggies taste like they came out of a frozen bag.  They are very fresh.   I work in the area and the bowls are a great lunch option that helps me stick to the healthier side of things. Staff is friendly and the ambiance is comfortable.
