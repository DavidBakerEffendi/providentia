Came in for breakfast on Saturday, which must be thier busiest day. Wasnt the best breakfast of my life, although the coffee was very good.   The brisk attitude of the host was our 1st turnoff....we waited neat the podium for a full 5 minutes before anyone came to greet us, then finally the host came over, looked right past us, and took the name of the party of 4 standign next in line AFTER us!  We looked at each other like ????? Then she walked away as we were saying "Excuse me...." I know she heard us, it felt very impoilte.  The other waitstaff was cool, but the food just wasnt that great. Beans tasted canned, the dish needed salt. My DC ordered the Bo Knows Breakfast plate, which is a combo of things, like a lumberjack breakfast. He liked the oatmeal pancake, but eggs were bland, and said the  fried potatoes had the texture of baked potatoes.   If the food were amazing, I could overlook the service problem. but because the attitude of the host, and difficulty in getting seated, we wont be coming back.
