We arrived late for our reservation thanks to Philly traffic.  The staff was accommodating and found us a table right away.  Our party of four brought two bottles of wine and casually dined on small plates for  a couple of hours.  The menu is set up to be enjoyed as shared plates and creates a great dining experience.  We started with a few cheeses and mussels which were delicious.  We then ordered two margherita pizzas for the four of us. Best margherita pizza we'd ever had.  The plate du jour was a Paella with grilled rabbit loin, chorizo and prawn. It was cooked to perfection and there was enough there to split between the four of us. We left this meal wanting to tell all of our friends to make a reservation.  Do yourself a favor and experience another of Chef Garces' great eateries.
