This place is truly amazing. It's well hidden; you won't find it unless you're looking for it. It's a great place to take a date if you they like Japanese food and a sense of adventure. They bring you hot towels before you start your meal as well as a hot cup of tea when you finish. They do not rush or pressure you as you eat and always keep your water glass filled. The food is also great. I would strongly recommend this place to anyone who is going to eat in NYC.
