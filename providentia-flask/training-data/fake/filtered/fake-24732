I just had dinner at this place last night. The service was excellent. The place was small but cute. The food was very good. However, I still think zero Otto nove is the best Italian food I have ever had in New York. They are located in little Italy in the Bronx. It's totally worth the trip. They also have a new location in New York city, but I have never been there. If you are in the area and want good Italian food this would be a great place to have it.
