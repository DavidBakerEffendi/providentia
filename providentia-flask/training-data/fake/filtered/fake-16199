The food is great...especially their mac n cheese bowl things...really delicious....did wait a bit for a table but it's a popular spot so what does one expect?? Didn't eat outside b/c it was chilly...but our waiter Jesse H. was really great, never left us waiting.....and recommended our beverages and the fried oreo treat! mmmm I don't like oreo's but this was really good lol So go and have fun and if you're lucky try and get Jesse H.!! xoxo
