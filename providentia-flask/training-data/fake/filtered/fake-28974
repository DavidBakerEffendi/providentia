Prime 16 impresses me again and again! I go to Prime 16 as often as I possibly can- when I am not there, I am telling everyone I know about the place! Everything on the menu is great. The reason I chose to write this review is due to the superb customer service I received there last week. Normally at Prime, the customer service is mediocre at best- I am pretty sure everyone knows that who has been in there more than once. However, I am in Prime almost every Wednesday night either with coworkers, friends or family. Last Wednesday there was something wrong in the kitchen and they were unable to serve food until 7...at first. Then the time was pushed back to around 8:30! People were pissed!! I have never seen a person handle such a large crowd of angry, hungry, frustrated people better than the girl at the front. I am not sure if she is just a hostess or a manager (she should run the front of the house if she doesn't already!). She had a beautiful smile on her face the entire time, was empathetic towards people's complaints and unbelievably accomodating to everyone! She kept me so impressed-it was positively entertaining watching her while we all waited anxiously for the kitchen to be fixed. She is in there every Wednesday night and I will tell you what- if you have not been to Prime 16, go in on a Wednesday night so you can get your fair share of great food and unbeatable customer service by this young lady.
