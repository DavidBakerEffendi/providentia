While the pizza was excellent (the shallots were just the right touch), the service was only mediocre and the hostess was unbelievable.  We put our name down and they said they would call us.  The first call was a pleasant surprise that they'd have a table in shorter time then expected, great!  The second call consisted of, "Umm, do you guys still want to eat?"  No, we are waiting just to smell what others are eating.  ???  After eventually being seated, in the front by the door, we basically felt hovered over during the entire meal, including 2 un-subtle "Are you guys still working?" when one of us had a piece of pizza in our hand!  I might order take-out as the pizza was terrific, but never again will I eat there and be treated as though I am eating for free and taking up valuable space that someone hipper or more famous should be occupying.
