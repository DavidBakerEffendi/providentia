The experience was a total disappointment. I like the Colchester location, but the new Juniors Rustico abuses the Junior's reputation. For $15 I ordered the linguine and meatballs expecting something at least ok. What I got was two frozen meatballs, some box pasta and tons of sauce with two pieces of "garlic bread" which were closer to croutons covered in butter. To top it all off, it is being marketed as a higher end Juniors, but while I sat there wondering why I was paying $15 for half of a normal Juniors portion, wrestling was on the tv in the background. The only reason it's getting two stars is because the smell outside of the restaurant was deceivingly good.
