I'm surprised at the good reviews. Yes - the crepes are pretty good but the whole set up and process is completely wrong. It takes about an hour from arriving until your food comes. There are always lines (mainly due to slow service/inefficiency) so it takes about 20 - 30 minutes to line up and place your order and then another 30 minutes for the food to come. Not really worth all this effort for a crepe place!
