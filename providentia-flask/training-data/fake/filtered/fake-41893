Legally blind Englishman here, dined at Trattoria Trecolori with my girlfriend on a hot weeknight in March 2012. It was great! Cannot fault the experience on any level. The food was as good as I've ever had and everything was fresh. Their sorbet in particular was to die for. Special mention to the great service - made me, a blind person, feel very welcome, which is my no means always the case when it comes to dining out. Our waiter even picked out for me the best olive of the bunch. What can I say, the man knows his olives, and that is a sign of a great restaurant. Will be back on my return to NY.
