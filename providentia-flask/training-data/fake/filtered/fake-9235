We went for pizza on a Friday night a couple of weeks ago. The place was crowded and we had to wait about 30 minutes for a table. The staff was accommodating, told us an accurate estimated time of seating, and were cordial when passing us in the waiting/seating area. The pizza, of course, was delicious and the service was prompt. The beer selection allowed for the three of us to try different drinks and different flavors. All in all, we had a great time at Kitchen ZINC and would go there more often if only we lived in New Haven.
