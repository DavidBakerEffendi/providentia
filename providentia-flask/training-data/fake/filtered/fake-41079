I travel all the time.  And anyone who knows me, knows I love pizza.  I have eaten pizza just about everywhere.  So when our limo driver on a recent trip to NY suggested Lombardi's, I had no idea what he meant by "coal pizza." I am also one who does not love a lot of cheese and I was actually asking the waitress for them to go light on the cheese like I saw in the picture on the wall.  She pointed to it and said that is how it always comes out.  I couldn't wait to try it! I ordered mine with extra sauce and romano cheese.  The others in my party tried pepperoni and a variety of other toppings.  We ordered 4 pies for a party of 7 and I am not kidding.  With myself loving pizza as much as I do, I knew not much of it would go to waste if it was good. We also ordered the bread sticks.  Now normally bread sticks are just bread sticks.  They are like just something to fill you up so you don't starve to death before your food arrives.  NOT THESE!  I am serious we had to order to more sides of sauce--we wanted to drink it!  That sauce is unbelievable.  You need to get an order of breadsticks to see for yourself.  The bread is awesome. We were happily enjoying our Amsel lights when our pizza arrived and engulfed our entire table.  One bite and I thought I had died and gone to heaven.  I am serious.  I think I shed tears! It was absolutely unbelievable.  Now I am going to have to make special trips just to go there because to think I may not be able to have this on a regular basis breaks my heart. If you are headed to NY...make this a must do! YUM!!!!!  :)
