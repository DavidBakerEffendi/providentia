The legendary burgers? Good. Not the best I've ever had, but good. However, it was definitely not worth the huge wait (more than 40 minutes after placing our order for 4 people, with about 4-5 other regular-sized orders of a few burgers each ahead of ours to be filled.) For a place where burgers are literally the only things on the menu that need preparation, that is outrageous. We were able to order within seconds of walking though the door but still had that long of a wait. The staff have a reputation for their sarcasm and sass, which is supposed to be part of the charm of this place, but what I witnessed was rather forced and uncomfortable. The guy taking orders tried one of his "jokes" on a very confused 10 year-old trying to order chips. When she didn't pick up on it, instead of letting it slide, he repeated himself, asked if she understood, and when she shook her head, he proceeded to explain it in painstaking detail. Since I ended up waiting around for 40 minutes to get my burgers, I heard him use the same jokes and sarcastic comments about 10 times apiece. One thing I will commend are the cool old vertical grills used to prep the burger patties, and the charming old-style interior. I don't suggest planning to stay and eat your burgers unless you are fine with tons of people standing around you waiting for their orders to be filled. If you must try the burgers, call ahead and place your order for pickup. It'll save you a lot of grief.
