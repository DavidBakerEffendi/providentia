I just ate here for University City dining days, and it was really great, especially if you are HUNGRY! They gave two appetizers (most places do 1), one of them being a full size personal pizza or wings, the other salad or delicious brushcetta, then a choice of entree, and a huge dessert.  We ended up taking a lot of the food home. Way more than I have gotten at other DD/restaurant week participants The service was great, our waiter, Stephen, was very knowledgeable about the vast beer selection & food, and the food runners, and even the manager checked on us often. I ate here another time and was very happy as well.  The shrimp & grits were phenomenal!!! Try it! I was sad it wasn't on the DD menu, but glad I got to try other things
