I was surprised to come here and read the negative reviews because I ate here recently and thought it was fantastic.  My opinion usually seems to fall in line with the prevailing Yelp opinion but not in this case. We ordered dinner and I personally had the salmon which was excellent.  Service was everything you could ask for and although it wasn't cheap, I always expect to pay somewhat when it comes to seafood.  The person with me had a great experience as well and we will definitely be going back.
