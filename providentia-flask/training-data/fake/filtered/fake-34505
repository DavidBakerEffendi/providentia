Excellent pizza--definitely a rival pizza to Star Tavern in Orange. I've gone here several times and have never been disappointed. My family has tried other dishes, but I stick to the pizza (topped with olives). The staff is very friendly and the service is pretty good. This is a no frills (in terms of atmosphere and decor), BYO place. Great place for any night of the week.
