Be prepared for rude service.  Have thick skin.  Be advised this place is under new management.  Come for the pizza.  Not the hospitality.  If this is troublesome, try Lombardi's in Soho which provides both the delicious tasting new york pizza, and great family friendly atmosphere.  You will walk out unscathed, and free of negativity.     My friends and I went to Grimaldi's new location a couple of days ago, and for some reason there was an all out argument btw the customer and bartender/waiter.  All of a sudden he tells the customer to F-off and get out.  He had a thick russian accent and was on the slim side.  The whole staff I believe is russian which shouldn't mean anything, but just something I remembered when trying to understand him as I was ordering.  I swear I thought having pizza was a good thing.  What disturbed me was the disregard for the families around who brought their children.  Definitely not family friendly.
