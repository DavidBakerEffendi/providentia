The ultimate in sleazy diner experiences. I ordered a salad and the lettuce must have been almost a week old. The lettuce was brown around the edges and soggy to the touch. After wasting precious time fighting with the wait staff and eventually the manager they reluctantly took back my salad and brought me a grilled cheese. They refused to find fault with the lettuce and when it came time to pay the bill they insisted I pay for it. I now know why the parking lot was empty and it should have been the first sign indicator. I can easily say I will never return and hopefully after reading this you will follow suit. Thanks.
