This place is really good. When I get Pho, I always add alot of extra stuff to flavor it the way I like it. I don't really like the broth that other places make BUT this place's Pho broth is delicious!! I don't have to add as much extra stuff like I usually do - which is ALOT of hoisin sauce, sriracha sauce, lime, mint and much more - I like my Pho to be flavorful...I go here about once a week now. :) Try it! Also, the servers are really nice and attentive. Nice & clean place.
