Had dinner for the first time here last night, and it was one of the best dining experiences I've had in my life. Sat at the bar on a Sunday night, and didn't catch the bartender's name but she was so great that I definitely would go back and sit at the bar whenever she's working. The popover with honey and sea salt that they bring as an amuse bouche/appetizer is beyond description-I think that it's the most delicious thing that I've ever tasted. I had 2 appetizers so I could try a couple things-the flatbread and the mussels-both were perfect. Not too filling, great flavors and presentation. I was full after both but had to try the butterscotch panna cotta-and didn't regret the decision, it was so so good. Service from the bartender was just the right amount of neighborhood friendly/laid back and perfectly anticipating exactly what I wanted and right on top of it (i.e. another glass of wine-she always had the bottle when she asked because she knew). Absolutely will be back again and again and am so happy that they are 2 blocks from my apt.
