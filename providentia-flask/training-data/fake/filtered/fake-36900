Stopped in to pick up food for a Valentine's Day dinner.  Got the rotisserie chicken, kale salad, and farro salad w/ goat cheese.  Each of them were unbelievably delicious and they were perfect for a nice dinner at home without all the prep work.  One of the chefs gave spot on instructions for reheating the chicken.  This place is an excellent addition to the neighborhood.  Can't wait to come back to try the sandwiches and coffee.  I've never seen a place quite like this - it is truly unique. Highly recommended.
