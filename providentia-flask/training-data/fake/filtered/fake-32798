I absolutely love Pengag. Definitely a philly favorite and a place that I miss. The have the best mango chicken I have ever had and I have ordered many places included Square on Square and Mandarin Palace. None of them come close. No matter what time of year you go, the mangoes are always ripe, not like at other places. Plus they now accept credit cards.
