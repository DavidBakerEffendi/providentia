A friend heard this local place is now open for Sunday brunch so we checked it out!  Great idea!  They offer a totally different Sunday brunch menu!  Fresh, friendly and really nice time - great place to come back for lunch or dinner. We each had the Steak & Eggs with yuca fries - delicious and the coffee is great, too!  Today's special sangria was a Berry Sangria and it was a great way to end the meal! One block off Atlantic on Grand and just a few blocks from Barclays Center - so consider it on the weekend when everything else around Atlantic Terminal is crowded and noisy. This place is definitely worth a visit!
