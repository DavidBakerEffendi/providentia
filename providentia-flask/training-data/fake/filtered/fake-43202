You can hear the owner badmouthing her staff and customers while seated at your table. The food is overpriced and takes forever. The hours are crazy, who closes at the very time that people are returning from work on the train? The staff is constantly changing so you can't build that small-town relationship with them; something so important in a town like South Orange. While the food is pretty good, it just isn't worth it.
