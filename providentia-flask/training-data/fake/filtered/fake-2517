We waited for about 5 minutes to be acknowledged after arriving for our reservation, then were told to wait in the street until our table was ready. That took at least 10 minutes, so we were lucky it wasn't cold or raining. The wine ($13 a glass) was poured into tiny glasses, and the waiter poured the second glass up to be level with the top of the glass. Nice that he was being "generous," but impossible to drink without spilling... The food was okay, nothing memorable. The noise level was deafening, making it impossible to converse without shouting. When some of the tables emptied out and the shouting got a little quieter, they turned up the music to boost the noise level once again. It made for a really stressful meal.
