As good as it gets really is true in this case. Fricassée is far above par, even in the Montclair restaurant scene. The servings were delicious, divine, and diverse. Our meal included one 48 ounce cote de boeuf, one serving of pommes frites, one incredible helping of mac n' cheese, and salads all around, which was more than enough for four people.  Fricasée is BYOB, which only goes to save money when the bill arrives. First of all, the streak was one of the best i have ever had the pleasure of enjoying. The mac n' cheese: immaculate. When dipped in the homemade mustard, the pommes frites were heavenly. Even the salads were remarkable. When the bill did arrive, we balked at how reasonable the price was. Having not looked at the menu and simply asked our jovial team of waiters for a steak and some appetizers, we had no idea what to expect or how much it would cost, but were blown away on both fronts. The owners even came over to our table and spent a considerate amount of time chatting with us! Fricasée is a Montclair favorite of mine, and I will undoubtedly be back.
