I had heard great things about Percy Street Barbeque by word-of-mouth, so my expectations were high. Unfortunately, it only partially met my expectations. The environment and decor get an A from me. It felt like a Texas barbeque, without being trite. Our server was friendly, and offered help as it was our first time there. For drinks I had the F423, which tasted like watered down peach iced tea. My date had the Jack and Ginger, which was also very watered down. For dinner I ordered the 1/2lb of pork belly and the avocado salad. He had the 1/2lb of brisket (moist and lean) and the macaroni & cheese. 1/2lb pork belly: fatty, which I mean as a compliment in this instance and cooked well. I appreciate that they cook their meat with just salt, pepper and smoke. It was very good. 1/2lb brisket (moist & lean): it lacked flavor, which is not easy to do with a meat like that. Avocado salad and macaroni & cheese: We both chose appetizers as sides, and they were both scrumptious. They were tasty, but unassuming, so they didn't distract from the real focus here, the meat. Accompaniments: The meat is served with onions and pickles, which were fine. There is also an option for white bread, which I asked for. I was expecting something the size of texas toast, sans butter; but instead they serve basic white bread, ala stroehmans or wonderbread. I don't dislike plain ol' white bread, but it seemed out of place with the meal. I cannot make a sandwich with that deliciiously fatty meat, on a piece of white bread that will be soggy before the second bite. Perhaps this is nit-picky of me, but what can I say, I'm a carb kinda kid.
