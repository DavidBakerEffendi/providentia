Went with my mother this evening, she ordered an entree whereas I ordered two rolls of sushi. The food was delicious and brought out in a timely manner. Service was impeccable. However, it is now 2:29am and I've vomited twice this far, attempting to find something to keep my mind on, therefore the reason why I'm writing this review. I am not new to sushi, and I have only gotten sick once before from raw fish. Unfortunately I will not be returning to this local restaurant because I will not try my luck again. Sanitation when it comes to raw fish is a must, and I did not expect such practices to be an issue when I entered this establishment this past evening. I am disappointed. Be aware.
