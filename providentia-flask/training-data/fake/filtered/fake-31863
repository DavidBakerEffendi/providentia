I have mixed feelings about this place. The food is good, they have a wonderful sangria bar, but the food isn't really Cuban. With a name like Calle Ocho that's what I expected. But no ropa vieja? Ok, the mohitos are good. Just be aware, this is more of a fusion place. For straight Cuban I would recommend Victors
