What a new found treasure; a gem of restaurant with authentic Georgian cuisine on Bleecker St. in the Village! The lunch menu was affordable and with 2 courses plus dessert and soda, it gave me a chance to "sample" some dishes. From the hot cheese stuffed bread to the meat dumplings everything was delicious (all made fresh on the premisis with wonderful ingredients imported from Georgia). The dinning room has a nice decor with fine art and a restful garden as a backdrop. Â Great, keep it up, I'll be back for sure. Marty
