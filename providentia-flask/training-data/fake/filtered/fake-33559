After others had asked us, we finally dined at the Socials Bar and Grill.  I must say, it was less than we had expected. We are a senior couple, fairly large in stature, and the waitress failed to notice that and sat us at very small table for two against the wall.  Very tight quarters.  The menu was very limited.  I'm a steak man, and no steak on the menu.  The waitress failed to ask if we had been there before, and as our dinner was being served, we noticed down in the corner a chef was cooking up pasta for other diners.  We asked what was happening, and then were told that it was Pasta Nite, and you could have your favorite pasta cooked to order.  Would have been nice to know that.  We had to ask for rolls, even though the dinner we had supposedly came with rolls, and a roll plate was part of our setting.  I thought the meal was adequate, the prices high, and probably will not go there again.
