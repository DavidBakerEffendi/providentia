Continental is an OK place it has an upside and a downside to it. It was a little pricey but very much in a good location. The lobster mashed potatoes weren't too great didn't care for them much. I wasn't to fond of the their food but their drinks were great. i would definitely go back for the drinks. The roof deck was delightful very much peaceful and loved the patio. Over all continental midtown wasn't to bad i just wont eat there again.
