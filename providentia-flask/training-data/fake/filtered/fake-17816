Wow! I was impressed with the remodel of an old time restaurant.  I felt like I was in Philly or NYC.  It's very hip. We were warmly welcomed and treated graciously the whole evening. We had giant meatball parm and crab cakes to start and we were delighted!  We order the double boned pork chop and mahi mahi with sweet pea risotto... it was delicious and just right. We also brought a great Cabernet with us!.  We shared a tiramisu and cannoli sundae for dessert... it truly was the most delicious and satisfying dessert that I"ve had in a long time.  Although Marsilio's has been around for a long time, this is a new place with a new menu and new staff... but the service was excellent throughout the evening and we were there on a busy Friday.  I will be going back to celebrate my birthday next month!  Thank you Marsilio's for making our evening so much fun!
