I went to the diner and ordered a Chocolate Mouse Cake it was stale. My friend ordered a bowl of soup that came with 2 side packets of cracker. He opened the crackers and put it into his soup and the crackers were stale.  The waitress went over to one of the manager on site to inform him of the situation he seemed to have no care in world what the customer that to complain about.    Most diners/restaurant the manager would go to the customer and tries to see how they could accommodate there customer.  This manager had no care in the world just sat in the booth next to the door.
