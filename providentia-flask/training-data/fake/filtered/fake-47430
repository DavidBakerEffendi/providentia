I'm sure that all of you who love to eat meat are very satisfied with this place for all your steak needs. However, they do advertise as having a vegetarian menu and I have been ordering veggie burgers there on occassion for the past 2 years. Â Word of advice to all vegetarians who eat here. I was fortunate enough to actually get a seat in here one day and watched the dude "On the grill" handle the food. With NO gloves on, he picked up burgers, bacon,hotdogs etc. and then picked up my veggie burger and cooked it right next to the various dead animals. Grease and all! What was more shocking was that he used the same "flipper" for EVERYTHING! He then put more bacon on the grill and then decided my vege burger was done and again used his bare hands to place it on my roll.It smelled of meat and was greasy.Prior to this I thought that they cooked it seperately (Like most places claiming to have Vegetarian food). I won't go there again! Beware!
