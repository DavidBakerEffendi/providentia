Best pizza in Fishtown/Port Richmond area hands down FRANCO'S! Pizza brain is good, don't get me wrong. Both establishment have great pizza. I just don't need some ninja turtle action figures and mystic pizza posters to make my pizza better. I prefer good service and variety. Pizza Brain doesn't have fresh salads like Franco's, nor the classic pizza shop staples like wings, hoagies and cheese steaks. If you need a "museum" attached to your pizza experience go to pizza brain, your admission will be factored into the cost of food, otherwise go to franco's.
