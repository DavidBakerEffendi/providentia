This was by far the worst and most upsetting dining experience I've had in a long time.   This diner is an embarrasment! The server was rude, attitudinal, and sarcastic from the very start.  We were afraid to even ask her for water a second time (because she forgot the first time we had asked).  Most of our breakfasts/sides were poorly prepared/thrown together and tasted awful.  We BARELY touched our food, but the waitress didn't even care to ask if everything was alright.  And of course, we didn't complain to her because she seemed to be having a bad day.  Also, when it came time to pay for the bill, there was something wrongfully added to our check.  The owner/management said that it was a mistake in the menu.   He claimed that 'someone' must have scratched off the whiteout that corrected/updated the menu.  REALLY?  And then he refused to take it off the bill.   As far as the cleanliness, I found it to be a little disgusting.  The menus were filty/sticky and the table had dried syrup from a previous table.  Not to mention the dank and dingy bathroom, where all that was missing what a lone light bulb dangling from a string. I would NOT recommend this diner to anyone.  Before you nearly kill yourself entering the parking lot (it is right at an on-coming ramp for Rt 1), save yourself the disapointment, frustration, stomachache and keep driving!  Try somewhere else - anywhere else!
