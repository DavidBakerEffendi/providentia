We went to Sushi Yasuda last night for a 6:30 reservation. I arrived at 6:15 my dinner partner at 6:20. Â The last time we had reservations and arrived 12 minutes late (and called ahead to tell them) they gave up our table. As soon as I sat down I was pressured to order. As soon as my dinner partner sat down we were both pressured to order. While the sushi is good the dining experience canceled it out. We could not believe at one point we were asked to give up our table in 15 minutes after ordering a la carte and racking up at least $300 for 2 people. Having gone to Japan 3 times in the last 2 years and having some incredibly great sushi and much better hospitality in the smallest of places it puts Sushi Yasuda in a different perspective for me. I will not go back there and spend my money when in the large city of Manhattan there must be a more convivial place. If it was half the price I would not be so angry as it felt like I was eating sushi at a Tokyo train station always feeling like my train would be arriving at any minute and I would have to leave quickly.
