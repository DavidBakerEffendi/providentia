Was once punk, now a den of PBR swilling, denim clad hipsters... But, don't let that label dissuade you on it's own.. I only mention it because some people really are hipster-allergic. Pros: The bar is terrific! The vibe and music is spot on, and the patron conversations are not to be missed. The patrons, on the whole, seem friendly and welcoming.. Cons: The service is terrible and slow. Expect to get the wrong stuff half the time, after a long wait. The falafel sandwich will either be terrific or fried to death. The hotwings kicked ass. Bottom Line: Great place to grab a beer and a snack before moving on to better places, or to get out of the heat for a bit.
