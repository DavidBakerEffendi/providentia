Food is mediocre. Bunch of dishonest people. They tried to charge for extra items which we did not ordered and then they charged all the items not 1 or 2 all 5 items more price than on menu. When I caught it they were kind of unapologetic and acted as we were asking some discount. Bunch of rude and dishonest.
