This is the messiest burger I've ever eaten.  I went here on my lunch break, thinking I'd get a burger and a fry.  I only have a 30 minute lunch break, and the food wasn't even ready. If you don't know this, you call in and the rude guy behind the grill cooks your food when he gets around to it. Plus I'm pretty sure I saw someone buy a burger with an EBT card.  That's just not right. I give this place 2 stars because while the burger was OK, the service and atmosphere suck.  I'd rather go up the road to the other place and get a burger where I can sit inside.
