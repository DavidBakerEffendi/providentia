To Danielle J, the person who previously reviewed our establishment.   We appreciate you stopping by and we will take into consideration what you mentioned about your visit.  In regards to price, our average ticket pp after happy hour is $30, which falls at the low end of the medium price range according to ZAGAT.  Secondly in response to the mostly Asian crowd, that is the theme of our bar.   Thanks for spending your time giving us your thoughts.  We have a great HH menu which has lower prices until 9pm daily.
