Have been here half a dozen times or so and each time the food and the service were tied for excellence.  We have been welcomed every time, fussed over, patiently allowed to linger at the buffet and at dinner served with friendliness and attentiveness.  Even the water glass was kept filled.  The food is delicious and plentiful and this is fast becoming one of my favorite restaurants.
