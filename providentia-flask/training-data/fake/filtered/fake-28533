I frequent O'Tooles 3 or 4 times a week.  I am new to the 9th District and immediately found a home at O'Tooles. There is live music, trivia, and projection television.  The owners are constantly present, the bartenders (Eddie and Shaunie in particular) are cordial, quick, and consistent, and the food is delicious!
