Nice place. Deserves a chance. Â please rate the establishment on its merits instead of the seldom showered, little bit of knowledge is a dangerous thing, occupy his/hers grandmothers basement, doesn't know a hard days work, smelling of reefer and patchouli hipster/should have been born in the 60's idiot of a former employee. Instead come try the food and service and decide for yourself. That's what I did, both were very good and deserving of the five stars.
