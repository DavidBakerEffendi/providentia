We went to this restaurant when we found out that the Piolin in East Hartford was closed on Monday nights. My Peruvian parents are regulars at the other restaurants and we were happy to join them to check out this Franklin Ave. facility ( i think they have more grilled options) My daughter and husband are vegetarians and were very happy with the Papa la huancaina and Ocopa appetizers. My daughter ate the Peruvian style veggie omelette and my husband had the Tallarines with the piolin sauce (I think they added veggies to his pasta). The waiter was very helpful with his selection. My dad had the Chicharron de Pescado and mom had some mixed fish stew. I had the Chaufa with chicken(Chinese style fried rice). We all had HUGE portions. We also ordered a pitcher of Chicha (purple corn drink). It was a little sweeter that at the other restaurants. The presentation was very nicely done. My dad's dish had an almost architectural quality with the yucca and plantains " housing" the breaded fish and veggies. The waiter was very attentive. There was no one else in the restaurant for a while. Â Though we were stuffed my daughter was curious about their desserts. Sadly, our waiter told us they didn't have any available this night. Still, we all left with happy bellies. We will be back.
