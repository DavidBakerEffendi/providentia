While it made for a fun adventure, to come and try Di Fara's pizza, the product itself is not so impressive.  The place is really run down and unclean looking, although they now have an "A" rating.  The seating is something you would imagine in some of the least appealing pizza places you might imagine.  But most importantly the pizza...the biggest disappointment was the crust.  It had very little character and was hard and cracker like.  To me it is usually the crust that makes a pizza.  The other ingredients can make almost any pizza taste good but the crust can make a pizza great.  In this case the sauce was ok with chunks of tomato, obviously canned tomato, not highly seasoned or even modified in any way.  The cheese is half a one pound chunk of mozzarella, like any of us buy in the supermarket, that is hand grated by the elderly pizza maker, and spread on the pie.  He adds a big handful of grated cheese after baking and cuts some basil roughly over the pie with a scissor.  The pizza tastes very good due to the abundance of cheeses and basil and an adequate sauce.  However the lack of a crust with character makes the pie unimpressive.
