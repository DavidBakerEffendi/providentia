I have been to Rose Petals several times both during the week and on the weekend and I must say that they never disappoint!!! The southern comfort waffle is by far my favorite as I've never tasted anything like it. A cornbread waffle with fried catfish and a turkey sausage cream gravy is mouthwatering just to talk about. The intimate space lends itself to meet new people, enjoy good food and relax while the wait staff provides one of the best customer service experiences I have had from chain restaurants in so long. * As a note during the week I am able to relax and even using the free wifi to get some work done, but on the weekend the place is busy and jumping. I love that other's love this place as much as I do, and hope them much success cause it's definitely my spot!
