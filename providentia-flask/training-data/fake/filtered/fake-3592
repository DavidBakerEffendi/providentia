We did the $30 Monday special and came out very happy. The carrot soup, chicken & waffles and popovers were really good. My companion said his fish was slightly lacking in flavour and I wanted a bit less sweetness from my pecan pie sundae after all those rave reviews. What we both really loved was the butterscotch panna cotta. It had the perfect balance of sweetness and wasn't too rich. That and the fried chicken and cheddar waffles were the highlight of the night. Can't fault the service either.
