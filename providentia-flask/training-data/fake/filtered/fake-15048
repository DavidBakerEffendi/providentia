One star for the gluten free pizza. Yeah, I know gluten free is tough for pizza but this was inedible. The crust was like rubber, my jaw was sore by the second slice. I've had lots of GF bread, some of it nasty like this pizza and some of it quite good, and much closer to real bread. Luigi's, you can do better. For the rest of the food at Luigi's, including the regular pizza, I'd give 3 stars - very average. My family and I prefer Angelino's in the neighborhood.
