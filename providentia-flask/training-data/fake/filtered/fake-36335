Didn't knock my socks off. Â For the cost, I was not impressed. The famous spaghetti was great, but not the best I've had. The other pasta at the table was salty. The portions are small, so if you're looking to walk out satisfied, order at least 3 courses. The tables are way too close together. Our party of six felt like we were wedged in at the last minute, despite the reservation we made a month in advance (the reservation policy is strict!). The service was just ok - even though there were constantly waiters swarming, I went without wine for an entire course into the meal. (even though the rest of the table had been asked and served) It wasn't until after my dinner was served, I had to flag down a waiter to get a drink. This sub-par service, and so-so food, was all while Scott Conant was in the restaurant! I wouldn't want to be there on a night when he's not there!
