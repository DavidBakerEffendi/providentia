I am so with it! The food is excellent, and I can easily say it's one of the most enjoyable meals I have had in a long time. Savory from the first to last bite. The olive oil selection is to die for, Â the two cheese selection platters with mouthwatering spreads was uncanny and the actual meal was a true treat. The seating accommodations made for our larger than expected party by the hostess (Leah), and the service provided by our waiter (Sam), made the experience that much more enjoyable. Regards Jose,
