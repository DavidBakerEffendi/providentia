Have been here several times, and is becoming one of my go-to spots. Tasty cocktails, food options are great (perfect for sharing), and the all important service was impeccable. Everyone... wait staff, hosts, manager, were super nice and accommodating. I love that it's not too big and not too small... fun atmosphere filled with a good crowd!
