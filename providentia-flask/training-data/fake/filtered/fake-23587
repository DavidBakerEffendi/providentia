For lunch on November 1, my wife, son (25), and I dined at the SP.  If you don't mind waiting an unreasonable length of time and seeing diners who arrived after you being served before you,  this is the place for you.  While the atmosphere is edgy / casual, it's no excuse for the lack of an expediter in the kitchen.  Never again.
