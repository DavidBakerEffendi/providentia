I've traveled to Turkey and had a lot of Turkish food in my life (comparing NY and DC areas) and this place is by far the best Turkish food I've had. The service is very friendly and down-to-earth (like the decor). The fresh bread and free olive oil/sun dried tomato dip is absolutely delicious. Yes the cold appetizers are really good too but I would only recommend if you are going in a big group because it's better to save your appetite for the main dishes. I've always found the servings to be big enough for 2 people to share, or for one person to take home. Sometimes it's hard to restrain yourself though... For those people who complain that the prices are too high for the New Haven, CT area, they are not appreciating the fine quality of the meats and that everything, down to the bread, is home-made. I'd highly recommend any of the lamb or veal kabobs. Last night we tried the pide (Bread with onions, bell peppers, melted cheese and lamb peices) and it was absolutely amazing. I can't say enough about how much I love TKH. When my parents came to visit it was the one place I knew I could take them without there being any complaints!
