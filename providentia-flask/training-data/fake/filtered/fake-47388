Great food and great people behind the counter. The decor is great, from the local art on the wall to the great wooden tables and benches. The cashier is beyond friendly and welcoming. Even the guys preparing the food were friendly. I have made it my mission to try everything on the menu. So far after 2 visits i have yet to be disappointed. The falafel was just great. Nice portion for $3. The beef kabob was also great, and the fries are as tho i made them at home, nice crisp flavor, not oily and soggy. Hopefully this place will last many many years!
