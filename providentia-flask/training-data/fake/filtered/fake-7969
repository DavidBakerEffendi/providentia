Hard not to love this place. The new Chef Rick knows how to plan a menu and cook great food. The wait staff are all super friendly. They don't simply take my order, but they sit at my table and chat. The management is great. Every night I eat there, Chef Rick comes over to shake my hand. Great Food, Great Service, Friendly Staff. Remind me... what else are you looking for?
