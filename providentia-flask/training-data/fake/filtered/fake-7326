Finally an awesome Israeli restaurant with affordable prices. An an Israeli residing here in Manhattan I was looking for a place like this for quite some time and now the search is finally over. Even their simplest dish is served with great care and nice presentation. Everything is made to order so it's always fresh. Friendly staff
