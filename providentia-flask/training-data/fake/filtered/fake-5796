We love this place... After being together for many years, it was time to have a formal celebration. The Counting Room was a perfect choice for our wedding! Â The space it's beautifully designed, It's informal but sophisticated, and worked perfectly for our cocktail party. Ruth, the bar's event planner, was super helpful and accommodating. She really made all the right suggestions: The cocktails, selection of drinks and food were fantastic! All the staff was very friendly and professional. Our guests had a blast... It was definitely a great party! We're looking forward to going back!!!
