Food is fine, but it's pricy for taking a lunch that you might get something even better for dinner at a comparable price range.  We spend $74 for a lunch  for two which I believe the food is far off the price.  I can't tell much different between freshly made soba and precook one, if I do need to spend that amout of money for lunch, I would go something else in the area close by.
