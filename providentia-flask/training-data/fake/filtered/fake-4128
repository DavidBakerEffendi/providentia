Bierstube looked like a fun place to eat and relax last night, so we popped in and ended up staying a while. We were pretty hungry so we decided to try an appetizer, and we decided to try to Belgian fries, and OMGOSH, it was some of the most interesting, but best fries that I had ever eaten. My husband's review: "Best Bratwursts that he had even eaten! He said the were cooked to perfection, and the mashed potatoes on the side complemented the brats! (he had the spiced pork brats BTW) I had the chicken sandwich, which was completely amazing as well! I love the cheese that goes on this sandwich (muenster? cheese) It is perfect and different than just the traditional swiss or american cheeses that go onto sandwiches. With the sandwich, I got the side of those yummy belgian fries. Loved it! Awesome "hang out" environment. Will definitely be stopped back by here when we are in this area next time!
