I love Cuban Cuisine and had to try this place. The food was very good which I was pleased with, but unfortunately the service was slow and unattentive and that ruined my experience. I did sit out in their lounge area after dinner and that was nice. It's a very cozy and comfortable area to just sit and have a nice talk with friends.
