If you haven't been, you're missing out.  Iris is hands down the best brunch spot in NYC.  The environment is unique, and food amazing.  Whether I'm in the mood for a light snack, good sandwich, or full meal there's always something to enjoy at Iris.  The menu is simple and delicious.  The staff is friendly, and very accommodating. More recently, I've been going for dinner which is equally superb.  And desserts to die for.  Reasonable prices for high quality food and drinks.  Breakfast, Brunch, dinner, or just drinks (coffee, beer, or wine) Iris Cafe is true Brooklyn Gem.
