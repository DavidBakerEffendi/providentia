Really great food and service.  Some of the dishes are definitely eclectic and you have to have a taste for different.  The stuffed dates and meatballs are just superb.  Tried a few of their specials and they are equally enjoyable.  The staff will explain everything so if you have any questions or are iffy on something, just ask.
