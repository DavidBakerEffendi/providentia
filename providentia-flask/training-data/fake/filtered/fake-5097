I wanted to go somewhere for my birthday to have some food and listen to music. My friend suggested we try this place because he had a good experience. Well honey it was well over what I expected. The bartenders were attentive, the 2 lady DJ's made the crowd feel alive!!! My group stayed for 7 hours never bored once the whole night.. A must try is the cheesesteak w/fries and a drink called 7 minutes in Heaven. You will not be disappointed!!!
