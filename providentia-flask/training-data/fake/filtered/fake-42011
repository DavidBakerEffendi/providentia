We've had pizza a few times from Goodfellas, both delivery and dine in.  Very good. We decided to try something else off the menu - bad idea.  Eggplant Parm dinner was inedible - seriously had to just throw it away.  Eggplant was tough and barely cooked, breading on it was soggy and an odd color.  Ceasar salad was also awful.  The dressing tasted like someone added a little water to an almost empty bottle of dressing and poured it on, and the romaine was not crisp.  Sausage and broccoli rabe was edible, but lukewarm and not much flavor.  And the garlic bread - stale.   Delivery took well over an hour. Overall a HUGE disappointment.
