A delightful treat right in the city of Newark, Vonda's Restaurant serves delicious, heart healthy dishes. Everything served fresh, the vegetables are fresh and seasoned to perfection. Their breakfast and dinner items are all delicious. I was pleased with my first visit and each time I visit I am pleased. The wait staff are courteous and friendly, the restauranti s clean and the prices are reasonable. I'm glad I was introduced to Vonda's. I endorse this restaurant and it's catering services. Their catering services are wonderful, very professional and on time. They cater all types of events, they even had a Thanksgiving special last week - 20 people for $150 and the menu had some great stuff on there: Turkey, mac and cheese, collard greens, string beans, cranberry sauce made fresh, and corn bread. You can't beat that price anywhere and they even had Fried Turkeys for $75. I hope they have something special for Christmas! Five stars all the way!
