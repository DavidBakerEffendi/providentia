First of all I would like to say that I thoroughly enjoyed the experience at this restaurant.  From the atmosphere, to the food and staff, it was a great dinner after watching a movie at the theatre located conveniently next door. I had a falafel for my main entree which was amazing, as well as a fava bean appetizer to start, which was also incredibly delicious.  It is definitely a nice place to take a date for a healthy selection of food and customer service that you can't beat.  Our waitress always made sure that we were doing well at all times and the staff in general provided a very welcoming atmosphere. The customer service even went above and beyond the restaurant.  I happened to leave my lights on in my car causing my battery to shut down.  The entire staff including the owner, made sure that I was able to get into my car and also gave me a jump start to be able to go home!  Wow!  I am completely lucky and blown away by their generosity and support!  I recommend this place to anyone who wants great food at a good price, with great people.  5 stars all the way!!!
