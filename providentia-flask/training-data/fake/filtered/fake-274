Great place for happy hour! Â My friends and I hang out on the rooftop deck at least once a week in the summer. You have to get the seared tuna, they do it right! The shrimp calamari is fun, it's cooked very light and crispy! The shoestring fries are pretty cool and great to share. I've also been to the Continental Midtown for breakfast. Their breakfast dishes are tasty and not overwhelming. Oh, and you gotta love their Bloody Mary's! Not too spicy but Very flavorful and fresh tasting, they hit the spot!
