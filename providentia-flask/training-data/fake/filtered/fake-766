If you're open to something a bit different than your typical NYC style pizza then this  place is totally worth it! It's one of my faves (next to Lombardis and My little pizzeria and Mi Famiglia). The fresh mozzarella , the basil, and yummy sauce on thin crust is delicious. Not too pricey either,  it's about the same  price range as any other pie would be in NYC. The long  line waiting is worth it. I always find it a wonderful treat to eat at Grimaldis :)
