Best.  Breakfast. Ever.  Small, quirky, great personality.  I loved this place.  The food was great, and it had terrific character.  I had the grits bowl, and never had better grits.  My wife had a waffle with bacon and apples and it was great.  Plus we had the fried devil eggs.  Don't knock them until you try them.
