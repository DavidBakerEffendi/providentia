Always a fantastic meal here at Traif. If you are indecisive, like me, I suggest the chef's selection. You can never go wrong with it. Food is always savory and delightful. Every entre they serve you will just wow you. From their spicy cocktails to their ever changing seasonal menu with pork belly and my fave foie gras, every visit will be different. Oh and how can I not mention their bacon-flavored desserts? Uhhhh-mazing. However, their service is just mediocre but who cares when the food you're going to eat is beyond words?! Bottom line is Traif is the best known secret in Williamsburg. This is surely worth a visit!
