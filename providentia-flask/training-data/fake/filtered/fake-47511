I do enjoy thin pizza,  however all I experienced while in NYC was one undercooked pie after another.  Now I know why New Yorkers fold their slices in half while eating them!  The sauce was bland and the slices needed additional seasoning. The toppings list was too limited. The dining space was tight and the servers weren't very friendly. The Brooklyn Pilsner is definitely recommend. Overall disappointed with my experience with what is supposedly one of the best pies in New York.
