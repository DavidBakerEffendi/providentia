Gee...I have to be a bit of a naysayer here. The atmosphere can be incredibly annoying and the place is a little dirty sometimes. Also, I don't want to sit on a tuffet, as I am not Little Miss Muffet. That said, it is the food that can be objectionable. Burgers are great and we love the fries when they are not oversalted. In fact, salt happens way too often here. There is a real inconsistency: the gnudi are always great but the veg, the chicken liver and the fish can be way off. Also, wtf with the cocktails. I don't make that mistake anymore and go for a draft. Desserts should never be eaten here. And the waitstaff is harrid and on Mars.
