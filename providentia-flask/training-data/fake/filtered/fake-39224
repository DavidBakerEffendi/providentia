My husband took me here for dinner to celebrate our wedding anniversary. It absolutely rocked. The hostess who seated us was genuinely pleasent and helpful. Then, the server who took care of us was absolutely wonderful. I truly felt waited upon. The food was the best part. The Rocky hill burgers were gourmet.My husband is not one to be easily impressed but he is thinking of making this restraunt our default location for any celebrations. They even had a lady sing Opera during our dinner.We took our 7 yr old and 5 yr old with us and I was a little worried as to how the Kids would do. But everyone paid extra attention to them and this is the only real family friendly Tavern I know off. The ambience was extremely elegant and the decor was absolutely sophisticated. All in all I would recommend this place to anybody.
