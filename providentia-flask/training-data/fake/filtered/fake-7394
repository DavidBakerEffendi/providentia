Out of this world service and some top-notch food! I ordered their ever-famous fries and the foi-gras patte. This restaurant is not for everyone, and is not a normal visiting site as it is rather high-end and pricey. I don't think this place needs any advertisement as they are always bustling with customers either in the restaurant or the bakery. Everyone has to try this place at least once.
