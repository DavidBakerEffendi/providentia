I've been walking past this place for the last month or so that it's been open and really wanted to try it. I finally did with some friends and really wish I had gone sooner. The food is probably the best Indian I've had in the neighborhood and even converted one of our friends who previously didn't really like Indian cuisine. There are two reasons I went with 4 stars instead of 5. First, although the food is delicious the portions are just a little on the small side, particularly for the price. Second, the staff still seem somewhat awkward. It wasn't terrible and I'm guessing it's just because it is a new place, so hopefully I can bump this up to 5 stars after the next time I go (which will probably be very soon!) Overall, highly recommend!
