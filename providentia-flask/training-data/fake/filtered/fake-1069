A met a friend here after work on a Friday, and I have to say, I wasn't really thrilled. On the plus side, I liked the looks of the interior, and it is a cool looking building. Upon asking about drinks specials, however, we found out that they were only available at the bar, not with table service. Not really a Â big deal, although I always think it's weird when there are rules around happy hour service. A waiter very kindly and helpfully advised us to try the rooftop bar, which we decided to do. The rooftop is a very pretty space, and I recommend checking it out if you decide to go here. I have heard that the Continental Midtown is known for its martinis, and I saw the "Continental Martini" on the happy hour list and decided to try it out. The bar tender offered me the option of gin or vodka, and since a classic martini is a gin based cocktail, I went with gin, to get the full martini experience. The bar service wasn't great, but I didn't really care. What made me not so happy, though, was when I received my bill. I was charged the normal non-happy hour price for my martini, and when I inquired about it, the bartender told me it was because I ordered it with gin, which is not a special. I know it's sort of lame to quibble over $4, but it just felt kind of shifty. To me, a martini is made with gin: I didn't know that comes with a surcharge. I honestly don't care about the money, but it did sour my attitude towards the Continental Midtown.
