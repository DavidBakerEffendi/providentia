This location meets the standard of Cheesecake Factory.   The inside interior and ambiance are the same as other Cheesecake Factory locations.  Foods are great and portion size is BIG.  I ordered the Fetucinni pasta with sundried tomatoes and my boyfriend ordered a rib-eye steak.  I liked the pasta more than the steak; it was creamy, warm, and sweet from the sundried tomatoes. The steak seemed very typical, nothing special and it was OK.  This place is packed.  You should expect to wait for a long time to get seated and high noise level.  It's not an upscale, high end restaurant but still you can have a good time with our friend.
