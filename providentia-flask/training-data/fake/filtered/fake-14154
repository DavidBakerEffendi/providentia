We've been to Bleu a few times now and every time it's been an awesome experience. The staff and owner are extremely friendly and the service is excellent. The fish is the freshest and most tender I've had in the city. The BYOB option really makes the place great and they are happy to provide you with glasses and an opener for any drinks you bring. The ambiance is perfect for any occasion. It's not too dark or too light and the decor/lighting/paint scheme really complements the food and service. This place is great to bring friends. Prices aren't mind-blowing, but they aren't unnecessarily expensive. The fish is high quality and would typically be priced much higher for what you get. The owner has a clear vision of providing guests with high quality sushi at fair prices. Overall, this place is awesome all around and the staff (though some newer than other since the place is relatively new) make your stay much more welcoming.
