We have two small children and we are big on eating pizza. We've been to Angelo's, Avelino's, Valentino's, Gencarelli's, Cinga's, Marco's. Every place was good. Last week we got a coupon in the mail from Parsippany's Best Pizza. It was for a one topping pie, mozzarella sticks and garlic knotts. I got there exactly 12 minutes after I placed the order. They got my order from the back room - usually when you have hot things they are sitting on top of the oven. We were beyond dissaponted. The pie looked and tasted old - I am not sure how long it was sitting there - maybe left over from somebody else - it certainly explains being in the back room and not kept warm... the garlic knotts were cold and extremelly greasy. The marinara sauce was extremelly sour. We ended up tossing the food away Â - it was literally uneatable. so, please do not be fooled by thier name. They should be really called Parsippany's Worst Pizza!
