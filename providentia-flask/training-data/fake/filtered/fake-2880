The service was poor. The staff was incredibly rude,starting with the owner of Cuban Pete's, Dominic! He physically pushed my friend's chair into the table--with her in it---so he could seat another party! When we objected to his actions, he shoved a table at us and told us we should leave! This guy is a total idiot and doesn't deserve a penny from anyone. Steer clear of Cuban Pete's and this jerk loser who owns it. Â  With that the quality of the food is irrelevant. I don't care if the food was free and the sangria had alcohol, I still wouldn't waste my time there. Cuban Pete's has alot to learn, starting with courtesy & etiquette!!!
