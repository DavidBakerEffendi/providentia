Came In for a very late friday dinner and had to wait an hour for a table. It seems to me that most of Stephen Starr's restaurant are just so busy. They all seem to have very interesting ambiance like bicycle rotating on top of the bar. We tried the Crab meat Guacamole and it was nothing special. We had seabass tortilla and the few other wraps and would say it was nothing special. The normal mexican food you find at your local place, but with better ingredients. The good part was that the service was very attentive and the overall ambiance was very relaxing.
