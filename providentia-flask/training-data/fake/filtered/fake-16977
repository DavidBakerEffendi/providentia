My sister and I were waiting for our brother while he was at the dentist. His dentist, Christopher Perez, suggested that we go to Cafe Gitane, and gave us directions. We almost passed the Cafe, not thinking much of the outside. There was blue and white stripped umbrellas and a couple tables and chairs. As we entered though an old phone booth looking door way and through the curtains, we were pleasantly surprised with the cute atmosphere. We sat down and ordered two cups of coffee. WOW!! The best cup of coffee I ever had! I ordered baked eggs with tomato's and basil. My sister wasn't hungry until she saw my food and figured she had to have something because it looked so good! She had brushetta. She hates tomato's, why did she order it? The tomato's were fresh and delicious, she loved it! Five cups of coffee later... everything was great, prices were right, we loved it!!!
