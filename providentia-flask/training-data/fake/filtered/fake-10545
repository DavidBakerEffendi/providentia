I suggest this place to everybody who would like to try Korean cuisine. I went there few months ago for a lunch and since then it is my favorite restaurant in new haven. Owners are really nice and very helpful. Inside is nicely decorated and it is perfect for a relaxing dinner/date. The entrees are all very healthy choices and they all come with some little side dishes as well which are absolutely delicious and worth to try (kimchi and cucumber are my fav!). Overall it is great dining experience.
