This place is amazing. I went there with my coworkers after a really difficult day at work. We initially said that we will stay only for a drink and we end up leaving after 3 hours. Great food, we tried meatballs, mac cheese balls and an eggplant spread for appetizers. After we shared a mix grill platter that it was more than enough for the three of us. Atmosphere and service was great also. Great food, warm atmosphere and cool staff...what else you need from a place??
