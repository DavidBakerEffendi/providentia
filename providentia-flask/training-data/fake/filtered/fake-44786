The owner was unbelievably rude - worst experience I have ever had at any restaurant or business in this country. We had made a reservation but when we got there the owner entirely ignored us. When we eventually were able to get him and ask, he yelled at us and told us to "get the fuck out of my restaurant!" - which we did.
