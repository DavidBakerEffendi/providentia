For a place that is all about Mac n Cheese and Grill Cheese the are totally lacking in both.... The Grill Cheeses we ordered should be over flowing with cheese. The Napa Chicken grill cheese they used dark meat! It was gross... Our Mac n cheese was so peppery and dry. It was like someone accidentally dumped a container on peeper in it and just decided to leave it. I would say buy kraft singles and white bread and make your own sandwiches. You would save money and your taste buds. Â  Soooo disappointing
