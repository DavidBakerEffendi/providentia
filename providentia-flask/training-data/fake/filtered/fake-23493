Ultra-modern decor with great view of East River.  Hostess and waiters were warm and attentive.  The dress code advice, "casual elegant" describes the atmosphere very well. The Spring Pea Panna Cotta was beautiful and delicious; the pasta with lamb and fava beans was prepared correctly, like home cooking, but it only had three beans which was a disappointment.  The potatoes and greens for the table were delicious. The menu was a little intimidating due to its creativity.  I settled for baby lettuce and greens and Berkshire Pork Chop. Again it was good home cooking.  Which can be a good thing depending on your mood.  It suited me fine The location was a complete mystery to our cab driver, which is not the restaurant's fault.  But it gave us a funny story as he let us out below the restaurant at the parking garage entrance. I am torn between 3 and 4 stars.  I really enjoyed the ambiance and the food was good to excellent.  I would return for a classy evening and respectable cooking.
