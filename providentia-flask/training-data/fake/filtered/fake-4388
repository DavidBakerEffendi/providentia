As soon as I sat down, I knew this was going to be a treat! The smoked salmon appetizer was seriously good and the rabbit saddle and leg saddled me with joy! I thought that my main course was good! But boy was I in for a treat....literally! The affogato cake knocked me off my feet! I would go here again and again!
