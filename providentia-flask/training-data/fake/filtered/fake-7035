wafey small bagels.  They need to figure something out.  Go try the bagels that Muddy Waters gets.... those are the real deal.  Tried this new place twice because its in my neighborhood,  the second time was worse then the first.  The eggs tasted rubbery and strange and upon inspection, they were grey.  The bacon was not fresh either and after about 5 minutes the cheese sorta turned into a plastic layer.  The entire thing was a waste.   I am truly disappointed because their sign is amazing and it could be prime for the right restaurant.   sorry.  Look on the bright side, you hired some really friendly employees, they were great both times.
