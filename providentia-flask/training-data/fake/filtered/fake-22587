Being new to yelp and thanks to my recent Samurai Mama obsession I decided I'd give this place a chance.  Almost didn't stay when they said it was going to be 45 minute wait, so glad I did.  Probably some of the best pork buns I've ever had, and I've had a lot. Then we had the ramen. To me ramen is all about the broth and again, great. Perfect flavoring and consistency. The wait staff was super attentive even tho they were slammed. Bringing my boyfriend back next week!
