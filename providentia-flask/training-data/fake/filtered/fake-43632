Extremely loud, extremely cramped, extremely uncomfortable seating, indifferent service, bad food. How difficult is it to cook a hamburger to order? Medium rare does NOT mean well done. Does the chef think that the spicy "special sauce" will disguise dry, tasteless ground beef? And who knew there is a potato underneath all the salt on the fries?
