Family-friendly, I don't have kids but I do enjoy watching kids tip over their parents beer! Enough about that.. pizza, flatbread, awesome... ThE place to go for flatbread in Burlington, health ingredients, great beer and an upbeat staff what more can you ask for? The environment can cater to many needs, my first date 5 years ago with my girlfriend was here and it was, perfect. I am not a perfect guy, but we keep going to "flatbread" and she is still by my side to this day.... I better make a reservation tonight.
