My husband and I were here the other night for our "date night" and I was extremely pleased with his choice. I had, first of all, no idea that we were going to a Cuban restaurant and second of all, had no idea, that he knew to choose to this place. From the street you may think this place is just a regular restaurant. We found parking in the back (which we later found out was the actual entrance) and was filled with surprise at the size of the restaurant.  We were offered indoor or outdoor seating.  I thought that was awesome.. It made me want to return next summer already. Yes, you are to bring your own drink but that didn't matter. The service was quick.. The food was absolutely delicious. I was certainly recommend this place to anyone!! I'm very pleased.
