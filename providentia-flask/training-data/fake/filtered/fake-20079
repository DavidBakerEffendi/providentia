I love this place.  The food is fresh and delicious. An unusual spinach salad has goat cheese, walnuts, and dried apricots with the most amazing fresh pesto dressing.  Yum.  Espresso lattes are good but the assortment of chai tea lattes is awesome.  There's a chocolate version I save for special occasions when I've been very, very good and deserve a treat.  I live around the block and have always found the service polite and very accomodating.  Breakfast outside on a Saturday morning is a great way to kick off the weekend--bring your dog and chat with neighbors.  Oh, and after 6:00 p.m., sandwiches and salads are reduced to $5.00.  Such a great deal when you're too tired to make a meal after work and want something healthy.
