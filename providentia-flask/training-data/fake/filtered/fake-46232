Food is really decent. The wait is long but, if you're with friends and near the bar it shouldn't be too bad. The only drawback is that the refuse to let you take your food home. I'm sure ramen purists will defend this by saying that it doesn't travel well, you can't reheat it it, it's not the same, they don't take out ramen in Japan..blah blah blah. Sorry, if i'm paying $18 for noodle soup, I should be allowed to take it home if I want to. They either need to put a sign up that says we don't let you take your food home or explain that its going to be gross if you do and let the diner decide. If I ever go back, I'm bringing my own tupperware.
