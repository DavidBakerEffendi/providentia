As good as it gets! Best Restaurant in Brooklyn for southern food with a classy and funky twist! I love their freshly muddled specialty cocktails. They got cucumber, cranberry, cantaloupe, any fresh fruit you name it, absolutely refreshing! Gents don't say you don't know where to find the ladies. ;) Ladies you know where you want them to take you eat, SoCo. It's the spot to be, yummy.
