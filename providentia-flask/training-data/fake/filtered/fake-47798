On a second outing to the Oyster House, I found myself not only hungry when I left but feeling a bit "skunked" about the $27.00 platter that i ordered.  They called it "Lobster Roll" but I gave it the name "Seafood Salad on a hotdog bun"  because that is what i recieved.  I do have to mention that the platter came with shoestring fries......big deal.   I was not only turned off by the presentation of the platter but most importantly the price.  In reality it should have costed $8.00 and if I knew it was going to be like that, I would have ordered from the local hoagie joint in the northeast. Needless to say, I would never recommend this place to my worst enemy and I will never step foot in there again.
