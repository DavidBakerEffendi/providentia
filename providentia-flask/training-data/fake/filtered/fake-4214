Service is a first class Good is first class Ambiance is a first class A new cute Thai restaurant in Hell's Kitchen, Â I can't think of anything else to say but this is the best thai restaurant I have eaten! I normally don't like pad Thai but the pad Thai here is something that I can eat and finish the whole serving, and speaking of serving it's a lot haha! Definite a highly recommended
