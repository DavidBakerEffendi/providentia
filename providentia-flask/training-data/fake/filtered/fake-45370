I took my significant other here for his birthday for the second year in a row and we LOVE it.  This year I finally broke down and ordered the chicken with red velvet waffles...it was FANTASTIC!!  We also had the mac and cheese and he had the short ribs...everything was superb.  The server also recommended the Hibiscus Martini and it was soo good, I had two. My only complaint and the reason why I didn't give them the fifth star was due to the cafeteria style seating against the wall....the couple who sat next to us had a child and at one point she reached over and tried to but her hand in my plate...she was that close to me (next time I will wait for one of the other tables).  But don't let this little bit of info discourage you from going here.....the food here is FANTASTIC and I will definitely go there AGAIN AND AGAIN!!!
