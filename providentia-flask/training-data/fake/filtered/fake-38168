Dining at Theresa's Place was a great experience, From the beautiful plate presentations to the great tasting food.  I was very impressed with this quaint and cute restaurant.  I had the wonderful pleasure to meet the owners and they made me feel right at home.  If you haven't had a chance to experience it for yourself, give it a try. Two thumbs up all the way.
