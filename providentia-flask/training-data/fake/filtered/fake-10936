Service is non-existent. Pizza was good but service was awful. Tip: If you want more than one soda or more than one beer order them all at once since you won't see your waitress until its time to leave. I would like to have the money the  owners  lose every evening because the wait staff fails to see if the table wants more drinks. They could double their drink income . We were embarrassed since the out of towners we were with couldn't get another soda for their son.
