This place is horrible!  Granted, I've been going to Zoi's for a few years now and everytime I go I think maybe, just maybe it will be better than the last, but it's always the same, very disappointing.  Usually, in the mornings they have great coffee, however, their food...not so much!  Whether I order a sandwich or just a simple salad, I'm never satisfied.  Today I went and coldn't decide, but I knew I wanted a salad, so I decided on their House Garden salad which said, on the chalkboard, it comes with sunflower seeds and house croutons.  When I opened the salad to eat it, it was loaded with purple onion, two SMALL chunks of a tomato (basically just the skin), a few olives, and a ton of cucumber.  Neither the seeds nor the croutons were on it!  I also decided to buy a blueberry muffin for dessert because they looked fairly small, and it was small, but it seemed to be about 3 days old!  I don't know, I just don't think I'll be going back here any time soon, or ever!  Once before I ordered the chicken salad sandwich and it was supposed to come with cranberries and walnuts, there was neither, just very dry chicken salad with mayo on roll, very boring and just slopped together.  You can get an awesome salad and sandwiches right around the corner at Judie's European Bakery on Grove Street, of course you will pay a little more, but it's definitely worth it!  And you can buy a GREAT muffin from Koffee right around the other corner on Audubon Street.
