First, I'd like to thank the Yelp community for recommending Rincon Criollo.  So, I drove a litle over an hour from Connecticut to eat at Rincon Criollo after reading the reviews here.  I'm a Miami Cuban and was really craving some flavors from home.  This place did not disappoint!  I've been hunting down good Cuban food in the area for two and a half years, and this was way better than any of the silliness that's sold as Cuban food from Manhattan to New Haven. The outside is very unassuming, but once I stepped inside, I was home.  I heard someone speaking Spanish in a Cuban accent, and I asked him three questions (in Spanish): Did they serve Materva? "Yes", Jupiña? "Yes", Ironbeer? "Yes".  After passing with flying colors, I couldn't wait to start ordering.  I had the Cuban standard Lechon Asado, Moros and Yuca.  The pork was outstanding, the moros and yuca were standard good.  The flan for dessert was excellent, and the cortadito was perfect!  The service was a little slow, but honestly I was in no hurry to leave.  Rudy is fantastic; he really makes you feel like you're at your cousins' house for Noche Buena.  I can't wait to go back!  Next up is either the chicharrones de pollo or the rabo encendido (my favorite).  For anyone in the tri-state area looking for truly authentic Cuban food, don't waste your time going anywhere else; head directly for Rincon Criollo!
