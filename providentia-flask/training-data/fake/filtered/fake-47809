My mother saw a review of this place on television and was waiting for us to come for a visit.... I am glad she did. The lobster roll is amazing and the fresh shucked oysters are the best I've tasted outside of New England and New York! Would have been rated 5 stars if there was a childrens menu. I will, we will definitely make a return trip.
