What I had: 1) Cabbage and Pork dumplings in soup (8 pieces, $3.00); 2) Kimchi ($2). The Cabbage and pork dumplings in soup was very good. The perfect treat for a cold day. Even a warm day. Tastes like moms cooking. The Kimchi was mediocre at best. I would certainly not try it again nor recommend it. The seating is tight when things are busy; but I was satisfied with the seating given the type of restaurant and kinds of prices offered. All in all, the dumplings are a great value and I expect to come again.
