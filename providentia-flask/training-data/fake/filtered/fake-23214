Had Sunday brunch here with 6 friends on a Gilt City voucher and had an AWESOME experience.  The margaritas were delicious and packed a punch! The staff was very attentive (especially Michael) and always made sure our drinks were replenished in a timely fashion.  We weren't rushed, food was tasty and portion sizes were good.  We had guacamole, chicken enchiladas, fish tacos, steak and eggs and the tilapia sandwich with rosemary fries...yum!  They even threw in an extra guacamole and a pitcher of margarita because my hubby wasn't crazy about the tilapia sandwich.  All in all, it was a great brunch and we will all be back for another Mexican fiesta.  Did I mention the incredible margaritas?!:-)
