When you walk into this place there is nothing more than an old school diner feel. So appealing because I can't say there are many left like this.  It is just good old NYC. This place is sooo cool! The cooks are so fast on that grill.  It is AMAZING! When I went I had the Jersey Shore and everything was cooked perfectly!! The old fashioned bar stools as well as 2 tables in the back, the menu lined up with comfort food that is well priced and plentiful to hit the spot. Whether you are in the mood for breakfast at 2 pm or a flavorful turkey burger, you can't go wrong with whatever you choose on this menu. The restaurant has been in business for 18 years now, which tells you they are doing and cooking everything right in the heart of Chelsea! The coffee is fresh, the prices are in line for even the tightest budget. The atmosphere is comforting and the owner and his dad as well as the staff are impressive in personality.   The owners fiancé was also there helping out proving what a team they make together. The jokes amongst the staff are comical at best. =) The speed and intensity at the grill is more like a Hibachi Chef to keep up with the orders coming in.  These guys are on the move and they get it all done perfectly. If you are in the neighborhood, and just want to sit at an old school diner, and are in the mood for either a healthy salad or that good old fashioned comfort food, then THIS is the place to be.   Many return customers and regulars seem to be part of this place.  It's kind of like the Cheers of NYC. So, with that being said, enjoy a taste of NYC!! and enjoy your visit
