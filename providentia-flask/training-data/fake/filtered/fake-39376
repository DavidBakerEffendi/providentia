I was in New York for a week on work and I managed to eat here twice. You might say that is a foolish choice in a city with a million unbelievable restaurants, but it was worth it. The ambiance is everything that I would ask for in a restaurant. Cozy, romantic, dreamy. Â The food sealed the deal. It was delicious! My friend and I ordered everything to split so we could sample as many of the amazing sounding items as we could manage. All good! It was possibly my most happy dining experience. Plus I saw Josh Hartnett dining there with his oh so cool dude friends and oh so annoying girl friends and I realized "Hey, he kinda is a heart throb..."
