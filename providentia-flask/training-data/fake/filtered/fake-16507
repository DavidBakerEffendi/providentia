One of my favorite places to eat in Burlington for sure.  The Pink Lady is incredibly yummy, as are many other menu items.  I wouldn't reccoment going for lunch- not enough staff to get in and out in a decent time- so save it for dinners with friends.  Best in the summer months when eating outside is an option.
