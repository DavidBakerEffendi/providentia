I ate here on Sunday evening, and I was very satisfied.  The food was excellent - tasty, hot, and very creative.  The wait staff was efficient and engaging.  Food was delivered in a timely manner. I went here with friends who wanted burgers.  Two of us are vegetarians, and I was a little leery of a place called Bareburger.  There were several choices for us.  I had the a sweet potato and wild rice "burger" wrapped in steamed collard greens.  We ordered a small plate of pickles and slaws.  The pickles were out of this world - fresh, crisp, a 100 year old recipe.  We also got a small plate of onion rings and sweet potato fries.  The rings were excellent, and the fries were crisp and tasty.  I will return and bring friends.
