The word is consistent.... It is consistently great at Park & Orchard.  The restaurant boasts fresh food; healthy cuisine; large portions; great wine and beer list; and friendly staff.   Put all this together and thats why I drive almost an hour to dine there.  I have been visiting Park & Orchard for about 15 years..... and it excites me as much now as the first day I stepped food inside.
