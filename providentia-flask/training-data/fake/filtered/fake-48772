I eat out at least twice a week for dinner and three or four times for lunch/brunch. I've dined in the U.S., Canada, South America, and Europe. And frankly, I'm getting tired of those few restaurants that serve food that's okay (not brilliant), with portions so small they wouldn't qualify as a "sample bite" in most establishments, and prices that must be determined by the size of the chef's monthly yacht payment. If the food at this restaurant had been absolutely amazing--prices, for these tiny portions, would still have been too high. And the food was not amazing. Good, edible, but not amazing. And the drinks--hard to figure why I should pay $18 for a jigger of the same bourbon that costs me $12 at other restaurants of similar quality. On the good side, our waitress, Marley, was terrific--engaging, warm, responsive. The atmosphere--worth a shrug. If you're an anorexic, this is the place for you. If, on the other hand, you want a meal, be prepared to stop for a burger on your way home from this place.
