I am officially a FAN! - The drive to this place was a bit hectic but when I finally arrived I was amazed by the organization at the front counter. They provide a number for all orders and call out when its ready. Order was ready in 10 mins flat!. Feel the need to comment on decor - small but spacious enough for a comfortable quick bite. Not a 5-star but sufficient. The garbage mentioned in other reviews is just nit picking - Its as clean as a garbage area can be. Did not see any flies either. Now back to my order of 12 pan-fried dumplings with a beef noodle soup. The dumplings are large and filled with extra meat for that full bite. They hold together well oppose to others where the meat falls out on the first bite. The even held their crunch after the 20 min ride back home. Beef soup - Nice chewy but not soggy noodles. Beef was a bit fatty but taste great! Overall, I am a fan and will be back to cure the my next dumpling craving.
