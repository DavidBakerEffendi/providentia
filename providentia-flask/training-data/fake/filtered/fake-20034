The food was simply awesome. Great service and great ambiance. Maybe a tad too dark for my taste but that's not a big deal. We started with the octopus appetizer and the edamame ravioli: so good and so different. The octopus was perfectly seared (plancha style) and not rubbery at all! The edamame was so good! A bit filling but the truffle flavor they added made the dish! Then I had the sea bass: delicate and cooked to perfection with these wild mushroom to boost. Chris had the seared scallops and there were a great too. Not to forget: the drinks. We had martini cocktails with our food and they were creatively awesome. Overall great dining experience: not cheap but worth it. Sometimes it is worth to spend the extra bucks but something unique.
