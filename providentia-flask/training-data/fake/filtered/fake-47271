Lucas is without a doubt one of my favorite dinner destinations.  It has a great menu  - very extensive - and I know that, whatever I order, it will be exceptional.  I've been there on many occasions, with my husband or with groups of friends, and we've always come away impressed with the food, and with the wonderful experience of a great dinner in a welcoming and attractive setting.
