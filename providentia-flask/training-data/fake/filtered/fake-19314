The interior is really cool. Speaking of cool it was too cool in there, they did not have the heat on when I went in for a late lunch.  So I had a chill while I ate my food. Also I ordered a fish burger with a side of fries.  The fish burger was suppose to be cod & salmon.  It was probably 99%cod & 1%salmon.  It was bland and pretty flat tasting.  On the menu it said it was $14 but when the bill arrived it was suddenly $15.  The fries tasted like they were the frozen fries you would pick up from a key food--generic, tasteless &reheated.  I think this place is for the transplants(and there are so many now!) who have moved in to fort greene who maybe have a different palette/standards.  As a native, I would not go back to this place or recommend it.
