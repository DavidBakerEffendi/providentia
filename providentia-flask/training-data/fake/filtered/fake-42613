This lovely quiet restaurant, close to campus, is a wonderful gem. Rava is one of the waiters and he is delightful, helpful and even brought us a couple treats, including a Mango Lassie for our friend. Since I am a vegetarian, i can say that their vegetable dishes are delicious and filling. The prices are reasonable, and they deliver, which has been a great help on cold, snowy evenings, or when we are just too tired to go out. Highly recommended!!
