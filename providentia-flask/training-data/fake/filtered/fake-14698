This was such an amazing restaraunt. Portion sizes were appropriate. Not too big and not too small. The atmosphere was cute. The drinks were a little tiny for the.price.but tasted good. The food and service was absolutely spectacular. Definately coming again but you should loom into larger drink glasses for the price of.the alcohol.
