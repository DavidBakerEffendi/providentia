Very disappointing! First of all, this place is suppose to open 11am but all the food was not ready until 1130-1145a. The food that came out early was not even hot. As far as the taste of the food...could be better. Nothing to rave about. Also, the seafood was in a separate room. Not sure how customers are suppose to know this. Good thing the lunch buffet was only $6.99 (not including the drink).
