wow...where do i begin....walked in and the people they have working there always have a smile...and very attentive.... we recently went with friends...a large group and the waitress was funny and on her toes...entertained us and really made our night a pleasure..... the food was top notch....not one bad review from our group of 10.... love going there and taking new ppl there ...always a good recommendation... if i have to say anything about the place that needs alittle sparking....is the parking....they should really have valet....
