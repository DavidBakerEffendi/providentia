Here's my story: I'd been on the road for 2 days, trying to get by with boring strip-mall caesar salads in places that had nothing but all-american fare, caught a cold, and needed a place to get a bowl of hot broth made from scratch to cure my viral/road food blues.  And it was date night, so I needed a place for my hungry sweetheart.  We started with the cobia - kaffir lime/pomelo/jackfruit sashimi and then a green papaya salad.  Both were well executed, but I would have gone lighter on the fish sauce.  Crispy shallots topped the salad off nicely.   When I walked in I could tell  the broth would be interesting, curiously (maybe because of my cold) the overwhelming impression was of cassia cinnamon.  I was a little nervous, not sure what it would be like, but was delighted when I tasted it. We both got the beef pho - I got a small, which for my 120lb midsize appetite (I'd skipped lunch) was perfect.  My date ate/drank every last drop of his regular size portion and was stuffed. The broth may not have cured my cold, but it made me feel a whole lot better: rich in flavor but not fatty; bright with herbs, and balanced. Do I think it's as authentic as south Philly vietnamese pho?  Hard to tell, I've never been to Vietnam.  My hunch is probably not.  Did I miss the beef tendons, when what I got was delicious meatball and and abundance of tender beef cuts?  Not a bit.   When I mentioned I found the green papaya a bit too salty, the chef kindly offered us the pineapple dessert on the house. I'm won over - we'll definitely be back.
