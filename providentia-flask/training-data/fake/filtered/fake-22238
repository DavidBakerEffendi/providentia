A shit place!  I placed an order for a pickup. It was not ready when they said it will  be. Then they will not except  a 100 or 50 bills. Then I got home and they didn't even put my drink which I paid for in the bag. Not to mention they charged me more then the menu to go stated and that the food was cold. Never again!
