We went to Buddakan back in July for my birthday and we had the best time! We went with another couple and also my daughter( who was 3 mos. old at the time). The service was fantastic! The staff was completely accomodating with my daughter. The food was amazing! I forgot what exactly we ordered but we all tried alittle of each other's food! Everything was so good! May I recommend the wasabi mash? It's a bit pricey but great for a special occasion! Will definately go back!
