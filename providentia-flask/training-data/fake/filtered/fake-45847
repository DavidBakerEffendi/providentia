They took the same friendly staff and incredible menu from Shinju and ported it directly into a modern sushi atmosphere.  I haven't been to this new location for lunch, but dinner is incredible (make a reservation, especially on the weekends).  The tempura rolls come out warm, they're quite generous with the avocado on the cali rolls, and I'm not sure what they put in the spicy tuna, but I could definitely eat it to excess.  Best sushi in Philly, and the prices are quite reasonable.
