Had a great time at Casa Piquin on Thursday night, it had more people that I expected. I ordered the cerviche & botanita for Â apps both were great starters. Then I ordered The fish tacos & skirt steak molcajete (it's a lava rock bowl full of great flavors) yummmm!!! I'm writing this wanting a plate of this now lol. The service was great, my waiter Richie was very informative & took care of our table the whole time like I said before a great night of Mexican Food. I highly recommend this place Casa Piquin.
