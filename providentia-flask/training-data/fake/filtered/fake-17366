Wanted some last minute breakfast with friends and did a quick Yelp search. Excellent service, very friendly-like most of Philly. Everyone agreed food was awesome. Friend said his Huevos rancheros was maybe the best breakfast he ever ate... Jen's Crespelle was nice as well. Fresh, quality ingredients, and excellent prices. Next time I'm in Philly I know I'm taking my wife and daughter here! Great place!
