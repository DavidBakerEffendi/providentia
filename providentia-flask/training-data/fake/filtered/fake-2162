Absolutely delicious. I think this was actually the best meal I've ever had. I went with one other person and we had pumpkin soup with hazelnut bread, some sort of sausage and lentil appetizer, suckling pig ravioli, the Corzetti (pasta coins, braised goat, mint, and chili oil), and the Roasted Rack of Rabbit, along with two cocktails. The meal was a little pricey ($130+tip for two people, but given everything we got that doesn't seem so bad), but that's literally my only negative. Every single aspect of the meal was superlative. Every dish we had was so different, but all equally amazing. The cocktails were also very, very good. Wow. The person I was with said it was better than Vetri, where he'd been a couple weeks prior. Amazing, amazing meal. Can't wait to go back.
