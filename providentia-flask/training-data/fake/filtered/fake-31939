I am from California and I discovered Posto a few years ago while visiting my son.  It was the best pizza in the U.S.  Every time I would come to New York for visit or pleasure I would make sure the Posto was on my itinerary.  The crust in particular was done to perfection and the toppings were well prepared with a delicious tomato sauce.  I went there yesterday for lunch and ordered for the first time a personal pizza - same two we always get (mushroom and pepperoni and a shroomtown.  The crust was as good as usual but the topping were dry and lacked substance.  Maybe insufficient tomato sauce or maybe cooked too long.  Not sure what the problem was;  could be a simple as it's harder to prepare a personal pizza. Not sure whether I'll go back or not.  It was great in the past and every restaurant can have an off day.
