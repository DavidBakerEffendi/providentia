My husband and I moved to New Jersey after getting married in June last year. He was anxious to take me to this Diner on the way to Eagle Rock Reservation as he used to frequent Eagle Rock Diner when he was growing up . The atmosphere was dull. The waitress was unprofessional. I ordered a fish dish, but when it came the fish was OFF. I began to feel upset in my stomach right away. The waitress spent about five minutes questioning me about what was wrong with the fish as if she did not believe me, before offering me the chance to choose another menu item. As my husband's pasta meal was okay, Â I thought it might just had been the fish so I ordered grilled chicken. When the chicken came it was white and uncooked in the center. The combination of both horribly tasting meats really started to make me sick. I went to the bathroom and threw up. I called my husband while in the bathroom and he came to assist me. The waitress came in the bathroom to tell him he could not be in there, and when she saw that I was throwing up, she screamed 'Oh My God' and literally ran back out. I was feeling so sick I could hardly stand and my husband did go outside to get me some soda water. As soon as I was able to stop throwing up he took me to the car and went back inside to pay the bill. Believe it or not, they charged us for BOTH meals, and no one ever apologized or showed concerned. My husband was disgusted as the Eagle Rock Diner had really declined in its quality and Customer service from what he remembered it to be. I would NEVER so back there, nor would I recommend it to anyone. The overall service even taking out this incident was atrocious.
