Been to Blue Ribbon on many occasions.   Last nite I was disappointed.   The service was great but the paella was not up to par.   I've ordered this dish previously and it was always great.   I think the prices have gone up and the quality has gone down.   I remember having prawns in the paella and last nite I received only two little hard shrimp.   Also the glass of wine is a joke for $14.00 the glass and its the size of a juice glass.  My husband and I thought this was our favorite place but I guess that's why it was on the empty side last nite.
