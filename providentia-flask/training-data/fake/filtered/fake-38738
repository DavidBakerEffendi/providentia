Its a rainy day in Philly and finding a cozy place to mess around on your laptop for a few hours is pretty tough. I stumbled into Fork finding it after walking down Market Street looking for some hot coffee. Fork was immediately what I was looking for. Great food beautiful Decor, service off the chain! Well done.
