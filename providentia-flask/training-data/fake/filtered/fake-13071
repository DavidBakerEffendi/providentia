Bad food and deceptive menu card....that is what describes this restaurant. They have a dish called "Mirch special chicken biryani". We ordered this dish and it is basically chicken lolipop in rice, no masala and the chicken never mixed well with the rice. When we spoke to the Manager, he initially denied that it was chicken lolipop in the rice and then finally agreed it was. The correct name for the dish should be "Fried chicken on rice". Very average in taste and also poor service. Overall a thumbs down. Not worth visiting and wasting your money as I unfortunately learnt. Cheers
