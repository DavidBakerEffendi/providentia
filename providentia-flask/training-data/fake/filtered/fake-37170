This week, while we were visiting friends in Ludlow, they suggested a restaurant in Springfield that they enjoy. I'm from Rhode Island and the prices at restaurants are pretty high. That's what I was prepared for. I ordered the escargot appetizer and the Black Rock rib eye with a lobster tail. The waitress was a doll and very helpful. The food was excellent and the prices unbelievably reasonable. The portions were so generous that I brought half of it home with me. I so wish that they would open another Black Rock closer to my home in RI. I highly recommend this restaurant. By the way, the house Cabernet was delicious.
