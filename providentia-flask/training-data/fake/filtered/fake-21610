Hat City Kitchen is one of the best restaurants in the ValleyArts District.  As soon as you enter the doors you can feel the great vibe from the Manager Larry and his staff. The cool hues of the artsy decor and amazing artwork that adorn the walls transforms the restaurant into a laid back atmosphere.   My hubby and I had the pleasure of stopping by on a Tuesday evening during open Mic Night.  The music and the comaraderie among the performers were amazing. We are now regulars. The food is awesome!  It is a combination of american cuisine with a creo-soul fusion.  My favorite dishes are the Shrimp and Grits and My Mom's Meatloaf.   If you would like to experience great dining, great service and great people, check out Hat City Kitchen!
