I visited Miya's after reading these great review and am compelled to write my review.  It was without any exaggeration THE WORST SUSHI EVER.   It even tops any bad sushi I have ever eaten including the Buffet Sushi. I have dined numerous upscale Japanese sushi places in NYC for over two decades and Miya's is a truly a shameful display of Japanese sushi It is Not Japanese Sushi it dose not even come close, the quality is beyond your imagination to the point that it is truly inedible. No Japanese sushi place will serve these kind of food and sushi EVER. The conclusion is that if you want to be tricked by these fake reviews with full stars join the gang.  You'll be leaving with disgusting feeling in your stomach.  GOOD-LUCK
