We love this place - the food is consistently excellent, service is always warm and friendly, and it's a great place for a special night out. If you can take advantage of their prix fixe, that's the way to go. Even though this place is on the fancy side (for Park Slope standards), the waitstaff is extremely accommodating when it comes to little kids. My toddlers always get a warm welcome there.
