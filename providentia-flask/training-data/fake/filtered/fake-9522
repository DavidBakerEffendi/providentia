While we were waiting for a table at the bar, just as we were about to order cocktails, a young woman came over and loudly asked for my friend to move his bag (which was hanging on the back of his chair) because it was in the food runners way.  Would've been totally fine and we would have no problem moving it , but she came off pretty rude with her request.   She said it loud enough for the most of the restaurant to hear and acted like we were an inconvenience.  So sorry to be annoying!   Would have preferred her to be less loud and  intrusive and more welcoming.   Immediately following her suggestion, my friend and I looked at each other and simultaneously said "let's get outta here." Clearly we didn't feel very welcome.  Thanks for that Rucola. I'll give it another try because the food is delicious and our first experience was pleasant but please be nice to us.
