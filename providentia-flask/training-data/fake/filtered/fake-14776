I recently traveled to Robbinsville from northern New Jersey and visited Centro for the first time when it was requested by a friend. As I arrived I had to wait a while to be seated, which didn't start my visit off well, but was then greeted and sat after several minutes (it was not busy at this time). I was sat and greeted by our waitress who was very personable and polite. I believe her name was Alessandra. She came to our table and gave us a perfect amount of time to look over the menu while she got our drinks in a very timely fashion. Alessandra was extremely nice and well mannered. She put in our appetizers and have us ample time to look over the menu to order our entrees. Our food was brought out in a perfect amount of time after our appetizers. She gave us our meals and allowed us to try our food and then came to us to make sure everything was to our liking. She was a great waitress and made out dining experience worthwhile after a less than par start due to the wait time to be seated. I will come back to Centro when in the area and I will request to be served by Alessandra. My review ranking directly reflects the service received by Alessandra.
