I have been going here religiously every winter for almost 6 years now. Somehow it had become a tradition between my family and a family friend's family and we always can't wait! I have tried just about every dish and I am ALWAYS satisfied! Let me start off with the must have....the soup dumplings(honestly the reason we come). They are actually the most delicious and scrumptious things ever! The dumpling part is never chewy--always great, the meat on the inside is fatty and incredibly flavorful and the best part- the soup! It is so wonderful they should bottle it and sell it! I have tried both the pork ones and the pork and crab and they are both great. Also, the garlic eggplant is so good!Also, the service is wonderful! The waiters are incredibly attentive and always willing to adjust the menu for you. Overall, I could not even explain how incredibly delicious the dumplings here are. They are a must have if you are taking a trip into chinatown and the prices are great too! Now unfortunately there are 2 downsides to this place-- no credit cards so you need to carry a heap of cash (great prices but with the way everything tastes you will be ordering insane amounts of the soup dumplings), they don't take reservations and are always packed-- heres what I do when I go: go in with a group of people and get your number, have a few people wait there while a few people walk around and then switch. Don't all leave because even if they say an hour it could be less and they wont seat you unless your whole party is there.
