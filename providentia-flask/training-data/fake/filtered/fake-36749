I love PYT. The PYT burger is delicious. Just thinking about it makes my mouth water. The patty is always perfect and juicy and the bacon and sauce.... Amazing. The fries are super tasty too. I live in the neighborhood so it is a great place to pick up a burger to go for nights in and dining in is always fun too. Great crowd. Great place to have drinks.
