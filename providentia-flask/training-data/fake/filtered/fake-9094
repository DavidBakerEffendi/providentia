We ordered delivery tonight, and they completely screwed up our order.  I called to complain and they offered to fix it.  My wife got hungry, ate half of one of the incorrect sandwiches they'd sent us, and the delivery man refused to give us the corrected order unless we could produce the first order.  I gave him my uneaten sandwich, and he handed me 1/2 of the corrected order. As he drove away, I realized they had, again, screwed up the order. This is not the first time they've screwed up our orders, but it is certainly the last.  We've cut them slack, but it's not complicated and, frankly, there are other options.  I will never, ever order from this restaurant again.
