My experience at Flat Top is what has egged me on to finally create a Yelp profile. Unfortunately I can only comment on the service, which was incredibly disappointing. My companion and I left without ordering. I was there earlier today evening with a friend. The restaurant was probably a third full when we came in. We were waiting for over 10 minutes for someone to come over and serve us water, let alone take our order. Two tables that were seated AFTER us were promptly served with water, and had attentive servers. Despite the restaurant being more than half empty, there was absolutely no move on part of the servers to look to us. What the hell? I mentioned this on the way out to the lady manning the front of the house, and she looked like she didn't give a shit. Ah well, I'd rather take my money elsewhere.
