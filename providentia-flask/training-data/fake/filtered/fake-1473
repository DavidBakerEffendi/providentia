I'm  sad to give the new iteration of White Dog one star, as it used to be one of my favorite restaurants in Philadelphia. With a renowned veggie-friendly, sustainable menu, it was a stand-by in West Philly, if a bit over-priced. Their menu, although somewhat static, was fully of variety.  I also really used to appreciate the service, which was solicitous without being pushy. On my last visit, I was very disappointed with the service, pricing, and food. Disclaimers: this was an off-time (late Wednesday afternoon), so I haven't seen the new dinner menu. White Dog's lunch menu seems to have changed to fancy bar food--quesadillas, burgers, "gourmet hot dogs" (?) , and only a few veggie options. For a lunch menu, it was quite overpriced ($13 for a small tofu sandwich, $11 for a quesadilla that included only three small slices). And that's where the bad service began. My partner and I--both people who dine out quite a bit and are used to surprises, gaped when the quesadilla arrived. It was that small. When he asked if that was the standard lunch portion, the waitress asked, "Anything else I can get you today?" and flounced away. She didn't seem to realize that we had voiced a critique. That was the moment for her offer him salad, fries on the house, or at least to go to her manager to mention there was a complaint. The food wasn't even particularly good. I wish I didn't have to be so harsh, as I've had some truly memorable, lovely meals at White Dog. However, they won't be getting my business again.
