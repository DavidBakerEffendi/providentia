Stayed next door to this place while in town for a gig in da Roseland Ballroom... It Rocks! Very different scene from the other bars in the area... Really cool space downstairs with beautiful upstairs room with balcony and an awesome patio out back... Barstaff were awesome! ..really friendly & most of them Irish I think..!!! Only bad thing I can think of is that I didn't go there the first nite of our stay. Definitely the first place Â we'll be visiting when we come back in the fall!
