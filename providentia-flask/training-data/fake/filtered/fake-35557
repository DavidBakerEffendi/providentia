I just ordered their catfish sandwich. Gross!!! I never tasted catfish so obviously fake. What a major disappoint. I foolishly decided to go for their chili seeing that it is chilly outside. Well, this what ever it is froze my face in a position of disgust. Talk about bland and tasteless, horrific. Are they serious? My friend ordered extremely hot wings. What a joke. He doesn't mind hot but that's all these wings were, hot. There is no seasoning of any kind on them. This is home economics 101. Meat must be properly season to embody its true flavor. I cannot recommend this place at all. I guess after enough Petrone one could this trash.
