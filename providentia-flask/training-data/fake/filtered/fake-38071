Last nite we celebrated a Birthday party with my Friends at this Place... The owner was very gracious enough to take cake a day ahead for a surprise party.  The service was excellent, can 't believe , he is able to juggle do many clients at the same time and be able to tend everyone.  The Food was Amazing, everything was fresh and cooked to perfection.  Everyone raved about the dishes they had and it was just right.  The portions were equally good, you wouldn't leave hungry out of that place.  Overall we had an Amazing experience and im planning to bring back more friends here.
