The food was delicious, especially the mac and cheese which was superb! The waitstaff were attentive and the ambiance just right. The only negative, but an important one, was the hostess who had one of those fake smiles and an 'I'm doing you a favor' attitude. Ugh! So Not Brooklyn! Go for the mac and cheese and the restaurant's proximity to the movie theater.
