I was so disappointed.  For some reason or another my plans to eat here have always fallen through and I was excited to finally experience what everyone loves so much.  The place is beautiful, cozy, it started off as a really nice, romantic Thursday dinner date.   The artichoke dip was perfect... the cocktail tasty but a little sweet (fair enough,  I think every cocktail is too sweet).  We ordered the romaine salad, the mussels and clams and the steak to share.  Every dish was so overly salted it was nearly inedible.  Nearly, since we were starving and a bit tipsy and devoured it nonetheless.  It is the only meal I have ever said this about.  It must have been a mistake.  The waiter dropped the food off, did not come back to check and our grumbling stomachs got the better of us.  The salad was salty, the broth was like drinking brine, and the mashed potatoes were pure salt.  I love salt, I put extra salt on everything heart-rate-be-damned.  This was not a good salt, this was a pickle your tongue and top of your mouth, gargling with seawater kind of salt.  My teeth hurt.  We both woke up this morning with puffy eyes and massive headaches - sodium overload.  I don't know what to say.  We paid and left and tried to salvage the evening... kicking myself for not saying anything because it irks me to no end to experience this kind of thing at a restaurant of this level in New York.  You are supposed to TASTE the food before serving it.   I absolutely loved everything else, but f**cking up the food is a major problem.
