While I enjoyed the food at Scarpetta, I do have one complaint. The waiters was very professional (as were other staff), but he did not even look at any women at my table when describing specials, asking if everyone was OK, or giving the bill. Since I was the host and female, this was disconcerting. My husband loved it, of course. He gave the bill to my husband, who passed it to me. I put my charge card in and left it for the waiter, who returned it to my husband, who gave it to me. What?
