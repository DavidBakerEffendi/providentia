What a great place! We were there friday night, the service was exellent, our waitress was extremely helpful! One of us can eat only gluten-free food, and that was no problem to the kitchen. There was plenty to choose! We dined with kids, no problems there either! Food was good, especially the stake and the appetizers. Solid 4 stars!
