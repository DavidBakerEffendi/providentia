This is one of my fav places in my neighborhood to go by myself and grab a bite and a few beers.  The 2 bartenders on Monday nights are super cute and personable.  I ordered the diablo muscles and they were absolutely delicious. So much in fact, it was too much to eat and I asked to take the rest of the sauce and bread home so I could have it for dinner the next night.  You better like spicey though.  Great beer selection and the staff has a decent knowledge on the menu.  try the chickpea fries at happy hour for an intriguing treat.  Not what you'd expect.  Thanks cute boys on Monday night for a much needed delicious and relaxing experience.
