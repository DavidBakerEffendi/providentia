Ths is the second time that I have been to this restaurant I live in Manhattan but have friends in Astoria and tscond time around they were as good as the first.  They didn't disappoint.  I ordered the crabcake appetizers the lamb lollies and my friend had the fish fillet  which was fantastic.  The quality of food is really really good and its the best addition to Ditmars Restaurant Row in a long long time.  We had some reallynice Australian wines and the place was really busy but the service was good.  Dont be surprised if one of the owners comes by and stops and speaks to you as this is the way service is at this restaurant. If you havent been to The Thirsty Koala go and enjoy you will love this place great vibe, service and food
