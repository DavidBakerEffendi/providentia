Great Sandwiches and Coffee. (La Marzocco espresso machine!) Did I mention? They do Sandwiches of the week, last week or two ago was Saigon Joe (Ground beef and carrots made with Vietnamese spices) and now this week is the Kalbi Sandwich (Short ribs) and man it goOoood. Saigon Shack is a gem, Vietnamese restaurants in the area usually focuses on either Pho or Sandwiches but they do both quite good and to top it, have good coffee. As for their service, every place have their good and bad servers, Luisa was it? She is awesome. Cheers Tip: Lunch time is bananas.
