My husband and our friend, voracious meat-eaters, loved everything they ate on the menu.  As a vegetarian, I was graciously and tastefully accommodated.  The backyard garden setting was charming, the service was attentive and professional, the ambiance comfortable and unrushed.  One of the owners, Heather, stopped by to chat periodically, and it was evident that she runs the restaurant with dedication and enthusiasm.  The other owner and chef, Jason, came over at the end of the meal and cheerfully answered questions about the cuisine.  As a new restaurant, Traif should have displayed growing pains.  In fact, the evening was without flaw, and we will return to try other items on the menu.   Highly recommend this gem of a restaurant!
