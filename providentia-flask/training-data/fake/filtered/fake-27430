After reading about this place on the Dyker Heights Christmas Lights facebook page, we decided to give it a try last night.  First it is not in the Dyker Heights neighborhood as we drove a good many blocks to get to it.  No parking  in lot, but did get street parking. Went in to crowded waiting area where they continually wheel large garbage cans through on hand trucks. Spoke to woman in charge and asked if they could accomodate our 80 year old mother who has celiac disease and they said yes, just to speak to the waiter. Told us there would be a 20 minute wait for a table. So we waited - more like 40 minutes, but were seated.  Waiter took our order.  Very quickly delivered the sicilian pie for the five of us and pitcher of sprite. But we waited and waited. Finally kids ate the pizza and still no grilled chicken for my Mom. A busboy finally came and asked if everything was ok - we said no, still waiting for grilled chicken. Waited some more and waiter finally appeared. He went to check and said chicken was still on grill and quickly left. Waited some more. Finally got up and went to get woman in charge. Lo and behold the chicken appeared.  Now our pizza was ice cold and the chicken was only luke warm. Bus boy began clearing table moments after chicken was finally delivered.  Not one person apologized for long -long delay for a simple piece of grilled chicken served on a bed of lettuce and tomato.  $40 for 6 of us to have dinner seemed reasonable, but service left a lot to be desired.
