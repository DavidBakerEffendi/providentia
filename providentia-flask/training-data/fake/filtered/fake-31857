How should I respond to this place? It is more "night life" than resterant to me, not that being that is a bad thing. The food was not bad, though it is more "themed" than authentic Cuban food (forgive me, spent two years living in Miami, I know Cuban food). The sangria bar screams "kitchy" to me. I would recommend it for friends wanting to drink and have fun. Would not recommend it for a serious dinner and certainly not if what you really want is Cuban food. A sold three stars, and don't take my review as a snub, just calling it as I see it
