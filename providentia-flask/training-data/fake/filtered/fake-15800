I ordered Swiss steak burger, Cobb salad and banana milkshake. They are good if u don't care much about calories. I was told to wait for the seat for twenty minutes. Luckily, they table ran so fast. I got a table within ten minutes. The food went so fast after we ordered like ten minutes. If you like the crowded place. This is good.
