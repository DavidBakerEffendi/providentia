I got a coupon for $25, with a $50 minimum to redeem, for this restaurant and had it printed out beforehand. After watching a sporting event nearby, me and my date ate here tonight. The food was decent, though not particularly great. They brought the appetizer and our entrees all together, plus the rice was tepid at best. Still, the meal was going ok and we had racked up a $51 bill. When I presented my $25 coupon, they told me they didn't accept it because it was only redeemable on their "seating area" section, and that we were on the "bar" area. The time was 7pm, so we didn't come to eat at an unreasonable time, plus the seating area was closed off, but they were still taking food orders in the bar area. Just because of that ridiculous reason, our coupon was rejected. I was also told that I had to present this coupon first before ordering, even though the coupon has no such stimulations on the fine print... infuriating. To top it all off, the waitress was extremely rude to us, and rushed me to sign off the bill receipt, and practically snatched up the receipt once I gave it to her. Horrible experience, horrible service, and I'm left with a coupon that I must now exchange for another restaurant who will hopefully appreciate my business.
