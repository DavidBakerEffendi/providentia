I visited this establishment over the weekend. This restaurant is beautiful and it is in a great location, which makes up for the bland food, poor service, and unprofessional employees. I would not recommend this place to anyone. I am sure that the other locations are excellent compared to this one. The owners should close it and hire a completely new staff.
