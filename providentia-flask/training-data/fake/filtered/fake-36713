I'm not a hipster. I just like burgers. PYT is my one and only true love, and the only lover I have ever introduced to my mother without shame. This hip burger joint is the baby of Tommy Up. My picks are the PYT burger with cheese and the Caucasian, one of their magnificent adult shakes (yes, that means its alcoholic). If you're feeling good, get your dance on in their secret backroom then take home the other tasty thing not listed on their menu: me.
