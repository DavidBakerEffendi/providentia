Took my mother and brother there for lunch.  Pizza was good but the entire meal was overshadowed by the horrible waitstaff.  I was appalled at the way the staff greeted us.  It seemed as though we were interrupting him watching tv.  Told us to sit anywhere and we walked to the booth and he said noooo, (as though we were stupid) and said tables only, booths are for 4 or more.  Keep in mind, they were not busy.   We ordered a large and a small.  The small came out first and a blonde man with a mohawk just sort of threw the pizza on the table and said nothing and went back to watching tv.  Pizza was sent back because the green peppers are pickled.  Although my fault, I was surprised that my server said nothing about them being pickled when we ordered it.  As a server for over 6 years, I usually give my customers a head's up when we serve something that most people don't expect.  And I don't think most people expect pickled green peppers.   The place itself was nice, however, it was dirty.  Staff was standing around, texting, and watching tv which was surprising because they could have sweeped or cleaned the dirty tables that were around.   Overall, for us the bad service was what we walked away talking about, not the pizza.   I'd rather go to Delorenzo's on Hamilton Ave or It's Nutts in Titusville rather than ever going back to this place.  Hopefully the owner has a talk with his staff to correct these issues.
