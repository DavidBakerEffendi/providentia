Its not just that the food is delicious, its also hearty and nutritious. The carefully curated menu is chock full of organic, local, farm to table goodness. The service is excellent and genuinely welcoming. When you walk in its immediately obvious that from owner to chef to waiter that all involved with Crescent really care about every aspect of the restaurant and are thoughtful about everything they are doing. A brilliant forward thinking addition to the neighborhood. Highly recommended as an all-round memorable experience.
