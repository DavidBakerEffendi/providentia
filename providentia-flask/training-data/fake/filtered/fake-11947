My husband visited the diner for the first time early this AM for breakfast. He was old by coworkers that the cheesecake is housemade & delicious...he took a piece to go for me.  I was just starting to eat my dessert this evening & much to my absolute disgust I felt something small & sharp-ish in my mouth...I took the small bite out of my mouth & examined my finding...A TRIMMED FINGERNAIL was what I found!  I had my husband look at it to make sure I was not losing my mind while trying to hold back nausea.  I am appalled.  I immediately called & spoke to the nighttime manager, not seeking anything as repayment, simply to make them aware.  He had no idea what to say, one thing he said was that he knows that "The Baker" has short nails..Ummm this does not change the situation.  A fingernail ended up in my cheesecake nonetheless!
