The pizza is fantastic: - super high quality ingredients - excellent crust - great assortment of recommended combinations - Can easily cater to both meat lovers and veggie lovers (really good options in each direction) And I don't know what they put in the crust, but you finish the meal and don't get that "heavy" feeling that comes with a lot of pizzas. I order from Naked Pizza a couple of times per week. Old World Pizza (now Slice Between) used to be my favorite, but they've been replaced by Naked Pizza. I dig this place.
