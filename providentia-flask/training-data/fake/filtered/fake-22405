Ok. This place has been totally hyped up. The fried green tomatoes were good. The disco tots were the best thing about the meal. If ur from the south, don't get the biscuits with sausage gravy. It's nothing like you'll think it will be. It's gross. It's a biscuit smothered in some kind of sweet gravy with a shit load of cheese and a 1/2 a sausage link split into 2. Gross. My bf had the black and gold which was literally pancakes with pulled pork in between. Weird,salty,and gross . My friend had the fried green tomatoes Benedict which the eggs were more boiled than poached. No good. Overall, the entire meal was totally disappointing. I would recommend Sugar Freak 10 x over this place. But the staff was really nice and the door man was excellent.
