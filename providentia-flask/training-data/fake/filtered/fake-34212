Sushi was decent, and the service was a little bit strange and stuffy. We had two waiters... it seemed as if one of them was in training and the other guy was there to yell at him in Japanese. Also, the real waiter decided it was a good idea to give us attitude when we asked him any questions, so I definitely wouldn't come back for the service. The sushi was actually pretty good, but I though it was overrated. They have a good selection and I sampled a large amount of it, I found that a lot of their fish has a 'ocean' flavor which I don't like, so I stuck with the salmon and Uni which were both fantastic. Easily the best sushi rice I've ever had, but that's really the only reason I would return over my usual places. Overall, it was OK but I'm not sure if I'll return due to the service.
