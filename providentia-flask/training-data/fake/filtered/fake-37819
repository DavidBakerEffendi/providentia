What a wonderful place.  We had a wonderful Mother's Day lunch here.  We also hosted a dinner here with 14 people after my daughter's graduation.  We had an assortment of appetizers chosen by the owner's of the place.  Unfortunately we were about 30 minutes late, but everything was ready for us when we finally arrived.  The food was fantastic.  It was a great venue for our celebration, a small intimate place with a personal touch and very good food.  We will definitely be back.
