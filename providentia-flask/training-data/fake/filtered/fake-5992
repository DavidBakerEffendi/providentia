My husband and I decided to have dinner here tonight.  It was around 7 PM and the restaurant was busy.  We walked in and stood by the door waiting for someone to approach.  It took about 5 to 7 minutes before the "chef" came over to us.  He said a couple were leaving it would be a few minutes.  We waited again, while they finished their wine about another 5 minutes.   When seated, our waitress was completely inattentive to us.   She said do you have wine, we said no, she walked away.  Never offering us ice tea or a soda... NOTHING!   When she came back to us she took our order, didn't ask if we wanted and appetizer.  Dinner came, she didn't offer fresh pepper. We won't be back again!   Food was ok  but they clearly treated us as "strangers".   Others were attended to and were obviously "regulars".  Felt very awkward and uncomfortable.  Have wanted to try this place for years, disappointed!
