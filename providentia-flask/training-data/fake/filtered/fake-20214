This is the best Greek food I've ever had. Every single dish is mouthwatering, every single time. Each item tastes fresh, and I've seen adults lap up the hummus with their fingers to get every bite of goodness possible. Try the Sunday night prix fixe - the food streaming out of the kitchen was varied and mouthwatering.
