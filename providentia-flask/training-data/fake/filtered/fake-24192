My nephew purchased a dinner which came with a scoop of canned yams (dry) and macaroni and cheese, a chicken wing and breast.  I like my food wet (juicy).  That was not the case.  I asked him today how much did he spend.  When he told my $12.00, I screamed.  It was not worth $12.00.  I know she is in the business of making money, but what!!!!!!!!!!!!!! The food was dry.  I usually do not eat out at mom and pop shops. But this one I will not visit personally.
