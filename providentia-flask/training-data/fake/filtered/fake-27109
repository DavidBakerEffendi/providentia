Awesome! Great menu, food was top notch quality. Presentation was unique and artistic, waitstaff was attentive. On my first visit I decided to come back. The specialty rolls were flavorful and fairly priced. The atmosphere is wonderful, clean, and warm. I highly recommend this place to any sushi lover
