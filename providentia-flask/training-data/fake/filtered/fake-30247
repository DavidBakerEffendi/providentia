I love good, local burger places.  I travel around the state and country looking for them--and trying other people's suggestions. Goldburgers is my new favorite burger joint. In an area with several great options (Five Guys for inexpensive; Plan B, The Counter, and the new Max's for more expensive) Goldburgers is the new #1.  Fresh meat, fresh toppings, great extensive mustard selection (from boutique maker in Maine).  Very reasonable prices.  And fresh, hand cut french fries.  The best I've had in years. I had the Goldburger, as I had to try their signature dish.  Two moist, tasty pattys, fresh vegetables, pickles, and potato chips.  On a fresh, sesame seed bun.  Simply delicious. I'm already looking forward to going back and trying other menu items. I'm not sure I can handle the shlogger though: hamburger, chicken, hot dog, and sausage all in a bun.
