On Friday 7/6/12, Â my family and I went for their buffet. Although the food tasted great, they served stale, rotten bread (pav) for their pavbhaji! When my daughter pointed it out, their manager, Mr. Sagar spoke very rudely and displayed attitude. Instead of appologizing for their obvious laps of quaility control, we were told that bread comes from outside and that they have no control over it. Isn't that true for all of their ingredeints?!
