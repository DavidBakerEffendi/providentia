My club meets there once a month. I look forward to this meeting because I go early to have dinner. I enjoy the food and service. I love the varied menu. The staff has always been friendly and courteous. Â These are the reasons why I also have taken my wife there for lunch or dinner. Another group that I belong to has also met there. The staff puts on a wonderful breakfast or lunch buffet. The food was always well prepared. This is a place that I look forward to going back to month after month and year after year.
