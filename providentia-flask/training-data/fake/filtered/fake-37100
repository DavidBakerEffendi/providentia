Went here for a company event recently & was completely disappointed by my experience, although considering the general clientele there ... i shouldn't be surprised. The bar area was mostly needlessly oversized and the decor was way outdated. Waiter service was completely slow. You would have thought it was a busy night there, but it was mostly empty except for our party. I ordered the chef's calamari which came in some sort of an olive oil & garlic sauce & was excessively over seasoned, so i sent it back w/ no interest in a replacement. For an entree i had an encrusted Tilapia dish which i thought would be a safe bet & was recommended, but clearly i was wrong. This fish was not fresh or even prepared that day. I would guess it was straight out of a BJ's Wholesale club freezer. The taste was bland & unfulfilling. There aren't many worthwhile places to eat at in this area, but this is right there at the bottom of the list. It's honestly no better than a fast food restaurant. Poor and outdated ambiance and a dining experience you most certainly will want to pass on if presented the option.
