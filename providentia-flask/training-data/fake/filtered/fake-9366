I agree with the minority on this restaurant - mediocre at best. Then, why so many 4 and 5 stars. My theory is this: NYC is so full of white bread Americans with little or no experience with cuisine that when they get something new and different and "big" in flavor they think they've just experienced a culinary delight. In short, they just don't know. Why else would mac-and-cheese! be the big draw to so many places around the city. This is what these people grew up on!
