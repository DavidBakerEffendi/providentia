My girlfriend and I found this restaurant in 2008. We are far from sushi experts but having eaten in no less than 50 sushi restaurants across the US and Asiana House is Â in the top 5. The rolls are creative, the fish is fresh and price is fair. It is not a boutique like Oishii in Boston, RA in Scottsdale or Water in Tampa but it provides a clean, casual atmosphere with reliable service and food. We have dinner here at least once each time I come to town (every six weeks) and always leave very happy. They even continue to make a roll for us that was removed from the menu two years ago! For all these reasons I confidently endorse them. They do not take reservations so plan ahead if you are going on a Friday or Saturday night between 6-9pm. PS: remember to tip the sushi chefs.
