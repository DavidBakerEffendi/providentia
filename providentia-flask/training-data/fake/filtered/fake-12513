After working in the area for a couple of weeks, and having lunch at Sunrise supermarket almost every day, I needed a change.  Yesterday I tried Reuben's Empanads I spent $8.50 and got a pretty gross empanada, and a cup of "black bean soup" (basically about a quarter can of goya black beans and water)...  To think I almost gave up on my quest for another lunch spot!!! Today I walked a little further, and was intrigued by the hand painted lettering and the "diner" fixtures.  The waitress was sweet when I asked about the octopus and spinach dish, she seemed excited.  Her excitement waned a bit when I shifted focus to the pork chop. She seemed disappointed but said both dishes were good.  Normally I would have gone pork.... Kind of like "when in doubt, Eat pork".  Not one to dissapoint excited waitresses, I got the octopus.  It was really really good.  A large portion of salad, and spinach noodles w/ a peanut, tamirand sauce, and some pieces of octopus.  Really refreshing and tasty. All told I paid $12.00 for lunch (including tip).  If you are in soho and need a place to eat, do not hesitate. You will not be disappointed.
