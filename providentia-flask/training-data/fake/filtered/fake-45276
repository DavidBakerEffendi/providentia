A couple of unique assets of this location is that the outside dining deck overlooks Perkins Pier on the lake, AND the auto ferry, AND the Green Mountain train line.   We went there with our 3 kids age 7,5, and 2 and they loved all the eye candy.   Menu is simple, very light fare, but we could enjoy an hour of sipping local beer and the kids actually sat still while watching all the action.     We were satisfied with the salads and nachos.
