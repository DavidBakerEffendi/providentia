I am one of the pickiest people when it comes to burgers. Every now and again I start jonesing for one and once I actually order one I'm always disappointed. I'm thrilled to report that this break broke the burger curse I had been having. I first headed here to try the yummy truffle fries I had heard about, then I threw all calories to the wind and added on a burger with american cheese and bacon and a really delicious sweetened iced black tea. The only problem was they had run out of their homemade burger buns so my burgers bun was soggy since they had to use a store bought one. But, then they got new buns. So I asked, though I felt like I was complaining, for a new bun. The guy working the grill went above and beyond and made me an entirely new burger with the freshly baked buns. THANK YOU 500 DEGREES FOR A WONDERFUL BURGER EXPERIENCE. I'll be back soon!
