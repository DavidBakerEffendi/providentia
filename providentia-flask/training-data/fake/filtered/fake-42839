a bunch of my friends and i decided to try nyonya in chinatown, i heard good things but when we got there i was blown away by how absolutly beautiful this place was and the food was amazing i got the roti canai and the pad thai....the flavor was incredible....the service was great or waitress was always checking on us to see if there was anything that we needed...we could not have asked for anything more...everyone was so friendly ...i will definitly go back.... And the price was incredibly reasonable.
