My husband and I have been going to Marzullo's for about 6 years now and we love it. They always have the best food and they are consistently good. They never have an "off" day. We even go there since we've moved farther away since it is worth the extra ride just to know you are going to get the best food. The wait staff and owner are friendly and personable. The experience is always great. Thanks Marzullo's!
