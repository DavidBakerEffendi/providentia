The S'more Concotion was inedible. The marshmallow fluff was like tar and could not be pulled from the bottom of the ridiculous mason jar is was served in. The waitress seemed unconcerned when we informed her. I ordered chocolate pancakes that were thin, rubbery (yet not dense) and far too sweet. They tasted like a stoned person created them while having a chocolate craving and made do with whatever was in the pantry. Overall, not sophisticated sweetness, just sweetness. I found the server to be a bit inattentive, not quickly bussing empty plates and cups from our very crowded table. But my friends liked their hot chocolates and my tira misu cocktail was great- as it SHOULD be for 12 bucks! IHOP or Friendly's give Max Brenner a run for their money IMHO.
