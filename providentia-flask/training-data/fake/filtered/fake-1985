OMG!!! i loved this place. my wallet hated it. =D the food was great, lamb was dry, but everything else was great. they have this strawberry thing in a glass. omg!! one of my favorite desserts. staff was friendly. felt a little stuffy though. tables too close together. VERY expensive. spent $80 a person there. i mean, that's not Donald trump expensive, but damn, for me that's up there in price. 1 drink, food, dessert and tip. I'd go again in a heart beat. been there a few times, loved it every time. lunch i cheaper, but less variety. dress to impress, but once you're in there, unbuckle the belt, it's time to stretch that stomach!!
