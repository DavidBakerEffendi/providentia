So before we went in we were sure to check the reviews on yelp. Most were 4-5 with a handful of 1 star reviews. To be completely honest this place did not appeal to us from the outside as it looked run down, Â small and hidden but we decided to give it a shot! - very clean on the inside. We were seated right away at a seat of our choice. We were so delighted with the menu - it was exactly what we were expecting and wanted to order everything (didn't have lasagne on this particular day though). Got the aranchini to begin with - melt in your mouth! I got the pene vodka (never heard of it but the reviews told me it was amazing) and I was pleasantly surprised. The sauce was delicious and the pasta perfectly cooked - finished the whole HUGE serving. My partner got the ravioli on the specials menu. They were superb but if you're a big eater, get something extra. He told me he was happy he chose our seat because he could hide behind the little wall and lick his plate clean without being judged. This Italian boy was very satisfied. They also bought out an extra bread basket to use for soaking up the delicious sauce. Bonus! And free! The staff were extremely lovely and got a nice little bonus because the meals were extremely cheap compared to what we're used to.
