The owners  Alex and  Kim and their staff are wonderful hosts . Their food is awesome!  The menu and daily specials offer a wide variety of excellently prepared dishes.   The Pastas, chicken, fresh seafood and of course their pizza  are all delicious and once you try their food you will rush to go back.  Go to Alfonso's soon and you won't be disappointed.
