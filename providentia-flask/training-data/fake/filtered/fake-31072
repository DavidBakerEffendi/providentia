We have been going to this restaurant for years .....something has changed. We went this time and my moo shu pork was BURNT. It even smelled burnt . I sent it back and the made it over, this time there was a hair in it. Uck Â I am never going there or ordering from there again. They are the same owners, but this place went downhill... Too bad.
