I went to station house looking for a quick drink but instead stayed for a few rounds thanks to the fantastic service and welcoming atmosphere. When I went in, the bar area was not too crowded, so i decided to sit at the bar. The bartender, I believe her name was Christine, was quick to respond and had strong knowledge of the drink selection. (a wide variety of drinks by the way) i tried something the bartender recommended and was impressed. I decided to try another drink I was unfamiliar with and again was pleased. I ended up staying for two more rounds. I would highly recommend station House to anyone looking for a good time.
