Banh Mi Zon is an inviting little Vietnamese restaurant in the heart of the East Village just around the corner from Tompkins Square Park.  Tasty Banh Mi, Papaya Salad and Beef Stews and soothing ginger lemon tea.  The rest of the food is delicious and reasonably priced, decor comfortable, quaint and modern.  But what makes Banh Mi Zon extra worthy of a visit is the staff, Tai Dang and his sweet wife who are so incredibly welcoming and helpful throughout your dining experience.  Spend some time there and you may be lucky enough to hear one of Tai's tales in his travels as a photographer in lCambodia and Vietnam as seen on the walls and taidang.com.
