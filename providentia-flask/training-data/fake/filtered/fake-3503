I have eaten at Sabrina's now more than a half dozen times and without exception, every meal that I have had there has been great.  Certainly known for their breakfast/brunch, which is every bit as good as people say, but their lunch and especially dinner menus are creative, delicious and always updated.  And you are guaranteed to never leave hungry.  I can't wait to go back again.
