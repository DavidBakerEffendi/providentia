WHAT A WAY TO RING IN THE NEW YEAR!! The Smiths go out for New Years Eve about once every 10 years.  The last time was the millenium at the Striped Bass but  It is generally not a night for great dining. However, when Charlotte sent us an email that Pierre would be putting together a special prix fixe tasting menu for New Years Eve with regulars invited first, it took us about a second to decide to go. What a great decision!  Pierre rose to the occasion perfectly... The menu started with Hama Hama Oysters and caviar The second course was a roasted half Lobster with black trumpet mushrooms and lobster Emulsion which was tender and tasty.  The emulsion asked to be mopped up with their homemade bread Third, Dover Sole En Habit Vert accompanied by Sauce Supreme with Truffles was absolutely divine Fourth, sauteed Foie Gras with poached cherries and duck sauce (absoulutely had to mop up the sauce with more bread) Fifth, capon leg pithiviers was to die for.  The capon leg meat mixed with foie gras in the flaky light pastry was a dish I could make a whole meal out of Sixth - Capon breast with chestnut fricasee, celeriac puree and sauce foie gras elevated chicken to a new level Seventh - assorted cheeses, gateau and a glass of champagne finished off one of the best New Years Eve Dinner the Smiths have ever enjoyed! Bibou is the best in 09 and is starting 2010 with a winner
