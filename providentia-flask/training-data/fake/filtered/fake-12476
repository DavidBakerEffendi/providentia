I went on a Wednesday night around 8.  There were still a few tables open.  BYOB which is always great.  I had the chicken, asparagus, mushroom risotto and it was very excellent, and a large portion too!   My only complaint would be that it took quite a while for us to get our food.  No appetizers and just 2 simple risotto dishes took almost 30 minutes.  I'll just write it off as being a slow night.  The food makes it worth another trip.
