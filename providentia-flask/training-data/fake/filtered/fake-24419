LOVE LOVE this place for lunch! It can tend to get crowded with lines but it's worth the extra little wait. Their Cobb Salad is perfect! Their half sandwich/soup combo is dreamy on a cold winter day. Very chill environment, friendly hipster staff and just amazing quality food, always consistent. The desserts (to be shared because they are HUGE) are so good....any kind of pie with fresh whipped cream. yummmmm!!!
