No complaints at all.  Dined at Pascolo for my anniversary,  and enjoyed every minute of it.   The space is beautiful, the service was helpful and friendly and the food was plated very nicely and tasted even better.   Started with fried mozzarella, which came with a very tasty housemade marinara and was very adequately priced for the portion.  My entrée was the sausage lasagne,  which was a generous portion smothered in red sauce and fresh melted mozzarella.  Very tasty, very very filling.  My girlfriend ordered the ravioli formaggi in a butter sauce with asparagus and lemon.  She cleaned the whole plate (a rarity,  to say the least) and was also very full.  The entire meal with 3 drinks was just over $60, which is why I would recommend Pascolo Ristorante to anyone who is looking for a solid meal in Burlington.
