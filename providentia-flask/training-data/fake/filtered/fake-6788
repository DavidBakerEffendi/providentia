The atmosphere and the food was great. However they tried to cheat us on the check. They brought out the summary credit card check that said on it "tip is not included in this amount". I asked for the detail back up, and it said clearly on it gratuity was already included. They were trying to double dip. It's sad that people try and make money by cheating other people :(
