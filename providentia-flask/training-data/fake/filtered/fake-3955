What an amazing restaurant-- I swear it has every place in the North Slope beat!  Everything on their small, locavore menu is delicious and thoughtfully prepared.  Standards like roast chicken and burgers are done to perfection.  The service is also spectacular-- friendly, excellent and nonintrusive.  And the ambience-- something about the shaker simplicity of the space alongside the incredibly food is really sweet. A gem.
