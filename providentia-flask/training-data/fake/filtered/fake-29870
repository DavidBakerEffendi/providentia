Recently becoming a huge fan of thai food, I saw they had a thai options on their menu. Disappointed to say the least. My spring roll was absolutely gross, my chicken pad thai was bland and the chicken was chewy. The vegetable dumplings were the only thing I was able to enjoy. If using only "healthy" foods means taste is sacrificed, give me unhealthy any day.
