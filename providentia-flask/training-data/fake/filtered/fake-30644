1) Pizza Brain is the best. Anyone who gives this place a bad review clearly does not enjoy pizza. 2) Staff is always awesome. 3) Leonard's probably my favorite. 4) Stop complaining about the "small number" of pizza related items up. It's a tiny joint, people. 5) Because of Pizza Brain, my roommate has decided that a requirement in her potential husband is that he needs to be able to make pizza. This was stated one fine evening while waiting for slices. 6) I feel guilty eating pizza somewhere else. 7) Seriously has the best options for non-meat eating people. They've gone out of their way to provide awesome creative slices for vegetarians and vegans. 8) They use really good, quality ingredients.
