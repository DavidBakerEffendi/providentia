For a place that's only 2 mths, the food here was pretty awesome. I had the lobster bisque and clam linguini. I picked this place b/c I was looking for a reasonably priced seafood restaurant, specifically in this usually overpriced area. And I definitely found a hidden gem.. And the decor and service was more than welcoming.
