You only need to read the real reviews to get a true indication that this restaurant is run by armatures who know nothing about hospitality service. We walked out after waiting over 20 minutes for table service. The staff were more interested in having shots at the bar with their friends than serving there patrons. Â This was very disappointing as I had heard good things about Black Tree, sadly I struggle to see any future for an establishment of this low standard.
