I don't know what everyone's hype is about Ippudo. I can tell you straight off the back that the service is great, but the waiting time just to get in is just ridiculous. I've been here probably about 3 times but I always order the karaka ramen, that's preferably the best thing on the menu. I've tried others such as modern and such and such from tasting it from my friends plate.     I'd have to say the ramen is here is not great, but not bad, but your probably be getting the same kind of ramen if you were to go to Santoka in Mitsuwa.  Also their appetizers are great such as the tako wasabi probably the best and freshest i had in NY. Their pork buns are good too, but the only thing is that these appetizers are way overpriced. I usually go with 2 people with appetizers, ramen and drinks usually comes up to over 100. That's pretty expensive in my opinion. I thought ramen was suppose to cheap.
