This is my favorite place for lunch. The service is excellent, friendly and the staff know their food -- ask them about any item and they'd tell you as if they had just cooked it themselves. The lunch special is the best deal in town, $14 for a soup and sandwich, which is a huge brioche bun with either roast beef, pork or ham in generous portions. The a la carte items never fail to please, with a blend of long-time favorites and new offerings. I love the smoked kielbasa and I hope it stays on the menu. I recently had the seafood and mussels in green garlic broth which was lovely and light and the mussels sweet and just done. The desserts are also good, although sometimes a little too big for small appetites. But this is the only restaurant I know that, when told two are sharing a dessert, would halve it onto to two plates, each with its own scoop of accompanying ice cream. I recently had the Â chocolate blackout cake which was awesome. I always feel at home here. I love the huge bunch of seasonal cuttings at the end of the bar counter. Even the ladies' toilet has a homey feel, with hand towels instead of paper.
