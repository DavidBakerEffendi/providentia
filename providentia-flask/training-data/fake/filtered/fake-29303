Honestly? couldn't get any better... its either the falafael or the shwarma both amazing. I have been in the middle east, and I tried some places in Brooklyn and the city itself (yes im a freak of shwarma). nothing can compare to this guys. Try the mint lemonade it comes naturally with the sandwich, its like "they meant to be". usually its a crowded place (and tiny as well) but they handle it very quickly and you never wait longer then 8-10 minutes to get it done. OH and pleaseee THE RED HOT SAUCE IS A MUST, but be careful its spicy - but its a big must. try to take few bites without any red sauce, and then add a little bit on the top so u can say the difference.
