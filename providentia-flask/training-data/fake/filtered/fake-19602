We were searching for a brunch spot and found this place. Boy, is it small. Only about 15 tables so be prepared. Aside from that, the food was amazing. Candied slabs of bacon... Who knew?!? You may think you want to share, but trust me... you won't. French toast, Eggs Benedict, fresh fruit... soooo good.
