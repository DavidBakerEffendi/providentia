We went on a saturday night at around 8.  It wasn't crowded, and the food was great.  From the other reviews I was a little nervous about trying the lobster ravoli but it was delicious.  Very filling if you combine it wtih soup or salad. If you want traditional italian I wouldn't recommend it, but as a seafood place it was great.   Glass of wine prices weren't completely ridculous (6-9), and the music was wonderful.  I would go back.
