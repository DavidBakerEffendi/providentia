This is a place to be rejected. We decided to have dinner at this location and called up for a reservation. The earliest we got was 8:30 pm. When we arrived on time, we were kept waiting for more than 20 mins. When I asked what is the holdup, was informed that there was no table for 5. In the meantime, i saw other people going ahead of me. At 8:30 in the night, one could walk into any restaurant without a reservation. One cannot stop wondering if this is a case of discrimination as there were other Indian diners who were waiting also.
