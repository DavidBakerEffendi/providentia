I went to Yellow Plum on Tuesday and have to say it is my new favorite restaurant! I loved the signature drinks at the bar! And how nice and friendly the staff was. Â But the most important part is the food it is so good I had the BLT sliders as an appetizer it was amazing it was delicious! The skirt steak for dinner it was amazing it was cooked and seasoned perfectly! And the fried brownie for dessert with homemade peanut butter ice cream OMG!!! so delicious!
