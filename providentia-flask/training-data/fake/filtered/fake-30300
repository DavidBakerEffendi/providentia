Forget Ginos & Pat's...Jim's is the best!! Consistent taste and the best staff ever! I have been going to Jim's since I can remember. They lock the door at 3 am on the weekends. One night I begged to get in and they wouldn't let me, so I snuck in the back door. The guy (I can't remember his name) totally recognized me and that I snuck in. He was pissed. I gave him a $10 tip, kissed his ass and we share a friendly banter every time I see him now!! The line moves fast, the steaks are consistent!! Love Jims!!
