This place is good. Authentic flavors and the service is great!! Must try their Â pork buns they are delicious, soft bun and tender pork with an incredible sauce. I had the traditionally Shoyu Ramen and it was so flavorful. The restaurant itself has a great vibe, with great artwork. I'm so glad there is a great ramen place nearby , I would eat here everyday if I could!!
