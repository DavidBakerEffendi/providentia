I live around the block from this place and I've found the muffins are delicious, the donuts, creemees and ice-cream are also delicious. In the past I've had burgers there and enjoyed them. But today I got the Ramble panini and I couldn't stomach it. The bread was sliced very thickly and barely warm. All the good ingredients inside that would've been delicious hot, were just slimy and sticky. I should've gone back and got a new sandwich but I was already comfortable at home when I opened it. Â Maybe it was just an off day but if you go, check your sandwich before you take them out.
