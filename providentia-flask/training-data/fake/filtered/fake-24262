This place is awful. My dish arrived late, in a brown box container that was open on arrival and too large for the very small meal inside, which had been tossed around. I specifically requested "not spicy, please" but couldn't swallow down a mouthful without my tongue and throat burning. The food was cold. Don't order delivery from Ngam.
