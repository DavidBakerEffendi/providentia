Came here with the wife while we were in the area and saw it really wasn't too busy, which is rare. The place was actually bigger than I expected (I thought it would just be a basica pizzeria) and had a bit of nostalgia to it which I thought was really cool. The hostess seated us right beside a ton of NY Yankees memoribilia and autograph pictures....a HUGE PLUS for me :-) We started off with an order of bruschetta which was excellent and extremely fresh, then moved into a 14" margherita pie to share which was more than enough. The crust was cooked to perfection and the sauce was absolutely to die for. One quick tip is to be ready to see alot of tourists at this place snapping alot of pictures. It didn't really bother me much but I can see how it would make some uncomfortable.
