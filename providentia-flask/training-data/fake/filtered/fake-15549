Burger is much better than Five-Guys.  The meat is better quality and they'll cook it rare.  That's the good news.  The bad news is that these burgers are not cheap ($6.25 minimum, and always paying for cheese even when you don't want it) and they're really too big for lunch. My lunch with fries (no drink) came to nearly nine bucks. I thought the fries were only so-so.  Five-Guys wins this one, IMHO
