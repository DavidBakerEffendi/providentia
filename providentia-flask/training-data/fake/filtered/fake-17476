There are so many great, detailed and informative reviews about this place that I just want to cover the basics here: 1. If you haven't been yet and you like meatballs, don't walk, run! (And grab your two closest friends on the way.) 2. For the best way to enjoy the meatballs and sauce of your choice, get the smash. Their sliders are too small and the heroes too big. I feel like the smash just nails the bread/meatball/sauce ratio. 3. Leave room for dessert, and try the ginger snap and peanut butter ice creams with a cookie of your choice. 4. Go home happy.
