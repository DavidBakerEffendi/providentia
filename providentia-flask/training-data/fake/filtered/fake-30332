Decent pizza, AWFUL service. My friends and I had to wait for more than 30 minutes to be seated... beside the fact that there were at least 10 available tables (without reservation)! Hostess and waiters literally ignored us when we got there, and they didn't explain why we had to wait so long. Beside a friendly and professional barman, the service was very disappointing. I hope they will improve.
