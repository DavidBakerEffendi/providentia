A friend made a reservation for her birthday a week in advance. She also called the day before to confirm. Upon arriving at the restaurant- no one had a record of her reservation. Our party of 12 people was put at a makeshift series of tables squeezed together. That's not the worst of it. Appetizers arrived with no plates for us to eat from. An order for a neighboring table was put in front of us and then removed and given to the correct table after my friend had already cut a portion of the pizza that wasn't really hers! Â I will never go back.
