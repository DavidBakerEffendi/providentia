do not i mean do not go to this deli unless you want to pay double the price compared to any other deli in town. the food is louzy. the service is slow. the prices chancge day by day. one day you get a bagel its one price the next day its a dollar more. prices change daily in this place. i personally will not step foot in this deli ever again
