I've worked for Miss Rachel in the past and so I've eaten a lot of her food.  It is all amazing!  I'm vegan but I've served Rachel's food to all kinds of eaters and everyone is equally impressed.  Rachel can do all kinds of cuisine American, Asian, Mexican, gluten-free, soy-free, you name it.  Rachel loves to cook and she loves to make people happy with her gift!   And, if anyone is interested to know, Rachel is also a super fair employer and we can never have too many of those in the world!  A meal at Miss Rachel Pantry is a vote for fair treatment for *all* animals!
