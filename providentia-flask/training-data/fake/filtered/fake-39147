I do not understand all the hype. I have gone there twice. The 1st time was about a year ago. The burger was OK at best. I went about a week ago and the burger tasted like seasoned cardboard. Maybe if I would have gotten cheese with the burger it would have been better. I give the place 2 stars because I think the design of establishment is pretty cool. You want a good burger go to Good Dog or Butcher and Singer.
