Found this gem browsing Yelp and it definitely lived up to the hype. I rolled w/ the Catfish, Tiger Shrimp, and Pork Belly sandwiches. Shrimp was my least fav, with the pork belly sewing up the #1 spot. The only bone I have to pick is the fact that they are not open late night, but then again that's probably beneficial to my health.
