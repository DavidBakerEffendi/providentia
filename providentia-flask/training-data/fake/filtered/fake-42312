I like to eat dumpling in every restaurant. some of my friends tell me that it is good to try Prosperity Dumpling. last weekend i went to Chinatown with couple typical Chinese and had a lunch in Prosperity Dumpling. $1 for 5 chives and pork Fried Dumplings $2.50 for 8 boil pork & cabbage dumpling Both were wonderful , very tasty. All of us were amazed at how good they were. And we agree on that no other one an beat the taste and price.
