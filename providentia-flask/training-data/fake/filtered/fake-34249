Had dinner here a couple weeks back with my friend and we both loved it. .  The prices are very reasonable especially for a restaurant carrying a Michelin star.  We both had one of the chef specials (a step down from Omakase but a similar chef's choice meal) and were very impressed with the quality.  We will be back.
