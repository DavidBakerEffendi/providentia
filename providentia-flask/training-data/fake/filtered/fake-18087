Recently, my boyfriend discovered he needed to completely change his diet to gluten-free and lactose-free. This was our first time dining out with his new allergy. Craig, the manager, was fabulous. He was so helpful in not only showing my boyfriend all of the options on the menu, but also instructed him of specific foods he can purchase at the supermarket. This is all new to both of us, so it was wonderful to have someone so kind and helpful in this journey. As a newbie, he made our experience dining out wonderful. We will definitely be back because not only does the place offer a full bar, with gluten-free beer, but delicious entrees for both parties.
