Sounds like melissa l. has a vested interest in Dickie Dee's. The neighborhood where Frank's is located is not nearly the nightmarish environment she describes. I live there now and have for several years and I've never felt unsafe. Now as far as the pizza goes, being from Brooklyn, born and raised, I know a few things about pizza. Franks' pizza, as well as their entire menu, is the ONLY pizzeria in the area that even comes close to authentic. There are many in the area, including Dickie Dee's (sesame seeds on the crust?), that have perfectly fine fare. But none are in the same league as Frank's.
