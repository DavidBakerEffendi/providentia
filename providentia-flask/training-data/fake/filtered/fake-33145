This place is freakin' delicious!  And you'll notice that half of the diners on any given night are Asian (mainly Japanese).  The prices are reasonable and the Spaghetti served with the garishly large Kraft Parmesean cheese bottle is such a guilty pleasure.  The Pork belly and cabbage, shrimp tempura and yellow fin fish are among some of the most amazing dishes!  Also the momo sour drinks are deceptively potent!  Go here, but be prepared to wait at least half an hour and as long as an hour and a half!
