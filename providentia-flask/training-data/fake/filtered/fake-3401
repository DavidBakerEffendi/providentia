Riposo 72 is a great little inexpensive pizza oriented wine bar in the neighborhood.  It has always gotten a good crowd but has been getting even better recently since Jennifer Klein's Wine & Roses, a couple of blocks away was inexplicably taken over by amateur investors with new inexperienced management and a severely downgraded food menu.  Jennifer's entire staff of 15 walked out in support of Jennifer leaving nothing the same of the once classy establishment except for the four walls.  Oh, yeah, did I mention Riposo's pizza is flat and crusty, and they serve some high end liquor?  Yummy for an early snack.
