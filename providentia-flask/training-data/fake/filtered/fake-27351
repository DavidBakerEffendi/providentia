Bed Stuy deliciousness.  If you're in a hurry here, you'll lose your mind.  If you're up for a leisurely meal, want to chat and relax over some yummy food, then you're set.  Lovely place with a European sensibility...You can pretend you've gone to Italy and that someone was kind enough to print up the menu in English for you.  Never felt rushed here, even on really busy evenings.  I've never been done wrong by the Fritto Misto (always perfectly battered and crisply fried and never overcooked and chewy) or the Hot Coppa pizza (oh, quite the contrary, I dream about this pizza sometimes).  Never had a dessert or coffee based beverage here that wasn't a delight.  My husband and I have had great stuff off of their specials and other parts of the menu - but these orders are placed rarely -  cuz we're under some kind of spell and keep coming back for our faves.
