There are not a lot new business springing up in the Claremont area, so when a new place to eat pops up... you have to try it. In the case of Hench Dogs, 10,000 taste buds, WAY up! First, let's start with the dogs. Nathan hot dogs! With a foundation like that it's tough to go wrong. Steamed or grilled it just doesn't get any better. Add to that a full 25 toppings to choose from and I can honestly say I've never left this place without a mouth full of happiness. If you're not in the mood for a dog, I recommend the Chili/Cheese baked potatoes...goes great with one of their Italian Sausages. The meatball subs are also superb. Messy with just the right amount of tang for the buck. I was most impressed with the owner/operator. Personable and funny. You can tell he loves what he does and it shows not only in the food but the individual service I've received. Great location right on Route 12, plenty of parking, outdoor seating (rare for a stand) and even better pricing make Hench Dogs a must for anybody's budget and lunch time fill up.
