Sushi Yasuda is very good. However, I wonder, for the price, is it really the BEST Sushi in NYC? I feel like it is very good, but for the price I don't think it is worth it. There are a ton of very good sushi restaurants with fresh, tasty fish. I don't think Yasuda is the end all, be all of NYC Sushi.
