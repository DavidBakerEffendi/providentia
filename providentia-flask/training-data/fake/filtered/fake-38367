Just AWESOME! Was visiting from Franklin County, VA ( Home of the Bondurant Family) and stumbled upon this bar because of its name and links back to my hometown. Not only was the atmosphere and setting perfect, but the selection and service exceeded all expectations. Had a great time! Can't wait to visit again-
