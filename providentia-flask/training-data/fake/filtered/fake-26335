Pizza is so-so! But the NASTY ATTITUDE you get there is UNACCEPTABLE! Over 3 decades of BAD ATTITUDES! The only reason it has survived is because of school kids that don't know what good pizza taste like! Do yourself a favor and drive to LAKE AVE you have 2 EXCELLENT PIZZA PLACES IN COLONIA! Another time, I went there for a charity donation & the middle aged guy that has been there forever, took my flyer & told me "he was going to give it to the owner". He couldn't even wait til I walked out of the door before crumbling it up & tossing it in the trash! HOW DISRESPECTFUL! NO COMMUNITY ANYTHING FROM THAT SHACK!
