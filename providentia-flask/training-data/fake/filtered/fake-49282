My boyfriend and I would order classic sandwiches and bubble tea every weekend during the summer and they were always delicious, one might even say addictive. The sandwiches had just the right amount of meat and veggies and were just really freaking good all over. The bubble tea was excellent as well (Taro, black tea, jasmine, yum!) but yes, a little over priced. However I cant give this place a good rating at this point in time because for the past 2 months their sandwiches have sucked! I only get about half way through before I just throw it out. The quality has went waaaay down. The meat is dry and the veggies have no flavor. On more than one occasion m bread was burnt,. But of course I keep ordering every now and then hoping that they will get back to the quality they had during the summer. Going to try the new Hancos that opened on Montague st. and hope that place still lives up to its name.
