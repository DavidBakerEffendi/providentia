EWW !!! worst FOOD EVER!! I saw the owner literally throw out his ciggie and start on a sandwich... no gloves or handwashing! I also heard several people got food poisoning from there! stay AWAY In reply to your comment: As for the food poisoining. I know of several people who have told me about. Finally, for the other review, you're right. I tried Saads and Hummus both in the same month because they are the two restaurants that serve arabic food. One that I loved and one that I hated What's wrong with that? Also, I'm not really liking the attitude. I sensed that too during my visit. A little cold just because I don't like the food?
