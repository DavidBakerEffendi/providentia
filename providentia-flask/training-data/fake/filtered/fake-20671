This place is totally under the radar and really great. The oysters were huge, the cocktail sauce and mignonette were perfect, and the littlenecks were so sweet. I would also recommend the fried oysters, mussels, scallops Dave's way and the lobster roll. Waitstaff are awesome and treat their regulars well. Â I'm looking forward to coming back.
