A restaurant that truly lives up to the hype.  When you read how everything was amazing, as hard as it is to believe.....it's true.  From the quality of each plate, to the presentation, to the staff who are both down to earth yet rapid and dignified with the service, everything is top notch.  This is an ideal location for wine lovers, especially those with a wine cellar, to bring some of our best wines.   Our meal was a party of 9, in which everyone left raving.   Perhaps they can find a way to finagle some outside seating to be able to allow more people to enjoy the magic the kitchen and staff create?    I perceive that there is so much demand for Bibou's creations that ownership could open a second location (Bibou two?) with outside seating so that everyone can enjoy their creations without having to wait weeks for reservations.
