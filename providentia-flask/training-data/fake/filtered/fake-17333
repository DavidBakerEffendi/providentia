Portions are small, which makes for the "decent" pricing ($6-$8).  The more expensive specialty rolls($9-$15) are still small portioned (5 cuts per roll). They charge 50¢ for any type of sauces outside of soy - including spicy mayo & sesame ginger dressing.  The one server they had on staff was friendly although the space was ridiculously small & once the owners came out to "help" with the service the poor treatment began.  The food is just not as great as the recommended reviews makes it seem.  The kani was mushy and the shrimp tempura roll had nothing else in it except cucumber - this was my second visit thanks to groupon and a friend who was dying to try them, unfortunately I cannot say I will be returning.
