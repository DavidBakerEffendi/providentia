I am a person of Indian origin with fastidious tastes for Indian food. My several experinces at Mehek, both in house dining and catering has been splendid. Mehek's food and quality is awesome. Their fine manners and polite demeanour is a breath of fresh air. I rate it as one of the best Indian restaurants i have ever been to in my last one year in the Princeton neghiborhood. Well done and keep it up.
