Tommy has 'one' of the best pork sandwiches around.I grew up on these damn things back when Tommy was on 10th and Oregon and he still kicks out the best quality food.There was nothing like getting out of school and hitting DiNic's for a pork and a root beer. Keep up the great food Tom!      Niccademo
