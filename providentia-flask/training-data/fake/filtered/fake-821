Great and Classic Sub location. When you 1st walk into Stash's it is a feeling of walking into a little bit of the past and NJ Folklore especially once you look at the wall and see amount of High-end credentials this Sub House has rightfully so it seems. Getting a classic sub on a soft roll with a Clinton Iced Tea is a staple in my childhood and manyin NJ no matter the generation. Good Prices have gone up very little over the years but still great value for the final product Overall: With the personal feel and almost 0 wait time this is truly a place to stop by and pick something up.
