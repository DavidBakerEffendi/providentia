My new favorite spot to eat Sri Lankan food. Tastes just like my mom's hommeade food. I usually order my fish lunch box which includes fish curry, rice, and a variety of vegetables (usually 3 different kinds). I have tried other dishes as well and they are just as good. The owners are very nice. They do free delivery. I usually take my food to go. Great place, great taste!
