This is my second time here and it definitely did not disappoint.  So far the two sandwiches I have had, Echo-Ella's Flight and their signature Flying Meatball Sandwich, have been very tasty and, contrary to other reviewers, left me feeling very full and satisfied.  If you haven't been in yet, definitely worth the trip.  You won't be sorry. On a side note, be ready to buy more than just lunch.  Somehow each time I have been in there, I always walk out with some extra goodies that I definitely did not need, but they are too good to pass up.
