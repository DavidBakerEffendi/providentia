I went there with two friends and thoroughly enjoyed the evening. The place was packed despite it being a rainy Monday, but we were seated promptly for our 8pm reservation. Each of us ordered one appetizer and one entree, and their sweetbread appetizer & escargot appetizers must have been one of the best I've had in the city. Their seafood ceviche, however, was a disappointment both on the plate and on our palates... It's not their specialty, after all. The entrees were very good, but not as memorable as the appetizers, I wished I had ordered two appetizers instead... We were also excited to read great reviews about their desserts, but the two we shared were a bit too sweet and kind of boring. All 3 of us loved their espresso and coffee, as well as the festive atmosphere and great service. Although I prefer to go somewhere more quiet for a date, it's a great place to dine with a group of friends. With a bottle of very tasty and very reasonable red wine (around $40), we spent about $80 per person after tip. Not cheap, but certainly well worth it for their solid performance on food, wine, and service.
