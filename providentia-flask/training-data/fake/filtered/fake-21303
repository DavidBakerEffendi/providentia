It's rare that I go somewhere and then I want to tell everyone I meet about it but this place was great. The food was really amazing. We ordered way too much and ate for 3 days of leftovers. The only reason I am taking off 1 star is for the service not the food. I saw two couples argue over their bill. Maybe it was just busy but all the tables that were drinking had some "mistakes" that needed to be corrected like charging more for Happy hour drinks and so on. Our server didn't bring us the food in the order we asked for. We basically got apps and entrees all at once. But it was worth it for the food and I am picky about service.
