Nice renovated space in Mill Hill.  Very intimate feel.  TV in the front dining area and more relaxed private area in the back that  usually plays light jazz.  The food is delicious.  They took the menu from Amefika's and added some special touches from his chef daughter.  Good soul food, good fish sandwiches and they sell shrimp and grits, chicken and waffles and all the soul food favorites like macaroni and cheese, collard greens and potato salad.  Finally a place in Trenton!  Oh, and they sell good breakfast too.....you can finally get beef or turkey bacon!!  I'll definitely be going back.  5 stars!!
