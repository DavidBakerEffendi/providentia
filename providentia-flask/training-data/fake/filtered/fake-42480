Hands down the best coffee in New Haven. I haven't tried their other coffee drinks, but if they're anything like the basic black coffee then it'll be great. The people are exceptionally friendly and the atmosphere (no electronics) is so relaxing. It's great seeing people enjoy exceptional coffee while reading a book / newspaper or actually interacting with friendly people. Do yourself a favor and go!
