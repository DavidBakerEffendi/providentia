I am from the Hartford area, and rarely make it to New Haven. However, after attending the Stone Hearth soft opening night, I knew I would have to make a return trip! After a surprisingly easy trip from Hartford (no more than 40 minutes, tops!), my group of three was seated at a spacious booth. It was a beautiful Sunday morning, and we were delighted to see that our booth had sliding windows next to us! The electrical outlets at each booth are also a plus. The service was excellent, and the chefs accommodated our request for egg white frittatas. The Lorraine frittata uses Gruyere cheese, yum! The group also shared a few breakfast pizzas (something I would have never thought of, but loved!) and the AMAZING rice krispy coated french toast with nutella and whipped cream. We practically fought over the last piece of the french toast! There is something for everyone - lighter options for the health conscious and decadent items "From the Grill" for those treating themselves. Brunch is served Saturdays and Sundays from 9am-3pm, and I highly recommend. See you soon, Stone Hearth! ... and I will definitely be requesting the Georgia Peach cocktail from opening night.
