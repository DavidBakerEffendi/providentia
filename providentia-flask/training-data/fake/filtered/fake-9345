So I have been to the saladworks on rt 33 many times.  I love going there for their salads, but have also always felt they were a little pricey. Today I was at this saladworks, and ordered the soup an salad combo which is $9 for a soup and half salad   I ordered a salad and the Maryland crab chowder. I tasted the soup, and I can honestly say that it was the worst soup I have ever had. It was so overly loaded with salt to the Point that i was unable to eat it. I went to the counter and asked if I could trade the soup on for another one, and the girl behind the counter just said "no". This wasnt a complaint of me not liking it, it was a complaint about the soup being inedible. It tasted like it was 3 days old, and like I said, so salty that I doubt anyone would have even able to stomach it. So I basically paid $9 for a side salad. I will not be returning to this saladworks again. It has always been convenient but after this experience, I will take my business elsewhere.
