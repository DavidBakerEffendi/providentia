Modo Mio being a 5 star is a no brainer. The food is completely awesome. I had one of the best meal in Philly with their tasting menu - $35 well spent! The portion may look small, but after 3 courses and dessert, you will find it just nice to enjoy the taste itself. Appetizer, they have an above average bread (I'm personally quite picky about bread in particular), a bit over toasted but taste nice. You literally can't go wrong for the next two courses, 'cause almost everything is good! I came with two friends on two different occasions and we ended up ordering 8 different dishes, and they all rocked! Rabbit ravioli and trout were both perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the pasta was simply delicious. Panna cotta was also very balanced, just sweet enough to allow you to enjoy the flavor of the fruit. During the meal, service were really great, with the waiter checking on us frequently to make sure we enjoyed our meals. Only tiny little setback though - it's a cash only place, and carrying around 50 bucks isn't my habit. Still, the food itself is enough to make this place a 5 star.
