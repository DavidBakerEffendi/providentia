fabulous place! country side decor picked with the eye of the love for it. smart, handsome attentive waiters. i love the hight ceiling vibe and cozy set up. the pizzas are different and fabulous. so are the salads and the fish. you just want to live close by and be there all the time if you could. its very smart and welcoming and really cultured italian! nothing fake just real and with the time and totally hip.
