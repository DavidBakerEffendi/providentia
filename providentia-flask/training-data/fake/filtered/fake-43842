I go to this diner often and its pretty good I've never had a complaint. Good food (I usually order either breakfast food, like eggs and waffles. or a burger or a chicken salad) and good service for a reasonable price. I'm usually full after a meal, so I haven't been able to try the dessert yet but it looks delish
