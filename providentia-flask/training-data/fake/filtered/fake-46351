We were back recently after 2 years and have to say the quality seems to have receded. The mussels in vinegar was much too salty, the deviled eggs were underwhelming, and the cheese wrapped in prosciutto wasn't good at all. The squid ink rice was the redeeming dish of the night, and the service was excellent.
