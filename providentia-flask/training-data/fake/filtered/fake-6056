Had two different pies tonight and they were outrageously good - like, I-Can't-Believe-This-Came-From-East-Falls good! I didn't eat in, but when I picked up, I noticed that the interior was welcoming. The staff I dealt with were very nice and knowledgeable about the menu. I am keeping my fingers crossed for this place!
