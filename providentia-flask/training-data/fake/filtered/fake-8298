I went there on Tuesday evening for some of their chicken wings.  The service was great but the chicken was not.  My fries came out 10 minutes before my chicken, and when it got there it looked as if it had been fried last week and reheated.  Needless to say it's Friday and I'm still sick from the food.  Bad chicken or dirty hands?????
