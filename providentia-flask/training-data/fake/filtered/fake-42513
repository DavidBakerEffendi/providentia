I'd give it 5 stars, but that always triggers the dreaded Yelp filter. Excellent roast beef sandwiches. Provolone makes them even better. The gravy fries are out of this world. There isn't much in the way of atmosphere because it's a neighborhood bar, but I don't care. I go for the food. The seating area in the back has 2 insanely powerful air conditioners which anyone who hates dealing with this heat and humidity will appreciate. Service is always friendly. Prices are very reasonable.
