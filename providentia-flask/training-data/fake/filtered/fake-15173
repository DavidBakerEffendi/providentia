Food is excellent.  Start with the lamb lollipops and then a wonderful salad with skirt steak on top.  Then top it all off with a Lamington desert.  We have gone twice and would go more often if it wasn't for the fact we life quite a distance away and have to cross two bridges to get there.   Well worth it!  Keep up the great job guys!
