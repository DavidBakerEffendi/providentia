If it weren't for our jarring experience with service last night, this place would have been without a doubt 5 stars. We've been here before, where food was impeccable, and service blew us away. It was the most chill group of guys and considerate to boot. Realized the mountain of food we ordered and helped us move to a larger table. ----Last night was a complete 180 to shit---- My boyfriend and I wanted to celebrate our last day of vacation with one of our favorite meals. It's hard enough for us to get the same time off with him working chef hours, so this experience was overwhelmingly awful. Along with 2 friends, we were really looking forward to a Bunker blowout 8:45pm, we were told it would 15-20mins for a table. No problem. Guy was nice enough to even point out potential tables that were wrapping up. 45mins later, tables still sitting on their checks, texting, and no one came out to check on us or even offer menus. We continued to wait patiently though, salivating over the idea of food. Around an hour, I finally walk in to ask how much longer since it's nearing 10pm, when they close. Same host guy from earlier meets me, walks out with me, and tells us he's going to take our order now since the kitchen is closing. We're staring dumbstruck at this guy. How does he expect us to order when we haven't even seen menus? Haven't even been offered drinks. So he brings a few menus out, then says nonchalantly and quite impatiently, "you have 4 mins". I've never been more furious and insulted from any dining experience. To have waited patiently and even initiated checking in to be considerate of the kitchen, this was the rudeness we received in return. We were so uncomfortable, that even after waiting for over an hour, we left. It's never been truer in that moment how a place can leave a bad taste in your mouth.
