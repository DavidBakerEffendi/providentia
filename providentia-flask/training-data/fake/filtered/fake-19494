I worked with the owner at a community service project, and she seemed nice enough. The area is quirky, full of young hipsters, and the place got good reviews. I took my girlfriend. On arrival, the bar was loud and boisterous, and no wait-staff were visible. People seemed to be enjoying beer, food, but how? After waiting awkwardly for 2-3 minutes at the door, we were starting to get strange looks. I tried to get the attention of the bartender but he glanced over me twice. I finally yelled "excuse me!" and got his attention. I asked if we just seat ourselves - he rolled his eyes and said yes, as if it should have been obvious. We sat at a table without service for five minutes and just left. The food is supposed to be great and the beer selection fantastic, but the music was Â loud and the service non-existent. A side note about this area: Northern Liberties used to be a poorer, immigrant (primarily russian/ukranian/etc - look for the older churches) area that felt industrial decline. It was then primarily poor and black, and to some extent it still is. Because the property values are so depressed, young people are flocking to the area and bringing a strange culture with them. The "hipsters" seem to mix young bicycle culture, some of the san-fran scene, an elitist attitude. More often than not they are moderately wealthy, consumers of products marketed towards their "image", and are full of contradictions. There is a prevailing attitude that if you are not part of that "scene", you are not worthy of the time of day by those "in the know". Screw it. South Philly is just as ugly and much more honest.
