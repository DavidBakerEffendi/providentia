My boyfriend and I had dinner here for the first time last Friday night, around 9pm. First impression - loved the adorable outdoor seating. The bistro is housed in a beautiful brownstone on the corner of Lenox and 122, and the seating area is quiet, unobtrusive and lovely. Second impression - as the outdoor seating area was full by the time we arrived, we were seated inside. While the indoor space has a lot of potential, it's clear that they are still working on the overall look and feel. It's warmly lit and has a lot of potential, but the tables are slightly too large for the space, and there are too few small details - the table are bare (no flowers, candles, etc), minimal artwork on the walls, etc. However, whatever was lacking in atmosphere was made up for with the food - AMAZING! My boyfriend ordered one of the nightly specials (roasted chicken) and I chose the salmon. Both were excellent. So good that we are still talking about it. We'll definitely be back, and we're looking forward to seeing how the inside decor comes into it's own.
