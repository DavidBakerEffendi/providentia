A small, crowded restaurant with horrific waits. Food is phenomenal: meat and cheese plate may be the best anywhere. Beef carpaccio is rich, coq au vin is hearty, seasonal veggies are fresh and deliciously prepared. Dishes are small and shareable. Wine list is varied and interesting. Service is pleasant.
