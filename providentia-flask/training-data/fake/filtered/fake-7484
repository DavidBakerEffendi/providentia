Excellent service. We called to make a reservation, but were told no tables were available all night. But, we were told to check back at 5 p.m. to see if there was a cancellation. Sure enough, we got a table at 9:30 and proceeded to have the most bitchin roast chicken ever. The atmosphere is great and lively, and the table staff are real professionals. I'm just sad we don't live closer so I could dine here more often!
