I've eaten a lot of shwarma in my day and this place is up at the top of my list! The hummus and babaganoosh are silky smooth but the real kicker is the tahini sauce blended with the seasoned spices on the Schwarma platter. The food and value are all part of the small family operation that feels just like the name a falafel hut that just happens to be located in the heart of a high end suburb.
