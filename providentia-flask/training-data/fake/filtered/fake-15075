Am I missing something with this one? Not to rain on anyone's parade but this place is pretty awful.  I am gluten free and have had wonderful GF dishes in NYC but this just doesn't do it.  The pizza is overpriced and bland and the paninis are pretty terrible. The rissotoria is not well made and again overpriced.  The space is crowded and unwelcoming, as are the staff.  If you want great gluten free options (better priced with a cooler and warmer space) check out Pala, which is awesome by the way!  17 bucks for a personal thi crust pizza?  Really?  I usually don't do reviews but I felt the need to reach out to fellow gluten free diners and tell them about better options.  Better yet, check out Keste across the street which serves gluten free pizza on mondays and tuesdays. By all means though, check it out for yourself and decide with your own palate.
