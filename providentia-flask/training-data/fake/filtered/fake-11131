Recently visited this  Irish establishment,  Found it to be a hidden treasure in New Haven. I had lunch and the shepards pie ,only to die for a young gentleman by the name of frank served me with a true irish accent   friendliness and smile to go along with it . I cant wait to be passing through New Haven again to revisit Anna Liffeys
