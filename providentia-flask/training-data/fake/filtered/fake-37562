Not only is the food great, but the service is impeccable. They are super friendly ALL the time and even remember you by name! I love every sandwich I've had, and I go there a lot! Lunch is busy but always efficient and I am never disappointed by what I get. There is great variety and everything is always fresh and so good! Being from the neighborhood, I was so excited to find a new place to frequent for a delicious and healthy meal! It is such a great addition to Tribeca and I love having it as my "go to" when I want a good eat.
