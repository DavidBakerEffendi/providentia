I am a very picky sushi eater, and I thought this restaurant was excellent, with absolutely NO complaints!!  Quaint but authentic, warm-feeling ambiance.  Hidden from Route 1 traffic, so ideal for deterring obnoxious Rutgers drunks from ruining a nice dinner experience.  The food was shockingly amazing as well!  Very unique signature fusion roll selection and tasty as can be!  Parking tight, but once again, keeps crowds to a minimum which I personally like.  I will be back very soon with my wife, to enjoy the wonderful food and service.  5 star+ Michael & Victoria R.
