The best cheesesteak that Â I ever had. It reminds me of my youth when I always ate cheesesteaks at the eagles games. The combination of the whiz and the fried onions is delicious. In my opinion better than John's roast pork because the bread here is just to my liking, as oppose to johns Italian bread semolina(even though everything else is delicious).A must have.
