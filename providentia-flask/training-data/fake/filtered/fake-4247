We went midweek. We weren't expecting it to be as big and cozy inside because it was in a small strip mall. We were pleasantly surprised. However, the place was empty with exception of a couple of small groups at the bar where we sat. Then we looked at the menu and noticed the prices were a bit high. We ordered 2 martinis which came in a small glasses. We got an artichoke app for $10.  The dip was served in a small bread bowl.  The pita chips were tasty, however they significantly outnumbered the small dip portion. We ordered a sausage and pasta dish entree and an eggplant rollatini app as an entree. I asked if the eggplant had the skin on it and the bartender checked with the chef who said it didn't. After our app, we waited for quite some time for the bartenders to notice our drinks were empty. There were about 6 people at the bar besides us and 2 bartenders.  They walked by us several times and passed the empty glasses pushed to the edge. Right before our meal came they acknowledged us and got us two glasses of wine.  My eggplant looked dry, and it was.  It had skin on it eventhough we were told it didn't.  The pasta and broccoli rabe dish was tasty but the broccoli rabe was gritty.  I ate half of my dish before we could flag a bartender for more marinara sauce.  Noone ever asked how our meals were and it took a long time to get our plates cleared, get a to go container and get the check. Overall, the atmosphere was nice but the service was poor, food adequate, and prices too high.  We won't be back.
