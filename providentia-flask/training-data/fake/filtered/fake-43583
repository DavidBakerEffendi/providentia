I dined here last Friday night, and I have to say, the hype is for real about this place. I came with a large group, and it was a busy night, but clearly, they know how to handle the pressure.  Our food was perfectly spiced(even for those in our party who are a bit spice-averse).  The spinach chaat was to die for, as was the naan!!  Our server, Josh, was extremely friendly, well-informed, and in general, added to our experience!  I will definitely be back, and will tell friends!! One note....it does get a bit loud, so if you're looking for a quiet dining experience, this is not the place to go on a weekend.
