LaScala's was one of the best Italian restaurant's within it's price range in Philadelphia. I've visited LaScala's three times now, each time for dinner. For an appetizer, I typically go with the bruschetta, which I find to be exceptional there. It has an excellent flavor and it is well worth ordering each time you visit. For an entree, I've enjoyed the chicken parmigiana twice and I have been very happy each time. The chicken is topped with delicious sauce and just writing about it makes my mouth water. For dessert, the canoli's are killer! This restaurant is terrific overall and I can't wait to make another trip back.
