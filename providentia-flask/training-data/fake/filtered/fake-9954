I really wanted to love this restaurant!  The decor was nice and the service was good.  The crab cake appetizer would have tasted great without the pork belly since it had great flavors on its own.  The flavors on the entrees we ordered were good, but the cuts of meat were a bit too fatty for our taste.  The desserts were not memorable.  As another reviewer said the donuts were four small, hard pieces of dough that were hard to chew.  The prices were rather high for the quality of the meats we had.  I would rather have had better quality meat and smaller portions.  We may visit again, but probably won't be back often.
