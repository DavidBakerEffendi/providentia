I stumbled upon this website trying to find out how late Oasis is open, and could not read these negative reviews without adding my two cents. Classifying a falafel as "Middle Eastern" is like saying rice is Asian.  Oasis offers a Persian style falafel, and is authentic in that regard.  They put red cabbage on the falafel because that is Persian cuisine, not because they are cheap (as suggested by another review). Most importantly, the food is excellent.  Falafel, shawarma, lamb, chicken, it's all good.  Yes it is cheap.  Yes it is fast.  Yes they are open late.  Yes they are right off the Bedord L.  But the reason I love this place is the food.
