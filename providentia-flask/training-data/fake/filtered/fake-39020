Wow!  I have heard about his place and finally decided to try it out. I wish I would have gone months ago. Several wraps to choose from, I tried the Philly jalapeño in a spinach wrap and was amazed. They also have many vegetarian selections. I will be back in a few weeks and will definitely be back to try another selection.
