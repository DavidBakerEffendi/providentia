stopped in here during a recent stay at a hotel in hartford upon word of mouth. A bit of a walk like 10 minutes but worth it. Food is awesome! top notch bar pub food. drinks are like any other bar. bartenders are hotttttttttt and friendly. Loved this place! The food is so finger lickin good I could eat there every nite im in hartford and never get sick of it
