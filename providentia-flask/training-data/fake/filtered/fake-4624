Fantastic meal. I'll definitely be back. we ate there more than a month ago so I don't remember exactly what we ate, just that it was fantastic. The small sized dining area is warm and intimate. Service is rather friendly and knowledgeable. Â Eager to sit outside in the patio for our next visit. Looking forward.
