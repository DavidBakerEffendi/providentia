We were treated like family!!  We came all the way from Staten Island to Brooklyn our old neighborhood to celebrate my son's graduation from HVAC school.  I had eaten in Bogota Latin Bistro before with my daughter and I really enjoyed the food.  We all decided to celebrate there and we were not disappointed.   From the minute we walked in we felt so welcomed.  The yound lady servering us was Daniella and she was great!  The food is totally full of flavor and the mojitos we had were awesome.  My favorite empanada was the one with bacalao.  You must save room for there deserts, I had the smores empanada with vanilla icecream which was so delish!!! Also I want to mention that the fry cheesecake was a hit in our table too.   I will have my sister day next time at Bogota Latin Bistro!!!
