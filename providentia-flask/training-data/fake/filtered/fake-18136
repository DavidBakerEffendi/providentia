I found myself last night in Montclair, New Jersey, for the first time in a while. I was having dinner with two non-vegan friends and we decided to try MUNDO VEGAN. Simply put: it was terrific.  The food is very high quality and carefully prepared. There is a Caribbean theme but the menu, although small, is varied. Two of us had the organic black eyed pea stew and one had the pernil Caribbean style. We also got the raw curtido salad as a side and liked it so much that we ordered more.  My non-vegan friends were thoroughly impressed and we made plans to go again next week. Yelp is not current with the MUNDO VEGAN opening times as they are now open on Wednesday night and open later on Sunday. The co-owners, Fanny and Tracey, are really nice people and committed vegans. In my view, MUNDO VEGAN is as good as *any* vegan place in Manhattan. Try it. You'll love it. Gary L. Francione AbolitionistApproach.com
