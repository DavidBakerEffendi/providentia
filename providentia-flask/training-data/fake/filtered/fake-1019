Ever since I moved to Brooklyn - well, two months ago - from out West, I"ve been looking for some great barbecue, and I've finally found it! Best brisket this side of Texas, and the perfect place to watch the games. Great, spicy collared greens, good beer selection, and tasty Mac ' N Cheese. When it's nice out, the outdoor seating can't be beat. Morgan's is my new addiction.
