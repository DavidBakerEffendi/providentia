Some background: Great Wall of China underwent some expensive renovation recently after splitting with Hong Kong Grocery (which is now located in the adjacent shop house). Food tend to be oily, and overly deep-fried. Portion is average. Be wary when the fish comes with a lot of tomato or soy sauce. Think about it: Why would they cover up the taste of fish, if it were fresh? Main customer base appears to be the Chinese students from Helen Hadley Hall (Yale's dorm for grad students), which is located a block away. Few other people have reason to dine there. Personally, I prefer Ivy Noodle, East Melange, and York St noodle house. To host visitors and parents, I bring them to Royal Palace.
