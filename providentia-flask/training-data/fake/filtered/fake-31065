First time at Prime 16 and it was great. Never left a restaurant review before, but dinner was so enjoyable I had to share.  Portobello stuffed mushrooms were awesome.  Dared to try fried jalapeno, not as scary hot as I feared and massive serving.  Maui burger on pretzel roll.  Tropical mayo? never heard of it, but found myself dripping every last drop on to my burger. Fallyn  was great with well chosen suggestions. Would go back there in a heartbeat!
