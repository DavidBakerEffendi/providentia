Went here for Easter brunch - Awesome!  Great service and loved the food.  High quality offerings and the selection appealed to our widely varied group.  Such a nice way to celebrate the day - our kids, us parents and the grandmas were all happy.  I want to have a party here - such a gorgeous place.   OK, Yelp wants specifics regarding photos - so many different rooms, one photo doesn't suffice.  I didn't take any of just the place, so can't post, but go see - each area has it's own lovely character.  Also, the attire at Easter brunch was dressy, but I think nice casual would also work on non-holidays.
