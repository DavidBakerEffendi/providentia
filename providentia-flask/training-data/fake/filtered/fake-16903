Although ilili didn't live up to Zaytinya, my favorite in DC, it was definitely the best Mediterranean I've had in New York. We started off with their plain hommus and warm puffy pita bread which was pretty good although not especially unique. Our appetizer of falafel was excellent, crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside, and I would definitely order it again. For dinner, we split the Kebab Kerez which is lamb and beef meatballs with cherry sauce and Chicken Shish Taouk which is grilled chicken. At the last minute, we also added warm eggplant which had a tamarind molasses sauce. The meatballs were phenomenal. I'm not the biggest lamb fan but the meat combination was great and the sauce was delicious. On the other hand, the chicken was a disappointment. It was insanely smokey and definitely won't be on the ordering list next time. Luckily, the eggplant held up to the rest of the meal. I was so glad I ordered it at the last minute. It may have been my favorite thing on the table and I definitely could have eaten 2 bowls of just eggplant on my own!
