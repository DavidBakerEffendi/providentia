There should be a minus star rating for restaurants like Hendrickson's. I would give it a minus 2. It's really a shame, too because this was my number one favorite restaurant in Bayonne before it changed hands last year. I used to frequent Hendrickson's at least a couple of times per month and the former owner (I believe her name was Susan) was very friendly and greeted us like old friends. Very warm and welcoming. The food used to be top notch and service was very good. My last visit (truly my last) was disappointing to say the least. Less then stellar service (we had to ask another server to find ours), and the food was had me wishing we had chosen a different place. Really a shame that this place has gone down so much. Particularly as it has seen much, much better days.
