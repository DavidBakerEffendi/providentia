The food here is good, and the baked goods are always fresh. Their dinner menu is a good size and is pretty varied. The cod fritters were amazing, the artichoke salad is fresh & delicious and for the entree I'm a bigger fan of their pasta than their meat dishes. The decor is really cute and the atmosphere was laid back. The waitress was really attentive, and they didn't rush us out. One of my neighborhood favs!
