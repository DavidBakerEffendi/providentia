Very disappointing experience last night.  While I am understanding of a new restaurant finding its legs, an hour and a half waiting for entrees was totally unacceptable.  If anything, I under-exaggerate the time we waited as a table who sat more than 45 minutes after us was served before we were.  We were joking the food wasn't ours as they brought it over and unfortunately we were correct.  Waitress tried her best to handle it professionally (who we tipped handsomely for doing so), but ran out of things to say as to why our chicken, sea bass, and hangar steak were taking so long.  Biggest disappointment was that the manager failed to come over to us once during this time.  It's unrealistic to think a restaurant will never make a mistake or run behind, especially one just opening.  But how management approaches it (or does not) can turn a negative to a positive and speak volumes about the quality of the establishment.
