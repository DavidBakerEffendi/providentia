The only reason I gave 4 stars was because I haven't fully enjoyed the actual restaurant and service,  however the take-out experience was great.  Mac & Chesse was deeeelish, and the "All American" burger was nice and big and cooked to perfection.  The homemade chips were great- not stale as previously stated.  I usually don't even write reviews unless service is extraordinarily bad, but as a townie I'm psyched that a new, quality restaurant has called Nutley home!!  The take-out tupperware is the good sturdy kind too- a plus!
