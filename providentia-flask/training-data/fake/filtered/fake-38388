Been here a bunch of times, the beer selection is decent. They have a bunch of Hi-Def Tvs which is cool.As far as the food goes im sure they get it all in prefrozen. Granted ive only ate here a handful of times it's definitely not something to write home about. If you cant do basics like wings right then how can you build from there. Barstaff is another story. They need to refresh the staff badly, when your bartenders resemble the waitstaff at the now defunct midtown 4 diner you've got issues. On a high note they have my favorite beer Delirium Tremens and even though i felt like i was in the hull of a ship i didnt get seasick.
