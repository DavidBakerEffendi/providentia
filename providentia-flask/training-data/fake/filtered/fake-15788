Place was just a few doors down from our hotel & I wanted a quick bite before the theatre. The selection of pizzas on display looked yummy, so I chose a slice of veggie w/nice crisp crust & well-cooked veg piled high. It was loaded down & the slice overflowed the paper plate.Tasty yet not greasy. Interesting spices/seasonings set it apart from most pizza places.  It took only a few minutes for them to warm it up for me & bag it to go-with which I took a Corona from the fridge (I don't remember wine options). Total $8-ish. There were wooden stools along a wall counter that seated at most 4 ppl. It was standing room only while waiting for your order, so it's best to eat elsewhere. My friends were envious of my pre-show feast (BIG piece of pizza). It was a bit heavy on the garlic-any more & it would've been too much. It was good as I was consuming it, but afterward I felt like a huge garlic bulb. In spite of tooth brushing & mouthwash, I was concerned about offending the surrounding patrons at the theatre. After the slice I was on flavor overload & couldn't enjoy my apres-show dinner at The Playwright of french onion soup w/friends. If I'd made a milder flavor selection for after show, I might would've done ok. The french onion was competing w/my garlic-saturated tastebuds. The service was super-friendly and everything in the display case looked good. (Hot foods as well as desserts) Also there is an extensive menu from which you can order.  They close early for night owls-even in my small town we have pizza places open til 1-2am, but they open for breakfast early in the morning. I go to NYC every spring & will choose it again because good svc, good food, close to my hotel, good prices. Hint: don't throw your trash away in your hotel room or apartment-it's very aromatic!
