4 stars, but that's being a little generous. Food was for the most part excellent. I was raised by good southern women, so i know my barbeque. Both the ribs and the chicken were done just right. Didn't try the sauces, but my dinner date (a.k.a. Dad) loved them. French fries were perfect. And the red velvet cake...it took self-control to not lick the plate clean. That 4 star generosity is due to the service. Scatterbrained would be the nice way to put it. The waiter was super friendly, but it ended there. Brought me the wrong entree at first ("Oh sorry, I've been punching in those sandwiches all day."), but my correct meal was brought out seconds later. Asked for the other half of the meal (it was huge) to be wrapped up, never saw it again. Waiter went back to the kitchen for it, but it was too late. So they fired another half of the entree for me. Disappointed I didn't get that half order of fries back. On the bright side, I was only charged for the cheaper, incorrect entree. Great food, failure of a service. Oh well.
