Train your servers to listen to the customer. To hear the words and not make assumptions. servers this should ring true for you especially if someone elses experience with you  dictates your income. No you just showing up and looking pretty means nothing without a polite and classy demeanor. I had to basically almost yell at my server after asking her four times for a wet/clean rag to be brought to the table I was seated at. Well why the wet rag you ask? its something so out of the ordinary to order you say? The rag was so I could wipe the sticky residue  and mess off the table I was seated at. You could not see it so the oversight was no big deal. However the funny faces coupled with the dumb founded look that I recieved when I asked for a wet rag was too much.Ok maybe she wasn't used to being asked for that, maybe that was the problem? Well no she was just either rude, incompetent or another proud middle school graduate.  If your at work pay atention to what your customer is saying to you. The silly girl kept bringing me wet napkins, and gave off an extremely rude vibe. If your customer has to clean their own table then you probably shouldn't feel entitled to give rude looks or make stupid faces. Hire people that can listen when you put them in positions where 90 percent of their job is listening. I have been here 3 times and it is a mediocre mega bar but this last time will probably be the last visit.
