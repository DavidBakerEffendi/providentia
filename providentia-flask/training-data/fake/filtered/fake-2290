Blueberry pancakes-Amazing? No, but 10x's better than diner food and very yummy. Cheese Grits-yum SUGAR CURED BACON-AMAZING!!! YUMMY!!!!!!!!!!!!! 1 hour wait at 8:45am! Yikes! I went back and tried the Chocolate Chip pancakes, and it was way too rich for me. It was good, but I wanted to throw up. Too sweet. Stick with the Blueberry pancakes.
