Anyone looking for a decent late night bite (or anytime), after an exciting evening at NJPAC, SOPAC, Paper Mill Playhouse or anywhere in Essex county should try this place.  The menu choices, food presentation and service are really above par.   Their soups and desserts are excellent. A gourmet dining experience in NJ, at a welcome and unexpected location - on Bloomfield Ave. in Bloomfield.  Highly recommended!
