This is the BEST American/Chinese restaurant I've ever been to and I've been to A LOT. I don't know how people could give it any rating but a five star one. Every time I come here there are always Chinese customers. Being that their clientele is largely Chinese, must mean there's something authentic about the food. The ambience is sooo pleasant and cool. And very clean. I LOVE the atrium area with all the windows, so beautiful! And the service is incredible. Everyone that works there is sooo pleasant. Especially the girl at the front who greets you. And you can't beat the fact that its byob!!! Wine goes so well with all their delicious sauces. They also bring out the food in lightspeed time, but do not rush you while you enjoy the experience. Five stars, hands down. Would give it a six if I could.
