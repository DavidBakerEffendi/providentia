We ordered several dishes and it was either amazing (the majority) or so so: Lamb breast: Out of the world Duck breast: Out of the world Steak tartar: Fantastic Tako taco: Good, but not great Foie Gras Doughnut: Interesting, but didn't think the sweet and savory flavors go well in this dish. For the rest: Friendly staff, great drinks. Will def. come back!
