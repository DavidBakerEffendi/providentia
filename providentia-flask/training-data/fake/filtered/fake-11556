This rating is based on what i saw during visiting the bethwood.This place is indeed gorgeous. I must admit the guy that gave us the tour was excellent. Me and my fiancee has been looking around and by far these people performance just in how they present themselves is outstanding alone.however we do have some issues their prices are a little over the top we've been to serval venues who included everything in a package just like them who prices were much better me and my fiancee are not by far cheap people either but somethings are just outrages the reason for us being skeptical of the other venues that were giving a decent price because their presentation was horrible how u meet and greet people shows alot when having someones wedding in your hands...moving on I've been hearing that these people food Â is garbage i can't afford this paying 15,000 just for the ceremony and reception alone the food is a big factor also I've was Just diagnosed with a chronic illness and my meds has been running us alot of money they want at least 20% to hold the date before the month is out i cant do that right now i explained things would, be more better in February however that's, when the special ends i don't no i don't think I'm going to stop here just on their food rating alone from others but like i said I love the set up andpeople are friendly but i have ran into better deals, in my search, also its extra for led lights up lighting and so on like a, extra 300 i would love to have my wedding here if the food can be guaranteed hot and fresh from start to finish and if, we could if made,a better money arrangement this place would make, me look like a queen for my wedding better than how I've been feeling these days
