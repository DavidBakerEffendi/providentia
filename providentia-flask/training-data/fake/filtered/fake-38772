I'm a first generation American both of immigrant Cuban parents.  I was raised in Miami during the 70's on thru 2007.  Moved up to CT and all I can think of how much I was missing my Cuban food.  I have to say their pastries are great but when it comes to their sandwiches, they are not that good.  Our kids raised on Cuban food and sandwiches, were disappointed.  Its hard to find Cuban bread at our  markets along with slices of pork roast which is used for the Cuban sandwich. Their pan con lechon was stingy on the meat...as well as their Cuban sandwich....just not good in that area. BUT pastries are great!!
