Absolutely love this place!  The pizza is always thin and crisp with a great selection of toppings.  The salads are fresh and seasonal and the antipasto salad is delicious!  The service is always friendly and fast.  They will even give the kids dough to play with while they wait.  We try to get here at least a few times a month.
