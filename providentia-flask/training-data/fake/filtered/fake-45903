The only reason this is getting 3 stars is for service only-  This is our 3rd time going and the service is HORRIBLE,  Everyone just stands around, even when the restaurant is dead.  This is NOT due to understaffing.  Five servers, 3 tables in the entire place...all three tables were neglected.  Nobody running around, busy or hustling.  No sense of urgency at all--the bus boys are the best (they should make THEM the waiters) It always takes a long time be seated (they dont even know you are there)--even when they are not busy.  15=20 MInutes to even approach the table and the servers disappear, forget drinks, hang out texting on phones, sitting near the bar. etc.  IT is possibly the worst service that I can think of and unfortunately every time it is the same thing.  The Food however is really, really good!  Not inexpensive, but the quality and quantitiy of food is really good.  The sampler appetizers and the greek salad are a must.  The lemon potatoes....mmmmm.    Excellent Pita and olives (if they remember to give it to you)  Lamb shank stew and greek pasta, spanakopita, pastisio, moussakka.....alll fantastic!   So, if you dont mind waiting and terrible service...go for it.  Just make sure you dont have an appointment or somewhere to be afterwards.
