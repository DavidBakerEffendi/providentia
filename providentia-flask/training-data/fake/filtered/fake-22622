Customer service and consideration at its worst! I can't vouch for the food because I never got to eat. My husband and I went there to have a much anticipated dinner with friends. We arrived early and sat in the bar adjacent to the dining room.  A large group of musicians with major sound equipment was setting  up. Our friends arrived and we moved into the dining room. We ordered drinks and the band started playing just as they arrived. The music was incredibly loud and I felt as if we had been dropped into a wedding reception at the point dancing begins. We complained to the waiter. He told us there was nothing he could do. We noticed guests at the other tables were also complaining to their waitperson, including  the people seated farthest from the barroom.  Our waiter walked away and returned a few minutes later. Once again he said he could do nothing. The music was for a session set up for prospective customers for weddings and other large events. All he was able to tell us was the music would end in 30 to 40 minutes.  No member of  management came to talk to us about our concerns. We voted with our feet. We called the Highlawn Pavilion and 30 minutes later we were in their dining room for a delightful dinner. I called the GM of the hotel yesterday who apologized on behalf of the hotel, but explained the restaurant is leased to its operators. He said he would speak to their management and give them my number. It's more than 24 hours later and I have heard nothing.
