A friend of mine recommended this restaurant to me while I was in Linden. I was extremely pleased. The food was just great, the service was great, and the overall experience was very relaxing. I ordered the beef short rib. The meat was very tender, very juicy. My sister ordered the spicy tiger shrimp. She enjoyed that as well. :) But the dessert was, by far, my favorite. We ordered the dragonfly desert sampler.       It was delicious. Just delicious. The only critique I have is on the fish tank. It needs more fish. For those of you who haven't gone, I would definitely recommend this restaurant.
