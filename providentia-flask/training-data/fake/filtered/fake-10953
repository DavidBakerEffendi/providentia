Been coming here for 30 years almost.  It is without a doubt the best pizza in the area if not NJ.  Super thin, a little dark on the bottom.   The drill is simple - get there at 6:30, put in your name and order, go to the bar, have a Rolling Rock or a "Conte's" glass of red wine (filled to the top) and relax. Get your table and pie in about 45 min. to an hour.  It is so worth it.  Soccer or baseball on TV.  Great courteous staff. Ciro is the man.  The bartender's special is the pie to get. Secret - if you live too far away to come here every weekend - the pie's freeze great...
