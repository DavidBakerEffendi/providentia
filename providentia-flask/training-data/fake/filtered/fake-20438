Its a cool hangout in Soho, great to sit outside if you can get a table if not expect to wait as the place is not huge and its extremely popular. Its the perfect Brunch place in the city to people watch with a group of friends. Atmosphere is really down to earth and friendly. The food is delicious and pretty good portion wise.
