Loved it! 1 dollar a piece fresh oysters during happy hour. Who can argue with that? Perfect place to grab a drink at the bar, and enjoy some tasty oysters after a day of work, without feeling like you're in a packed subway car. Small plates: Ham biscuits--amazing--melt in your mouth delicious. We had to order another plate of them. Duck rilletes with pickles=perfect--just the right portion size. great balance of flavors. My friend and i were so impressed, that we stayed for dinner. Main Course: the porchetta. Best i've had in the city. served with cabbage and apples. perfect. moist. flavorful. not too fatty. really loved it. Â  after this experience, went online to see what the story was, and learned that the great food is coming from Chef Rob Berry. I loved what he did at Cookshop for the past few years--where i was a regular--so no surprise that i loved what he's doing at Monument Lane. I will definitely be back, and will highly recommend to friends. Only bad thing to mention is the decor. It's a bit hokey: maps and flags, etc. This is not Cape Cod--It's New York--keep the decor clean, simple, and classic, without the gimmicks. Long story short: my new favorite place in the west village for delicious dinner.
