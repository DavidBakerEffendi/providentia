We showed up with ten people in our party , four adults and six teenage boys and EVERYONE enjoyed the food.  As a group we ordered a variety of items and we loved it all!  The owner was very nice and the restaurant was nice, cozy, and clean.  I highly recommend this place to my friends and family.  Next time we are in Newark we will definitely be back.
