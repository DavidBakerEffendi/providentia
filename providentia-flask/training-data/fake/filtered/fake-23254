OK, I have to say that I am a fan of Mexican food. So I get very picky at times. Especially in New York when most Mexican restaurants are hit or miss..mostly miss. Alas! I have found my new favorite Mexican in the heart of the West Village. Ofrenda Â is probably the best I have had in a long time. First of all, the service is excellent. Everyone so friendly and making sure you are having a great time. Great margaritas! Huge selection of tequila..over 50, I believe. Then there is the food.........Last night I had chicken enchiladas the were out of this world...so fresh. My friend had the shrimp wrapped with prosciutto..amazing! The guacamole is fresh and served with homemade tortilla chips unlike most places that will serve a basket of stale Tostitos. Ofrenda is the real deal. Check out their happy hour..$5 margaritas and affordable appetizer. Such a fun place and I can't wait to try their brunch this Sunday.
