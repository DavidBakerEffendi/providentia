We love Taboon restaurant so we really wanted to visit Taboonette. We loved the intimate, relaxed space -- the firewood wall is gorgeous! Don't you love when you want to eat the whole menu? It was hard to choose but the lamb kebab and vegetable platter were delicious. Not only will we go back to try the rest of the lunch menu, but we'll definitely return for the breakfast too!
