I literally live next door to this place, and I look forward to making this my and my friend's new thrice-weekly haunt. The staff is absurdly friendly, cute, and excited to be there, the food is tasty (I die for the shrimp and the gumbo), and some truly yummy beers are on tap. They make a kickass Bloody Mary as well. Please stay open later soon!
