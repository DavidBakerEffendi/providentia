I went in last night with a friend, sat at the bar and had a great time! We ordered the Surf n Turf (Sea Scallops, Slow Braised Short Ribs), White Truffle Caviar Deviled Eggs, and my favorite the Sonoma Goat Cheese Ravioli. The bartender Sabrina was very nice and made great suggestions. Overall the service and ambiance was great! I'll be back.
