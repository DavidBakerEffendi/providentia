Great menu, appeals to a novice juicer or a beginner. Clean and beautiful space. Friendly staff. Delicious juice, great quality - pretty sure it's the only place in Burlington that actually uses a hydraulic press to squeeze their produce - which is an optimal way of preserving nutrients, much like a Norwalk juicer. Very cool to see them using the press out back. This allows the convenience of bottling their juices and enabling customers to quickly grab a freshly bottled juice or juice cleanse on the go! Also super cool that their website has the option of ordering and paying in advance online!
