I just have to laugh at the people on here who complain about the wait and the service. "I think this is probably just a big tourist trap now."- tim e. Oh yeah tim? Well, considering you didn't bother to actually EAT at Sally I think you "probably" have no idea what you're talking about. I'm glad you won't be clogging the line for those of us who accept no substitute to Sally's. The staff can be as rude as they want when they produce the best pizza in the world. And you're complaining because they don't take credit cards? Give me a break.
