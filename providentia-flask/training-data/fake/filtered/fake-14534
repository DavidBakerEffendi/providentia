10/10/14 Placed an order today for delivery. Wrong food sent, called to have them come back and pick up food and send my money back. I was then confronted with a VERY RUDE man who I believe to be the owner (who was also the one to mess up the order) His way of rectifying this situation was not to see if I still wanted my correct order, but he told me not to call back there if I was going to have an attitude. He then told me there was nothing he could do about my money being returned anytime soon because he only had one delivery guy. NOT MY PROBLEM....but where is my damn money Legends!!!!!
