I have been coming to Modern Apizza since I was a college student and Im almost 48 years old. Modern Apizza has the best pizza hands down anywhere on the planet. I am from just outside of Beantown(Boston) Ma. and have tried pizza from Vt. to Florida to Arizona, Modern is the "BEST", some places are close but still Modern remains the best.When I am traveling through New Haven I make it a point to order a pizza to go no matter how little time or how late it will make me or how much pizza land on my face and lap. I tell everyone that Modern is the best pizza, not Slow Sally's or Peppes.
