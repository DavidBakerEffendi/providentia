The place is a little smaller then I thought but upon walking in and being greeted by Natalia I was surprised with how quaint and welcoming Zafra was. Natalia was very sweet, patient, and extremely corteous. Truly a great person to have welcoming you at the door! Â Now as for the food, it was banging. I am of cuban decent and this place truly captured the flavor of my mothers kitchen and the food was incredibly displayed! I began with the cuban dumplings which truly are a festive party in your mouth of different seasonings and flavors. I also had the Tostones Rellenos which were the best I ever had. The lechon asado was moist and not dried out like most places and the black beans (which i have never been a fan of ) were mouth watering!!! Even the white rice was kicking!!! The portions were great for the price but I still had room for Tres Leches!!! A popular dessert growing up and this place really captured the perfect recipe!!! I followed it with a cafe con leche which basically ended the evening perfectly. Thank you Natalia for your wonderful service and thank you Zafras, I will be back?!!!
