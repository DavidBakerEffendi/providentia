Beware of an angry, nasty chef/owner, Anthony, who is more interested in money than customers! Hope his food isn't as acidic as his attitude! He just ruined our Christmas dinner. I purchased a groupon for $100 worth of food, only after I purposely questioned groupon if I could use it for catered trays or take out There was no fine print on Cielo's deal saying dine in only or not good on holidays and groupon assured me I could use it. I Â placed my order with Cielo and they were fine and accommodating until I mentioned the groupon. I was yelled at and told they would not honor the groupon for take out, especially near a holiday, and that it says that on the groupon. I tried to tell him it doesn't say that and groupon assured me of that and he yelled you should have asked me and hung up. Sounds like their problem is with the groupon company but they had no problem losing me or any of my network as customers, let alone leaving us without Christmas dinner! Bah humbug!!
