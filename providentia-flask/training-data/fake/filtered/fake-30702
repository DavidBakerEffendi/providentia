Love this place! Staff could be a little more attentive but overall everything is great. I really enjoy sitting outside when its nice watching the plans take off and land. They have awesome hot wings and I really wanted to buy the sauce ( which they don't sell) and they actually gave me a container to take home to have. I was really impressed with that! Thanks!!
