I have gone to Lucali's numerous times and each time is a reminder of all the great things in this world. I have lived in New York my whole life and like to think of myself as an avid pizza eater, however they don't serve just mere "pizza". The fresh ingredients they use intensify every flavor in the cheese, sauce and even the dough... my taste buds have never thanked me more! Some complain about the price, for those people I sense a Dominoes menu to your liking... OR bring your own booze and call it fair :)
