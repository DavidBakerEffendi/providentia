Emporio used to be my favorite go to spot for brunch, lunch, dinner or any special occasion. The food is delicious but to me service and food must work in conjunction. Yesterday,  Wednesday May 15 at around 1:00pm, I decided to treat my mother for lunch at Emporio. We entered the restaurant and were rudely greeted by the server or hostess., not quite sure of her position.  We thought that she might have been having a bad day so we didn't pay much attention to it. With more than half the restaurant empty, she gave us the worst table right next to the door. When I politely requested another table,  she again gave me a rude attitude telling me that it was either that table or the bar. To be honest, it is not my mothers fault or my to be Hispanic. We live in a city which has become very diverse and staff at public restaurants should not judge people because of their looks. I have worked in the restaurant business as well and know how to tip, if that was the issue. Management should definitely educate their staff on not judging other based on looks because you never know who might walk through that door. I am highly offended and will never recommend this place ever again because what this employee did was just unacceptable.
