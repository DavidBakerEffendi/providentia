lucali serves DELICIOUS pizza. people need to realize that this is a small time neighborhood place. the owner is not a restaurateur, he just makes really excellent pizza every night. i go to lucali at least once a week, and i am constantly shaking my head at the obnoxious people getting upset about the wait. there is no 'insider' list, but if you are rude the high school girls at the door they will remember your face, and that is not a good thing. it's NEVER going to be easy to get into the place, so just deal with it. they do you a great service by calling you when your table is ready, so just go around the corner to brooklyn social and have a couple drinks while you wait.
