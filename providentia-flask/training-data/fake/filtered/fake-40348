I never leave reviews, but since I just had to throw out the entire take out order, I'm having the urge to let people know. I'm not sure what happened - I used to love their food - but tonight my vegetarian pad thai was so greasy and overcooked, it was inedible. The chicken satay was completely bland and felt undercooked. The papaya salad seemed really old. I actually am hoping now that I won't get sick from trying the food.... So gross, and this is not the first time I was extremely disappointed. They must have changed owners or chefs. Stay clear, at least from the take out at this place!
