As a celiac, I appreciate informed, careful service. Mogador served up fantastic Moroccan-style food--a cuisine that already uses mostly gluten-free ingredients save for the fixation on pita bread--and did so with attention to my needs. I also feel that I know a thing or two about hummus since it became one of my go-to's for a tasty GF snack and Mogador serves some of the best in the city.
