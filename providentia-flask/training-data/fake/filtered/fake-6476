Nothing hits the spot better than a fragrant, delicious and ENORMOUS bowl of hot. spicy chicken pho from Pho 501.  After outdoor tennis on the weekends, sometimes a group of us make our way to this favorite eatery.  We are willing to wait in the cramped restaurant for our chance to slurp our soups.  In warmer weather, we prefer to wait outside to avoid drooling on fellow patrons who are already enjoying their bowls; the place is quite small and cozy.   We have called in our orders of spicy chicken or beef broth as it often runs out on the weekend.  I order the small bowl which is ample. The large bowls are daunting to me, but have been ordered by many, perhaps before their sumo match. The friendly staff seems to be a family, right down to the grandmother type who is busy making sesame balls in the back.  They will give you extra basil etc, if you want to add more to your soup.   Great place for lunch - go!
