Me and my fiance' visited Geno's last September. I was the one who dragged him there, since I assumed since I have seen them all over the food network, then it had to be a "must try". I enjoyed the wait in line, more than the food. The photos along the walls and inside the covered awning were interesting. However, when it was time to order my food, I had mixed reviews. There are no signs telling you how to order, so I informed the female working at the first window that it was my first time ordering. She responded, "yeah, I can tell!" I guess she didn't care about promoting good customer service, since she knew that many unsuspecting customers would be coming to them anyway, with all the publicity they have received. However, when we went to the second window to order our fries and drinks, we conversated with a very nice young man, who helped us finalize our order and even thanked us. He was obviously too young to be jilted by the older employees who could of cared less about anything but making money and getting through the day. As for the sandwich itself, the bun was good, but the steak was disappointing! There was harldy any meat on it and the meat that was there was tasteless! I just assumed there would be an option to have green peppers, mushrooms etc., but no..only onions. We had the fries with cheese. I thought the cheese just "drowned" the fries, but my fiance' enjoyed them. So..for us, it was not a good enough experience for us to return. Geno's needs to be thankful (due to publicity/media) that they will continue to have many other folks visit, who like us, did not know any better...until we actually got there!!
