Jamaican D's is the best! When I attended CCP I would arrive to class 1/2 hour earlier just so I could get my platter. The food is absolutely delicious. The kitchen is clean. Never dirty. The food is fresh and plentuful. I live in Overbrook park. Some days  I would drive to 17th  Spring Garden just to get this flavor. After I completed CCP I hadn't been down their to get food. It's had been so long I forgot the name of the truck. Until tonight...i'm in Jersey City visiting friends so we stopped in this Jamaican, restaurant and I ordered oxtail, rice n beans, n cabbage...and it reminded me of a familiar flavor....and then it hit me. I turned to my boyfriend and shouted.Jamaican D's that's the name of the truck that serves best Jamaican food in Philly. Wow so glad I rememered. I will save the number once again as I did when I was in school and the next time I want some great Jamaican food Jamaican D's here I come.
