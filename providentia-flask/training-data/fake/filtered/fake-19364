My family and I eat here frequently, and I thought that it is about time that I write a review. We really love this place - the food, the people and the place. We have never had anything that wasn't good, and not infrequently have dishes that are exceptional. I am a Caesar Salad lover, and Pulcinella's version is my absolute favorite. The pizza is wonderful, and compares favorably with what I had when I worked in Milan, Italy. I don't order many entrees myself, but other folks that I dine with do, and they are always satisfied and often enthusastic. Finally, the desserts are great and it is always exciting to try the new offerings. Handicap access is top-notch, which is important to us. We often eat here before concerts at the Flynn, as we can get in and out without any hassle. The bottom line - we love Pulcinella's!
