I was very disappointed tonight. I went to La Calaca Feliz for the first time, although I live just across the street. I did like the food. The service was very slow and they seemed to need more wait staff. I was not very hungry so I just wanted something light and ordered a cold soup, and I didn't really want a big heavy dinner and asked if I could have some quesadillas with cheese and mushrooms. They brought them plopped on a plate with nothing else. I asked for pico de gallo which is usually on the table along with other salsas. I was told I ordered a la carte so it didn't come with it. I told the waitress, that I couldn't eat dry quesadillas and she could take them back. She then said I will get you some pico de gallo. She did not say there would be a charge for it. It came in rather a big bowl and I was eating alone. I don't know about most people but usually one person does not eat pico de gallo by the bowl. I took a couple of spoonfuls Â and put it on my quesadillas and left the rest. The waitress asked me if I wanted to take it home which seemed odd that someone would take home the salsa. Anyway, when the bill came the salsa cost $4. Also where were no chips. I am glad it didn't come with a piece of cilantro on it. I wonder what that would have cost. My dinner with tip came to $46.00. I told them that that $4 cost them a customer. It is not the money, believe me. I hate chintzy , cheap, creepy places that try to pretend they are so elegant while they are nickeling and dimeing , you. Just make the price higher but don't plop some dry quesadillas on my plate!!!
