One of those happy accidents when you're walking home and discover a new treasure in the city-- beautiful and simple interior, a nice glossy wood bar, a gracious and friendly bartender/owner. Everything about this bar was the antithesis of the other dens in the Village on a Saturday night. They have an oyster menu with better prices than other oyster spots in the city (or Brooklyn), a concise craft beer draft list (all beers are $6.00), and a thoughtfully curated wine list. Didn't try the oysters or wines, but enjoyed two rounds (Back in Black IPA and the Mother's Milk Stout were excellent) with my girlfriend. I have never "yelped" before, but felt compelled to because of our excellent experience at Upstate.
