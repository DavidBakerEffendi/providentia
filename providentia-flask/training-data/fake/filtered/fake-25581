This restaurant is awesome.  My friends from college introduced me to the place 3 years ago and I still drive the 30-40 minutes to eat here.  The service is pretty quick and the food is delicious!  Not only is the food great, but the prices are too.  You could estimate spending around $30-35 for two (which includes an appetizer, entree, drinks, and dessert).  My personal favorite is their chicken pad thai, the sauce that they have is nice and sweet, not too sweet, but just right.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is very warm, great place to have dinner for two or dinner with a group.
