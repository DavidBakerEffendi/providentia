Great menu, delicious options. I am a sales manager for the eastern part of the states and I am venturing out more often while traveling for business trying new cuisines and restaurants and this visit was well worth the risk. Comfortable ambiance and good energy. I cannot say anything bad about the service. My waiter knew his stuff and made the whole experience even more pleasant. Looking forward to returning to this place on my next trip to try new dishes. I'll make sure to ask for Juan.
