Only if you're crazy and/or have no taste in pizza should you ever go here. The fact that it's a tiny establishment isn't a problem, but there are two things definitely wrong here: 1: They reheat it. It was only 7:15 when I went in for a slice with some friends, and in my book, that's a no-no. 2: It just wasn't good pizza! You couldn't taste any mozzarella on the pie (I ordered just a regular slice, nothing funky like the artichoke pizza I've heard about), it was practically ALL parmesan! The fact that it was reheated only made the crust tough and crunchy, more like a pita chip or a cracker than anything. The basil leaves were really distracting, and the sauce was just... well, it wasn't there. So, if you want good pizza? Find someplace that ISN'T this.
