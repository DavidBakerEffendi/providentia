Mr. Dino's has been in Watchung Plaza since I was a kid, quite awhile ago. There pizza is always great. They use huge slices of peperoni. Their Sicilian is great too. They used to be across the street and had a rocking juke box (David Bowie, The Cars, even some disco). Pat and his bro have been there all along. Whenever I go back they stare hard and then bust into a smile. They have awesome sandwiches, I like the sausage parm. I would also order any of the cold subs and have them toasted, there were doing this way back in the 80s. (quiznos?). It's a Montclair tradition. If your in the plaza stop by for a slice and check out the awesome crust with the bubbles of dough.
