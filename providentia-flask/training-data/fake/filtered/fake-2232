I went here with my fiancé in the mid-afternoon hoping to be wowed- considering all the great reviews Clinton St. Baking Company has received. But I just wasn't, and here's why: The first thing we ordered was the Chocolate Peanut Butter Shake, at my fiancé's insistence and to his great excitement. The presentation of the shake was perfect. It came in an old-fashioned ice cream parlor glass and was topped with a dense layer of whipped cream.  The shake itself was good, but the whipped cream was like the kind you'd get at a Jack in the Box. Dense, warm to taste, and not-very-fresh. I'd say go to Bareburger for a  mouthwatering, amazing choco-peanut butter shake. Not here. I ordered those famous Blueberry Pancakes and some Fried Green Tomatoes. He ordered the Chicken and Waffles. The food was all tasty, but definitely not the best I've ever had. His waffle wasn't hot on arrival and his chicken was a bit overcooked. The pancakes were good, but not mind blowingly delicious, and my tomatoes were enjoyable. Overall, I'd say these popular items were enjoyable, not too overpriced, and worth eating again... IF it weren't for the service. As for the service... I knew we'd have to wait to be seated, but I didn't expect patrons who came in after us to be served water and have their orders taken before us. That was irritating, but forgivable. As soon as the patrons next to us finished their food and quickly settled their bills, some of the employees placed water and pastries on the empty tables... Apparently for themselves?  This had to be around 3pm- 3:20pm at the latest. As we waited to receive our check, a busser even reached over us and took away the condiments from our table. My fiancé had to ask the busser to ask our server for the check. Awkward and definitely disorganized service! If you're so eager for everyone to leave, why keep your patrons from letting you be? The food itself gets an 8/10 and the service a 6/10.
