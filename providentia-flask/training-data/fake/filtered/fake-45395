Best night ever. First time me and company  were there. Food was amazing, I had the shrimp and grits he had the chicken and waffles.  The f-que chicken was a great appetizer.  And the mac  and cheese was good as well. Love love love this place. Thank you for a memorable night. The seating is pretty tight but if u know Brooklyn resturants most seating is tight anyway. Nice atmosphere and great music. Our waitress was really nice and gave her honest opinion on food and drink. Will definitely be returning.
