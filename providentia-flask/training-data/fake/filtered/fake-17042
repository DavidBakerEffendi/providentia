Sooooooo Disapointed!!!! After dining at Cubanu for almost 3years and really TRYING to stay positive regarding service, food, entertainment, I have to say it should just close up.  The staff was, well, what staff?? but the one young gentlemen we had was probably the most "removed from this earth, angry, unhappy human being I have ever experienced as a waiter!!   It is extremely upsetting that I paid over $280 and the food was horrible and the service was Worse!!!! This was our 4th attempt and this will be our last. We will never again go to Cubanu and if you do.....maybe you should be part of their answering service because that is the only thing and not really that you may get a response to.  Horrible Horrible Horrible....disapointed Cuban chef myself!!!!!!
