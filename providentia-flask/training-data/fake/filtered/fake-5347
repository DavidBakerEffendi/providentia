2 Stars for the fact that the food is good. 0 Stars for the fact that we've been waiting over an hour(this is no exaggeration) for our food to arrive and we live within 5 blocks of their location. We were quoted 35 minutes, and when we called 50 minutes after making the delivery, the woman on the end told us that they just started on our order. This was made further irritating by the fact that her tone of voice was rather nasty, as if we had called 15 minutes before the stated time, rather than 15 minutes after. Our food just arrived. A few tortillas and some nachos took 70 minutes to be cooked and move to a location in the same area code. - The food is great for the price. - As the other reviewer pointed out, if you want to get your food fast, pick it up. If you order it, you'll find yourself wanting to grab a snack while you wait. I could have gotten on the ferry and been eating in Manhattan quicker than it took for the food to arrive.
