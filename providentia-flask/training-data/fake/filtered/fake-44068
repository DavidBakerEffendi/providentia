I am loving this restaurant, I go often.  Soooo many delicious choices  to choose from.  Butternut Squash ravioli a favorite, Seafood Combo's,  Avocado salad, just to mention a few.  They have appetizers, all varieties of pizza,great service, drinks at a beautiful old bar.  Don't miss out on this find!!!!!!  If you haven't been there GO NOW.  If you have, you'll be back.
