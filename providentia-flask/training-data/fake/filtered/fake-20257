Came in here by accident a couple of sundays ago when we couldn't get served at that pretentious German beer garden bar across the road. We had an absolute ball in here. The locals were friendly, the barman Jeff was awesome with great music and the drinks were ridiculously cheap. Forget what it looks like outside and go on in....you will have a lot of fun.
