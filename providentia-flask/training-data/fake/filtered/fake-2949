While the service at Cuban Pete's has always been sketchy at best, the food is pretty good and thus is sometimes overlooked.  However, today, the service was its absolute worst and the two stars only for some of the dishes on the menu. Cuban Pete's would do well to have better hostesses.  The amount of customers, the nonexistent lobby and the lack of a real service desk means that the hostesses would have to be on the caliber of a Michelin graded restaurant to manage the mess.  However, they are not, and I am usually completely frustrated by the experience.  Today, the hostess had an attitude even though there was no one in the restaurant, so managing my request should have been easy.  This is typical though. There are also some typical Cuban dishes that are not up to par, namely the Arroz con Pollo.  The Sangria has no alcohol, so BYOB and stick to the reds.  The restaurant is unnecessarily loud.  Overall, it's a step above Bahama Breeze, though at least there, there is an attempt to train the staff.
