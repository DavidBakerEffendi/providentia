My wife and I had dinner on Friday night.  Top to bottom, an exquisite experience.  Attentive, gracious service matched by truly amazing food.  We had the sea scallops, lamb tartare, duck breast and butter poached lobster - all exceptional.  The suggested wine pairings were spot on.  By far our most enjoyable Princeton dining experience.  Can't wait to return.
