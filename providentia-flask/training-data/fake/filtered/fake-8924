This is NOT the Brazil Grill you have had food at or heard about!!!!!!! We made reservations and showed up to find out it is a dirty barn inside. You do not have a person goming over to your table to serve you the hot cooked meat at your table you have to line up like hungry animals for the good stuff while everyone else is scrunched over the lousy salad bar that was VERY dirty looking. So yes we looked around and were dishusted and turned right around and walked out!!!! VERY DISGUSTING!!!!!!
