No, I don't think so. The location: ok, while you wait the hour in line you can look at the Manhattan Bridge and old warehouses turning into high-end-whatevers. When you ARE seated you can wait 15 minutes for the waiter to run past Then you wait an hour for your pizza to come, and by that time you are starving and will eat just about anything. Worst pizza I ever had, bland and dried out. No taste. Half hour later the table was cleared and we asked for the check. The waiter must have gone home for the day? Never saw him again. An hour later we asked a burly man who appeared to be the owner if we could get our check, and he says, "could these nice people have their check please? I have to bother one of the waiters for their check! Some people think they are the only ones in the restaurant!" Yeah. ok. 3 hours of waiting for a really bad pizza to be told we are impatient. Nah, I don't think so.
