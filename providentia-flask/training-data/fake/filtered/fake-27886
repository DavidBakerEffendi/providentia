Hey Anna K I live in Florida too and the best Pizza there sometimes ( Not always good !! ) is Anthony's Coal Fired Pizza but it does not compare to Lucalis at all !! Anthony has quite a few places but by far the best one is run by Michael Angelo and his wife Debbie on Federal off State Road 84. They are The BEST out of ALL Â The Anthony's Pizzas :O) Hey you get what you pay for these days and it is New York NOT Miami darlin :O) Rents are very high in New York. Guess you are used to Florida Pizza which does not compare but sometimes does come close to New York Pizza !!! or maybe it is you are simply on a budget ? There always Dominos then :O(
