This is my favorite place to grab food. I come here for every birthday! Old-fashioned burger is my favorite, and always cooked to my liking. I also enjoy getting the caesar salad and some sort of pasta with my friend and then splitting it - more than enough food for 2 people! The vanilla sundae with melted chocolate is amazing.
