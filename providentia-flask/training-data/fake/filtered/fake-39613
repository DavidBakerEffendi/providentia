The food was good. They have a lot of veggie options for the veggies like me. BUT they take cash only. Considering we got there with just $30 on us, we had to watch what we ordered. The Thai red curry was yummy. But the yellow curry had a strong sour bamboo flavor that I am not used to. The next time I am there, I want to try the pad Thai. We got there at 6 PM. An odd time for any meal. And the place had so many people. By the time we left, it was packed. That should say something about the food.
