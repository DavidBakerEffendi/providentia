I absolutely love this place!  I recomend it to all my friends when they come to visit the city.  It has a causual yet modern atmosphere that always makes me feel at home when I am there.  Not to mention the lovely service!  The gm is so charming and welcoming.  He always remembers me and my family when we go in and that just makes me feel special! ;)  My favorites are the make your own blody marys, ginger dumplings (I think they are ginger), the fish tacos, and of course the chicken and wafles!!! It looks like the menus have been redone recently (maybe?)... There are a lot of new drinks on the menu and the one's I've tried have been great but I'm still working my way through.... I'm loving the changes so far. Also, who doesn't love mini picknick tables?! Love Jones
