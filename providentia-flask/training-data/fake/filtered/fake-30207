Everything a NJ pizzeria should be, open counter where you can see them make the pies, and booth seating to enjoy your slice. I travel a lot and always come back to Anthony Franco's to reset my palate on what a pizza should taste like. Besides the delicious plain slice, they have a great selection of specialty slice pies available including Buffalo Chicken, Philly Cheese Steak, and Chicken Marsala. Daily lunch specials from the kitchen never disappoint either.
