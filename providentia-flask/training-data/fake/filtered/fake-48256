Just came back from Pommes Frites and omg I am so going back! It's a cute little hole in the wall and their menu of sauce flavors is amazing! I got a regular size (that was my dinner) with the Mexican Ketchup. At first the green pesto-like substance that was mixed with regular ketchup scared me, but the man let me try before I bought it and it was delicious! It has a slight spice that I describe as "zesty". I also tried my friend's pineapple mayo and mango mayo and they were fantastic as well. You wouldn't think that fruit would mix with French fries, but it was delicious.
