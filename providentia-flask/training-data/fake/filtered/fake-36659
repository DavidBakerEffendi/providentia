I LOVE this place, the food is soooooo good.  I have never been disappointed anytime that I have come here.  I was in there a few weeks ago with some friends and our server was Deb, she was amazing!!! She did such a good job at suggestion new food items and drinks for us to try.  Always a great time at El Camino!!!
