I give their burgers five stars, but the overall restaurant four because I still haven't tried the majority of thier menu but the setup is nice and spacious, especially the bar and the happy hour is long. But the burgers are soo good, it makes it hard to try anything else. You must try the Edison Ale House Burger with caramelized Beer Onions and Swiss cheese. My husband and I consider ourselves burger connoisseurs and this is by far one of the best burgers we've had hands down. Â Go on a Monday night and get the $10 burger and beer special. It's so worth it. I promise you'll keep thinking about it. The sweet potatoe fries with the house-special sauce is also pretty darn good.
