I am conflicted. I have been to the bar several times. The bar staff is exceptional. Cocktails are superior, the bar staff is professional, courteous, and inviting. Their Â style keeps me coming back. Now for the down side. The remainder of the staff is arrogant, rude and basically a toxic combination of a bad Real World or Jerry Springer episode. The sense of entitlement and blatant rudeness exhibited by the staff is beyond anything I have even observed at any other establishment. Agricola would be best advised to have a come to Jesus moment with their staff and make it abundantly clear that they should show customers respect and courtesy if they expect this establishment to be successful. My advise... Go for a GREAT drink... Eat the wonderful food at the bar, but do not, I repeat do not reward this sub-par waiter/waitress staff with any semblance of a tip. PERIOD
