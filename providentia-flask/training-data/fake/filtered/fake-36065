This is a classy place that I want to drink at AND watch a game AND I can take a date to. It's 3 floors. First floor is all sports bar, but its nice. It's like the village but by the garden. No, seriously. Second floor is a classy, villagey-type bar with a nice selection of craft beers. This neighborhood has nothing but blah blah blah irish pubs. This place has character and it was very reasonably priced. I'm very impressed and I will be back.
