Great meal.  The food was authentic and enjoyable.  The arancini, stuffed clams and pastas were delicious.  I was irritated by the bill because the drinks were $14 a piece which is way overpriced.  The desserts were also disappointing.  Will return but I will not drink alcohol here or order dessert. Also, it is way too loud in this restaurant, and the tables are too close together.  Definitely some kinks to be worked out.
