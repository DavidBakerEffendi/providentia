I have dined in all types of places all over the US in the past 25 years, nothing beats the food at Punjabi Rasoi. Each dish has a distinct and unique taste, preapred fresh and served hot. The menu is extensive, but the prices are highly reasonable. Many dishes remind me of the food my Mom used to cook for me. I have been dining at Punjabi Rasoi since Feb 08, I am a great fan of this place now. You can often find me at Punjabi Rasoi eating lunch during weekdays. Dr Pramod Sharma
