I have been here a few times since moving to nyc over a month ago. Up until my visit today, I loved this place. The food is consistently great. I decided to bring two friends from out of town here for lunch. It took about 15 minutes just to get water and we had to flag the waitress down for it. I let it slide because we were in no rush. The service was quite average for the rest of the meal. The total bill ended up being $53.89 after tax and we left $60 thinking that a 12% tip on the pre-tax amount was reasonable. Once we got outside, we were rudely confronted by our waitress who proceeded to educate us about tipping etiquette in front of a crowd of people lined up outside. This was embarrassing and completely unnecessary. Hope losing a repeat customer was worth the extra $5 my friend tossed her so she would STFU.
