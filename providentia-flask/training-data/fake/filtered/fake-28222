I was finally able to check this place out after hearing about it from a few friends.  LOVED IT!  The service was excellent and the food was beyond amazing.  Very cool concept.  The menu had a lot of options and the food portions were good.  Everything was made fresh and it was a short wait. I would highly suggest the nutella/grilled cheese sandwich.  I also tried their Traditional Mac and Cheese, which was very good.  Normally, after I order mac and cheese at any restaurant, the dish is too rich and I feel extremely sick after.  The taste on this one was just right. I loved the fact that they had a gluten/lactose free option.  I will definitely be going back on my next Montclair visit.  We need one in NY!
