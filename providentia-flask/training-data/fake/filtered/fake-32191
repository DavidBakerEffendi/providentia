It sucks! Worst food ever! Today is my birthday and I ordered food and they delivered raw food, hard steak under cook, dumplings raw, noodles in the soup is not cook, they are putting customer in danger of eating raw food. when I called again to replaced the steak they send me a 1/4 portion of my order. In short I paid $ 55 of food for nothing. they ruined my birthday! and when I called to explain to them they hang up on me. and they are so rude and dishonest....
