I never use yelp but I needed to do so today.  Been a customer for over 30 years.  Wanted to treat myself to an Italian hoagie.  Got a lettuce sandwich with a little meat! Are we cutting back on the portions? Skimping to make a little more profit?  I'm all for profit but when people have been lined up for years I think the profit line is fine.  Just remember who and what got the previous owners there and what will keep the current owners there!
