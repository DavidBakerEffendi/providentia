I loved Westville.... and i just ate Kale i ordered for delivery and there was a "stone" in my food and i almost cracked a tooth.  When i called and spoke to a manager, and he said "i started working her and they told me to tell customers it sometimes happens.  we use fresh vegtables and sometime when we wash them stones still get stuck there.  sorry."  REALLY?  I can swallow a stone or crack a tooth because they can't clean their vegtables well enough.  #PoorForm
