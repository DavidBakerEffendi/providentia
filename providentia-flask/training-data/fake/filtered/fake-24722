After managing two seats at the communal table, we were promptly greeted by friendly, bubbly, helpful Isabel.  She recommended wines for both myself and my friend, both which we loved.  She placed our order for food and it came out exactly as ordered - and MOST delicious!! There was never a moment that we wanted for anything, because Isabel was extremely attentive.  Our wine glasses were full, our needs were met, even before we actually needed anything. Great experience, outstanding service from Isabel, and a resounding yes to the question of whether or not we will return. Keep up the good work, SCG!!
