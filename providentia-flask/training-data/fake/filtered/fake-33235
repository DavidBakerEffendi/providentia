I went in yesterday and was happily surprised!. Did not feel like a movie theatre. After exploring the bar and bar menu I was surprised to see a lot of artisan spirits, with me being a spirit nerd i was in heaven.  Their tap beer was good with the space they had. only 6 taps and 3 of them were micro breweries from Hartford. The bottle list covered all ground. The wine list did the same with an option for wine flights which is great considering there is about 20 bottles by the glass. Food: Had the taste of Hartford reluctantly. BUT was happy at the end. I had the hummus platter. YUM but i like hummus so... Had the pretzel coated salmon with butternut  squash risotto. NICE sweet and savory. Finally I had the Waffle sunday. YES! The place isnt gourmet but in a movie theatre setting, its fantastic. If you go for what it is you will have fun. The happy hour specials seemed awesome and you can brin beer/wine into the theatre. Overall very happy!
