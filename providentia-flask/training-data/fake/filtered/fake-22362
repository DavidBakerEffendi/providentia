I LOVE this place. The service is great, the workers are great, what's not to love?! My favorite dish is the Pad Sew Eew with steak. I get it every time and I know that I should try something new but this is just TOO GOOD! My favorite drink there is the mango smoothie when it's mixed with pineapple. Yummy! And last but not least, the dessert that I just can't stay away from is the banana chocolate pockets with a honey glaze. Those are just so... I can't explain. 5 stars for SURE!
