Absolutely love this place. Excellent service, great food and BYOB. Whats not to like. When you first walk in you dont expect the great food . Your almost taken back. The panag curry is my favorite. A bit too spicey if you ask for meduim but extremely flavorful. Alwasy top it off with some black sticky rice and mango! YUMMY.
