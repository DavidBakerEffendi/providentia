I've been here twice so far for lunch. As others have said, an amazing beer selection. My guests and I were also very happy with the food (we had sandwiches, burgers, and a fantastic brussel sprout salad sort of thing (hard to describe, but tasted great). Delicious, fresh ingredients, prepared with style and served promptly. The service was also great--the server was happy to give me a taste test of several beers before I decided and everything came out when expected. I am not trying to dismiss the negative reviews, but as with most things on Yelp, I wonder if one person complains on Yelp while another 99 people were perfectly happy to go many times, enjoy their food and drink, and say nothing. So--as a extremely rare poster to Yelp--I'm trying to do my part to keep this great neighborhood place in business!
