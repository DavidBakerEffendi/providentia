Many thanks to John's staff and management for taking pity on 2 Flyers fans from upstate NY who arrived just at closing time on Sat. Oct. 25th, 2014. They unlocked the door and let us in -it  made our day! The staff couldn't be friendlier and the cheese steak sandwich and roast pork sandwich were delicious- our favorite being the cheese steak definitely!  Wonderfully hearty crusty roll heaped with steak and our choice of cheese and fried onions...YUM! Thanks again guys!
