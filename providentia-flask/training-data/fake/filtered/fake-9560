this is such a great neighborhood place and has the best bartender in our area. The drinks are great and every time I have sat at the bar I always end up meeting and talking to other diners, having a great time. One 53 is affordable and while other restaurants in the Princeton area talk about being "local" places, this one really has an authentic local vibe. I had the roasted beet salad (great) and their wonderful grilled Ceasar salad. I would highly recommend this restaurant and to sit at the bar, order one of Craig's great drinks and order dinner from him, he is the such a gracious host, you'll have a wonderful evening!
