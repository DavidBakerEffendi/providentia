Made a reservation for 45 mins and when I went to inquire about my table, the girl at the desk said I have to wait an additional 45 mins because she seated other customers. Asked for the manager. She said no managers on duty. She was very rude and not apologetic about her mistake. Couldn't talk to a manager. The waitress messed up the order and was very defensive and rude about the order. She made faces and never apologized. The food is excellent but the customer service is a 0 out of 10.
