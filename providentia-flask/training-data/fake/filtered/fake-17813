Charcoal is my absolute favorite restaurant of all time! Steak and eggs is heavenly and the staff and chef's are simply incredible. I always leave this place perfectly satisfied. They serve the best quality of food I have eaten to date; portions are perfect and the hard work & attention to detail in each dish is extremely apparant.
