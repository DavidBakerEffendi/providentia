The New England Lobster roll was warm and flavorful. Fries that came with it were seasoned appropriately with what may have been old bay. Â Lobster tasted fresh with an even balance between their herb mayo and lobster. The Lobster Mac'n'Cheese was hearty and filling. There were nice chunks of lobster. Top layer was nicely crusted with a creamy center. Definitely a meal to share as the cheese was overwhelming halfway through.
