We've been to Bluebird for brunch twice now, and we've had an excellent experience both times. The first time, our Bloody Marys were spot on. Be sure to try the Frail Mary, which is their Bloody but strained so that all the bits are filtered out. The brunch poutine and candied bacon waffle were both generously sized and delicious. They didn't skimp on the cheese curds! On our second visit, we enjoyed the Citrus Gimlet and the citrus cured gravlax, but wished that the bagel chips served alongside were more substantial. The eggs benedict was tasty, as was the brisket hash. The portion size of the hash, as with the cast iron baked eggs, was reasonable but left us wanting more. The service is spectacular - friendly and attentive. We love the cozy but refined atmosphere. Not the cheapest brunch in town, but worth every penny. As an added bonus, unlike some of Burlington's other establishments, we haven't had to wait in line to enjoy this hidden gem (but we totally would if we ever had to).
