I have gone to the Bistro many times, I was there last night the place was packed. I ordered a paella mediteranian because I read a review on yelp about the paella,what I had last night was the best paella and all the many times that i have gone to eat there and the taste was great like always,my husband had three tapas that were also great. The waiter that I had was fantastic he gave me and my husband a great service. The staff was welcoming and made us enjoy our dinner.
