Pat's was my longtime front-runner in the infamous Philadelphia cheesesteak war, and still remains a top-contender. When you visit Philadelphia, people will tell you to head to Pat's for it's reputation alone, as well as it's location right next to the other top contender, Geno's Steaks. In my opinion, cheesesteaks are something very difficult to rate. Some people like Cheese Whiz, others prefer provolone. Some prefer their steak chopped up, others like it still in slices. Pat's uses a great roll for the bread, soft and as good as those used by any other place. They then slather it with Cheese Whiz and top it with chopped prime rib steak. It's a great cheesesteak, and their cheese fries are an incredible addition to an already filling meal. It's a little on the pricey side, but so are all of the big name cheesesteak places (Pat's, Geno's, Tony Luke's, and Jim's). It's also unfortunately a little out of the way for a lot of people, but if you are just visiting the city I would absolutely recommend you try it. I give it four stars simply because there are better options in the city when you have time to explore. Jim's is delicious and probably my favorite of the big-4, with Tony Luke's and Pat's tied for 2nd. Overall, it's a great place for tourists to visit, and the fun of choosing a side on the Pat's vs. Geno's war is half the reason to go. If you live in the city, there are better options, cheaper options, and a lot of preference to be had. But everyone should try Pat's at least once, as well as Geno's for the comparison.
