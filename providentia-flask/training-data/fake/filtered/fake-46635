As a current student at the College of New Jersey Wildflower's is the one and only choice when going out to eat. Their hodge podge appetizer, anti pasta and buffalo pizza is top notch. It is a low key environment so no need to get dressed up. The reason for taking two stars away is the service. I have been going here for the past four years and the service has always been the same, okay at best but always poor. Forget about getting a quick refill on your drink because it won't happen. About 98% of the time I always find myself thirsty when eating and end up having to go to the bar for a refill because the waiter/waitress never comes by. I recommend going but don't be surprised by their awful service.
