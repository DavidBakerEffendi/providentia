Fancy in all the right places. A friend and I checked out In Riva last week and had good food and the best service I've ever had.  The burrata caprese salad was my favorite.  We also had beef cheeks after I asked the server about the difference between a cheek and a jowl.  I was just expecting some adjectives like "better" or "fattier," but the guy explained in some anatomical detail how they were different, and how the differences would affect the taste.  I'd expect any server that knowledgeable to be an intolerable snob, but the dude was friendly and chill.  Speaking of which, the interior was cool, with exposed concrete and a few bright red details.  Good prices too.
