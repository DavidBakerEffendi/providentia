Best Thai food around.  The crab rangoon is the best I have ever had (no lies).  If you've never had Thai food, stick with the Pad Thai.  Not only is it amazing here, it's a pretty basic dish that you can get at almost any Thai restaurant.  However, after having the food here, you'll find every other other place merely mediocre.  LOVE IT!  (also, not sure why Yelp took down my previous review... I've been here quite a few times and love it!)
