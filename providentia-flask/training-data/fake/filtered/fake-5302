one of my fave restaurants in nyc.  Whatever negative things people say about this place, they are crazy.  The only problem is it's too good and too many people want to eat here, thus during the dinner rush (i.e. 7:00-9:00 time frame) be prepared for an hour to hour 45 min. wait at least. BUT it is totally worth the wait. This place hands down has the best jalapeno margs in the city.  As a resident of nyc for over 10 years and a mexican food addict and moreover someone who loves spicy food/drinks, I can confidently say that this place has some of the best drinks and food you are going to find in nyc.  my husband and I have never had a poor meal there, and we have now tried everything on the menu, including the desserts, everything is great and pretty well priced too.  If you like lamb, the lamb stew is incredible, and the chile relleno is really great.  Tacos are all delicious, my fave is the al pastor ones.  The guacamole is always fresh and delicious and never those big chunks of avocado that you find in some restaurants.  The tortilla soup is great too.  love love love everything about this place.
