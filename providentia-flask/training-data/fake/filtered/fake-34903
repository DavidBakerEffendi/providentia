Once is enough. I went here for a birthday party recently, and while the interior is lovely, the place is, after that, nothing to get excited about. And in some ways it's even worth getting aggressively irritated by it. Maybe we'll start with the big things first, like the hipster manager coming over to our table at the start and telling us that, hey man it's cool that you're here, really, just, y'know, hang out--BUT still you'll have to GET OUT at 9 because there's another group coming in. Standard uptight American push-you-out restaurant crap, which is especially unnecessary in this case given that this particular restaurant is clearly a money pit. The waiters were quite nice, but the clock was clearly ticking for the poor guys, evident in the way they more and more hovered around the table, whisking away wine glasses and half-finished desserts as 8:45 approached. Then when we get the check we notice that they had actually charged us TWENTY DOLLARS for making the RESERVATION! Maybe it's common practice nowadays, maybe I'm naive, but everyone around me was as surprised and offended by it as I was. And this is all to say nothing of the food, which was good but hardly worth the prices, given that "rustic" cuisine usually means you can make a lot of it yourself. I'm thinking especially of the unremarkable artichoke dip, the huge hunks of half-cooked onions for sides, and the dull green salad, which seemed to have come straight from a Whole Food bag of mixed greens and been dumped in a bowl. Not even the very fine trout could make up for the mediocrity of everything around it. On second thought, once is too much. Save your money.
