My Husband Lived here for 37 years. We meet in Las Vegas and for almost 2 years all he would talk about is THIS pizza... Im a little southern bell the best pizza i had was papa johns, I kept saying it cant be as good as you say it is... well lets just say.. He bought a Large, and i FINISHED THE WHOLE PIE MY SELF! I cant wait to go back and get some more... the greatest pizza ON EARTH!
