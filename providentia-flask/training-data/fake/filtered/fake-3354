First time I went my quesadilla was on point and delicious and crunchy. Next time I went I got a really soggy quesadilla that I did not enjoy eating.... I mostly just dipped it in guacamole to cover up the grossness. Went back again recently hoping I'd get lucky and get a crunchy one again but no it was soggy again and I was really annoyed.
