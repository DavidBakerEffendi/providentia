Frequent here every now and again on the weekends with my girlfriend.....Small place, greasy food (always good for the Saturday morning hangover). Kinda has the Mel's Diner feel to it. Truly not a place you're gonna get a fit & healthy meal. Â One of the pluses about Johny's is he'll pretty allow you create what you want...if its not too complicated. They cook it all up right in front of you! Make sure you DO have cash, because "you can't tip with a credit card" sucked for them the first time we went there, cause who carries cash these days????...its all about the debit/credit....it's 2012, Johny!
