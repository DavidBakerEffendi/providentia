Tom Collicio's Riverpark is definitely one of the best restaurant's in NYC. The views are spectacular and the food outstanding. My waiter's vocabulary was not only enticing but colorful and elegant. Words like succulent and sumptuous in addition to phrases like the onions atop one of the meals are like "the M&Ms of the onion world". He was right!!! The pork chop was perfect; the branzino was outstanding and the tuna tartar was to die for!!. I truly enjoyed the Riverpark experience and would return again and again and again.
