Two of my hiking groups eat here after hiking at noon on Saturdays or evenings after the movies.  We could not be more pleased. The service is excellent, the food is great and yes, the restrooms are clean.  The acess on and off route 84 could not be more easy and convenient.  My "adult" friends are extremely pleased with the establishment, including the food, the service and the cleanliness! Our waitress actually rememberd us after our first visit on the prior week, our preferences in food and that we needed separate checks. She constantly checked to see if we need anything more and that the food is prepared to our satisfaction. What more could you ask from a restaurant with a really "picky" bunch of diners?   And yes, we are sober when we eat at this diner!!
