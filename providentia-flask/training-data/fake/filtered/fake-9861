We couldn't get a brunch reservation, but decided to come anyways.  Success! We were lucky to get seats at the communal table. I didn't care much for a marinated shrimp that decorated my blo-ody Mary, but I enjoyed the lobster chili.  I thought portions were large, especially buckwheat pancakes special with sausage and eggs.  Crispy prosciutto slice on my friend's eggs benny was amazing!
