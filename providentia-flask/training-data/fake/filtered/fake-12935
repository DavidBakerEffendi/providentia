this place looks absolutely a mess. it is so dusty and dirty, one time i found a fly in my food, that was a major turn off for someone who hadn't ate in over 5 hours and was hoping for a pleasant meal. these new "owners" lied that the previous owner was just off having fun but everyone who knew george knew he would never have left the place in such terrible hands and thats who kept it up and running. these owners do not know well english and one of my friends had ordered from here another time and they told them that it was a 30 minute waiting time for delivery, and she had ended up waiting almost 2 hours for her 40 dollar order. One thing i can say about this place was that george the previous owner ran the place way better.
