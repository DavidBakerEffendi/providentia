Absolutely a fantastic place. I made a reservation through Open Table and let them know it was a special night for my wife and I as we were celebrating our 10 year anniversary. The host, waitress and manager went out of their way to make our experience perfect. The food was excellent. I had the hanger steak, my wife the tuna. The drinks, appetizers and service were top notch. This was my first time at Zinc and they made a true believer out of me. We'll be back again and again..
