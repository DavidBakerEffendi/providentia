I went to Moe's in New Haven for lunch today, it was not my first time there, and as usual, I loved it. The food portion was so generous I took half of my burrito home! Their free chips are homemade and delicious, add the salsa bar to that and you're in for a treat. The service is as friendly as it gets, speaking with the working-owners is always a pleasure, not often you find employees who actually carry a conversation with their customers and make you smile, well the staff at this Moe's is perfect for that...ooooh and their new frequent diner card (buy 9 entrees get 10th free) is a great bonus!! I will be back again and again :)
