The food and service were amazing!!! Took my wife there and it was great.  The appetizers were served quick and large portions.  The main course came and it was even better portions.  Definitely get your money's worth. We finished with flan which was off the chart!  We will definitely be going back there for sure and recommend to all our friends.
