Went here early last evening (Sunday) on the advice of other Yelpers. They were right about the mojitos--awesome!  (Too bad we weren't there for happy hour, but $9 isn't SO bad). The good news is that Sunday is 1/2 price taquito nite.  So that's what we ordered:  carne, pollo & camarones.  I didn't try the carne, but my husband scarfed them down.  Shrimp were the best, but all were good. Nice atmosphere, pleasant, attentive service.  Def. recommended.
