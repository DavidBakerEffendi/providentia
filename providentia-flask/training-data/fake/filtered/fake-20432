I was in my neighborhood with a friend and looking for a great brunch spot. We arrived around 3 pm and the place was packed. The hostess told us it would be a 10 minute wait to sit outside on the bunch and she will bring us in. After 30 minutes of sitting outside, my friend and i saw about 3 groups of people walk in and not walk back out. We could see from outside that they were friends of the hostess as she did everything possible to make space for them. Other people who came after us BUT before the hostess's friends arrived were waiting outside with us. So you can definitely say we were disappointed that this new spot in my neighborhood is already one of those places that really doesn't care for newcomers.
