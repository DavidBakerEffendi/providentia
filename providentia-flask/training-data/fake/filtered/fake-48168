I'm new to the city and have been looking fairly vigorously for a local bar.  Its difficult to wander around and keep up the pace of finding the next great restaurant in a city where things come and go like flies on a dead carcass.  I want a staple go-to where people are friendly and drinks and food are good.  Basically, I want Cheers, only a higher end version with a few more patrons.  On Friday night, I found it. The place was packed at around 10.  My friend and I squeezed up to the bar to get a drink and, fortunately for us, a seat.  I flipped through the menu and gazed longingly at the tons of scotch on the shelves behind the bar.  The bartender told me it was a Scottish bar.  Owners and all.  It all came together.  The food, the scotch, the cocktails (many scotch-based).   Service was good and friendly despite the incredible mass of people clamoring toward the bar in the well designed "industrial-quaint" space.  Servers were attractive and incredibly nice throughout the night.  Drinks were reliably good:  Blood & Sand, a Manhattan (stirred) and a Highland Park 12 with a beer (a "Gentlemen's Boilermaker", I was told by the barkeep) and some sort of glorified pig in a blanket to sop it all up (forgot the name of the dish, but it was delicious).  Definitely worth a visit.
