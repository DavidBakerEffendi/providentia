This place is terrible. It's NOT the oldest tavern in the city - it's built on the SITE where the oldest tavern once was. The atmosphere is nice and simulates a colonial decor, but the food and service were abismal....The hostess was scarcastic when we asked if they had a table for two.....she replied. 'we might' ---then we entered the dining room to see that the place was practically empty. We were there for lunch on a tuesday -yet the first 3 entrees we tried to order from the menu - we were informed they were completely out! We finally settled for a couple salads. We each ordered drinks and the beer I received was lukewarm and flat when served - so much for a refreshing drink on a very warm afternoon. The lunch entree we were served was miniature in size and topped with a few beets - totally sparse but very very expensive - Service was horrid. We waited and waited for our check while our waiter ignored us and was groveling all over table of six that came in long after we were seated. Again, the dining room was nearly empty. We left disgusted by the entire experience and headed back to our hotel where we got some real food - as we were quite hungry by then. Don't go to Fraunces Tavern. there are many incredible restaurants in NYC - This IS NOT ONE OF THEM!
