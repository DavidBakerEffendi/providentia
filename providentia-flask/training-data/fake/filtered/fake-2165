CROWD PLEASER Fun environment Party food Cute crowd Lots of bar seating (First come first serve) MENU FAVORITES: Try the grilled corn on the cob. It's covered in queso, lime, and spices. My other menu faves are the guacamole/ salsa house ceviche for starters And red snapper for an entree. Some of my friends dig the blood orange margaritas at El vez. They are made in house with fresh ingredients. You can order a pitcher too which is good for large parties. What I do not like: LIMITED DRINKS Do not be afraid to order off menu to get a better margarita. They have some great top shelf tequila. However, if you're not in the mood for margaritas or mojitos this bar does not have much to offer for mixed drinks or wine. DO NOT ORDER: The sea bass tacos On three separate occasions upset stomachs from this dish have occurred so I have Â sworn it off.
