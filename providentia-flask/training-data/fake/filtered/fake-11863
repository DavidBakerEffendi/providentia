We wish we'd found this place a week and a half ago because we're only spending 2 weeks in New York and we could have returned once or twice more if we'd found it earlier. Great atmosphere, if a bit noisy, a really nice place to have a family meal. We ordered the clam linguine with a side of mixed veg, which arrived on 2 great big platters just the right size for us to share (2 adults, 1 child). The waitress did warn us about the large portions beforehand and she didn't lie! The food was delicious rustic Italian fare, nothing too pretentious or pretending to be elegant, very much like you'd imagine a typical Italian mother would make for her family. The dessert menu looked really nice but we were so full from our pasta that we just wouldn't have been able to finish it. Our loss, no doubt! Our waitress was a real character, very entertaining and took good care of us. Recommended for groups or families - although if you're looking for a romantic meal for 2 you might not find the intimate atmosphere you were looking for at Tony's. Nonetheless, I'm quite sure there is something for everyone to enjoy at this great restaurant.
