Roberta's Plays the Music Loud That's about it. You can read about the food in other's posts. I've taken some people by this place b/c I live in the area and wanted my visitors to get a sample of what's going on. But Man, Saturday night, that music was loud, and like the granddaddy, I asked a nice man if they could just turn it down a bit, to which the nice man responded "we play the music loud." SO there it is. Roberta's is #1 in fancy pizza in East Williamsburg, with the atmosphere of an East Village bar (with a rooftop garden.) I like the place. The pizza is fancy and good, with a slightly carcinogenic crust. The service is casual, which means that it can be very friendly or just blunt. The atmosphere is getting crowded, and they are adding on areas to accomodate, such as the tiki bar and outdoor seating. Really, the place has a good energy. I was just cranked about that loud music, it was like a whole speed punk set. But then they switched to some nice 50's stuff and I was able to have a conversation with my foreign guests.
