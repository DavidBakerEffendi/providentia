I am truly sorry for this review . It was my first time coming to this spot and i am sad to say it is also my last . My order took about 25 to get to me ( chicken wings and fries ) when the food got to me , they dropped a wing on the floor , the waiter picked it up , went to the back n not even 5 seconds he comes back with a wing on a plate .... could it had been the same wing that fell on the floor , i dont know . then to top it off , as im leaving the restaurant , people spot a waterbug crawling on the floor and one of the servers step on it and keep on like nothing . For anyone looking for a good spot to eat , I do not recommend this place , i honestly dont know how they got an A grade , smh .
