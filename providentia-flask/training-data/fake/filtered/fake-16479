Awesome! What a perfect dining experience. Great atmosphere. Friendly and very knowledgable staff and a terrific menu. Too many great choices to pick from. We had 4 appetizers and three entres just to try them and each was better than the next. Diversity of items from classic french to down home and all were perfectly prepared and served. And in a really unique bar area. Great staff presence and our server knew details of each dish including ingredients (no allergy concerns!). Wide selection of ryes, bourbons and scotches. Unique specialties. Desserts were KILLER! Really can't wait to go back!
