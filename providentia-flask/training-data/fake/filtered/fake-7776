A buddy of mine and I were waiting for our drinks here, and we figured it would be fitting to write a yelp review while we waited for our drinks.  What I had failed to consider, is that War and Peace could have been written while waiting for drinks here.  The ambiance is adequate and the outdoor deck has overhead heaters, which is good.
