Yes, this is a little biased as I live in the neighborhood but I must say I walked away feeling so pleased that it wouldn't matter where this place is located. Service was attentive across the board (quickly had our wine on ice, water always full, wine glass always full, friendly). When you think miso soup you don't really expect anything unique. The clam miso soup was a welcomed option and was a delicious, savory soup. The clams came in the shell which gave you a nice sign that they were fresh. I didn't know what to expect with tuna tartar but I'm pretty sure I'll order it again on the next visit. A salmon-colored form of tuna-deliciousness. I don't know how they make it or really care to, but it was just a really nice flavor (much more easily enjoyed than the beef equivalent). We asked for a little extra of the mayo-type thing on that was drizzled on top as that added to it so nicely. In terms of sushi, I decided to go with 3 rolls. At this point it is worth noting that I was with my wife and this quantity of food had us stuffed. Rolls were a Fire Dragaon, the Kidari and a Philadelphia. All beautifully presented, substantial and tasty. I particularly liked the jalepenos on the Kidari. In the world of good sushi I've had in my lifetime, this stands up if not out.
