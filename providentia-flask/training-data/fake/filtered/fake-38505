Was very excited to try A Kitchen for breakfast during the week to beat the weekend brunch crowd.  Arrived at 10 am Friday with my son and husband.  There were about three other tables there eating so service should have been better. I had pancakes with apple compote.  They were Luke warm and no apples.  I asked the server about the fruit and she was clueless.  I asked her to check in the fruit.  She came back and said they were put of apples (this is September apple season!).  Didn't offer another fruit -- I had to ask what they had and she said berries.  Well she brought me a side of jelly. Husband had the raved about homemade sausage egg sandwich.  Cane out again luke warm looked like it was tossed on the plate.  Came with nothing!  Not a side of fruit, some greens, maybe some potatoes.  Just the sandwich on a plate.  It was ok but he was still hungry so ordered a $4 side of potatoes that were undercooked. Oh and I forgot to mention the hot chocolate  I ordered when we first sat down.  Came out at end if the meal.  I like my breakfast drinks before the meal when I sit down. Not a good experience.  I will not be back.
