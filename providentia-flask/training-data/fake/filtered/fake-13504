I have eaten here twice. Once a year ago, and once recently. I have to say that I don't predict I will be eating here again. The service was terrible. I asked our waitress for certain sides that I never received, yet she didn't forget to charge us for them. Service aside, the first time I ate there, it took forever for our food to come out. When it did, the crispy taco shells were soggy; it was clear they forgot to bring the food out. The more recent trip was much faster, but the food was just Â still disappointing. The ground beef taco I had was flavor less and the beans just gross. My husband had a salmon burger that tasted way too fishy. I will say that their salsa bar was pretty good. The spicy ranch is delicious.
