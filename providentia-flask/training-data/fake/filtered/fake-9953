walking in looks nice and inviting but once you get in and see why you'll understand.  for one there was no one in there.  Both dining rooms empty maybe two other tables.  there is way too much staff on for the amount of customers coming in.  Prices are outrageous for bloomfield you are not in NY or montclair for that matter.  I had the crab cake for an app probably the smallest I have ever seen, and nothing to rave about.  For my entre I had the shirt steak, it was good but definitely overpriced for the portion.  the fries made the dish and when your eating a steak you want that to be the best thing not whatever accompanying it. my girlfriend had the lobster bolognese, $31 for little pieces of lobster with spaghettini trying to be al dente, yea it had too much of a bite to it.   then for desert we had the deep fried brownie, I heard good things about it from a friend that went and they were good but still was nothing I need to go back for... Won't be going back.
