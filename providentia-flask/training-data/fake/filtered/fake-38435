well i must warn as many as i can!!! i had my birthday party at zinc and the food was ok but the staff was "ok" not really on point. the worse thing of all was the face that my bill was $62.72 but when i checked my account 2 days later they had charged an additional $150.00 to my account for no reason at all. they had no right to do this. i am fighting it now with them and they hang up on my and lie elizebeth and donna the owner know they are in the wrong but they lie and lie! this is such a wrong thing to do to a person. and from what i hear i am not the first one they have done this to. please if you plan to eat there and you should not, take cash!! and be preped to deal with the bottom of the barrel. there are so many other great places in new haven to eat.
