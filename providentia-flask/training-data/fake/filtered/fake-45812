Peppercorn's Grill is one of my favorite restaurants. This is not a pasta and  meatball restaurant, although the house made pasta and the veal meatballs are delicious! Some of my favorites are: Apps ~ the veal meatballs, the calamari with a sweet aioli dressing (ask for extra!) Entrees ~ Pork Osso Buco, (offered on the daily special menu occasionally, the veal one is on the regular menu) the meat so tender you don't need a knife, seasoned to perfection, Seafood Risotto, a light and fluffy risotto with shrimp, mussels and  fabulous tasting, Salmon Salad  a lunch time favorite, lobster bisque, always with big chunks of sweet lobster, Mare Caldo with a broth so delicious you will want to "sop it up" with the restaurants fresh house made Italian bread . Desserts: ~ If you have had true biscotti in your life you will appreciate the amazing Biscotti that Peppercorn's makes. It is authentic tasting and delicious.  Summertime, the Italian Sundae hits the spot with the house made gelato and fresh fruits. The chocolate bread pudding is a piece of warm chocolate/fudge type of cake with a bourbon custard sauce and the Tiramisu, (this is the only place I wlll eat tiramisu)..lady fingers soaked in espresso with a mascarpone custard layering. Seasonal favorites ~(summer) zucchini blossoms, a zucchini flower deep fried with cheese and pepper filling, simply made but with a complex taste (winter) chocolate covered figs, figs soaked in Grand Marnier then dipped in chocolate, do I have to write any thing else? I could on and on but you're mouth is probably already watering...oh and they have free parking !
