The NoMad is one of my favorite establishments in the city. This review is only on the NoMad Library which is the upscale bar within the NoMad Hotel. This is a bar that you want to go to with a small group of people before a night out. The bar is not huge and it gets pretty crowded. The drinks are great. The wine selections are impressive. It's very intimate and cozy and the bartenders are very knowledgeable of their craft. Had many great drinks here multiples times. Great mint juleps here and even better mojitos. The price is what you would expect for an upscale establishment. The bar is adjacent to the NoMad restaurant, if you haven't been able to get a reservation at the NoMad Restaurant you can try getting food at the bar. I saw a couple of people enjoying the oh so famous NoMad chicken at the bar. The service is great, the drinks are strong, the establishment is cozy. Feels a lot like any place in Chelsea, London, while still being in NY.
