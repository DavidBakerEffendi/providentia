Great place, very noisy though. Make your reservation in advance. People were waiting a long time for a table. The food was delicious and they have a basic wine list for $15-30 bottle if you ask for it otherwise they will give you a huge book which contains very pricey wine. I will definietly go back when I in NY. Love it!!
