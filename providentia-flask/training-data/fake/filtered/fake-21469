Love, just love this place. Fresh and delicious! Tried the shawarma and the steak, never disappointing. Very authentic food i love the fact that the pitas backed on the spot. can't get any fresher than that. Also great customer service! The only thing is the limitations that they have on the salads, you can have only one salad (charging $1 for extra) but hey its NYC.
