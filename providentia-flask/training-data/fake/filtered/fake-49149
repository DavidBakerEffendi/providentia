This restaurant is EXCELLENT.  I'm from New York and my girls live in Boston so we decided to meet halfway for Easter dinner.  The food was absolutely delicious.  We liked it so much that my husband decided to have a surprise 50th dinner for me there.  Everyone in my family enjoyed it and said it was worth the 90 minute drive. Every entree was great but to name of few favorites...pork tenderloin, boneless short ribs, and scallops.  Don't forget to get the garlic cheese bread and a side of mac and cheese! The entire Salute staff was courteous and the service was top notch.  Special thanks to Jimmy and our waitress Darienne.  They were so attentive and accommodating and really helped make my birthday special!!
