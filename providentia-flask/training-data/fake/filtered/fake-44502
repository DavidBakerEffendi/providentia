I was born and raised in India. I came to Philadelphia 5 years ago to study Hospitality Management and started my quest for Indian Cuisine places. My family owns and operates a fine dinning Indian restaurant in my home town so I have a pretty good knowledge about Indian food. From all of the places that I have tried so far, I really like Karma's food. My all time favorite is Butter Chicken and every time I eat Â this at Karma, it reminds me of Butter Chicken from back home. I have never tried it's buffet but I assure you that you will like the food-very tasty and full of flavor!!
