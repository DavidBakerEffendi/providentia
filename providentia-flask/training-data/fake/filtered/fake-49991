My husband I just moved to the neighborhood and thought we'd give Hearth a try. Apart from the company and the cocktails (kudos to the bartender for lifting my overall rating from a 0 to a 1) it was a tawdry and particularly low-rent experience. The service was not only lacking but obnoxious (specifically the guy in dreads who was snooty and had no sense of tact) and the food honestly among the most bland and uninspired I've had. Also, who picks up the check prior to the customers leaving? Tacky. Ugh. Blah. I can't help but wonder what previous reviewers are comparing to? McDonalds?
