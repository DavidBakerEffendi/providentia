Looking for a cozy café/ eatery with authentic cappuccinos and other coffees, homemade desserts and fresh food from the grill? This little gem, in the heart of Harrison's Latin enclave, is the best kept secret around! The staff are young, friendly and attentive. The price is just right.  Can you say mom-n-pop, Old World and 'hip' all in the same sentence? Just say "Terra Brasilis!"
