Ok, this place has great dinner and is fun on the weekends but DONT EAT BRUNCH HERE!!!! EVER! I go here regularly for brunch (not my choice) with a group of people and after today, Im done. They have never had great brunch service, the food is usually meh... and they run out of random things all the time. Today: we had a large group but are usually one of the few there at all, we got our food in 3 different time frames. Mine came an hour later after everyone else was done. They somehow forgot 2 of our orders. After 30 minutes of waiting for coffee I asked for I went to the bar to get it myself. They ran out of waffles somehow even though no one eats there. So apparently as a restaurant they dont have flour and eggs....? Really?? One time I went there and they didnt have sugar! No sugar in the whole place?! How is that even possible?? They have a small menu that never changes, no specials.... Thats fine, I get it, brunch isnt your thing- but then DONT SERVE IT! Either do it right or dont do it at all. How can service be so bad when they hardly have customers? I have never written a bad review about anyplace about anything but this time I signed up for Yelp because I am just so sick of the crappy brunch service here. If you want to try this place out, go for dinner, it is 100x better.
