I used to go every thursday night! last couple of times it was not good! and the portion is getting smaller and smaller and its not cheap! So last night i gave it one more chance - pulled pork portion is even smaller! brisket is smaller and dry and the bread is stale and surprisingly not busy at all! i wonder why......
