I experienced Max Brenner for the first time for lunch today as part of the restaurant week promotion. It was sparsely populated with diners and we were seated quickly after being greeted with a complimentary chocolate-covered pecan, which was tasty. For an appetizer I had the bacon chicken cheddar bites with a maple glaze, which I feared would be overly sweet but had great flavor: nice and salty from the cheese and bacon and with some sweetness from the glaze. My companion had the white corn croquettes, which I tried and were also good. My entrée was a steak panini with caramelized onions, baby spinach, asiago chips and peppers. The bread was great and the steak was tasty, but it could have used more peppers to feel less one-dimensional, and this coming from someone who isn't very adventurous with food. She got the traditional pizza, which I thought had a nice bright sauce and good cheese but was lacking in basil. My dessert was the "chocolate chunk pizza," which is on the edge of false advertising, as it was neither particularly chunky nor chocolaty. A thin layer of melted chocolate lay between a bland, thick dough and an overwhelming layer of marshmallows. The dessert would be much better served with more chocolate and scaling the marshmallow back to some sort of drizzle. She got the banana split waffle, which was another story entirely. I don't like bananas but tried a piece of waffle with the ice cream and chocolate ganache, and it was phenomenal. I regret not ordering it. Service was a bit slow, especially getting our order and taking the payment, but generally attentive. Décor was lovely, and the overall dining experience was enjoyable. I would absolutely return; I'd just want to order something different next time to see if I get different results.
