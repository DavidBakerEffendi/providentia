Even thou I love their hot dogs, as a paying customer if I order a dog all the way I expect to get it my way, at Rutt's you have to buy the chilli seperate....WHAT'S UP WITH THAT? I don't understand how a resturant can't give it to you the way you want. I'm glad theat Falls View still cators to thier customers.
