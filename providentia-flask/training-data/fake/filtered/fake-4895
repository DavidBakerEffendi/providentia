This place is pretty happening. It does get a lot of overflow from Frankford Hall but this place stands on it's own two feet. It's got a great ever changing beer selection, the food is pretty phenomenal and there's a live music scene. They're always playing some fantastic music on Vinyl, music snob or not if you've got any kind of ear for sound you're going to love it.
