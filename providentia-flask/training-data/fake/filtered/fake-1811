After listening to the story of why is called La Pulperia we even love this place more. We had lunch on wdnesday and it was an amazing experience, despite been seated near to 4 old crampy ladies complaining that they had to get on time to the theater so they could get something free!!! Our server "G" was very attentive and kept a smile all the time despite the hard time this 4 ladies were trying to give him, why people go to restaurants with attitude?? We ordered El Chilango by our server recomendation and it was just amazing!!! I don't drink cocktails ever and I have to say I felt in love with it!! The lobster taquitos were amazing, the music the lighting and again the personal and caring service that "G" gave us put this place in our number 1. Choice for our future visita to NY. I wish we have places like that in NC!! We will definetly come back!!
