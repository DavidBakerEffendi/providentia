I went there on Sat around 12 to eat lunch since my wife suggest to me to this rest. First impression the waitress is so rude with her answer when I asked her something about the menu since this is my first time here. I don;t care about the price of the food and how good the food, but if the service is like that there will be no second time come to here.
