HENRY: I felt he used too many onions, but it was still a very good    sauce.   PAULIE: Don't put too many onions in the sauce.   VINNIE: I didn't put too much onions in, Paul.   VINNIE: There are only three small onions. This scene illustrates a point about pizza sauce in general and Lombardi's sauce in particular. Lombardi's uses San Marzano tomato puree simply on their pies. That's it, no herbs or garlic or onions. I think the people who dislike this kind of pizza prefer round table which isn't horrible. Round table is good sometimes. I think the price is what it should be. I got a small pizza and I left fulfilled and without leftovers. Bring cash. Order the meatball. Get a sangria. And don't put too many onions in the sauce.
