I had ordered from this Pio Pio in the past, and I must say that the chicken is second to none. That being said yesterday I ventured out , and ordered the Causa rellena de cangrejo. A total disappointment to say the least. The potato was dry, and it looked like it had been sitting in the fridge for a couple of day. Presentation was way below average. I was totally disappointed. When ordering food from here stick to the chicken. I definitely would not dare to order anything else other than the chicken. so sad.....
