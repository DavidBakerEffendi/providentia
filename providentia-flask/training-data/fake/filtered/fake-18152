Prime 16 is fantastic.  It's location, directly across the street from the Omni-New Haven hotel makes it very easy to get too.  Keep in mind, the place gets crowded, very crowded.  They do take reservations for a parties of 6 or more.  Without a reservation expect to wait during peak hours.  After 6 pm we were waiting approximately 90 minutes for our table, with a reservation, we had no wait time.   If you are a beer fan, you will love the endless selections of beers, banana bread to lager, stout, and your more traditional american beers.   The burgers are the reason you go to Prime 16.  They are out of this world.  They offer a large selection of burgers and several types of french fries...Keep in mind some of the burgers are so popular they actually occassionally will run out of some of the ingredients.  They also offer a nice selection of wings and other tavern style appetizers.   Although the appetizers are great, I would avoid them, because the burgers are HUGE.  Service is also excellent.  This is truly a "gourmet burger" establishment.  If you want a quiet dining experience, try Prime 16 during non-peak hours, otherwise, it is loud, but the tables are spaced enough and separated from the bar, so the experience, regardless of what time you go is enjoyable.
