WOW today was my first time at Vesta and needless to say I will be a forever returning customer! My experience from top to bottom and from food to service was absolutely flawless..I'm talking even down to the selection of drafts beers to the perfect taste of my coca cola. Our bartender and server Chelsea was amazing, she topped off the experience with a delightful attitude and unmatched professionalism. It all left an impression on me and I will most definitely be referring people I know! If I were you reading this right now I'd be on my way already!!!
