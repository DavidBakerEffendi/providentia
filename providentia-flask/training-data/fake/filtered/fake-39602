Lunch with my friend. Only two other groups. Not busy. The flavor of the food is unique. The greasy sheep milk ravioli and good simple salad . Confusion whether who was to take orders and serve. The uniforms need to be adjusted. Reservation was quick, got seated immediately upon arrival. Took a while to order food.
