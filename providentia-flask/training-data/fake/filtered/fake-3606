Another great Italian restaurant. Been here a few times. I have tried a few different meals here but I love the veal. It melts in your mouth. Always perfectly cooked. Also, the mussels and asparagus app is cool and the bone marrow is a must try. If you are into seafood, I would recommend the wild stripe bass. Staff here is very professional and this place is always packed. Love everything about it.
