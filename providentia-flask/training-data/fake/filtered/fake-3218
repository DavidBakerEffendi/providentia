I heard so much about this food truck and decided to give it a try. The food is simply the best. What's even more is it's so cheap. They serve a big portion for $6. We tried the lamb over rice and the chicken combo. Came with some lettuces as well. I ordered extra white and red sauce. Be careful, the red sauce is extremely hot. The line was a little bit long but worth every minute of waiting. You can't resist the smell of the truck. There is no seating and they only accept cash, but getting the food and walking around trying to find a place to sit and eat is part of the experience. These guys working behind the truck are very fast. They are very entertaining and make great food for a more than fair price. I am glad i tried this cart. First thing on the list when visiting New York.
