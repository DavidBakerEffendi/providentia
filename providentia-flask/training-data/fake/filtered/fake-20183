This is an awesome german/austrian restaurant with small bar type food.  they do not take reservation and can get packed rather quickly especially over dinner or the weekend.  They serve lunch also and I would say that's the best time to hit it.  The place is empty during lunch hours. Things to rave about: Service: fast and friendly Beer..a nice selection. Pretzal...best pretzal i've had. Aufschnitt Teller cured meats / spreads / home-made pickles (love it) "Katja's Ruben" Pork Belly cabbage / cheese / pickles / mustard sauce   Austrian Meatballs
