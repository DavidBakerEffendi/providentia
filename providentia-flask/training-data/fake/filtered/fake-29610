I'd been yearning for more of their biscuits n gravy since pies n thighs closed; went today and had a dining experience that wouldn't have made me such a fan had I been served the same meal a couple years ago. I was very surprised at how small the portions are. The biscuits n gravy were half the portion they were at the old location. And at $8 they don't include any sides. The pie slices are tiny as others said. The sides portions were small too. I was still hungry walking out their door. Back to the biscuits & gravy, the dish was cold and not as flavorful as it used to be. I think their printed menu and pricing Â needs rethinking. If they want to do an a la carte menu (like Turkish or tapas places) because that's what the menu really is, you have to choose and buy separately your sides, then they should just do that. Instead we go in expecting to be filled up and we weren't so it's a letdown.
