I was driving to my girlfriends house one day and I spotted a Japanese restaurant named Yummy Sushi and decided to give it a try. The atmosphere there was very casual and family friendly. Me and my gf decided to sit down at the sushi bar and chef Tony recommended us a yellowtail Jalapeno with yuzu sauce. I have to say it was one of the best yellowtail dish I've ever had. The citrus yuzu had a sweet and sour twist that brought out the yellowtail's natural flavor, it was my favorite dish of the night. We also had a kitchen hot appetizer, the chicken lettuce wrap. The lettuce wrap was rich in flavor and Â a bit spicy just the way we wanted. For entrees, we ordered a house special yummy roll and robinsville roll. Both rolls were very tasty and unique. The yummy really claim its name yum yummmmmm. The servers were also very attentive and friendly and the price were worth it.
