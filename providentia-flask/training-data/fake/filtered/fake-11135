We had a very unpleasant experience with the hostess at La Pasta and La Pizza.  The restaurant was 80% empty at 11:30am.   The hostess refused to accommodate two additional guests.   She did seat a group of six where five of the guests promptly left and one person sat holding the table.   After the hostess' rude spiel about how tables couldn't be held that was the height of inconsistency.   Is this encouraged by management?  Did money need to cross hands?
