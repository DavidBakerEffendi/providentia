This place serves authentic menu that could even beat any Chennai's dive place with the number of options to choose. Â But, what lacks is the taste of the food to match the price that they charge(bit pricey for a dive). I've tried Biryani couple of times here, it tasted like tamarind rice. It would be really hard to convince myself to go there again.
