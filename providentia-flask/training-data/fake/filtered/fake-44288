I never, ever eat Chinese food in NJ. If I want Chinese I make to trek to NYC and head to Mott & Cannal St. to Wo Hop.....the best. I thought all Chinese food in NJ was all the same......just plain bad. WOW, was I ever wrong. I stumbled onto Yao's and will never make the long trip to NYC. The food here is beyond outstanding!!! I could care less about price. "Cheap food in never cheap" A quick look at the prices on the menu and the are far less than then the rest. Everything on the menu that we have had is simply put....the best! Last week my wife wanted to know where I wanted to go for my birthday dinner....NYC, Philly, AC, Northern NJ to a nice steakhouse??? No way, my choice was YAO's. The staff is family and Ping our waiter get a 10 ouft a 10 rating! How lucky we are that we live just 1 mile away!
