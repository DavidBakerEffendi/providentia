Last night, I was excited to attend an event at Bar but left disappointed after dealing with an overzealous bouncer. Although an 11-year old child was allowed into the bar area, the bouncer demanded that every black patron--even those of us with grey hair--show identification.This is the 2nd time that I have visited Bar and was accosted for my ID while white patrons were not. As much as I love Bar's pizza, I cherish my respect even more. I don't see myself returning to Bar until there is an end to the systemic profiling of black patrons.
