This was our first time at Front Street Bistro.  We went after the movie, which we also enjoyed, so it wasn't crowded.  Service was great.  Our waitress Shelby was just adorable.  She was attentive and engaging.  The food was excellent!  Everything was fresh and delicious.The prices were very reasonable. I loved the shrimp cakes and the wine sampler was awesome and a great price. The home made chocolate chip cookies and ice cream were wonderful too! We were treated to kareoke with some great local talent from the Hart School of Music. Just a totally enjoyable evening.  I look forward to our next visit!
