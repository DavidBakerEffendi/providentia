The noodles are so perfectly cooked. After the wait, extra noodles definitely complete the meal. The place is pretty clean for an overwhelming hole in the wall eatery. For those who can't stand the wait for a long time, you should plan before heading there. Individual fans who compete for a seat when eating alone are awesome. For those who need air conditioned space to enjoy your food, this is definitely not the atmosphere for you..
