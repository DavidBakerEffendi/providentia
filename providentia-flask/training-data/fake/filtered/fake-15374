I had Dinner here Saturday with my husband.  We are big time foodies and love to try new places all the time.  I read the reviews and took the advice of others who had enjoyed their experience here.  The place was cozy and had a great feel, I especially enjoyed sitting on the patio.  My only problem was that it was small on the upper level and the tables were so close together that it was near impossible to pass between them without disturbing the neighboring table.  That being the only negative I would highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone.  The Avocado fries are something that everyone who likes avocado should try at least once as it is an experience to have them in such a unique preparation.  The skirt steak which was highly recommender was cooked perfectly and all the fixings were full of great flavor.  The presentation was creative but a bit cumbersome, nothing to cry about as the food was delicious.  I am not a big enchilada person by any means but I can't lie, they were so amazing I would have them again and again.  Almost forgot we ordered the appetizer special which was a BBQ short  ribs with corn on the cobb.  The ribs were so tender they fell right off the bone and were so tasty.  the corn was coated in a grated cheese and some kind of flavored cream/butter, again no dissapointment the dish was great.  I am a big fan and truly enjoyed the entire experience.  Good company and great food ca't be beat.
