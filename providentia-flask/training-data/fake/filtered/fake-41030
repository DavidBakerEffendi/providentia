I feel that all components of Lombardi's pizza is amazing. The crust is out of this world, the tomatoes that they use in the making of the sauce seem like they must have been hand picked from someone's garden, the cheese divine and the meat superb. The fact that it is cooked over coal and is one of the few places in the city that allow that is icing on the cake. I also love the packed atmosphere on the weekends. Lombardi's gets an A+ from me!
