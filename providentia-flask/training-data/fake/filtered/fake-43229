UNRELIABLE, the food was NEVER delivered! So initially we placed an order for pickup, but when we went to collect it, we were told it never left the front desk. Since our little one was already hungry we asked them to deliver. We called them 45min later only to be told the sushi would take more time. Since we were all starving by then, we asked them to deliver without the sushi. The person told they would get back to us in 5min, but never called neither delivered.
