Been here a couple of times, but not in a while. First, they only take cash or Amex (unless this has changed recently). A real, solid venue. The atmosphere is romantic with all of the candles and the fireplace (even though it seems that it is popular with groups). The food is excellent. I enjoyed all of the dishes. Service was very good. Looking forward to going again.
