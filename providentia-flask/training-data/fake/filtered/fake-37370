I am not a huge sandwich goer but after this sandwich I appreciate sandwiches more.  I work in Midtown and on most days I get a Subway foot long sandwich for $5.  Not only do these sandwiches cost less, they taste 1000X better.  Fresh ingredients, great sauces, plenty of meat, and decent bread make this a great sandwich.  I wouldn't think Asian and sandwiches go together, but then I remembered the French influence on the Thai.  Mayo and baguettes both come France.  The baguette isn't top quality but has a crunchy outside and soft inside.  Get your sandwiches spicy!
