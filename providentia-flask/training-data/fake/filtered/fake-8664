Who cares about the food when you have to wait 65873906790236 years to get in? The hostess has no clue what is going on so good luck trying to score a table. Totally infuriating for just meh food. The line of hipsters around the corner just shows you what suckers people are for hype. Go to Guerro's around the corner instead. You will NOT be sorry! And you can even sit down! Woo Hoo!
