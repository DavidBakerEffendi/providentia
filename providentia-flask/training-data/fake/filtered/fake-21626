their chicken cutlet belly buster with spicy cheese is the best! made to order so it's super fresh. Consistently awesome. they make a good italian sub too. also super cheap for the amount of food you get. A full belly buster keeps me fed for a solid two days. just call in your order ahead of time and you wont have to wait so long.
