My wife and I went to this place right after lunch hours. We decided on eating here due to the good reviews we read on yelp. The restaurant was clean and the decor fit the style of food. First of all, we were the only people in the place. We were asked by the cashier in the front if we were eating in or taking out. We replied that we were eating in. We were then told we could sit down. We took our menu and started making our decisions. Never did anyone actually come to our table to ask if we were ready to order, wanted anything to drink or if we had any questions about the menu. After waiting for a good 10 minutes, I decided to just go up and order at the cashier. We ordered a chicken doner, gyro shawarma pita ($6.75) and a lamb shish kebab small ($11.00). The food came fairly quick, but wasn't too warm. The flavors weren't bad, but the sauces were what actually gave the food the flavor. The lamb was also pretty tough. We also checked in here for the free dessert. The choices were almond, rice or brown pudding or 2 pieces of baklava (the menu says 4 pieces, I was told we would only get 2). We chose the almond pudding, which was actually pretty good. The dessert was the best part of the meal. A big annoyance throughout our meal was the manager or owner who kept his cell phone on speaker the entire time right next to our table will being on hold so we got the great sounds of crappy elevator type music while we ate. In conclusion, the food was okay, the restaurant looked nice, but I would most likely never go here again as there are definitely better options in NYC.
