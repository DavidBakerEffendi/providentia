Cafe Antonio's is such a nice place with great food and service. I love that it is bring your own bottle. I had the Pork Au Zu tonight and it was mouth watering. The food is amazing and our waitress Â Gina was so sweet. I would go back to this resturant for the service alone. Thank you Gina for making us feel like we were with family.
