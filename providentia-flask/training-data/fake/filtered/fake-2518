The good - food is really tasty, top quality ingredients (prosciutto, parmesan) and well prepared.  Wines are good and not too expensive The not so good - the place is always packed, and they squeeze in so many tables it is zoo-like.  The service sometimes can't keep up with the crowd. I will go here again but only if it's 3/4 full or less.
