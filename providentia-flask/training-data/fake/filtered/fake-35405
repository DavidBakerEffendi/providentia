We ate at Trattoria Lincontro last night and it was amazing! I have to say, I don't think I have ever been to a restaurant with more nightly specials. We never ordered off the menu. We decided to have the waiter "feed us". He brought out a sampling of delicacies that tasted like heaven. My favorite app was the octopus - it was the best I have ever had. For dinner we had a bow tie pasta, langoustines and an artichoke dish. For desert we had "chocolate pizza" - delicious! We had a bottle of Italian wine that the waiter choose for us and it was great for the price ($38). I am still full and yet I can't wait to go back.
