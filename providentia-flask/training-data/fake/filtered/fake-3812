I was at Mes Reves with some East Coast family around August 2012. Suffice it to say that it was truly exceptional. The matradee, Tami, was very friendly and seated us promptly (it was around 10PM). Service was efficient and attentive. Ahhh now on to the food. We ordered a variety of dishes including seared duck breast, foie gras, and escargot to name a few. They were all outstanding. The duck breast was definitely the best duck I've ever had; it is prepared with a crispy, delicious layer of skin on top, leaving the meat moist and flavorful. The foie gras was served upon a bed of butternut squash, and like the duck breast, it was incredibly delicious. The escargot, which were served shelled in a porcelain pot, were cooked with kalamata olives and a garlic butter that added a lot to the dish. Overall, it was a fantastic dining experience, and I'll definitely be back next time I'm on the east coast.
