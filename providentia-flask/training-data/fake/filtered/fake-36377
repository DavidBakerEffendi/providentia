I had dinner at Scarpetta last night and the food was amazing. The creamy polenta was to die for and the burrata was great too. I had the duck and my boyfriend had the short ribs. Both were very tasty. The service was very good and the overall experience was great. Scarpetta is a perfect place to get great food and good service.
