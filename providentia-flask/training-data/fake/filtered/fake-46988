we had dinner there last weekend and it was a great experience. i wasn't even feeling like i wanted to go out for dinner, but once we got there i felt the opposite. the service is impeccable and the bread and the amuse bouches are really great and adds to the overall value of the meal! my husband had the pork chop and i had the cod and it was cooked perfectly, savory and delicious with beautiful veggies. superb execution. the only thing missing is the decor...there isn't any, and makes the restaurant a bit stark. i wish it had flowers or some other plants in the restaurant to give it that "grocery' feel :)
