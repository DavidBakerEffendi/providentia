Took us awhile to find and husband was getting frustrated. Once we got there we had second thoughts -- and just decided to stick it out. The food was delish -- had bánh xèo (shrimp and bacon crepe) and the portobello bánh mì (roasted with Havarti). But, not sure if we'd go back because seating was a problem. Maybe good for taking with you if you can order ahead.
