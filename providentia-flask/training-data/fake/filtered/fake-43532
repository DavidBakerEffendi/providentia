We went to the new Han on Saturday evening for appetizers and some cocktails. I've been to the Han in Exton for years so I was expecting the same quality of food. Not the case.....Dan Dan soupy, very little ground pork, wonton in chili oil, different type of chili oil, mung bean noodles- unrecognizable from Exton, tendon excellent, cucumbers in chili oil, way different.   If you want to have a chain of restaurants- consistency is key and I think they need some work here.  Tons of cooks in the kitchen,  just not as good.
