Great edition to Forest Hills.  Went here last Friday for Happy Hour and to watch the Knicks game. $5 craft draft beers was great during happy hour.  The place is lively and was just fun watching the Knicks game with good TV coverage.  The food was much more unique than your typical pub or bar fair and everything we had was very good and was fairly priced.  I enjoyed eating things that were a little more unique and having the option of enjoying a good craft beer over your typical run of the mill bud, bluemoon or coors is always welcome.  Steve (owner) and his staff seemed to be pretty on point for the packed Friday night and for opening less than a week.   For those who were disappointed because it was too loud maybe you should think twice before going into a bar with sports on the various screens.  Jack and Nellies on Ascan would probably be more up your alley.  Marking a place low for this reason is like me going to McDonalds and marking it low because it doesn't have fillet Mignon or going into a formal restaurant and marking it low because they have no TVs and I can't watch a game.  Don't mark a place low for what it is.   Station House is a step above your typical bar that carries an awesome selection of craft beers and whiskeys and is a great place to watch a game.  That's what it is and that's what it does well.
