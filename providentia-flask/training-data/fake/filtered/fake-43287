The ONE and ONLY time we were at Poor Henry's, Montville, NJ, we found the "sneeze guard" over the salad bar TOTALLY FILTHY!!!  Seemed that it hadn't been cleaned in YEARS!!!!  PLUS we found lettuce on the floor by the salad bar -- DUH!!!  SLIP HAZARD = LAW SUIT!!!  Atmosphere: DARK, DINGY, HORRIBLE!!! We've NEVER been back because of that!!!!
