I order at least two times per month from Rice Bowl. The food is delicious. My wife likes the fried bean curd and broccoli. My children always want the cheese wonton. I enjoy the General Tso's chicken--it's whole, gigantic pieces of white chicken meat. The staff provides excellent service. The establishment is well kept. The price is affordable. I believe they can be more generous with the shrimp servings, otherwise this is my favorite Chinese food location in Central Jersey.
