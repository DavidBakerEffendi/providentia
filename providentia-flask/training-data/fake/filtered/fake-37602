apparently the owner of the restaurant thinks its okay to mess up an order after an hour and a half wait time. He ALSO thinks its okay to call the girl who calls to complain about the mishap a "liar" and a "bitch." Oh and apparently he would prefer if you have a complaint that you "come and say it to his face because he doesn't talk to "telephone tough guys." The food was mediocre enough for me to never order from there again, the service was enough to make me give them a negative review. Anyone ordering from the grease factory that is Sargent Pepperoni should take this into consideration before giving them their money.
