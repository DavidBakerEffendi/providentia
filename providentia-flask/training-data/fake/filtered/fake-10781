I recently went to this place to get a burger one evening, and the service was extremely poor. One of the servers moved the condiments from my table after I picked up a bottle of ketchup to use on my food. For no reason at all..... She asked me with a rude tone of voice "Is there anything else you need?" I respond "I would like more burger sauce" My server gives me a blank stare and ignores my request. The food itself is pretty good I'll admit, but the service was terrible; I don't think I'll be going back there.
