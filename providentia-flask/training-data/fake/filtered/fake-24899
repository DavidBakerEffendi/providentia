Mr. Max, Max's has the best Calamari in NE that I have ever found. And I have been to lots of places.  So light, tender and sweet, and the sauce so delightful. Finished that with the scallop salad, a glass of pinot and what more can you ask for. I order squid almost eveywhere I go and get dissappointed 9 out of 10 times chewing rubber, tasting stale Pungent oil, or wincing from distasteful sauces. Will try more of the menu my next stop to W Hartford and might 5 star if I find equal or better wow. Ask chef if he would consider frying with  a mix of Jalapeno, Pablano, Red Onion and Cilantro. Could be even more smashing as I experienced in the Portuguese section of Newark last year. Hats off to the Chef. G
