Things have changed - unfortunately for the worst. I have been to this establishment numerous times over the last seven years, too many to count but they have lost the business of my family and I at this point. You were able to get just about anything you wanted if you paid for it - in my case it was unseasoned chicken on the quesadilla as certain spices and seasonings cause me great distress. Any time I ordered in the past - they would simply advise me that I would have to pay a slightly higher price for the chicken meat used in the fajitas and that was no problem for me - give me what I ask for and I will gladly pay for it. Today, my request was met by Sparky, a blonde haired, blue eyed, crew cut wearing stocky manager who told me it was for the customer's benefit that they (the owner's) no longer allow this to be done - in short I am not going to get what I want even if I want to pay for it. Sparky - news flash " I am the person who pays your salary" The jambalaya plate was a bit small, the quesadillas were soggy, the drinks consisted of a large glass of ice with about 4 oz of fluid. Sorry to see that this has gone to a corporate and forgotten the customer in its wake. Find a local place that values your money -
