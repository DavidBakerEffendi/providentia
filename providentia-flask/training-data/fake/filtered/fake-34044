Generous portions, always have room for you w/o a reservation, overall great dining option for Montclair that won't break the bank. Their pita is wonderful and they'll keep bringing you as much as you want. The entrees are huge and very dependable. The staff is friendly but sometimes there have been communication problems due to the lack of strong English speaking skills. That's okay, they're so friendly and it always works out!
