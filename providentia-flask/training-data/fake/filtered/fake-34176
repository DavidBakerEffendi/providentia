Ahhhh, Little Collins, or as I like to think of it, The Coffee Shop that saves Midtown East. This modern Melbourne coffee shop serves up the best coffee in town. Period. That one is easy . Go, order a cup of....well, anything and you'll agree. But here's what gets me - a place that's doing coffee this right could offer it with a pastry or two and call it a day. But not Little Collins. They also serve up some of the best food in the area. Here are my favorites (see pics for added effect): - The Smash - avocado, feta and chili flakes on thick toast with roasted pumpkin seeds on top. It's become my go-to breakfast. - Big Dill (breakfast) / Salmon Sandwich (lunch) - Breakfast version has eggs, but basically they're both super high quality salmon and on the lunch version, mascarpone cream mixed with dill, capers, and I'm not exactly sure what else, but it's possibly more addicting than crack.** - Chicken Sandwich - there's chicken, there's peas, there's caramelized onions. I don't know why it works, but it's ridiculously good. This place is awesome. The people are great. And it's surprisingly inexpensive. So, why are you still reading? **Not an expert.
