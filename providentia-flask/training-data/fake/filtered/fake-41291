Disappointing.  I used to eat here fairly regularly when I worked nearby and although the prices were a little above average, the quality was excellent. So wanting a change of pace, my husband and I went there recently on a Sunday night.  It was latish (8pm) and the restaurant was not busy (about half full). There seemed to be plenty of wait staff, but the service was the worst that I have had in years. It was well over 5 minutes before the waiter appeared to take our drink order and ages before the drinks arrived (although he appeared to hover over a large party that had ordered several bottles of wine).   We ordered a winter salad (Absolutely excellent, the highlight of the meal) and crab soup (also good, but a little salty) from the specials menu. The empty salad and soup dishes sat in front of us quite a while, until the server brought our main courses. My husband had the Bouillabaisse; it was OK but nothing to write home about; WAY to much stock in my opinion and it was served with a tiny slice of french bread. I had a fish dish from the specials menu. It was dry and completely unremarkable. I guess I expect a "special" to be, well, special. Back to the service, drink refills were not offered and when I asked for one it was slow coming, and again the empty dishes from our main course sat in front of us until the check came. I spoke to the manager as we were leaving.  She was very polite, and appeared concerned.  I hope she takes the opportunity to improve both the quality of the service and the food.  Maybe they put more effort into their weekday lunch crowd. Also Sunday night may not be the best time to expect excellent quality food, but one should be able to expect good service in a quiet well staffed restaurant. The winter salad and crab soup would almost make me go back, but the prices are too high for mediocre seafood poorly served.
