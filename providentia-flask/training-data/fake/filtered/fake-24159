I have never been more disappointed with management as I have with this restaurant. We took our daughter out for breakfast this morning and observed an old man holler at an infant telling it to shut the fuck up because it was laughing while enjoying breakfast with his mother. This poor mother was so embarrassed she left immediately and the manager did nothing! My husband and I also complained about this mans aggressive behavior. The manager sat down and had a nice laugh with the old man and did nothing about his inexcusable behavior. Extremely disappointing experience for a family restaurant, we will not be returning.
