I go used to go here for lunch about twice a week. Love the soup and sammy deal, not on the menu, you have to ask for it. Though I always regret going for dinner. Meat is always over cooked. I recently got some absolutely disgusting grilled escarole with my over done salmon and I haven't been back since. Stick with the specials.
