My friends and I came for lunch on a Saturday. We had a personal recommendation to try this restaurant, so we decided to give it a go even though it was out of our way. I am SO glad we did. Not only was the food INCREDIBLE, but the hosts/waiters were so attentive and gave us such a postivie & memorable NYC experience. As for the food we tried from the antipasta bar: 1. Scallop & shrimp salad:   best scallops I've had in my life. I'm pretty sure I made an obscene noise when I tasted them. 2. Meatballs: enormous and to die for 3. Roasted asparagus: excellent 4. Cauliflower Parm:  perfectly cooked I'm not sure what we did to deserve this, but the waiter treated us to a free bottle of Prosecco. I would have given 5 stars without that kind of treatment, but it was certainly icing on the cake.
