Try sharing the ramen and ordering extra noodles, great value! Amazing, amazing noodles and pork buns. we couldn't believe how good this was. The trick is to go for lunch so the wait times are not crazy. We were actually able to get a seat right away! The buns are probably the best I've had in New York.
