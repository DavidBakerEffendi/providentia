The Vegan Tree- previously known as the Loving Hut- is one of my fave places in the city. It is perfect for grabbing a casual lunch or dinner that is both healthy, delicious and vegan for a good price. I highly recommend their Eggplant and Tofu Burger with "cheese" (which is really not a burger at all)... I have intense cravings for this sandwich a little too frequently! They also have delicious vegan drinks, treats, pies, cakes, cookies, ice cream and more- all of which really super awesome too.
