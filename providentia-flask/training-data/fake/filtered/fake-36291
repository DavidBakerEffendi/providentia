Yakitori Boy is amazing in every way possible.  The staff is extremely helpful, friendly and knowledgeable about Japanese culture and cuisine and they really demonstrate a commitment to providing five-star customer service.  The management is very welcoming and accommodating as well.  The menu is very extensive and truly unique, being the only Philadelphia dining establishment to offer a fantastic assortment of authentic Japanese cuisine.  Every item I have ever ordered has always been delicious and exceeded my expectations.  I especially recommend specials such as the Rib Eye Yakitori, The Royal Roll (the best tasting sushi roll I've ever had), and the Ruby Tuna Wrap.  The sushi is always fresh and delicious.  I eat sushi often and can confidently say that Yakitori Boy offers the best, freshest sushi in the tri-state area.   Their specialty drink menu offers an outstanding assortment of unique alcoholic and alcohol-free beverages such as the Lychee martini and the Aloe martini, which are refreshing and highly recommended.  Not only is the food is very affordable, but they offer a Japas-style menu, which allows guests to try some of everything without worrying about wasting food or affordability.  The Japas Lounge on the second floor is an extremely fun time for anyone, regardless of age.  The environment is always fun and welcoming, and my friends and I always enjoy ourselves whether we are just hanging out in the lounge or in a private karaoke room.  This place is the best, and it truly offers its guests a one-of-a-kind experience and an overall great time.  On top of all this, their facilities are always kept very clean and well-maintained regardless of how much of a crowd they may have on a given night.  Yakitori Boy - Japas is hands-down one of the best things Philadelphia has to offer, in terms of night life, food and overall experience.
