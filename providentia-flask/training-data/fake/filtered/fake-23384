I know this is going to sound cliche - but this place is a hidden gem. My girlfriend took me here last week.  I hadnt caught up with her in years. It was the perfect place to sit, chat, drink wine and eat yummy italian food. The restaurant is cozy, dark and rustic. There's an open garden in the back with heat lamps and a separate downstairs seating area. We chose a spot right near the fireplace on the main floor.  The waitress could tell we were deep in conversation so she let us be and came in to check on us at all the right times.   We ordered pizza, cheese courses, olives, speck, wine, etc... it was perfect.  The crowd was down to earth and were there to enjoy the same things - good food and good company. Definitely check this place out
