Thank heavens for Kate's!  Every time I tear myself away from a favorite sandwich I find something else to which i can just as easily become addicted.  You will never lack for choice from this delicious menu.  I also love the convenience of picking up a chicken stir fry or cutlet for dinner that i know is freshly made and that my kids will love.  And the toffee is divine! As a long time Verona resident I am thankful that I now don't have to go to Montclair -- I can stay in Verona and have an even better meal right on Grove Avenue. Thanks for improving the quality of life in our neighborhood Kate!
