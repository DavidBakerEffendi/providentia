The restaurant is small and they just keep taking online reservations like they own the entire city block. Expect long lines and waiting at least 30 mins. Real bad experience tonight, Â made worse by the fact that we had with us my wife's sister and her two kids who are visiting us from our of town. This place used to be so much better. The only redeeming quality was that the food is still decent. Oh posted this too soon. They forgot one of our orders. So in summary, if you want to wait a long time for really poor service, this should be your place of choice.
