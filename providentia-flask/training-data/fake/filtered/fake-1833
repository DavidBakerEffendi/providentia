We ordered food for delivery and they estimated 45 minutes. It took over an hour and a half for food to come and the person on the phone said there was no manager and didn't know when one was coming in. The place seems to be I'll equipped to manage the volume of delivery and in house orders. I'm not sure any good is worth waiting this long for. When I finally got to speak with the host, he accidentally disconnected the line. The place is really disorganized.
