We were waiting for our son to get out of work to have dinner.  We checked Yelp and Salute came up as #1.  We found the restaurant and went in to check out the menu and ambiance.  We were greeted warmly and shown the outside terrace.  Everything was spotless and entrees looked fantastic.  We had some time to kill so we went across the street to the park.  When we returned the staff told us they had saved us a table on the terrace if we liked.  We sat down at the bar while waiting for our son.  Bartender was friendly and knowledgeable about their selection of single malt Scotch. It was Happy hour so we had a drink at the bar while waiting and talked with the staff.  It was a little slow when we first arrived but by the time our son showed up the place was packed for a Monday night with a line out the door.  My wife was extremely impressed that, as packed as it was, the owner remembered our names.  The cheesy garlic bread was fantastic.  We had the Shrimp Fra Diablo and one of the specials for the night - sea bass.  Everything was cooked perfectly and the wait staff didn't make us wait for a thing even though the place was hopping.  We didn't have room for desert but the owner sent us off with a bag of biscotti for our 2 hour drive home.  All in all this meal and the entire experience was fantastic.  The next time we are in Hartford we will definitely be back.  Highly recommended!
