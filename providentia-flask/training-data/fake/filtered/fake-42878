I can't express my extreme disappointment and anger towards this establishment. I come to 983 at least twice a week and what is with the staff . Some waiters and waitresses are nice enough - but the bartenders are miserable negative people - why am I giving them my money? Who owns this place? Who hires these bad vibers? I do not understand why these ppl are working here. I always feel like I'm begin for food and I should kiss their feet for getting a mimosa and chicken tenders, while paying them $30 for that. And ill always tip over 20% because I'm loving service worker too, but I bring my fun everywhere - including the workplace. I really want to talk to the owners - FIRE YOUR ASSHOLE NWGATIVE WORKERS AND TRY AGAIN.
