My wife and I went to meal last weekend on a recommendation from a friend and boy do I owe my freind a favor... This was by far one of he best meals I have had in a long time (Pun intended), and when I say MEAL that encompasses not only the food but the service, price, and atmosphere as well.. After being sat immediately We were promptly and enthusiastically greeted by a young fellow named Steven who informed us that we were in for quite a treat upon learning this was our first time at the restaurant. All I ask for in a waiter is someone who is nice and genuinely give a hoot about taking care of us, but this server went above and beyond and truly made sure that we were comfortable.  The menu had so many great choices that I didn't know what to pick but once again our sever helped push us in the right direction, after giving us a flawless breakdown of the specials he informed us that MEAL excels in steak dinners and how all the steaks on the menu are  of a specific high quality grade beef and they are cooked at a certain temperature with butter salt and pepper and that no matter how rare we liked our steaks it would still have that nice crispy char on the outside, but when they have special steaks they are usually very high quality.  He made the KC steak (bone in NY strip... Which I had no idea prior) accompanied by a full plate of goods as opposed to the normal ala carte sound so good that I couldn't refuse and let me tell you it was worth every penny, just as thue server said nice and red and juicy on the inside and perfectly charred and crisp on the outside, not to mention everything else was phenomenal as well ( French onion soup with sherry, truffled creamy blue cheese potato chips with bacon bits, tuna tartar, and my wife got the cowboy steak which our server said was his personal favorite from the regular menu, and our sides creamed spinach with almonds and truffle, sautéed mushrooms and beer battered onion rings). I know i have went on a bit of a ramble here but that is how good this place is, but now my fingers are starting to hurt due to my early onset arthritis so I will wrap This up... MY FINAL GRADES: Atmosphere - A Price - A Service - A++ Food - A +++ Bottom line: as soon as you get the chance go have a meal at MEAL( and from what I've heard they have a fabulous Sunday brunch also) you will leave with a smile and a full stomach and you will not regret it!
