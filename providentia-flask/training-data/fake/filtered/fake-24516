I have mixed feeling about ippudo. First of all ramen is supposed to be a low budget, quick eating type of food. My Japanese friends would be shocked to hear that I went out for ramen for dinner and even more so that I waited over an hour to eat it. But I love ramen so I had to eat here. That being said, the ramen was awesome. I had the akamaru modern ramen. The broth was the key. It had this creamy garlicky taste that makes it unique. The noodles itself were on par. The pork chasu was great. Nice portion, tasty, fatty...mmmm! I also had the pork bun and I agree with the other reviews that they are pretty fantastic too. They treat their pork well there! I've been to both totto and ippudo. Totally different places. The atmosphere in ippudo is more upscale and trendy. It was 15 bucks for the ramen which is dang expensive for a bowl of noodles. I would go back again, but it's not somewhere I would be going to every week. So my rating is solely based on the food. If I took account the price and wait it would be 3 stars.
