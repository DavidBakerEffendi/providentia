Thought this place was amazing! Stumbled upon it from the back alley street and saw a couple eating a awesome looking square pizza. I am always in search of a better pizza and it was amazing. It was a cool day so the let us sit a few restaurants down at the pub under the heat lamps because my wife was freezing. The manager was really nice there and they said the would take care of us and get us anything we want because it was all owned by the same people. Great pizza! Really enjoyed it. Thin crust, tasty, and cooked perfect! My wife and I ate the whole pie ourselves. Would definitely recommend!
