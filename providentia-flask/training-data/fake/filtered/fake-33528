Love and Sangria I recently discovered this place, twice visiting this place for drinks in the evening and yesterday, enjoying an amazing brunch for the first time (which in turn prompted me to write this review).   Confessional is truly a place to confess your thoughts, love of food and wine and my favorite, the mixogist's martinis.  To her, I say "hvala lijepa"!  Not to be outdone by their amazing drinks at night, the brunch sangria's were amazing.  I am not sure I can reveal their secret ingredient, so we just refer to it as the love ingredient.  They even let us create a few drinks, which a new friend Cat K posted on the cool board across the bar.  This is where one can write their confessions and any thoughts that come to mind.  The board and the decor just add to an amazing ambiance. Regarding the service, I have to say the bartender is great as a mixologist but also very natural in welcoming you to the bar.  Of course that was not a shock to me as the owner makes you feel welcomed and the hospitality of the rest of the staff just round out the pleasantries.   Now to the food ... I was so torn on what to get, that I wound up having three dishes so I can try their take on traditional omelettes and the Latin American dishes.  I am not biased in stating how great the food was because I did not get to the unlimited sangria and newly created shots til much later.  The chef is quickly gaining a reputation as the next star of Latin cuisine. So obviously, I recommend this place.  I doubt it will be a secret for long.  I cannot wait to get back there and have another amazing time ... hopefully finding love in the sangria.
