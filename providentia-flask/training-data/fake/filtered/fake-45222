I thought I'd give this place a try, as I never had Ethiopian food before. And although the food was decent, everything else was not. The service is horrible, by far the worst I've experienced in a while. First off, I was not greeted with a smile but rather with a hand gesture welcoming me to sit anywhere I want. As my boyfriend and I sat down, it took her 20 minutes to attend to our table. Granted I had never tried Ethiopian food before, I tried asking the waitress questions. All I got for my answer was "it's an enjera" in this dull and bored tone of voice. I gave up trying to inquire, and just ordered the rice dish. Â It took her another 20 minutes to bring out the waters, and about 40 after that to bring out our food. After we finished our food, it took her 10 minutes to bring out the check. Not only did they give me crappy service, but they also had the nerve to overcharge me. After I tried reasoning with her, she gave me that "no ifs and buts" attitude and made me pay the check as is, without adjusting it. As soon as I got my change back, I got up and left rather pissed and unsatisfied. If you don't mind being at a restaurant for about 2 hours and getting crappy service, you are more than welcome to try it. I, on the other hand, will never come back to this place again.
