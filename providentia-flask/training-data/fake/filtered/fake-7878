As leaders of a local congregation in Hamden, often times we need special event catering and Sandra's Next Generation Restaurant has always surpassed our expectations. From impeccable professionalism and quality customer service, to luscious finger-licking meals, Sandra's keeps us coming back. Â  If Sandra's Next Generation's service to us and our congregants is an accurate barometer of their future business accomplishments, we judge that Sandra's will not only fare quite well but also excel in their endeavors, and we highly recommend and encourage others dine with them.
