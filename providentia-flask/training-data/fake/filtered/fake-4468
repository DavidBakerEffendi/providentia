I like it here a lot, it has become a weekly ritual!  Good sushi, service and ambiance all within walking distance, what else could I ask for.  It can get a little pricey though when compared to other Japanese/sushi places.  But I have not been disappointed in anything that I have ordered over a course of the past six months.  This place is becoming an asset to the neighborhood.
