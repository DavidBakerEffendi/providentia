Everything on the menu here is great. My favorite are the chipirones in their own ink, the bacalaos, the stuffed olives, the salteado de gambas, and pretty much everything I've tried! The entire staff is extremely friendly and eager to please. I also love that Â their food is always served HOT. The best part, though, is that it's a pretty cheap place to eat.
