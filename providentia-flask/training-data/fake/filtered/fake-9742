Now don't get me wrong, the food was good.  What was frustrating was that we went in for lunch at about 3:15PM.  When I asked for a lunch menu I was told that they were serving dinner after 3 PM.  I had checked the internet, so I brought up the page on my phone and showed it to the waiter.  He thanked me for pointing that out and said that he will notify the manager of the error, but we still had to pay dinner prices.  He said that the 'computer' switched from lunch to dinner at 3PM.  I told him that the computer should talk to the Internet and get the times straight..  And no, I won't go back there again after being 'screwed' so gently.
