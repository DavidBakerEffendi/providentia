Went with friends who go often so we let them order. For 4 of us we decided on drinks and multiple small dishes, like tapas: shrimp and guacamole pantacones,  Papa criola, delicious Cplumbian  potatoes,  and some others i cant remember but good; then a large entree, a marinated fried Red Sea Bass....which I didn't think was that tasty without the sauces. Very ggod meal, but not great.....
