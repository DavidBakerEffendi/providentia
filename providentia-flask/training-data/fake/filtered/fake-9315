where do i start...hmm..well for starters..the food was ok but nothing special...unforgettable!.. they were so stiff even for the rice...i mean does rice cost that much for them to actually measure it in a small cup? i expected more food in my plate for the price im paying....its not french food so please dont be stiff!!!!!!!  advice to those who wanna try this restaurant..  if ur really hungry and dont wanna spend much this aint ur place. U'll end up ordering more to fill u up coz one order aint gonna do the cut. be prepared to bring at least 30bucks/person.
