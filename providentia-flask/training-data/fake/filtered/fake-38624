I had been here before when Doug (who is now in the summit store) was the manager in some capacity.  The food and service were excellent and could not have been more pleased.  This is what drove me to go again.  This time took clients and boy was I disappointed.  The service was good but there was a small language barrier with the wait person.  A main entrée ordered was NOT what we ordered and in trying to explain the mistake it was not worth it and just kept the dish which was also disappointing.  Semi cold shrimp with some type of French fry sticks and cole slaw.  Ordered the steamed vegetables and got the broccoli rabe.  vegetables came cold and no apology.  The worst was the wait.  I think it took at least an hour to get our entrees.  I will think twice about going again and spending the money when there are so many other choices although not for seafood.
