Got a text from a friend at 8pm on a Monday telling me I had to meet him at Mcladden's for beers.  Initially, I declined the invite and told him to call me on the weekend like a normal person, but he sold me on the idea when he told me they had a log of NEBCO "Locust's Reign" on.   I hadn't been to McLadden's in forever.  I don't know when they upped their beer game,   but I was wicked impressed.  Whoever is doing their ordering is doing it right.   I planned on drinking a couple pours and calling it a night, but ended up staying until last call.  The bartender knew what she was talking about, and had no problem letting us try before committing to a full pour of anything.  Bonus points for samples with a smile. If they keep bringing in beers like the ones I had the other night, I will be back for sure.
