This place is amazing.  The food is as fresh as you can get, the sauces are incredibly original, the service is great, and everything you get is memorable.  This is not just a meal it is a dining experience.  My mother-in-law travels from Chelsea (in NYC, not Great Britain) just to go there.  The pastas are probably the best, but everything is good (but why bother with steak at a place like this).
