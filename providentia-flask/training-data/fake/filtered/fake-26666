I usually never write reviews but I couldn't help myself this time! I wish I could give Dough 100 stars for both their service and food! First and foremost our waiter, Anthony, was the best waiter we (meaning my boyfriend and I) have had in a really long time and it was so refreshing. Usually when younger waiter see a younger couple they tend to slack off or take it easy ... Not Anthony, he was wonderful and I thank him for that !! Now to the food ... We started off with the zucchini chips which were delicious !! The dipping sauce was fantastic as well ! But the real prize was the pizza (obviously)! I can't say enough praise about the pizza. I worked in a wood-fired pizzeria for a little over two years and have been looking for a place comparable ever since I left. The pizza at Dough blew it out of the water !!!! The crust was so flavorful and not too doughy but not too crisp.. The sauce was tasty but not overpowering. Everything was so fresh and I taste the dedication and hard work they put in their food with every bite I took. I will never go anywhere else for speciality pizzas ever again !! I HIGHLY recommend this place Â for anyone and can not wait to go back and try some more pizzas!
