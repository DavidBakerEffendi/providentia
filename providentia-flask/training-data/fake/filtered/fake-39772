One and Done!  The Lobster Bisque was putrid tasted like puree coffee.  French fries were long dark and scary.  Restaurant completely unsanitary as not 1 but 2 cock roaches were on our table and along the wall we were sitting.  After bringing it to the kitchens attention that were just killed with the white napkins that were on the table and taken away.    I have been nauseous ever since.  My date still graciously paid the bill as they took off the bisque but I personally would not have paid anything.  BEWARE!!!!
