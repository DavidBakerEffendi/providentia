When I want to treat myself to a fabulous dinner after a long and productive work week, my first choice is always Cherly's. I haven't had anything here that I wouldn't have over and over and over again. On top of that, whenever I have a friend or family member visit from out of town (I've already brought everyone I know from NYC to this spot), Cheryl's is my go-to place for the "last supper." I'm forever grateful to the friend who introduced me to Cheryl's and it's my absolute pleasure to recommend this place to everyone I come into contact with looking for some spectacular food and spectacular service to go along with it. I cannot recommend Cheryl's enough. Enjoy!
