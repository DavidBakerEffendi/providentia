I love love love this place. Did I mention I love this place? Hillstone's is great on all accounts. The food is always delicious. It's fresh and they even make their own ketchup. My favs are the ribs and the california burger and the shoestring fries and the thai salad and the...everything! Â The service is far above the standard. The staff is uber professional and their timing is on point. Definitely well-trained. The decor and ambiance is relaxing. And the price for the quality of food is amazingly affordable. Whenever I'm in midtown east, this is the place where I eat. This is also where I bring people who are visiting from out of town. Hillstone never lets me down.
