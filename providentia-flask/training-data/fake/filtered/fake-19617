Having grown up in Princeton, I've come here many times over the years, and truthful, the sushi is pretty good. The management and employees, however, are a different matter. I was out in Princeton today and went to get ice cream from Halo with a good friend who I haven't seen in three years. We got our cones, but stupidly, I forgot napkins. We were outside of Sakura when our ice cream started melting all over our hands and dripping on our clothes. I dashed inside to take a few napkins. I took six or so and the man behind the counter started yelling at me. I asked him I could take a few, and he yelled "No, What is this, your house?!" I said that I've been to Sakura many times. He yelled, "Good, get out!" I'll never come back to this place. Seems the people that run it have no respect for their patrons, and further lack common, human decency. Can't stand people like that, and even more so, can't stand business built like that.
