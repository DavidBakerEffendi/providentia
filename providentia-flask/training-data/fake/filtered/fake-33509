This place should not be compared to other restaurants or especially pizza joints, but rather only to great artists and works of art such as Starry Nights by Picasso, or Miles Davis's Live Evil album, the slam dunk of Michael Jordan.   To wait in line for this is nothing compared to the lines people wait for their favorite concerts or art museums, or traffic in a thriving metropolis.   It is impossible for me to empathize with someone who could find fault with the best pizza on earth and the master who found and served his life's calling dutifully and beautifully.
