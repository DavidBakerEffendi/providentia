Went here looking for a traditional phily cheesesteak - which they do not sell. But they had many yummy combos - meat and vegetarian options - well priced at under $10. I had a paesano which is made with lean delicious thin sliced brisket along with peppers, onions and provolone cheese. Very good. Long wait to order and get food - one person taking order and one making food. Only 8 or 9 bar stools for sitting. Best for take out or a one time experience.
