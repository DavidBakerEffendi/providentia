Beautiful restaurant, outstanding food and service, and the nicest people you will ever meet. I've had just about everything on the menu, and it's all unbelievably good. If I had to pick favorites, the veal slider appetizer, pork schnitzel, and rolls coated with duck fat are my absolute favorites, but everything is delicious. As good as the food is, though, the people make it special. This is now a regular restaurant for me. Every time I walk in, Lindsey. Kate, and the rest of the staff greet me by name and are genuinely happy to see me. I brought my parents there last night, and everybody went out of their way to make the evening perfect and make them feel welcome. I'll be a regular customer here for a very long time.
