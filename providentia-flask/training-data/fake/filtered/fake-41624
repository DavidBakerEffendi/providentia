Great space, great service, great wine selection. Patrons are attended by two servers, both of whom are inevitably knowledgeable, friendly, and not too pushy. Noise is moderate, but you can still carry on a conversation. Tapas are excellent. This is an excellent date spot for early in a relationship -- nice but not too pricey, menu likeable by all with good taste. Reservations recommended Thu-Sat.
