I would not recommend eating here.  It is not worth your money.  Have ordered burritos and bowl. Everytime I have got some thing, have regretted it later.  There rice is always uncooked.  Feel like every bite has rice that is not cooked.  There does not seem to be difference in the portion of big bowl vs. small bowl.
