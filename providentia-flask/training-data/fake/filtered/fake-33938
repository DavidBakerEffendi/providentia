So you'll get to Sally's - think, that seems like a reasonable line. And then you'll be seated. At this point you're probably thinking - dinner isn't to far away. 1 hour and 30 minutes later you're confused. No, excited. You're thinking what wizardry, what complex flavors are being developed in the kitchen! What a amazing experience this will be. Â 1 hour and 40 minutes you're served. Next time you'll do digiorno. But for truly average pizza and a terrible experience do Sally's.
