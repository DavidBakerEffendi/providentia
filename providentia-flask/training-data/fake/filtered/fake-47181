I've been here many times and had most of the dishes on the menu.  Baba ghannoush, musakaah and falafel are my favorite appetizers, but I've also had their delicious zuppa di clams and mussels and the soujouk  which is quite up to my taste as far as being well spiced. For the main course I would recommend the chicken shawarma and the filet mignon steak as well as the kebabs. The service is good and the hookahs are being maintained continuously with new coals. The service makes the difference versus other similar places: any of their waiters is ready to serve your table whenever you need something, while refilling the water and the hookah maintenance are being done by specialized people, thus allowing the waiters to take care of the main business. After a couple of weeks, I already knew most of the people working there by name. I always end my dinner with turkish coffee and kanafi or baklava. I love this place!
