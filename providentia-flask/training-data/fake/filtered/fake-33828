What a fantastic restaurant!! The bartender, Jenny, was absolutely phenomenal! She was so accommodating to my party's every need. She was fast and friendly and really made our experience at this establishment much better than expected! Â The food was delicious. I highly recommend the mozzarella en carrozza! I will definitely be returning here in the near future!
