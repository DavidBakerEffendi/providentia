What a great spot!  I love when restaurants care about their customers.  I came here with a big group and they are so accommodating to all of our needs (and we have a lot of needs). The best part though was the food, super flavorful and satisfying.  Here are all the items that everyone must try, calamari, sugar cane with bacon, mixed seafood with red spicy sauce (i dont quite remember the name).
