Yes, you have to wait a while to be seated, and then you have to wait a while to be served. There doesn't seem to be any method to the madness at Saly's, but once the pizza arrives at your table, none of that matters.  The pizza is melt-in-your mouth good.   My first visit to Sally's was with my cousin's family.  At the time, there were four kids age 12 and under.  The kids kept telling me, as we waited, "Don't worry. It's going to be worth the wait."  And they were so right.  Any place that can get kids that age to patiently wait for that long - a half hour in line, forty-five minutes at the table - is amazing to me.  The kids knew what they were waiting for, though: Amazing pizza.  I never found the staff to be rude, as some other reviews have said.  They just have their way of doing things, and it's not what we're usedto, but it's no going to change.  They know they have a good product. They know the people will keep coming back for more.  I went back there again last spring, and it was just as I remembered it.  Incredible.  I don't care how long I have to wait.  In fact, the wait becomes part of the experience.  I've tried pizza in several places around the country , and so far, I'd have to say Sally's is, by far, the best.
