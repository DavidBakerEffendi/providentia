We were starving and needing a drink after playing with our daughter at Madison Square Park playground on a recent evening. Just up from the park on 5th Avenue, Lulu & Me was so warm and inviting, and brand new. I love the design of the place--it feels speak-easy-esque with white subway tile and dark wood and candles, and a long bar. Forties music was playing and it was ... just what the doctor ordered. The service was friendly, and the wine and beer list was very impressive--we'll be telling our friends. We ordered roasted pork, appetizer almonds, a cheese crostini and a tuna panini (excellent tuna, no mayo, fresh arugula) that our 5-year-old devoured! We were shocked. It was, in all, a sort of romantic evening, very satisfying. I highly recommend. Great place perhaps to take work associates for wine and small plates at the end of the day, or meet friends out at night for good conversation and wine. We'll be back.
