Very impressed with the service considering how new and busy this place was. Waitress was extremely polite and observant of our needs. The prices were phenomenal compared to other hibachi places we've been to. The portions of food per person were enough to feed at least two people. Fried rice, although still delicious was cooked with yum yum sauce, different then most places. All 15 tables had people at then and we were only here about an hour. I do recommend calling ahead for reservations; we happened to get lucky!
