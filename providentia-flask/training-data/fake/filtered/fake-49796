The quality of the service and quality of food left a lot to be desired, especially when you are going to an establishment that is supposed to deliver quality food and service. On our visit, we sat down and ordered a couple drinks and calamari to start.  The drinks came and were as to be expected.  However, when the calamari came out, it was soggy and the breaded coating was falling off.  You could see all the residual oil in the plate.  We mentioned it to the waiter and nothing was done about it.  We were a little taken back and decided not to order a meal because of how things were handled.  We settled up and carried on to a pizza shop down the terminal where we grabbed a few slices of pizza that ended up being a lot more satisfying. It seems too frequent today that establishments find it acceptable to charge inflated prices because of a name and not because of a superior product.  Unfortunately, we haven't been to Gallagher's since our visit and despite frequently being in Newark airport...and we plan on keeping it that way.
