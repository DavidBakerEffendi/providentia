I have been coming here for years and the food is always wonderful, service is excellent, and the atmosphere is good too. The food is always readily available and they will ask you if you want to try something on the menu that hasn't been brought out to you yet. Servers pull your chairs and treat you like royalty! Even when it's full there is never a long wait if you didn't have the chance to make reservations.
