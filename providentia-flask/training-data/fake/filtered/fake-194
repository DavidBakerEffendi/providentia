Steer clear of this place. Like all people already stated before ignorant racist ba....ds. Whoever heard of a place where you can only get ketchup and cheez whiz on your steak? Sad part is that they tried to take thier business to Dover DE. Thay had the same ignorant attitude there. Happy to say they closed thier doors within a few months. Delawareans weren't having it. Philadelphians should do the same. Tried them once. Never again.
