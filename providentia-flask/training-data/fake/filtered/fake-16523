I've eaten here several times w/family and friends and found the service attentive and the food decent.  While I can't say "out-of-this world delicious," I'm hard pressed to say the food is spectacular at most local restaurants.  I will say the ambiance, food and service are above average for the money spent. We enjoyed a lovely wedding rehearsal dinner here with 30 family and friends.  The owner is a dream to work with before hand and all throughout the evening of the event the owner and his staff kept checking if everything was alright. We never felt hurried or rushed.  The serving pace of the courses may have been slow, but it was perfect for our event!  And the servers were extremely polite. We requested an open-bar tab and opted for package 2 from their party menu.  The price was quite reasonable for all we consumed.   If you're considering a holiday party or any type of get-together, I highly recommend you get in touch with Café Mulino.
