Just checked out a great Indian restaurant, Urban spice.The restaurant had all the right elements. 1. Great food- All my dishes were spiced just right and cooked to perfection. 2. Superior Service - From the moment I walked the staff took care of me. The waiter filled my glass every time it was low, reviewed the specials with me, explained what each dish was, and checked if I needed anything else. 3. Price - The price was just right!
