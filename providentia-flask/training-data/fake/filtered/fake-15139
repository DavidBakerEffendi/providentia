Probably the WORST sushi I have ever had. Got a spicy tuna and a West Orange roll...spicy tuna was okay (more rice than tuna tho), but the West Orange roll...I don't even know what it was. Â Chopped avocado, spicy mayo, and other garbage slopped together and thrown on top of the roll. I think I saw actual mayonnaise on there. Had two bites and had to throw it out. Wouldn't recommend going to an Asian restaurant w ZERO Asians. I don't think they know what they're doing.
