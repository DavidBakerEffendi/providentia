Was there when they first openend and was not impressed. I returned recently as I am a big fan of mexican food. While not as good as a local mom and pop mexican restaurant, the portions were large and fresh with a variety of topping choices. The price for the 2 tacos that I got was definately worth it. Will be returning.
