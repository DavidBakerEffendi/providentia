My father was one of their first customers (1939). I moved out of Bensonhurst Brooklyn in 1971 to Woodside Queens and still managed to go to L&B at least twice per month. My wife and our kids moved to New jersey in 1983 and went to L&B at least once per month. We now live in Winter Garden Florida and fly up to L&B 6 times per year. It is without a doubt the best in the world!!!
