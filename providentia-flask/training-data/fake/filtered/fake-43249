I went to fill a flask with coffee, as I always do to try to limit the amount of waste I throw in a landfill each day. I have never had a problem with filling my coffee flask in any of the surrounding shops, yet the barista gave me a vicious glare for doing so. This knocks off a couple stars for me. Muddy Waters,Speeder & Earls, Uncommon Grounds (despite it's nasty attitude towards the local arts scene) all have competing products at the same prices-although you can avoid some of the younger college students at August Harvest which is a bonus.
