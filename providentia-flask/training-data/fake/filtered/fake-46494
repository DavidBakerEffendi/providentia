Was introduced by a friend and have been back about 5 times since, mostly with clients from out of town. The pork buns are absolutely to die for. I bought 40 pork buns for a party that ended up not happening. I wrapped them in a paper towel and put them in the microwave for 20 seconds and therapy taste amazing!!!!
