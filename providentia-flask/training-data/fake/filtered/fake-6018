This is a love it or hate it place.  If you want modern, quiet, and respectful service, it is not the place for you.  If you like places with history, character, people from all walks of life having a good time, and have the sense of humor to appreciate the sassy serving staff, you will love it.  Oh, and the food is GREAT!
