Atmosphere:  Unbelievably loud, you have to yell at people you're eating with Service:  Front desk-rude, waiters are literally RUSHING you through the courses, reaching across your face to take plates still with food on them Food:  Passable, a bit too greasy if you ask me Horror moment:  We were eating and this couple walks by, the poor woman slips on the tile floor (there was grease, I noticed it when I walked in), falls flat on her back and every person who worked there pretended not to see!!!  I got up to help, a guy at the table next to us got up to help but the hostess ignored this poor woman and nobody called the manager!  I could see the couple after they were seated, the woman was holding her head through the whole dinner.   I will never return.  I also plan to tell every person I know to avoid this place!
