Nice atmosphere, but my rib eye steak did not justify the price. Not exactly a bad cut of meat, more like the difference between a juicy, flavorful, perfectly ripe cantaloupe and one that was picked a week too soon. But don't miss the strawberry-rhubarb tart, a great combination of sweet and tangy tastes!
