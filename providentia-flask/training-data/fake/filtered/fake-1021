ELBOW ROOM'S MAC AND CHEESE IS WAYYY BETTER THAN THE STANDARD MAC....guy's you gotta do this year 'round. I tasted the Chicken Tinga Mac and my boyfriend had the Jamaican Jerk. The chicken tinga mac was full of flavor Â and the avocado was fresh. I tried some of my boyfriends Jamaican Jerk which was a little spicy but the freshly grilled pineapple eased some of that pain. We came in on a Tuesday night, which to me is way better than coming on a Saturday, nothing was sold out. Morgans is the place to go. As a crown heights resident, I will be a regular. THE RIBS, THE SERVICE, & the Mac & cheese, is all i need in life.
