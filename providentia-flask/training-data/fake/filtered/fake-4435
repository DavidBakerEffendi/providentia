I went to the restaurant with family, the waitress "back hair, about 5.6 tall" was very RUDE. I called in around 9pm and was told that the last order is at 9:30PM. We made it at 9:15pm, when the waitress saw us entering, she shouted: "We're closed !!" I told her that I am the one who called, so she allowed us.  I asked her to bring juice to the kids; she ignored me so I went to the refrigerator and brought the juice. She brought our orders with a miserable face!! We never had seen her after she brought the food although we had to request more water. After we finished, I waited for her to bring the check but never did. So I went to the cashier and complained. Then she heard me and said:" what's your problem"  if you don't leave, I would call the police". EXCUSME US: "Calling the police"!! The good thing a tall man in the kitchen heard us and he knew I was polite to her. This is the first time in my life I heard that a waitress fights with customers. Be aware people, if you go to this place, you may get caught by the police!! The next day, I called the manager and explained to him. He was nice and offered a free lunch, but I refused because I don't want go there no more. He told me also last order is at 10pm, so they gave me wrong information too. Later, a friend told that the same waitress was rude to him as well 2 times.
