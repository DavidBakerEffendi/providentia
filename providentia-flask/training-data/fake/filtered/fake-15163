Buyer beware! I don't know if this place is still working out the kinks or what, but what a mess. They lost our order ticket so we didn't get our dinner until an hour and a half after sitting down. Mind you, this would have been fine considering the profuse apologies that came once they realized they had lost our order in the queue. But to add insult to injury, once I finally got my meal, it was majorly dry and overcooked :( I really liked that the chef came around to each table to check on us, but it was sooooo disappointing to find that when I took the chance to note my sad pieces of lamb, I had people on my side. It turns out that the couple next to us also found their meals to be overcooked and very dry and they didn't have the courage to complain until they heard about our issues. While I appreciate their efforts to keep us happy (they ended up comping our meal) and the great waitstaff, it was an overall disappointing dinner - especially considering they've been open for a number of months now. I don't think I'd go there again, they should have their acts together by now.
