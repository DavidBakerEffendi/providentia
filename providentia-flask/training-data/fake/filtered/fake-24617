Delicious, reasonable, traditional.  Don't be turned off by the frantic atmosphere and frenzied customers inside this Chinatown gem.  The food is incredible, the prices unbelievable and the experience: memorable.  Favorites to try: roast duck, REAL wonton soup and roast pork.  DO NOT MISS THIS PLACE.
