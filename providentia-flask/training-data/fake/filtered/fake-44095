The food, oh the food, delicious soups made from scratch, salads so fresh you feel your face being slapped, sides, cole slaw being a family heirloom, red skinned potato salad and I can go on. Top quality beverages, sandwiches which leave quiet and savoring the wonderful taste and freshness, and don't forget the desserts, trust me, if you didn't save room take some home or to the office.
