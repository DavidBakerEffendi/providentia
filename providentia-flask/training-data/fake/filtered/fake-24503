I moved away from New York City four years ago.  I am back for a visit and went to Joe's Shanghai for the used-to-be superb crab soup dumplings.  i was shocked.  instead of the rich crab soup the dumpling contained soup that didn't even taste like crab or maybe just barely.  Was the place sold and the new owner is cutting corners?  It is a mystery to me how they could take the goldmine of a deservedly world reknown signature dish and monkey with the recipe.  I had gone there for years and will never go back.
