We spent a day in Enfield, NH, to go to the Shaker Museum, which was very interesting, and very worthwhile. That evening, our hosts at the Shaker Hill B&B recommended a couple places for dinner. We went to the Salt Hill Pub in Lebanon, NH. They had a good crowd on a Monday night, which is a good sign. The alcohol menu is unusual - beer and Scotch, so I couldn't order my usual Martini. I had the fish & chips, my wife had a big salad. The waiter recommended a beer, which turned out to be exactly what I like - a hoppy beer or ale, like Sierra Nevada or Newcastle, only it was local, and just excellent. My wife's salad was first rate. I had fish & chips, and the fish was thick, crispy. It couldn't be better. The fries had skins, which I prefer. The fries were somewhat greasy, but I'm not really complaining. I strongly recommend.
