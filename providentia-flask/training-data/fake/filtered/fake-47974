This is my wife and I favorite spot in bayonne to get some pizza! We have tried about 4 different pies,grandma being our favorite..we are very excited to try the shrimp pie this weekend..as far as customer service goes I wont base my review on that.Our only issue was the phone girl! she seemed very rude and made us uncomfortable to be there maybe we will stick to delivery..We asked twice for extra silverwear the first time she forgot and when we asked again she mumbled something under her breath and gave it to us without a sorry or your welcome and if its the same girl she is also very rude on the phone when being asked questions about the menu..but like i said i wont base this review on that because the pizza is the best in town but maybe they should consider a more welcoming waitress
