I went here last night with a few friends. It was after 10pm and it was hard to get a seat. It was loud and crowded but really good crowd. Even though it is in the heart of the LES, everyone was really friendly here. The drinks are cheap compared to other spots in the area but the ambiance is just as swanky and trendy! I will definitely come back here during a weekday when there is less of a crowd so I can enjoy time with my friends. This is more of a spontaneous place to visit if you're in the area and looking for a good crowd with cheap drinks.
