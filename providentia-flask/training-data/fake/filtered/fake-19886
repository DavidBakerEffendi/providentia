I would always go out of my for their falafel and shwarma, and the seasoned salads they use are out of this world, but unfortunatly the last 4 times I have been their they have a new person working the counter and making the sandwich he is completly ruining the reputation. The trick to these sandwiches is how they are made the originial individuals who still works their needs to make the sandwiches again. he is getting very cheap on the meat for the shwarama doesnt add enough sauce and is adding way to much red cabbage and lettuce to the sandwich. And what he is really lacking is the twist when the other servers would stick the tongs into the sandwich and give everything a twist so you not just biting into lettuce or cabbage. I gave it 3 stars as for the last 2 years the sanwiches have been great but it realy would get 1 1/2 if i rated it only on the last 4 visits.
