This was one of the better Mexican meals we've had in the city.  Dropped by around 8:00 on Friday and had to wait a half hour for a table.  Bar was crowded so we stopped by foodery for a drink (highly recommended).  They text you when your table is ready which is nice.   This feels like a bar rather than a restaurant.  It is loud with brick walls and had a decent beer list.  Ambiance was nothing special, but did not detract from our experience. We were hungry so the first course was the complimentary chips and salsa.  The green salsa was some of the best table salsa we've had in the city.   Next we had more chips -- the steak nachos.  They were on par with our favorites (el vez and loco pez) and a generous portion.  The best part was the steak on top which was cooked perfectly. We were 4 people and tried 3 different entrees.  First were the Costillitas, which is listed as an appetizer, but worked well as an entrée.  Meaty and succulent ribs with a great pineapple salsa and jalepeno combination.  Very, very good.   The other two entrees were tacos off the special menu - spicy shrimp tacos and duck tacos.  Both were great and full of flavor.  We preferred using one tortilla (they are served with two) so we could taste the ingredients better.  The tacos were a healthy size and were fairly rich - difficult to finish all of the food.  This is not a complaint.   Overall, a very good option for a casual meal.  Entrée prices looked a little steep for what is more of a bar than a restaurant, but the food we ordered was well worth the price.  We will be back.
