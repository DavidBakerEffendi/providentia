I don't know what the hoopla is all about.  This restaurant is terrible.  For Happy Hour, we were served very weak margaritas.  I ordered wings---and they served thin ranch dressing instead of blue cheese.  My suggestion is to try N 3rd---their Blood Orange margaritas are to die for and their wings are big and healthy!!!  Cantina Dos Segundos is no follow-up to its predecessor, Azure.
