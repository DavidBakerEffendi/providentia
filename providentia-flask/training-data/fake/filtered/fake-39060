Most of the staff is friendly enough, but as diners go this place is mediocre at best. The food is blah and the environment needs an overhaul, big time. Brighty lit and very cold and unwelcoming (as many diners tend to be.) I would not recommend this place unless your expectations are very low. If you want a fabulous diner experience, a local place that feels more like a restaurant with well prepared food is ANDREW's on Hylan Blvd (they are not open 24 hrs). Or venture into Edison, NJ to the Skylark on Rt. 1 for a true treat, an upscale Diner with trendy decor and a wonderfully eclectic menu that everyone raves about - U will see why! Bon Apetit!
