I cannot say enough good things about Stella 34! The restaurant is beautiful, immaculate and comfortable, which is out of place for it's location - the heart of midtown! Upon entering the space, you forget that you are at "the largest store in the world" and in the heart of one of the busiest cities in the world. The staff is very friendly and the service, first class! My family and I decided to go all out for this dinner! We got the meatballs, rice balls, calamari and the polenta for starters. All were divine! A few friends raved about the meatballs, so naturally we had to try them! And now I too will be raving! I got the Spaghettini and I do not have enough words in my vocabulary to describe what was going on in my head when I took my first bites! The sauce is simply perfect. Who knew you could have the perfect amount of spice, lemon, red sauce and crunch all in a seemingly simple pasta dish! I would eat this every day if I could! For dessert, gelati. Wow. I don't think there was a flavor that was undesired by my table! Apparently, it's flown in from Florence - delicious! I also ordered the tiramisu (because why not!) At first, I wondered what it was, because it certainly did not look like tiramisu! They should rename this dish "Deconstructed Tiramisu" By far one of the best I've had, and I consider myself a tiramisu conoseur. During our meal, we were greeted by the general manager, Matthew. This wasn't your typical "manager walks around to make sure the servers are doing their job" talk. He already knew everyone was already doing exactly what they were supposed to be doing! He simply wanted to have a chat! He was warm, inviting and genuine, much like the character of this restaurant. Please, if you visit one restaurant in NYC, make it this one!
