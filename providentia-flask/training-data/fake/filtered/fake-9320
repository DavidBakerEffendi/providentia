I just ate here last friday and I love the place. Here are the reason why: 1. VERY ACCOMMODATING WAITERS - They allowed me to sit in a table of six even if my friends arrived 15mins after. Some restaurants don't let you sit unless you're a complete party. But this restau made me sit even if I was waiting for 5 more people to come. I say this is an important thing. 2. GREAT FOOD. - As a Filipino, I would really know which Filipino food is legit and which are not. The food here is pretty legit! Dinuguan was great! Sisig was great! Pork adobo was great. Tinola was okay. Ginataang Sitaw and Kalabasa was amazing. Halo-halo and Buko Pandan was comparable to the ones in Manila. And the ube ice cream was very good! All of which MUST be accompanied by Red Horse Beer. 3. FRIENDLY ENVIRONMENT - With Filipinos around, you're sure to see smiling and friendly people. My friends who are non-Filipinos love the place not only because of the food but because the store owners would check up on us, converse with us, and even crack jokes on us. Very relaxing environment. I felt at home.
