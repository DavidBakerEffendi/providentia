I went with a colleague of mine during lunch, and we each got one of the lunch specials.  One was an aloo dish, and the other was saag paneer. The lunch came with generous servings of rice, a daal, and naan. The food was flavorful, and was very much like simple, home-cooked food.  It was healthy and not soaked in oil.  I really enjoyed it and would definitely go back. The only thing is I would have liked for it to be spicier.  Otherwise, the food was very nice.
