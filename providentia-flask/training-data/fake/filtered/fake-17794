My wife and I live near by and go to this place whenever we have a chance or when we have visitors. The staff are phenomenal and very friendly. Bam, Mike, Chris and Cheryl are my favorites and even when I'm not eating there they always wave and say "Hi". If you come more than 3 times they'll probably start remembering you and that's probably the biggest reason why this place is so great. You feel welcome! The other patrons are relaxed and you can talk to anybody.  Early in the evening there'll be a family or two with young kids, and then it becomes more of a night crowd as the evening goes on. Never too rowdy, except during big sports events or holidays, it's easy to spend 2-3 hours there. But the best reason to go there is the food. Best. Pizza. Ever. I must have saved a nun in an previous life to have pizza like this so close to my house. I love it. I used to think Grimaldi's in Dumbo was the best, but this is better. Oh and you don't have to wait 45 minutes with a bunch of tourists to get it. Great crust, fresh mozz, and great combinations. It's awesome! My personal favorite always switches between the Sopesatta and the Del Macellaio, but my wife loves the Tartuffata. They also make great salads and appetizers. It's just great, almost artisan food. Lots of great micro-beers on tap to choose from. I usually try something different each time. During the summer they have outdoor seating and is perfect for sitting out side with a drink and hanging with friends. This place only has two downsides. It's small so it can get filled up pretty quick on a busy night. It a little claustrophobic but it's a rarity.  The other is that it's a bit pricey. It's difficult to eat there and spend less than $30/person which may seem like a lot for pizza. But you'll leave stuffed and happy so I feel it's always worth it. Definitely give this place a try. You'd be missing out on a great experience.
