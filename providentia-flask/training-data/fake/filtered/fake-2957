Since the options on the appetizer looked more appealing than the entrees I decided to order several dishes.  I ordered the fried cheese, Cuban sandwich,  the Perni (Pork shank) with fried plantains and croquetas.  My partner ordered the Pollo A La Plancha. I knew there was something wrong when the order came out within 3.5 minutes.  Needless to say everything was room temperature except for Pollo A La Plancha which you can tell was quickly grilled on the spot, as it should.  However.... the rice was cold as was the sweet plantains. Out of all of my appetizers I can honestly say that none of it was good except for the cuban sandwich.  The pork shank was extremely dry and the tostones were cold, the croquetas looked like they had been sitting around for hours and were cold.  The fried cheese, well...the fried cheese...were not fried???  The cuban sandwich was the only item that was tasty, except that they forgot the pickle.  (Cuban sandwiches are supposed to have pickles in them) I was also surprised to learn that they make Sangria and Mojito but no liquor yet they charge you close to $15.00 for it.......what??  And all it had was grape juice, lots of ice and some fruit in it. Maybe the problem was that I arrived a little after the lunch rush hour..??  Mabe what I was served were leftovers..?? I expressed my dissapointment in my meal but it went into deaf ears so I decided to write about it. I guess I won't be back.
