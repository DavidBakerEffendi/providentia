Hands down the best happy hour in the Hartford/West Hartford area. You can't beat their half price apps and $2 beers. If you're stopping by you have to try the wings, these guys know BBQ! I'd also recommend stopping by on a Friday or Saturday night for great live blues music and an all around festive environment. Hanks Hot Pick: Jambalaya with any of the endless beers that you will always find on tap.
