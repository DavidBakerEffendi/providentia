This must be one of the most overrated restaurants in the hood. It's just where hipsters go to dress up and look important. The food was ok but had very little substance, it's Â not even in my top 10 places to go in the hood. It's pretentious yuppie food, you'd be better served going to Egg for brunch for truly delicious food. The wait for brunch here is absolutely RIDICULOUS, and then you sit down and get served pretty bland fare. This place is ALL HYPE, don't waste your money just to be seen here.
