Rotisseur is a fantastic restaurant that reminds me of the rotisserie chicken places that scatter the streets of Paris, France. The taste is so sublime, that words can only begin to describe it. Not to mention that the restaurant itself has such a brilliant interior design. As a side note: The corn muffins are amazing!!
