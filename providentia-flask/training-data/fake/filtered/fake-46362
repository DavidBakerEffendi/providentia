this place serve the best ramen in my life so far. I want to give them 5star but because of the wait was too long 30mins on sunday noon(3o'clock),and also the staffs were too noisy.I understand its selling point but for me its just too annoying.I prefer go to mitsuwa supermaket and order salt ramen(pork bone soup) they also have a good ramen out there.
