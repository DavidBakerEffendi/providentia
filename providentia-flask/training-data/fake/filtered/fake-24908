Max's Oyster Bar is one of my favorite special occasion spots to dine out. Everything about the place screams quality and attention to detail, from the freshness of the raw seafood to the bread baskets provided for the tables. The menu changes seasonally, drawing upon the different ingredients the restaurant can procure from the local area, and the food has always been top-notch. I have had mostly positive but mixed results with the waitstaff, with most of the servers providing attentive and knowledgeable service, though one time the server seemed to tune out after our initial order; I got the feeling that Â she was disappointed because we didn't meet some sort of threshold for the final tip, and for the rest of the dinner I felt like I was being hurried but this has been the exception, not the rule. Max's Oyster Bar is certainly pricey, but usually worth it. The restaurant is certainly lively and can get noisy at times but the host should be able to accomodate you if you would like to have a quieter corner for a romantic dinner.
