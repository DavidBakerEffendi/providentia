This is a great restaurant with friendly service and awesome food. The BYOB with Shoprite Â Liquors next door makes it a perfect situation. The BBQ chicken with their special hot sauce is dynamite. Its not too spicy just enough kick to enjoy the flavor of the chicken. I would recommend this place to anyone. A Must try and a great addition to the Caldwell Area.
