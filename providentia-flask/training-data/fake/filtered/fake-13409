"The Canoe Club is pretentious for no good reason. The space is cramped with table too close together. It is noisy. Food is sometimes OK but mostly mediocre. There is a little back alcove that is a bit more quiet but very uncomfortable seating. People who don't know any better consider it upmarket." Uggh. A July saturday night last I spent an hour here. YUCK. Due to the fact that we had to make a reservation 3 hours in advance, we went to the bar at Margarita's. We should have stayed there. We went back to the canoe club and ordered the crab cakes and the mussels for apps. There were two sizeable crabcakes for somwhere around ten bucks. They were lacking flavor, but the sauce was good. The mussels SLITHERED down my throat and almost came back up.. NOT GOOD. We also ordered the buger $10, was probably good, but we were full from chips and salsa at margaritas. I ordered the potatoe gnocchi. That was most certainly the best thing we could've ordered.. MaybeI'd go back for it. Then again maybe not....
