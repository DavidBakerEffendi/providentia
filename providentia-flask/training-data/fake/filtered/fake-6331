Before even getting to the place, we could not find parking, it was near impossible which is a mood killer. The food is just ok, I have had better Italian in the bella vista area of philly. Also a downside is that like chrisine mentioned, it can get really loud and does not make for a nice enjoyable evening for its hard to hold a conversation.
