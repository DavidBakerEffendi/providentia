Went once, not so good- attributed it to being newly opened. Went again almost 2 years later. Not so good.  Service is poor, well let me rephrase. Service is insolent, condescending and quite honestly, the best person on the floor (management included) was the runner/bus boy.  Sorry I wasn't wearing my highwaisted camel toe jeans and my date wasn't sporing a beard- perhaps if we looked like tourist hipsters instead of people who lived in the neighborhood for 10+ years the service would have been better.... as far as the food, it was fair- nothing special- problem is, even if it was stellar, the shitty service kind of put the kibosh on the whole meal. will never be back- nor will recommend.
