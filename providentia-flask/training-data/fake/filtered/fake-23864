I just want to say that Sazon is a restaurant that cares for the quality of the food, your health, for the Venezuelan heritage and more.  If you don't believe me, go to Sazon and taste any item in the menu.  Also if you get to talk to the owners Judith or Robert and you will see, and feel their passion and love that they have, for all what they cook and do. The food and juices are delicious and healthy.  The Chocolates are incredible, amazing, and unique...  The menu gives to you options such as truffles, exotics flavors that you won't get in other place in the world, hot and cold options.  Food wise, I recommend the tequeños, the palmito salad, the sancocho, the pepito the arepas, which are 100% corn, (any filling, you won't do wrong), empanadas, the Asado negro (bitter sweet), the pabellon criollo ... my list is endless... so, just go and try all.  I'm Venezuelan... and going to Sazon is to taste, my grandmother' food... my Venezuelan food...
