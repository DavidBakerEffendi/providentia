Visited on soft opening night and what a delight. Owner Joe and Chef Ken were on hand greeting and discussing their plans. Apart from a quite oasis in this developing neighborhood Llama Tooth also offers some creative culinary creations that pair flavors regardless of culinary history; spicy kimchi lamb burger, chicken pate beef-burger and on it goes. Atmosphere is wonderful, family business feel is wonderful and the food in excellent. No Llamas around in the garden though. Very excited to see how far this vision goes.
