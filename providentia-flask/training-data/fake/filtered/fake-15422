I couldn't in good conscience give these guys five stars simply because they are not as good as Hudson Street was. The pies are second to none but Hudson (RIP). They are usually consistently perfect but if you catch them on a super busy night, sometimes the quality can dip a little. However you WILL NOT FIND a better pie anywhere in NJ, NY, CT, or the world....that is until Gary gets back to it at Hudson (pleeeeeeeease).
