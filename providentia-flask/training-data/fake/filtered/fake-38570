My friends and I were really excited to try this place - the menu makes it sound awesome! But we were fairly disappointed with the product. She got the Huevos del Sol, which was lacking in toppings, substance and that "boom" flavor that makes something great. And I got the banana bread french toast which was dry, a little gritty, and really lacking in the presentation (a few dark crumbly pieces of bread strewn across a plate). Luckily there was some blueberry jam at the table that I could pile on it. Overall we felt that we could make better dishes ourselves at home. Too bad because this place really has great inspiration for their dishes, and we loved the "green restaurant" concept. Just wish it was a little tastier.
