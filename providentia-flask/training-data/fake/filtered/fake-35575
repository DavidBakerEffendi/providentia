Park Slope finally has a place for great burners, great wings (no kidding) and terrific soup. This cute "joint" serves great grub at a fair price and plays great music to boot (if your a little bit rock and roll). It's a little cramped but the staff is pleasant. Check your cholesterol today and go tomorrow!
