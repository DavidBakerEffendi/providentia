My friend and I went to Peking Duck for lunch.  #1 drinks @ bar were either all juice or  served in a miniature water glass.  All for the price of $6.75.  We also noticed that all the other patrons received water and tea, of which none were offered.  We ordered a couple lunch specials, one of which was listed as spicy.  This dish was served Luke warm with no flavor.  The other dish we ordered was vegetable lo mein, which is hard to screw up.  The lo mein was cold with no seasoning.  Crab rangoons were included and were greasy with no crab!  When our tasteless lunch was over we split the bill between our cards, only to realize the bill had been rounded up .  Lunch was flavorless, cold and cost more than listed.  This was once a great establishment that has turned into a huge disappointment.  I'm not one to write reviews, but in this case I feel the need to warn you of what you would experience by eating here. Sincerely, Disappointed
