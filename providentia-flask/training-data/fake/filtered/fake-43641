It makes me feel uneasy when I look up from my food and all I see is bearded plaid-wearing hipsters reminiscing about the last time they took a shower. I was worried the group of guys sitting next to me were going to ask me "you gonna finish that?" Â The food was good but don't come here if you forgot to where your tight black jeans and fadora.
