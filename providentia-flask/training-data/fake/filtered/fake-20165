I have always loved there food and i especially love hawaiian pizza w/shrimp on top. However, their fried fish and chips lack salt, it's completly bland taste. i had the most hard time eating without any taste at all. i am very spicy food eater and this left me with no taste. over all they pizza is the best!!!!!
