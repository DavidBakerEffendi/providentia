I went to this restaurant last week after a friend recommended it.  From the time we walked into the restaurant, until we left, we were treated like royalty.  I am not a fancy-eater so I was worried I wouldn't be able to find something to my liking.  Boy, was I wrong!  The waiter explained each and every appetizer and entrée to us.  We shared the market vegetables and apple appetizer.  We also had the monkey bread.  All were outstanding.  For the entrée, a friend and I split the rigatoni and chicken.  They were incredibly tasteful and delicious.  For dessert, I finished off with the raspberry sorbet which was the perfect end for a perfect meal.  The owner is charming.  Well worth taking the trip!
