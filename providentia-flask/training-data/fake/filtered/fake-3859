I can't believe Adam Richman voted this joint as having the #1 sandwich in America..really?!?  I say, don't believe the hype!  I'm actually giving this place 2 stars, but hubby liked it a bit more..so, I'm rounding up.  Our server was great..about the only highlight of our visit to The Reading Market.
