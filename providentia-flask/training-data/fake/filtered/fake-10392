I stopped here on my way home yesterday. I found out this is formerly Gennaro's Pizza (after I ate a slice of bland pizza from here)....it is the exact same menu and food, except they added a mexican food category and changed the name. Gennaro's has quite a few Yelp reviews.....none of them positive. Here is the link yelp.com/biz/gennaros-pi…. Here's wear I started to panick........Later last night I told  a friend of mine I went there and he told me the place was shut down by the health department days before the name change. Since I thought he was just bad mouthing the place to make it seem worse than it was....this morning I called the town of Newington....who then transferred me to the Health department or something like that. Sure enough they were closed for 3 days in August for Health violations. This is public record and available to all. My confusion is.....how is it possible to have a new Yelp page for the SAME restaurant that only changed it's name to "Nicolas Pizza and Mexican Eatery" and added a new style of food to its menu? Are we wanting people to run the risk of getting sick?
