I've been going to Alyan's since 1995 and it's been the best authentic middle eastern food I've ever had.  No one can beat their falafel, fries, meats, grape leaves, labani, tabouli, etc.  I used to work there too and ate everything. I saw how everything is prepared with care and love. Since then, I've found no comparison.  Each tastebud to their own, but they are the best. And the owner is awesome.
