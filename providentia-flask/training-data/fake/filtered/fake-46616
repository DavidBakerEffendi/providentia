Boloco claims to have all naturally-raised meat, but their white meat chicken is not naturally raised.  They also charge a dollar extra for white meat chicken when in fact white meat is not any more than dark meat per pound.  They have a green restaurant certification but did not recycle for the first eight months after they opened.
