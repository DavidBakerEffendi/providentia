We went for lunch about a week ago. The waitress came quickly and was so cold and rude it was almost funny.....almost.  I ordered and asked that the dish be medium/mild spice wise.  The food came out and it was too hot to eat.  I can tolerate heat, but this was super hot, covered with hot pepper flakes.  I returned the food and decided that between the rude service and the inedible meal I was done.  I declined another meal.  First the rude waitress insisted I reorder, and then a man that I presume was the owner came out and explained that if I did not order another meal we would be charged either way.  In order not to get my lunch companion upset, I ordered the dish again mild to go....they sent it out in typical brown sauce...not even close to the original sauce.  My companion quickly finished and we packed the rest to go...wanted to get the hell out of there...aside from the horrible service, the decor is old and ugly, not a place to linger.  Due to the Horrible service and harassment, we didn't leave a tip and the rude waitress had the gall to ask us "why no tip".  I was a waitress for many years and I have never, ever seen this sort of behavior when someone returned a dish.  As a customer it was a stunning display of the customer being anything but right.....all for a returned dish of vegetables.
