Phenomenal! We made a same day reservation for 6 people at 4pm this past Saturday and every element-service, food, decor, etc. was spot on. We must have stayed at the table for 3-4 hours because the dinner crowd started to fill in. We did not want to leave! The food is unbelievable-we shared a bunch of starters and the octopus in particular really stood out. My husband had short ribs which were out of this world. My family usually keeps to themselves while dining but the warmth of the staff was so engaging that we took almost every suggestion they had and were so happy for doing so. My parents were also elated to find out this location is related to their Florida locations which they frequent. If this place keeps getting amazing reviews, I'm afraid we won't be able to get a table! We'll be back soon!
