This Resturant came highly recommended, so I thought we'd give it a try.  It was worth it.  The vegetable soup was delicious served hot! (Important to me). The kale salad had just enough crunch and very tasty. The grilled chicken was moist and flavorful. The chicken burger was also delicious but my favorite dish was the okra fries ! I loved them. A must try!
