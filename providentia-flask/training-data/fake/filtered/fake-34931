I've only ever been here for brunch, but I've always enjoyed the food and the cocktails.  The service can be a little slow but that's just because they place is always full.  There's always someone to flag down if you can't find your waiter or waitress.   The food is great.  I love the cheeseburger.  It's always cooked properly and it's a reasonable portion.  The bacon is great too.   It's kind of a pain to find this place, but I kind of like that.  On nice days it's a pleasant walk through the Village to get there.
