I had to write a review after reading the less than flattering review posted by Lindsay C.  I have been a patron of the Spanked Puppy for many years.  They have excellent food and the best waitresses in the area.  And yes, some of the customers may be missing a few teeth or have calloused hands, that's because they are hard working Vermonters taking a break, having a great lunch or a couple of drinks with their buddies in a warm and welcoming atmosphere.  The bottom line is I live here surrounded by many great bars and restaurants, the Spanked Puppy is still one of my favorite places to go for lunch or drinks.  I think it's awesome and you probably will too, that is unless you have your nose so far in the air that you can't handle being around hard working Vermonter's who may be missing a tooth or two!
