Wow. I gave up on looking for good tacos in nyc years ago, i wish i knew this place existed when i first moved here! By far the best tacos I've had in the city. Everything from the quality of the meat, flavor, and their home made salsas is just perfect. PS if you get the pork taco, they slab a couple pieces of grilled pineapples on it. Delicious.
