The food here is wonderful! When my husband and I came home from our Honeymoon to Greece, we couldn't wait to find some of the dishes we'd had. The gyros are great, but the traditional Greek dishes are even better. Definitely try the Moussaka :) Service is always fast and polite. Efaristo! (Thanks!)
