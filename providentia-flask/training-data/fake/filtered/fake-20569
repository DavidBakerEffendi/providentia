This little restaurant caught the eye of my fiancee and myself a few months back. I got out of work later than expected and we wanted to go out for our date night, and driving down Spring Garden, looking for a place, we found Llama Tooth. The food was great and reasonably priced for our tight budgets, the atmosphere was friendly and inviting, and the service top notch. The owner's family was having dinner at the same time as us, and we spoke to them about the restaurant and just made small talk. If you're in the mood for a cute place to go to for a date night, a date in general, or just to get away from the stresses of every day life, this is the place for you.
