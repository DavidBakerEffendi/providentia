I had to write 2 reviews about fantastic places in Brooklyn, this being one of them. The food...wow just sooo good. I had a Portobello and brie sandwich, who knew that they would taste so good together. And on another day I had pancakes, well I believe somewhere underneath that huge pile of fresh strawberries and whipped cream there was a very taste and light pancake ;-) Cheryl's you rock!!
