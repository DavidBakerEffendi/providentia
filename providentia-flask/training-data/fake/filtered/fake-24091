I work in the area and it's so hard to find healthy fast food.  I found Good to Go Organics and now I'm in love.  I'm here a couple of times a week and love the food and love the people that work there.  My co-workers are also hooked.  It's a comfort to know what I am eating is actually good for me.  Try it!
