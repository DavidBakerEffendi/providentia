Ate here with my family on Christmas Eve. It was a disaster waiting to happen. We were a 20 top and they only gave us one server for us and the 15 top next to us. It literally took a half hour before we got our first round of drinks, 45 minutes just to get menus, I actually went to the bar a few times to get drinks because the bartenders were awesome and at least i got my drinks right away. 40 minutes to get our apps, another 30 to get our entrees. The waitress screwed up our orders a few times- empty water glasses, our table maintenance was a mess, we had to literally ask for our dirty stuff to be cleared as we piled it up ourselves---but i guess that happens when the owner/management doesn't staff for the amount of reservations for the night and neglects to help out when short handed. When i sent back my entree because it was the most bland thing I've ever tasted, one waiter gave me the biggest attitude, and walked away without even offering me something else. I sat there with no entree, had get up myself to go find a manager. The owner came over and was the rudest person i ever dealt with, and told me "these things happen" and walked away, leaving me still with no entree. The worst part is, they fired the waitress as if it were her fault they didn't staff accordingly for the busy holiday. Maybe she would have done a better job if she had a support staff or even a busser. The owner should be ashamed of his behavior and service.
