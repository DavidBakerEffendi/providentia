I took an hour long train ride with my friends every other week to get bubble tea from this place. It was the closest one to our school, but even after going to other places we still ended up coming back to Hanco's; especially because they were always friendly if you asked for more bubbles, less sugar, or any change in your drink. After a while we ended up ordering food from here too, and it was amazing! The sandwiches were small, tasty, and filling, and their rice dishes were always cooked to perfection. Not to mention the prices weren't very high (Except for the rice dishes, but you get a lot of food in those). The shop itself is a little on the small side, so my friends and I always had to sit at separate tables, but that didn't take away from the fun we had when we went.
