Don't often write good reviews but i believe if you find something you feel strongly about you should let people know. First time to New York and to be fair the whole experience was fantastic only complaint was that i did not have a longer stay. The bar we found by chance and we were so happy we did. We had a great time the staff were fantastic but the owner made us feel so welcome sat with us had a drink with us just a great experience all round.
