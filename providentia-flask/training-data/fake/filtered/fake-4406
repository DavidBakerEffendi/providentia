My boyfriend & I arrived in Burlington VT from NYC right around dinnertime & from a friend's recommendation we headed straight to Bluebird.  Our friend steered us in the right direction --- we loved everything about this spot from start to finish.   Loved the "check in cheese" super smart of them & super yummy for us. Appetizers were wonderful and the entrees even better. I got the chicken pot pie, which was beautifully prepared and tasted better then it looked.  My boyfriend got one of the pasta dishes - being from NY its tough to please us in the pasta department but this dish was wonderful as well. The only mistake we made is that we ordered the poutine in between the apps & the entrees.  It was so good we could not stop eating it so finishing dinner was a challenge but we cleaned our plates.   we don't usually order desert at restaurants but we kept seeing these temping dishes go to other tables around us and we had to try them ourselves. Once we took one bite of the desert we were glad we found extra room for them - they were a perfect end to such a great meal.   One of the other key reasons we loved Blue Bird was the staff   everyone was so knowledgeable and so helpful - Even though we were only in Burlington for the weekend we did talk about eating there again, but decided to wait until the next time we came up....needless to say we cant wait to come back to VT to see what will be on the menu the next time
