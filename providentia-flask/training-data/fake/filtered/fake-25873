Really tasty meatballs and gravy but very overpriced.  I ordered them and my friend ordered the scampi.  Very strange that they did not include pasta or veggies or anything with the scampi.  Good taste but I had to share my pasta with her just so she could eat it.  Decor leaves a lot lacking and the waitresses acted like something out of the Sopranos.  Loud, gossipy, complaining in thick south Philly accents.  Was surreal.  As far as the service, they were totally in attentive as though serving was doing us a favor.  The saving grace were those damn meatballs!, addictive!
