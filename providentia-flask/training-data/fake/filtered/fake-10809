Their burger's are AMAZING with the perfect crunch. Their sweet potato fries are also irresistible. I would give them a 100 stars out of 5 BUT I couldnt because ... the guy next to me was a served a burger with a used bandaid with it. After I saw that, I almost threw everything up. That is RIDICULOUS I understand it's busy and all, but don't you use gloves?! Thank god I had the burger and fries before, or else I would just run out of there! You can decide if you want to try .. if you want to try the deliciousness and if that outweighs disgusting band-aids on your food go for it!
