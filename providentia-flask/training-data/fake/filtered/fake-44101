I used to go here all the time - about 12-15 times a year for at least 3 years. However, the service has always been super slow but I was l was okay with that since I was always with a group of fiends and we never went while we were starving. But, the last three times I've gone, both my wife and I have gotten sick. After the first time it happened, I figured it was just something that didn't agree with us. But when it happened again, I called the restaurant to let them know that they may have some bad fish. The manager I spoke with started screaming at me, "I have insurance! You no sue me, I get best fish around. Don't come back!" Now, understand that the reason I called was not to complain or ask for my money back (or anything like at); it was simple a helpful "Hey, you may was to check your fish because you may have gotten a bad delivery" kind of statement. After getting sick a third time, we can't o there anymore. The service is horrible and you'd think they'd at least pretend to recognize us after going there for so long? Nope. They just treat us like prefect strangers.
