Last Friday evening I met my adult son in lower Manhattan for drinks and dinner. We  went to the seaport first for a couple of beers and then went looking for a restaurant in the area.  We happened by chance to stumble (litterally) upon the Fishmarket restaurant. The restaurant/bar looks blah.  There were a few people at the bar (around 7:45 PM) and most of the tables were empty.  The other restaurants in the area were  packed. Not wishing to fight the crowds and not needing anything fancy, we decided to have dinner there.  We were pleasantly surprised. The only reason that I did not give this restaurant a 5th star was because despite the fact that the place looked empty, it took a long time for the appetizers to come out.  They then brought out the entrees a minute after the second appetizer. That being said, the food was great.  We first ordered calamare and chicken wings as appetizers and they were really good.  For entrees, we both had the salmon.  It was cooked to perfection.  I also had Bok Choy as a side and it was also very good. Before we left I had the opportunity to chat with the owner, who from the other reviews is probably Jeff. I told Jeff that we really liked the food but were mildly disappointed that it took so long for the appetizers to come out.  He replied that "momma" doesn't allow any food to come out of the kitchen that is less than perfection.  I believe him. He apoligized for the delay and was gracious enough to give us another beer on the house (which my son and I probably didn't need at that point).  I wished him well with his establishment and again told him how good the food was. I highly recommed this restaurant/bar to anyone as long as you don't mind waiting a bit for the appetizers. Don't be fooled by the blah apperarance.
