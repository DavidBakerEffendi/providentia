I went to Song tonight and order the fried whole snapper meal and a side of shrimp basil rice and the meal was horrible. The fish have no flavor or seasoning nor was it spicy as I specifically asked is it spicy. Both rice rice was over cooked Â with no flavor to the point it was sticky. If someone is going to spend money at least get a better quality rice. The fish is questionable also I wonder if it was even snapper. I read the reviews here and decided to give it a try and I must say this Brooklyn woman is not satisfied at all. On to the next one. Save your money and palate.
