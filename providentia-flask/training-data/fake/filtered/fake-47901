The food is Amazing, the best food of any restaurant, Greek or otherwise,  I can ever recall going to period.    The food however, was not even the best part of the dinner, for the service was impeccable with a bright, funny and delightful waitress, who not only knew an amazing amount of info about Greek cuisine and Greece in general but spoke in several languages.  The co-owner who came over to our table to see if everything was ok, was also very pleasant, had a very good sense of humor and had us laughing. The personal service and attention given was unparalleled, I most certainly strongly recommend this place, you will not be disappointed
