i worked in the building this place is located in for close to a year and never tried a slice until the other day. There are so many random average to crappy pizza places scattered all over the city. I can say that Previti is no such place. The quality of ingredients is high and you can tell. I have only had their specialty slices, have not tried the plain yet, so can't comment on them, but I can say that I have been really impressed so far.  Aside from being an above average slice of NY pizza, their prices here are very reasonable. Met the owner the other day and he was a real gentleman too. I highly recommend trying Previti..  Probably the best Pizza in the area, but I will do an update once I try the plain slice.
