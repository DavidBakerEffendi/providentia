U City needs a change in food trucks. and I genuinely want this place to succeed. I have been there twice already and still not convinced that the owner understood the whole food truck business. I totally agree with Yaanik D 's review. They use quality ingredients and the food is fine.  I love to watch my sandwich made to order and not a pre-made "grab and go".  I rather order a sandwich from Chez Yasmine located on 37th and Spruce with similar quality ingredients.  I wish them good luck and will give only 3 * for this time
