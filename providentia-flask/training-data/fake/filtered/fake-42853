The food as good as it gets been going there for many years family run authentic Ialian food with great attention to details even the salad is great tried just about every item on the menu and it is delicious. service is great never was an issue at times when they are totally booked it takes little longer to get your order but again for cook to order food it is exepected BYOB is great option since they don't serve it.
