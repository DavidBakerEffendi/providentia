I just had an experience with the owner of this pizzeria.  I ordered a pie and got it home only to find out it was all burnt.  I called the business and told them I don't eat burnt pizza and could I have another, which when  I got back up there was told that this is how pizza is always made.  The "owner" then opened the newly made pizza and said see, to I assume his suprize it was not burnt, he then proceeded to start picking up the pieces of the pie one by one.  At this point I said I don't appreciate you touching the pizza and I wasn't going to take that one alsol. ( I watched him take money from a customer and shake his hand, I don't know what was on the money of if the customer was ill or not)  The "owner then opened the register threw $21 at me so I waited for the change which at this point he said "oh you want your 15 cents too?  I said yes and he threw it at me and told me never to come back again.  I responded not to worry I won't!   Is this a way to run a business?  How do I know what illnesses any of them had if any, do I take a chance?  What was on the money he was handling?  I don 't know that either, needless to say I will not be going back there again not by his choise but by mine!
