I ordered some food for pick up yesterday from the Nutley Jim Dandy's, two bacon cheeseburgers, a turkey burger onion rings and potato skins. Upon opening the burgers we were surprised to find that there was no lettuce tomato, onions etc. I called and was told all these must be asked for, going against all standards of burger ordering. Usually these things are put on unless asked not to have them. Looking past this first disappointment we at least hoped for some better than average burgers, at least better than a fast food burger from Wendy's lets say. The bacon was burnt so bad it could have chipped a tooth, and they were able to get a taste from the burger i haven't tasted since the old middle school cafeteria, i can only guess this is achieved by leaving a over cooked burger on a counter, or dirty bowl, for many hours. I was also amazed to find that onion rings could be made to resemble rubber, i have no idea how this was achieved. The bread though fresh was of the lowest quality. The only thing they didn't completely screw up was the potato skins, they were at least average, way to go. Over all we felt like we got robbed, you wouldn't think simple food could go so wrong. The staff at Jim Dandy's obviously has no pride in there work, how do places like this stay in business?
