A+ Service all the way around...First of all, the family that owns Paisano's are some of the nicest people I have ever met and they have always made my relatives and friends feel very welcome.  The servers will make you feel at home...The portions are plentiful and the quality of the food is superb!  The restaurant has expanded multiple times over the years which provides many options for a different setting each time you eat.  This is actually a place where you WANT to listen to the specials, they are worth it!   There is also a take out option which my family and I have successfully tried as well.  Being Italian, my family and I have searched far and wide over the years for great restaurants, and Paisano's is one of the best Italian restaurants in the entire tri-state area. Hands down!
