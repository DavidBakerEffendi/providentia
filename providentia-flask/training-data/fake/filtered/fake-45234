Had an absolutely wonderful meal. Previously had been traveling into NYC for Ethiopian food. This was just as good and half the price. It has a very relaxed atmosphere and friendly servers. Easy street parking on the week night we went, but might have to look harder for a space on the weekend. Highly recommend this restaurant. We will definitely go back again.
