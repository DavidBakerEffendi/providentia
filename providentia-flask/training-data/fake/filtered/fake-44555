A wonderful Thai restaurant located in an unassuming shopping center. While the exterior looks are pure strip mall the interior is wonderfully decorated and quite inviting and relaxing. For an appetizer we chose the Satay Tofu, a tofu block fried and stuffed with cucumber and bean sprouts and drizzled with a tasty peanut sauce.  Upon recommendation I decided to try the vegetarian (tofu) Pad Kee Mao. It was excellent. In fact, the tofu at Rhong-Tiam is very, very well prepared I might venture to say it is some of the best tofu I have ever sampled. Finally, for dessert the Mango Sticky Rice was good but not to die for.  With all that said, I will caution diners who wish to for long meals to be prepared to tell the wait staff you are still deciding as they could seem as though they are rushing you and your meal. I would caution against not trying them because of this, however, as it is easily remedied by asking for their patience as you choose. All in all Rhong-Tiam is well worth your money for excellent Thai food in central New Jersey!
