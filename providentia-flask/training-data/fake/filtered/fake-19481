Finally had dinner here, it was fantastic! Great service, volume not oppressive, excellent waitress who made good suggestions. Â One of us is a vegetarian, and one of us had never eaten any kind of Indian food before. That person is spoiled now! Already made another reservation for our next visit to the orchestra.
