In Philly on business and saw this restaurant.  We asked the concierge at the hotel how good it was....he said it was the place to go and booked us a reservation.  The place is decorated great with couches and hip decor.  The hostess was great, the food fabulous, the service terrific too.  For an appetizer we had almond-stuffed dates wrapped in bacon with cabrales blue cheese...to die for.  For a main dish I had the Cilantro Honey Mustard Glazed Salmon with banana, lentil salad, and fresh horseradish cream.  It melted in your mouth and I am very picky about salmon.  My business associate had the Cuban Shrimp and Grits with laughing bird shrimp enchilado,sweet corn tamale grits and she enjoyed her dish as much as I.  We split the Chocolate Cigar made of almond cake wrapped in chocolate mousse, dusted with chocolate and served with dulce de leche ice cream.  The dessert looked like a real cuban cigar and tasted heavenly.  I recommend this place whole-heartedly and hope that I will have a chance to go back again.  Lord help the restaurant I go to tonight.  This will be hard to beat.
