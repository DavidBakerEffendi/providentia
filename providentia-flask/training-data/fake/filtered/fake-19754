With a prix fixe menu, I expected faster and smoother service, and for the price, I expected a better meal. Â I ordered the lump crab salad, and salmon as the entree. It was in no way lump crab in the salad. There was a very little bit of shredded crab meat with no taste of crab at all. My salmon was so under cooked, I could only eat the thinner end of the piece and neither the salmon nor the corn confit side was warm. Disappointing.
