Just recently visited this restaurant while on a bus trip to see a play.  I don't know if the food that they serve bus loads is different from the food served in the restaurant but I hope it isn't!  We were crowded in a room next to the actual restaurant and I mean closer than "elbow to elbow", we were served on plastic plates, some of the chairs were broken or wobbly, and the food took forever to get to us.  The best part was the lemonade and sweet potatoes.  The collards were sweet, the macaroni even had a sweet taste to it, the food was cold and to make a long story short I was disappointed because after going online and seeing the menu I was anxious to eat there.  The waiters were very accommodating, but I came to eat.  Also the hall looked like something that was just thrown together. I had a table leg between my legs during the whole time.  Sorry, but I would not eat here again travelling with a bus group!
