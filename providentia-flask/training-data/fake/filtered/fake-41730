Tried this place a week ago and I was hooked! I tend to place my orders via phone but soon I'll visit! (only downside is the $15 min. for delivery). Created an account for the sole purpose that none of these reviews say much about service!! Usually I place my order around noon and a young lady answers my calls. First time ordering I was going off a co-worker suggestion of a chicken club, I asked for the girl opinion and she pointed me in the direction of the oriental chicken salad or the bison (I've ordered both and love them). She was polite about it patient and thoroughly explained the menu options, I was very impressed on all the options I was given. The delivery service was fast and well packed and the delivery guy very polite and very patient! Love this place will be placing my order tomorrow!!
