went here today 4/16/14 and everything from the food to the service was wonderful.  i had the danish pancakes (parmesan cheese and pancakes?? who knew?) and turkey bacon with a chocolate egg cream and i left full and very happy.  the servers were extremely helpful and happy as well.  next time around i'll bring the kiddies
