I picked this from the reviews on yelp to meet my sister who was staying in Rutherford for a conference.  We split two items from the specials, dinner salad and a white pizza -they were both delicious, the crust on the pizza was beautifully thin and perfectly slightly chewy crust (made especially yummy toasted up leftovers).  Nice drinks, good wine selection, coffee was good (with a shot of Bailey's), the service was excellent, friendly and not rushed - which is important to me, and the atmosphere was just right for a casual, comfortable dinner.  If in the area I wouldn't hestiate to go back.
