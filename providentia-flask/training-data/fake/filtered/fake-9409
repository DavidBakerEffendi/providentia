This is a tiny French place that has been in the village for ever. A timeless staple, if you will. I was told its been around for more than for more than 15 years. The food is basic, good French and you won't be disappointed if that's what you are in the mood for. The real attraction is the quaint atmosphere reminiscent of the French Riviera, and a friendly non-stuffy staff. I recommend a visit outside of the usual dining hours, as there is not room for many, and you will wait for a while, especially for brunch.
