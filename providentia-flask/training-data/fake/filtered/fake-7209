Went for a birthday party, but given unfortunate circumstances, only 8 of us arrived.  Not having any part in the decision making, I was surprised to hear that we would be paying for rates that were set for a group of 16 people.  Where the restaurant could have been kind, they chose to give no other options.  The result was an uncomfortable situation.  I understand the reasoning, but would have preferred they take a different approach.
