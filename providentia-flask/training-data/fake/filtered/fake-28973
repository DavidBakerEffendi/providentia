Still one of New Haven's gems. It has only been open a few years, but they continue to improve upon themselves and are always a packed house. It delivers on its premise...Craft Beers and Great Burgers!! Many options to choose from for both, so plan on many a return to try them all. Plus with an ever changing beer list consisting of different craft breweries presenting the very best each has to offer, even the most discerning of palates will find a nice brew guaranteed to satisfy. They do accept reservations for 6 or more people and always try to be as accommodating as possible. Even while waiting for our table we were still able to grab a few beers and pull up a seat by the host stand to relax. Sometimes we have waited up to an hour or more, but the bartenders have always made sure we didn't wait empty handed. They are also super accommodating with small children. Prime 16 also offers a website and an in-house event schedule so that we are able to plan our visits around tap takeovers or special beers being tapped. We have had great service every time we go and look forward to our next visit. Keep up the good work Prime!!
