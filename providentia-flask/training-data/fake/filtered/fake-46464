I have been to ipuddo four times now...it is amazing. The ramen is just insanely complex and flavorful and full bodied. The akamaru modern is my favorite! For vegetarians, the miso ramen is definitely okay but it's not stunning or anything so, don't expect to like it much if you're a vegetarian! For some reason everything that Ippudo makes tastes so much better, like even their pork buns, are pretty average if you think about them outside the context but they are mouth watering when eaten at ippudo. It is rather expensive: 15$ for one bowl of ramen, but you will leave feeling full. As for the wait, I've found that it isn't so bad, but GO EARLY. During lunch if you walk in towards the end of the time frame, don't expect to be seated...NYU is right there so tons of college kids are always packing the place. As for dinner, if you go right at whenever it opens (5? ) then you should be fine, as they don't take reservations.
