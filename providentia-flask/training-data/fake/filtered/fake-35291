I cannot rave enough about Nolita's.  I was just telling our waiter tonight that they should open a location on the strip in Las Vegas because Nolita's food is truly that delicious.  Having just gotten back from an eight day trip to Vegas, I feel very comfortable saying this. Nolita's has a wonderful staff, lovely atmosphere and everything from the arrancini (you must try), the chicken parm, the thanksgiving wrap, to the chicken wings etc are incredible. The food portions are large and we always have leftovers which taste just as delectable reheated the next day. They have a wide selection of beers on tap as well as cocktails and soft drinks. My boyfriend and I stop in for dinner at least twice a month and always look forward to trying something new on the menu.  A second location in Hartford or West Hartford I think would do amazing as well, and I also look forward to a website from them.
