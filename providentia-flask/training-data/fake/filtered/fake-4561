Very excited to try this place, and after trudging through the snow was not disappointed. Â  Delicious coffee, and very nice atmosphere. they are in the middle of some sort of construction/expansion project which did not at all interfere with the operations of this restaurant. I ordered the "kitchen sink" which was basically every breakfast you could want served sizzling in a cast iron skillet. delicious potatoes and vegetables served under eggs, with my only complaint being that my biscuit was almost inedible due to the saltiness. would be interested in coming again to try the lunch menu.
