HORRENDOUS STAFF!!  TERRIBLE HOSTESS!!!  BORDERLINE DISCRIMATORY OF PEOPLE WITH KIDS!! Here is my story - Went last week with my family (4 in all, 2 kids under age 5) Got there before they opened waited outside with others, put my name on the list - when I ask about highchairs she rolls her eyes and says they don't do that.... She then proceeds to tell folks after me they will have a long wait as they will not make the first seating.   When they open she begins calling in parties, never calls my name.  When I go in and inquire I get a response that there are no tables left, when I ask why she didn't tell me like she told others that they wouldn't make the first seating she just walked away.  No apology -  no nothing Not worth the hype!
