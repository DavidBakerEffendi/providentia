I've been a regular customer for months, brought friends and widely recommended it.  I was there the Friday before last, sitting at the counter facing the grill and while waiting for my steak heard the main chef, she said to the others "I didn't cook the sides."  A new guy working there said "and I..."  I couldn't hear what he said, but when my steak arrived the sides weren't cooked like usual and it was so salty I couldn't finish it.  I've always been complimentary and polite, but it was clear she prepared a deliberately substandard meal.  I debated writing this, there are some great people working there, but it's such a patent violation of basic principles that I can never go there again nor recommend it.
