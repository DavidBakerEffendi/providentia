Chickies has got to be the worst company to work for. When I hear about the way the mangers treat and speak to the employees I'm appalled! Whatever happened to treating people with respect??? If the managers hate their jobs so much then quit, don't take it out on others! I too am a restaurant manager and have been all my life. The employees under me love me. Know why? Â Because I treat the with respect. I will never dine in any of your restaurants again, I don't condone abuse or harassment. I will make sure too, that everyone knows how chickies treats their employees. Shame on you!
