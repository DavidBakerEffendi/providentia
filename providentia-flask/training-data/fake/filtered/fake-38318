This place was outstanding,i went here for lunch with hubby. We order sushi combination and a bento box. My husband get salmon skin salad for starter,it was very good,crunchy and refreshing,but better good eat right away otherwise gonna get soggy.The sushi and sashimi very tidy and the bento box was on the perfect amount with marinated beef so tender and has a sweet taste to it,the minus on this bento box was the spring roll;i didn't like the flavor,kind of tasteless and the vege inside has weird flavor. But everything was good,definitely come back.
