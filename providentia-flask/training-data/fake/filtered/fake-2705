Algarve is perhaps my favorite restaurant anywhere (U.S. or abroad).  I live in Indiana, so I don't often have a chance to visit, but whenever I am anywhere close, I detour to Elizabeth for a meal at Algarve.  The paella is absolutely the best I have had anywhere.  I have tried it at upscale restaurants, expecting something close to Algarve's paella, and I have always been disappointed.  Even more frustrating, the cost for paella for one person elsewhere is close to the cost of the massive 2-person kettle of paella at Algarve, which comes complete with a whole split lobster and loads of shrimp, mussels, clams, and scallops.  Even with two toddlers eating with us, there is always enough left from the 2-person serving for another meal!  Finally, the service is great, and the waiters are friendly.  Even with our roughly annual visits, they still remember us when we show up.   Don't miss it!
