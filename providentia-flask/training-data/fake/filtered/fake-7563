My friends and I were visiting for a convention and we really wanted to go to a sushi place. The other two sushi places on the street seemed uninviting, especially to costumers like ourselves. Ginzo, however, was a really friendly place to us. The staff was extremely friendly and willing to help and answer any questions. We all got to try some chicken teriyaki for free which made all four of us buy different teriyaki dishes and some sushi. I was also happy with the rice, which was sticky, not unbearably dry like I've had at other places in the past. It is clean and set up nicely, with a fun casual atmosphere. Inexpensive, really a good place to grab a bite to eat with friends.
