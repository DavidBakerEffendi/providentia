**Don't go!** I booked a table for 8 people on a Saturday night to celebrate a friend's birthday. First we were told they didn't have any menus to bring over to us. Mind you, the restaurant wasn't even close to being at capacity. We repeatedly had to ask for menus and were finally able to order drinks and appetizers. The food arrived and we realized no one ever came by to take our dinner order. Our waiter seemed to leave us high and dry. We flagged down a busboy who did his best to take our order. An hour after ordering, our original waiter finally showed up to tell us that they were out of filet mignons. By this time it was 10 pm and still no dinner in sight. They didn't even start cooking it yet! A large group next to us was having the same issue. We were told we would have dinner in 8 minutes. Instead of waiting for undercooked food, we asked for the check and went somewhere else. I've never seen a restaurant have such a disorganized kitchen. When the manager can't do anything for you but tell you how she shouldn't even be at your table explaining why you still haven't eaten because there are so many tickets piled up in the kitchen, they clearly don't have their act together. Save yourself the trip and eat somewhere else.
