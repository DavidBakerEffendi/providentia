Great place to get a casual meal in Princeton.  The decor is terrific and the food is very good.  The ingredients are all organic and local, and both the savory and sweet combinations are creative and delicious.  These are not your traditional crepes, if that's what you are looking for, they are much better.   The coffee is terrific (Small World) and, if you are not in the mood for crepes, the soups I have tried have been amazing.  You should also try the layered crepe cakes.   The staff is very outgoing and helpful, and they are ironing out the inevitable kinks that come with starting up a new place.  They've been in business there for less than two months and are continually improving the process.  I've seen the change and it looks good.
