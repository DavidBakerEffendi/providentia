My boyfriend and I were attending a performance at the Merriam Theater one evening, and had no plans for dinner.  We were walking around and stumbled upon Varalli's.  The mosaic really drew us in.  The host was welcoming and able to accommodate us on an apparently busy evening.  We were told to skip the chat and to order immediately to "ensure we make it to our show on time".  Neither my boyfriend nor I found this rude; in fact we were both pleased with the honesty of the man.  Our waitress greeted us immediately and said she would be right with us.  When she returned, she informed us of the importance to order fast as well, she told us about the specials, and recommended a couple drinks to try.  She sold us on the House Made Ginger/Orange Mojito. We were impressed.  Overwhelmed by the large menu, we asked Kimberly for recommendations.  She was very detailed in going down the menu and describing her recommendations.  She was on the ball with the drinks, so we trusted her to make us happy and we followed her advice in choosing the shrimp and crab pasta and the scallops. Kimberly suggested we order an appetizer, so we told her to pick.  She went with the calamari.  My boyfriend is an expert, and he said the calamari was the best hes ever had.  Another drink down and our entrees appeared right before us.  Once again, Kimberly was spot-on with her choices.  The scallops were incredible, and the pasta was large enough for two.  Unfortunately we were attending a performance, so taking it back was not an option, but I assure you, we will return on a night we can sit back and enjoy (and take home what we have not finished).   I was impressed with the friendly staff, warm atmosphere, and our attentive server.  She set our evening off to a good start, and after a few drinks in, we had a blast at our show.  We will return!
