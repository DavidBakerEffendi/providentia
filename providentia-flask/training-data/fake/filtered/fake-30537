We frequently dine at this restaurant. We had a party of 6 there recently, including my niece, who is a vegetarian. She found plenty of options! We like the way the food is served as it is ready. The dishes are meant to be shared. The fried brussel sprouts were wonderful ( and I am not a fan of that vegetable). My only complaint is that they no longer have my favorite Ahi Tuna dish! Please bring it back!
