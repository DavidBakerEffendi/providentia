We had a wonderful family dinner at Benito One - my parents were in town and were so tired from doing all the touristy things. This place looked inviting and non-pretentious, and boy were we ever welcomed when we came in.  The staff were so kind and attentive, and seemed genuinely interested in getting to know us. The pasta was fantastic, and the wine went down a little too easy.  All in all, it was a completely comfortable experience.
