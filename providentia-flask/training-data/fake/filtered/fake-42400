what are all the stars for........food is not all that great...service with all the kids as waiters.......and the sangria even though you could say cheap! is not even worth it which is like water. the times i have been there they didn't have margaritas-and i've been there 3 times to try out diffrnt dishes with my buddy we just try the food for flavor and decor. and the bathroom with a hole next to the window....eeewwwww!!!!!!!!!.......eeeeek! me-thinks-not. but that's just my 2 cents.....and i'm a cook in the city came all this way to see the hype-ill stop by some other local ones....
