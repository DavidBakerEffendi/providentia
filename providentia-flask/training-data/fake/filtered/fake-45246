Hey Elizabeth R ... First and for most I wanted to personally  apologize if at anytime you felt when I took your order on 10/26/13 I was in any way rude to you. I pride myself on 100% customer satisfaction and kindness and was recently promoted to supervisor  two  months ago for it and also for great performance . To be honest our heavy customer flow nearly triples on the weekends and I am sorry if I did not include my normal please and thank yous with our call .Although I do not mean this as an excuse... It was also a off day at the pizzeria due to 2 last minute call outs( 1 counter , 1 kitchen staff). I truly was not trying to at all be rude to you in anyway, I was just trying to be sure to attend to every call in a timely fashion since I was on the phones and counter alone. I have also spoken to the crew in regards to the ketchup situation and informed them to thoroughly read  slips...twice to avoid this again in the future. In regards to the replacement food taking long to get to you , I was sure your hot dog was placed first in line and it left along with your chicken bacon ranch slices 7 minutes after I knew of the mess up when you had called, so I think there may be a misunderstanding on that end. I feel terrible about this situation and would like to invite you and your family in for a Free large 2 topping pie along with your choice of 2 liter soda. Please feel free to call me anytime 732 636 1119 for arrangements and again we are truly sorry for any inconvenience :)
