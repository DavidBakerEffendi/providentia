First of all, I paid $5 to get into a bar at 4 in the afternoon, but whatever, I was here for a Barcraft event (broadcasting professional Starcraft and drinking) on Saturday.  Everyone there for Starcraft (~100 people) wascrowded in the back around one TV, and there shouldn't have been a problem with management since everyone was eating and drinking.  The rest of the bar was maybe at 2/3 capacity, we were at standing room.  Didn't really mind, I was drinking, watching Starcraft, and having a good time. Around 5:30, they announce that they are ending the event!  I don't really understand why a place would kick out customers, especially when the event was gonna end at 7pm anyway and make room for your typical Saturday night party crowd. I go up to the owner and express my disappointment that this was ending and that I paid $5 to spend just an hour and a half at his place and that I'd like my cover back, and he just shrugs!  I get there was miscommunication between the organizers, but come on, to just shrug off a frustrated customer??? My friends I was meeting up showed up before having to pay $5 to watch nothing and we went down the street to Lilly O'Briens to drown our sorrows of a spoiled evening. The bar itself I'm sure is okay on regular occasions, but I'll most certainly be taking my business elsewhere because of how unaccommodating the management was in a suboptimal situation.
