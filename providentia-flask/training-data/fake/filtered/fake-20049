Until last week I would have said that Boston's Mistral restaurant (which you must try if you are ever in the area) had the best tuna tartare I've ever tried. Buddakan's tuna knocked it out of the park. The delectable blend of flavors with the creme fraiche made me melt in my chair. I liked it more than the 3 lb. lobster dish my boyfriend and I ordered (which is also fantastic and I highly recommend). Can we also please talk about the Bonsai Martini? I thought that I may never see two of my favorite ingredients in life (lime and cilantro) made into a drinkable form. Thank you, Buddakan, for making my martini dream come true. I still dream about that drink every time I go out in Boston. So much so, that I have begged my boyfriend to take me back the next time I visit him. I would also suggest ordering the mini doughnuts for dessert. They're the perfect end to a fantastic evening.
