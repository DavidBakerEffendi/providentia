My first impression of this new offering in Williston was excitement, as I walked in the door on Sunday of opening weekend and was met with a pub style atmosphere and friendly faces. Upon being seated, my table was informed the restaurant was out of pub fries/chips, and the grass fed beef.  I ordered a cup of chicken soup to start, and was extremely disappointed when, after having to wait 25 min and then ask where the soup was, it was served to me at room temp.  For my meal, I ordered chicken pot pie...again, extreme disappointment. Not only was the pot pie NOT traditional pot pie (it was chicken and gravy with a triangle of philo dough on top), it too was room temp at best. The manager and owner aplogized, chalking it up to opening weekend, issues with the kitchen staff and not having enough outlets in the kitchen.  I left wondering if I would ever return.   This past weekend I had company in town and decided I would give this place another try. Huge disapppointment. I felt as though I'd made a mistake when, while waiting for our meals, I saw two women having to send back their Sheppard's pie for being cold. We ordered burgers - one well done grass fed beef, the other a medium 80/20 beef burger.  Both came out black on the outside and so overly cooked that they were barely enjoyable. One was sent back, in hopes of getting a medium cooked burger. It came back out close to the state of the original.  We left very disappointed, and with a rumbling stomach. I knew instantly something wasn't right. I was sick from that evening through the next evening with severe abdominal cramps and a headache. The only thing different about my meal being the grass fed beef. Suffice it to say, I will not be returning.
