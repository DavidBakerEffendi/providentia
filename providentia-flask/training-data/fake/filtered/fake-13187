I used to go to the old Grimaldi's when I lived in Brooklyn Heights.  The sausage pie was the highlight of the menu, but sometimes it came out burnt and other times soggy and undercooked... I thought that when they moved they might make a change for the better... but apparently they didn't... the line is just as long, thes service is still kurt and you still get rushed out when you are done eating... as for the pizza, it isn't any better than it was in the old space.  I got the margerita this time around and it was pretty bland and the crust wasn't firm enough... Next time I am in the mood for Grimaldi's pizza I am going to go  next door to Juliana's and get it from Patsy Grimaldi himself...
