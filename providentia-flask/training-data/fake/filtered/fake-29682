PLEASANTLY SURPRISED!   This place is so good that I hesitate to reveal this East Village gem in fear that I will have to start waiting in lines to be seated. These burgers are so fantastic that they just demoted Shake Shack from a 4 to a 3. The only thing that tops this is Blimpie Burger in Ann Arbor, Michigan.  Yeah, it's that good! It says it has outdoor seating on yelp,  but the lighting is a terrible orange at night.  Instead, go sit at the burger bar.  Really friendly people make the baby-sized burgers and fresh fries right in front of you.   This isn't your gourmet bleu cheese and truffle oil type of burger.  In fact, there isn't even lettuce and tomato.   You can get it one of 2 ways: with or without bacon.  This place is about the quality of the beef. They grind their own beef daily. The burgers are thin and juicy, but not sloppy. My husband and I had fries, a homemade milkshake, beer and 7 burgers for $40.  We listened to some good music and talked with people who were clearly proud to be making and serving such awesome, simple food.  Not bad for a Saturday night in New York.
