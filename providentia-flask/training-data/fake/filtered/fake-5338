Just went there no less than 1 hour ago.  I ordered the beef and rabe sandwich. What do I get?  Surprise Surprise!!! I get a chicken and spinach wrap with balsamic vinegar.  I go back because I live close by and tell the guy he gave me the wrong sandwich.  Sandwich and wrap are 2 entirely different things.  Beef and Chicken don't sound anywhere near the same.  CAN ANYONE SAY HEARING AID NEEDED? Not only did he screw up my order, but the 2 guys in front of me ordered hot sandwiches.  THEY WERE COLD!!!  MAYBE YOU SHOULD TURN OFF THE FRANK SINATRA MUSIC BOYS!!!  SO YOU CAN HEAR!!! Any way.  Best Place to go is not here but to BeGiovonis in Montclair on Bloomfield Ave.  Across from Fresh Fields.  At least their Meatballs don't bounce off a wall and taste dry as sawdust.  Neither is their Marinara made out of a can of tomatoes pureed in a blender and sold as homemade. If I could give the a 0 star rating, I would!!!
