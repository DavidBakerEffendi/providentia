Being a type A personality... I am very much a planner.  I was apprehensive of selecting a mover, without having someone come out to do a assessment,  but with the recommendations of two cousins I selected to Mambo Movers to move me yesterday.  Best choice I made; I'm happy to say my move went smooth!! Three movers (David, Ross and Mickey) arrived promptly at our arranged time, immediately went into action of moving furniture and boxes.  The guys were professional, fast and worked extremely well as a team.  My belonging were set up at my new location with care.  There was an incident which my china cabinet hutch was damaged during the move, the guys explained and noted the incident which we will follow up with the company today.  All and all the move went smooth, we would recommend them which we did for friends planning to move this week.
