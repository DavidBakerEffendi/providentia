We've had dinner here twice, and ordered out once.  On all occasions, everything was absolutely delicious - fresh, flavorful, interesting, and with the right amount of spice.  Even takeout, which, in most restaurants, is not as good as dining in, was excellent.  The menu has the right mix of traditional and unusual offerings, and the service is warm and friendly.  Hands down, this is the best Indian restaurant in Montclair!
