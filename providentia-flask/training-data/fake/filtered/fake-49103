Another good visit for an early dinner just before things get hopping. Plenty of room at the bar or privacy with the expansive seating. The food is always the best and generous servings. Our waitress Melissa , and all the staff, are not only personable and pleasant but very knowledgeable on  not only the menu but all the beverages that are offered. We always look forward to a draft beer and there are plenty to choose from.. We live in the Adirondacks and stop in  whenever we're in Vermont. You owe it to yourself to stop in for a good experience. john and Lynn AuSable Forks, NY.
