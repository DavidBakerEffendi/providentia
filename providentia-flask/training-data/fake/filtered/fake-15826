I have been making my visit to Juniors every trip I took to NY for a meal. Recently I realized that the thing that made me keep coming back was the desert. (cheesecake) The meals are big portions, but not worth the wait as far as taste. Good quality, but just kind of typical and what you would think about the meal the day after you ate it. The cheesecake is definitely worth it though and I have recently been just going for a slice.
