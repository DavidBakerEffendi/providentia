I loved Mompou! However, I took my friend this afternoon for his birthday and I was very disappointed. At 5:30 when it was super dark outside I had to ask the manager to please adjust the lighting because it felt like we were in a hospital. He acknowledged the oversight and made the adjustment. The daytime bartender was awesome as usual, she makes the best mojitos in Newark and I go there expressly for her Mojitos every Thursday. I called during the day to make sure it was Mojito Thursday  as it had been for the past six months and to check the specials. I was told the specials and assured that the $5 Mojito special was on! They were indeed $5 until the night shift came on. I closed out my tab with the daytime bartender $67 and tipped $15 and re-opened with the night bartender. I totally treat others as would like to be treated. My bill was $21 for 3  mojitos. Not a bad price to be sure but when you call ahead to make sure of an event is on and it is confirmed then I expect to have paid $15 as I had the 6 months prior and as I had paid on my first bill. I still have the receipt. i brought this situation up to the bartender. He was unsympathetic and said "I have to do what they tell me..sorry"  Okay. I said "well I think this is a bit cheesy and rude so I am going to speak to the manager, no offense to you." I spoke to the manager, explained the details and he couldn't have given a crap! He was very dismissive and unapologetic. He really surprised me because I go to this place a minimum of three times a week. I guess they need the $6 more than they need my future business. In this economy and in this situation I believe they really missed the mark. I do not want FREE crap. i can pay for my own drinks. I just want decent service and consistency and tonight Mompou sucked it!
