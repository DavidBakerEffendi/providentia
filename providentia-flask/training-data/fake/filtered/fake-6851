I haven't had such a great dinner in a while. I was at Alta a few months back, so when I was in the West Village last night with my husband thinking of a place to eat, Alta was my first choice. I couldn't have picked a better place to end our long weekend. The food here is delicious. It's true gourmet, which honestly I haven't found in a while. It can add up, but honestly I've spent a lot more without enjoying it as much. The flavors, the options, the presentation - all phenomenal. You can't go wrong. Everything we ordered was fabulous.
