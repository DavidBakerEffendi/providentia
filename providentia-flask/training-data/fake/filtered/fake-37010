For families, for singles, for couples or groups, this is a great tour.  You'll never again ignorantly order a slice without thinking of the type of cheese and tomato being used, how long they rise the dough or the type of oven it's cooked in.  And you'll have a blast learning it all. But as good as the pizza is, the real star of the show is Scott.  He's the rare person who is genuinely enthused by what he does and it comes across in buckets.   Really did a great job. Thanks Scott, we had a blast.  Everyone else, if you're reading this Sign Up Now for this tour.  You won't regret it. P.S. A couple other notes: *  the walking tour provides a pretty good general geographic overview of parts of SoHo, Little Italy, the Bowery and the West Village. *  the walking is not challenging at all--perhaps a maximum of 6-8blocks at a single go, perhaps a total of a mile or so over the whole route *  great for kids, we had our 9-year old and she loved it
