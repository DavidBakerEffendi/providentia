This was a suggestion from a friend who has a standing reservation each week at Bibou. The foie gras and bone marrow was  different and delicious. The staff was very attentive and the ambience was wonderful. We went back with friends and had the escargot, filet and snapper..  Excellent One of the best meals my husband and I ever had!!
