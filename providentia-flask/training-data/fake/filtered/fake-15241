I have been coming here for over 15 years, maybe 20! At least since I was a kid. It's my home away from home. We always get the roasted duck with ho-fun, "dry" chow beef ho-fun (aka beef chow fun), or jook (rice porridge). The place may look like a hole in the wall but it's the best joint ever! Don't be afraid to go inside this place.
