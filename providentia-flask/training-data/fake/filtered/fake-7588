Panino Rustico is a welcome addition to Bensonhurst. There is great coffee, paninis, crepes and free wifi at the cafe. It's a good place to study, grab a bite to eat, and catch up with friends. I recommend any of the classic paninis with prosciutto di Parma, and a banana and nutella crepe that's drizzled with Hershey's chocolate syrup on top. As a few of the other reviewers have mentioned, service is a little slow because there's usually only 1-2 guys in the back assembling the paninis and toasting them. Well worth the wait, though. You won't be dissapointed if you come here, so check it out!
