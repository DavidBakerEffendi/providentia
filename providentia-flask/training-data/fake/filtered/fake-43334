We ordered party food for our home party- lunch. We are highly satisfied with the quality of food. It was our first try here and will be our pick for more parties with Indian cuisine . Highly recommendable for AUTHENTIC ( punjabi) food . Dishes like Chili paneer ( Appetizer) , Panner masala ( entree ), onion Kulcha ( bread) and Kheer ( desert) were highly appreciated by everyone. Be careful with the delivery charges , picking up the food by yourself might be a better option!!!!
