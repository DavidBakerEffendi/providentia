I really like the atmosphere here.  Recently I was here and had a great cup of soup and sandwich but it is pretty pricey and you can eat the same food at the actual restaurants represented in the market for much less money without the crown.   Although expensive, if you have a lot of indecisive people or people who can not agree on what to eat, this is where to go, you can get anything you want and everyone can have a different type of food!  Great shops and specialty places are also here.
