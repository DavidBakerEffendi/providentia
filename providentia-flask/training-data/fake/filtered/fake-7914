Yummy vegetarian food.  Yummy often means fattening so don't think that eating vegetarian here will shrink your waist line.   The best fake chicken cheesesteaks in Philly. The food is a tad pricey and don't be in a hurry when you go. Having said that, I'm grateful for the opportunity to practice patience.
