I made a reservation for 7:15 on a Saturday night. We arrived at 7:05 and were immediately seated at a table by a window . It was a cold night and the heat was turned up. We sat next to a heating element and it was a little uncomfortable but bearable. The bread was hot but very crusry and just average. I've had better bread at many other restuarants.  My frind ordered the salmon dish and I ordered the shrimp and scallops with marinara. They were both average but could have been served a little warmer. My friend orderede  a side of broccoli that was tasty and large enough for two people.  She commented that was the best part of the meal. We were a little surprised that the broccoli was an extra for $ 5.50 which the waiter failed to mention. A little misunderstanding. The dinner experience was avergae. My friend  and I discussed the dinner after we left and we came to the conclusion that we couldn't recommend Enzo's to any of our friends.
