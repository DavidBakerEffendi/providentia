From the second i walked in I felt comfortable because of the amazing ambience. An airy room full of fresh flowers and exposed brick and vines. Not only was our waitress waiting on us but she was the cook and owner as well. I personally respect and enjoy this type of experience and find it somewhat refreshing. I highly recommend the banana cream pie which is freshly baked by the owner herself! I look forward to going back and trying more what they have to offer.
