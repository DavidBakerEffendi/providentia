Lombardi's serves truly great pizza but it is inconsistent: one night you will get plenty of mozzarella, the next time you will barely get any.   Food: The best combination of topping I've found so far is meatballs, pepperoni, and red onions. It is an explosion of flavor and brings a smile to my face. The sauce has a sweet tang to it, and when you fold your slice in half, all the cheese, grease, and sauce runs together, making you never ever want to put that slice down until it's finished.  It's so good that I've eaten an entire pizza myself in one sitting (note: the pizzas are quite large, even the small). Ambiance: I have to compliment Lombardi's for this. As opposed to Grimaldi's, at Lombardi's you actually have room. It's also not ridiculously loud which is helpful if you actually want to have a conversation. Although the decor is a bit plain, they do have some neat artwork. Cons: Although it is really good pizza, each topping is like $3 -- extra mozz is a must because they are usually stingy on the cheese. By the time you add two real toppings, you're looking at a $25 small pie.  I would say that cash only is a con, but they have an ATM right inside the restaurant. Overall: Great food, could be a little less stingy on the cheese!
