Butcher Bar has fantastic food. Everything I've had here, from sandwiches, ribs, cornbread muffins, mac and cheese, etc has been amazing. My boyfriend set up a birthday party for me here and they did an amazing job of catering to a private party - about 20 people. The pricing was really reasonable and they were so accommodating and really made my birthday special. I've been back multiple times and each time I've been so pleased with the food, the service, everything. They're also a really excellent addition to the neighborhood in terms of a butcher. I wanted to get my hands on some beef fat for baking and they were the only butcher who could accommodate. Definitely worth a trip for either dinner or for picking up supplies!
