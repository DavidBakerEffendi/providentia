I walked into Puerto Viejo by mere chance and what a Wonderful surprise! My wife is Dominican so I know the food and culture quite well. All I have to say is that this spot is legit! The menu is authentic and the interactions are warm just like back in the island. What surprised me the most was the beautiful space as Dominican restaurants are not known to be aesthetically pleasing. However, Puerto Viejo's vision is finely executed and reflects the growing generation of Dominicans in New York. The food is Delicious and the portions are generous. My wife and I shared the Picadera and I then had the Salmon and my wife had the Sancocho which tasted just like the one her Mom makes for us.... we even ordered a container to take back to the hotel. I congratulate Puerto Viejo for being such an innovator and adding value to this neighborhood. If you want to be transported to a different place and indulge in delicious food, this is it. Â (y)
