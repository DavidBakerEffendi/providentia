All I can say is if you are going to specialize in burgers you better have the best burgers in town we all agreed Â they failed. Five Guys makes better burgers. Our sever was very nice, service was good. We all had burgers and fries. Fries were good nothing special but the burgers were tough and tasteless. As a new restaurant I hope it's just because they are still working out the kinks.
