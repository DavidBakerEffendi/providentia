Just went here for the first time this past Saturday night.  From the exterior, nothing special.  The interior is crowded and rather plain.  BUT, the food and the prices are wonderful.  We had salad and a main dish each and it came to under $30 (we are vegetarian so the entrees were only $10 each).  Wait staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Only complaint was that they charged $3.50 for tea - we only ordered for one but they came with two cups.  Regardless, before my wife poured, a waitress rushed over to tell us to wait another minute to let it finish steeping and then she poured it for us, didn't like that it wasn't strong enough looking and replaced it with a new serving. I would definitely return.  I thought the portion sizes were reasonable and priced right.
