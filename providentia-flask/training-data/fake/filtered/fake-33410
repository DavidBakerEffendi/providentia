Food is yummy, but the service is too rushed for 4 stars.  Three courses in an hour!  Our waiter was perfunctory-he said & did all the right things, but .. I don't know if the waiter had to be somewhere or they just want to turnover tables quickly. Our bil could have been almost doubled if it wasn't so rushed. They did not give us an opportunity for pre-dinner drinks & they brought entrees as they were clearing our appetizer plates, so I was still sipping on my chardonay as a steak arrived. We did not even consider desert wine or anything after the big rush. Maybe an 8 PM dinner on a weeknight is just too late for Max Downtown. I have dined a few times at Trumbull Kitchen at 8 & have received unhurried service. Too bad, because the food was nice.
