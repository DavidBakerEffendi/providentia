beautiful sophisticate space - great cut of beef prepared perfectly- (for the rep, price, and ambiance however- I would expect and accept no less) I know I know It was mean... I'm a little bitter about the economy making it harder for me to go to a place like this. We were offered a choice of veg- (always appreciated at a nice place like this) I chose the citrus ginger whole baby carrots and they were a perfect light side for my large filet - no problem getting sat but it was like 10 pm on a weekday- so I'm not sure how they usually are. My vegitarian friend raved about the veggie burger (if that means anything to anyone) Lost one star because the desserts were not great aka not worth the calories and once you have a glob of peanut butter flavored crap in your mouth you have lost the yummy reminicence of your lovely dinner till the next time. Skip the desserts bring a lot of $$$ and enjoy a nice classy meal.
