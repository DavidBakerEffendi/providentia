Don't bother! Was excited to try it when it opened and then I did, the service is so bad, ruins it all. Food is new and interesting, but at the end of the day, the pizzas are greasy and over priced, and the amateur service is not worth a dime. Â I gave it a fair try. First, went in for a drink-limited wine list and even though the bar was not full, took 10 minutes for a glass. Second, went for dinner but the seating is so limited and close together-they gave more space to their bartenders. Third, waiting 10 minutes for water, 10 minutes for first drink, but then we were there 1/2 hour before we could even order the service was so slow. Finally, when they served the pizzas-- they were shoved on the table, all three pizzas almost toppled over! And, with no Parmesan cheese or pepper flakes, we had to ask for our own condiments and then got attitude for asking! We watched the tables fill up around us and they were all having the same problem! We didn't even bother taking another bite and took off, Don't bother!
