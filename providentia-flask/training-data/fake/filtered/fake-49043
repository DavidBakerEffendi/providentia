Absolutely horrendous.  The management of this restaurant is utterly incompetent.  We were told the wait for our reserved Hibachi seats was 2 hours - one hour after we arrived - that they "overbooked" the hibachi side of the house.  We wound up taking seats at tables instead of the hibachi area after a 90 min + wait.  The staff were totally utterly overwhelmed - not their fault - management's fault.  Half our party were served their dinner while the other half waited another 20 minutes or more for their food.  My meal was the scallops and shrimp.  The scallops were cooked properly but not cleaned properly - all the scallops were gritty.  The shrimp was ridiculously over-cooked.  The appetizer of calamari - overcooked - most likely because the kitchen was just as overwhelmed by the gigantic mess the front of the house created for themselves and their customers.  I'd rather dine at McDonalds than this place, and obviously will never return.
