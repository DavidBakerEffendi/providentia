I am a NYC fine dining regular and was excited to give Hearth a shot after numerous excellent reviews. Upon arrival, we were greeted by a pleasant hostess and a large, spare dining room with padded carpet strips on one wall. Hearth has a large, seemingly complicated wine list that is likely excellent by-the-bottle, but too highbrow if going by-the-glass. After plenty of consultation with our server, we opted for the autumn tasting menu with one substitution. The salad course was not remarkable, with light dressing reminiscent of Henri's Tas-tee on the pear and pecorino salad. Next came lukewarm pumpkin ravioli that was so sweet it made my teeth ache, like a too-rich dessert.  The next day I read a 2006 interview with Chef Canora, who noted the following:  "The filling of the pumpkin tortelli that I serve at Hearth in the fall is made with Mostarda di Cremona, which is essentially a jar of radioactive-looking fruits, and store-bought amaretti cookies."  Assuming he used the same filling here in 2009.  I certainly wish I would have seen that ahead of time. The main course of venison (again, lukewarm) was overcooked yet flavorful.  The server smartly and subtly tried to warn me off of it and I should have taken her advice. My wife substituted the duck, which was excellent and the best thing we ate that evening. The apple crisp dessert was very basic and very good. In the end, I was turned off by the coldness of the dining room and the average quality of the food, especially at those prices.
