Horrible food lately. I have been going to this place for a few years now. However, in the past few months, the food and service has gone down the drain. The food frankly is below average now. Ordered the chicken kadai recently. The dish was filled with huge chicken pieces and large chunks of vegetables. This has happened with other dishes too. Seems like the chef prefers not spending the time chopping his veggies fine. Will not return to this place again.
