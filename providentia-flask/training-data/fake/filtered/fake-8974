Have never eaten dinner here, but was very impressed by a muddled ginger cocktail that I had.  I would go back just for that drink!  I have been on the weekends, and the place gets too crowded.  It has a long narrow bar in front, and you are making friends just to squeeze by into the back of the bar.
