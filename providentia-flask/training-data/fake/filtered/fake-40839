Their pizzas taste good because their ingredients taste fresh as promised. The tomato sauce is definitely a level above average but not excellent. It tasted really good the first 5 visits and then I started hunting for white-pizza options. And that's how I discovered their special clam-garlic pizza. This is definitely worth the long wait and your moolah. This flavor maybe available in many pizza/pasta restaurants. But, very few get the flavor right. I'm not a too much of a fan of garlic. However, Lombardi managed to strike a good balance with plenty of clams and garlic to make this pizza an A. If you go lombardi's, even if you are not a fan of "white " pizzas, you will not regret this!
