Hands down the best bagel spot in the Burlington area. Great bagels (the everything bagel is the best in Burlington), reasonable prices and the staff is incredibly friendly. The baked goods and soups are also fantastic. I frequent here for lunch often and I have nothing negative to say about this place, they have a creative menu and you will not leave disappointed.
