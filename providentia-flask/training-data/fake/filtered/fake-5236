EXCELLENT ! My experiences have NEVER been as bad as the other reviewer and after reading her opinions of various restaurants I now understand she is not happy with any place she visits.....it must be sad to have such an unpleasant palate..... with that said, I would like to tell you about my experience. I am in the area quite often on business and make it a point to stop into Marzullo's for what I consider to be one of the best Italian dining experiences I have had.  The menu is extensive and the service is good.   I also agree with the other reviewer "Angelo" regarding they make you feel like you have been a customer for years.  When I see the owner, he always makes it a point to come over and shake my hand.  You don't see "special treatment" like this very often anymore. Unfortunately, they do not have any restaurants in my area that even compare to Marzullo's, so it is something I look forward to when I am in town. ~ Maybe they should consider overnighting dinners upon request, LOL, that is something I will have to ask them about on my next visit.
