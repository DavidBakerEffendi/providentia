This place exploits Muslims. It wasn't just the extremely over priced meats that upset me( i am also taking into consideration that it is organic and free range ) but also the way how they interacted with customers, those Muslim and non, that had me praying for them. The reason why I stated that it exploits muslims  is that 1) there are no Surahs, Aayah or other words praising/ remembering Allah (Subhanahu Wa Ta'ala) on the wall that is always customary for Muslim owners 2)  the workers are extremely rude, they do not respond to muslim greetings and other Arabic sayings for thank you and good bye. As a muslim when u do  halal business with another Muslim you expect to be respected from another muslim/ owner of a store that sells halal things and this is simply not the case here. The owners of this store are simply just trying to tap in to the growing Muslim market in philadelphia and nothing more.  I pray that Allah (swt) will help them become better people. Dont go here..it is soo much better to go to Mecca market 20 blocks away at 43 n walnut or the one in germantown....
