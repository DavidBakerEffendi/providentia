Great! We walked in on a slower night and were accomodated at the nice table! Our server was descriptive with both food and wine. For wine we had nice muscat at a reasonable price. The best dishes were duck breast with sunchokes and tomatoes, duck egg with aged tuna (very highly recommended!), stuffed piquillo peppers, foie gras with onions..... duck heaven! Everything was coursed out for us by our great server! Food tasted very seasoned, very spanish! Nice crema catalana at the end with a couple of glasses of sweet muscat - can't beat an amazing nyc dining experience! Bravo!
