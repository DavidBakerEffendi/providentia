Love this place! I've been for dinner with friends and brunch with family and each time the menu surprises me in a new and consistently pleasant way. The service is always great, too. The owner/manager is particularly hard-working and they always bend over backwards to accommodate my party and me (we rarely make a reservation). Every person I've taken to Feast has also raved about it. And since they've opened, the momentum seems to be continuously building, which pleases me because they deserve it.
