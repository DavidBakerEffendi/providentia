This has become one of my favorite restaurants to eat on the east coast. We didn't have a reservation for a saturday lunch, but we were seated immediately, with 80% occupancy. The overall quality, presentation, and taste of the food was great. To start, we had half a dozen fresh oysters, and mussels with green curry lime & cilantro. For main, we had seared scallops, and lobster benny. The lobster benny in particular was to die for. Utterly scrumptious. For dessert, we shared the banana cake, which is very good for a banana cake.[10/10]* We were seated at the oyster bar, in our view the restaurant has a large open clean concept, which we love. [9/10]* Our waitress was extremely friendly and vivacious. All our plates also came promptly and nicely spaced in between. [9/10]* Our restaurant experiences and similar favorite comparisons: Rockpool (Sydney), Sydney's Fish Market (Sydney), Doyles Watsons Bay (Sydney) * 1 = the lowest, 10 = the highest
