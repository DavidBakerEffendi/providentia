I just had one of the worst non/delivery experiences in all of my life. I have eaten at Sawatdee a few times. I have never found them to be particularly skilled in dealing with customers, but never did I imagine they'd be this awful. I called them for delivery at 6:12pm. I placed a very large order of at least $60 worth of food. They quoted me 45 minutes for delivery. I live only 5 or 6 blocks away. (I also happen to live next to My Thai-so in hindsight I wish I had just gone there). At 7:20pm I still had not received my food. So I called them. When I called the man who answered the phone told me my food was still sitting there and that they would bring it to me as soon as their delivery guy returned. So we would be looking at at least another 15 minutes, possibly more. Which would bring us to around a 90 minute wait time. I was not happy! So I asked him what they were going to do for me. To that he said "nothing." I told him that wasn't a good way to treat customers and that I would rather just cancel my order if this is how they treat their customers. To this he simply said "ok." He also then proceeded to tell me he "had a million other things he needed to do right now." I then heard the owner in the background yell "tell her to "F**** off." Needless to say, we canceled our order and went to My Thai.
