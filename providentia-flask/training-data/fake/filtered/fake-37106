I should have written this review sooner as this was the venue for our daughter's wedding July of this year. John Henry is the man but Trish makes the day. I could not begin to explain what a truly amazing wedding reception they provided. From the outdoor terrace cocktail reception to the ballroom decorated to perfection and elegance. We had 250 guests and there was not one negative comment about the food or service. Our guests still comment that this was the best wedding reception they have ever attended. The entire staff was attentive and friendly. I also would recommend DJ John Rossi he kept everyone dancing all night long. Trish's attention to detail, pleasant and caring demeanor made the evening absolutely magnificent. We have expressed our appreciation several times to John and Trish for making our daughter and son in law's day memorable. Mickey and Ginny King
