Was a first time visitor tonight, some friends told us about it and we figured we would try it. The atmosphere was very nice, although they had a live guitar player that was too loud and was a little difficult to talk, but he was a good player, so that was good. We were greeted by a very friendly waiter, William. Being first timers we asked him about the menu and he seemed very knowledgable about the menu and with a lot of enthusiasm about the food. After we ordered drinks we had some chips and out of this world salsa. After asking me what I likee, william suggested the lomo asado mixtu, whcih is an out of this world steak experience!!! I never expected such a perfectly cooked sirloin, along with delicious refried beans and yellow rice. My wife had the Jailisco Burrito which I tasted, and it too was out of this world!!!!! Â William gave us world class service, while not bothering us every 2 minutes like some servers do, but making us feel like we were eating with family. The entire first time experience was incredible, great food, amazing service.....we will definetly be coming back again.
