Estia met our needs perfectly. My fianc√©e wanted a fantastic meal while we were on vacation. We got it. We ordered from the theater menu and we thoroughly pleased with each course. The tzatziki was splendid and the htipiti was otherworldly amazing. The chicken with orzo astounded her; such simple ingredients blew my lady away in the way they were prepared. I had the lamb; it satisfied in ways I didn't think food could. We were promptly served. Having read the other reviews I see that is something have found less than pleasing. We went on a Monday at 7 and the restaurant was comfortably populated. I cannot speak for other patrons. I can say that the waiter arrived each time on time at our table. He was attentive without being a nuisance, which is a wonderful trait for a waiter. The theater menu was definitely worth it. I would patronize Estia every future occasion I find myself in Philadelphia.
