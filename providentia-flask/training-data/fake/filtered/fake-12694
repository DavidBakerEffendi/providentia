The food is ok,  nothing to remember. The wine list is not interesting at all and over priced for the quality of the wines. The ambiance is ok. The service is awful. I really was not impressed with this place and I will not recommend  to anyone.This is not an Italian restaurant, it is much  more a revisited new American want to be Italian. That's why is not for me.
