I frequent this Jose's often and it is one of my favorite local restaurants. Everything is so delicious. Normally, I order fajitas, which come on skillets, still sizzling. The chips and salsa are always good, and the fact that they're free doesn't hurt at all. Amazing decor inside, and even if you just want to sit at the bar and have a few drinks it's still a great time
