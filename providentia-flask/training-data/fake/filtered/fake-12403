We had a nice meal here.  Though it took a month to the day to make a reservation which was annoying.  The ricotta dip with sea salt and herbs is a must have.  We then had pasta dishes which were excellent.  The grandmas ravioli was very nice too.  Our sea scallops were cooked very well and delicious.  We were so full by desert that we only had a few bites.  It is very pricey but the food was delicious.
