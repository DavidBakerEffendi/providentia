Bella's is the best breakfast in CT by far. They always have a unique selection of brunch items and great coffee. To top it all off the waitstaff and hostess are kind, helpful, and engage in delightful conversation. The great food combined with the lively staff keeps my husband and I coming back here whenever we can.
