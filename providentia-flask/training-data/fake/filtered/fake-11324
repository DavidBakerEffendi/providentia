Took my fiance here for his birthday. It was both our first time, decided to get a cheese platter and a few glasses of wine. The menu was a little confusing but the waitresswas very helpful. We then had amazing gelato, and bought some food to take home with us. Very different type of atmosphere, would def. go again.
