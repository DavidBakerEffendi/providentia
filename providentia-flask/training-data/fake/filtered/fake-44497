Very good marks for cooking, not so good for customer service and honesty.  Without any kind of verbal notice or sign on the buffet, upon receipt of the buffet bill we discovered we got 'ambushed' with a mandatory tip exceeding 19% (they charge 18% and they then round it up...)  No other Indian buffet restaurant in town I've ever been to does anything like this. Not saying that there should be no tipping for self-service buffet.  But making it this high, making it mandatory and especially doing it without prior notice is dishonest and probably illegal.  I contacted the restaurant about this matter on their web site.  Six days later, no response.
