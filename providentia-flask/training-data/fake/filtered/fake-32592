Went here with some friends for the $10 lunch special (w/ soft drink) on a weekday, and the place was pretty much empty with the exception of one couple at the bar. The soft drinks are refilled. We had some different orders: the crab cake, croque-monsieur, sandwich au boeuf, ravioli, and steak tartare. A la carte items included the trout with lemon butter sauce (was surprised but pleased to get a whole fish - not so pleased about the tail that was cut off yet still remaining on the plate) and pasta with clams & mussels ($16 each). The lunch special is fine if you're after a sandwich, but otherwise, you'll likely want something more, which is where they make money off of you with the a la carte items. The floating island dessert ($7) was okay; the raspberry coulis sauce was kind of sour. Â There are much better French places that I would pay more for, but this place is okay for a quick lunch. I most likely won't be back, but service (by the bartender) was very good, as well as food presentation. Whether or not this place is a good deal depends on how you choose to eat.
