After a couple not so great experiences, I finally realized that London is one of those really great neighborhood places-if you know what to order.  Went here with my hubby and another couple-the nachos for the app were great, and they brought us a little plate of mushrooms to sample.  I had the mussels in red for my entree which were great-the mussels were big, the bowl filled generously, and the red sauce was great!  Everyone else in my group was happy too with the food.  The sangria wasn't so great.   One of the big benefits, in my opinion, is that unlike a lot of restaurants, they'll let you order off the bar menu in the dining room, which has good prices.
