Quite delicious. I had a Southern chicken sandwich, which was crunchy and good. The sweet pickles, which they called a cole slaw, were a nice touch. I will say that the server was a little peculiar. Not very friendly and preoccupied with her own drama. Perhaps if restaurants paid a living wage, staff could be more professional.
