I had dinner here recently with my husband. We were looking for a place near the Pavilion Theater (which I definitely wouldn't recommend!), and this place had good ratings. When we walked in, the place was completely empty. I will say that it was a Sunday night, so I guess it's not too out of the ordinary to be slow then. However, the atmosphere just remained downright awkward, even after a couple other people came in. I think it's mainly because of the dated decor. Normally this wouldn't be too big of a deal, but things got a bit worse when we had to wait quite a long time for our food to come out, and other diners who had entered after us were served first. However, Le P'tit Paris definitely redeemed itself with the quality of the food we got. We each ordered what we thought were "safe" dishes, since we were feeling iffy about the place. Both the chicken dish and steak dish we ordered were surprisingly good. So I have mixed feelings about this place, and truly think it's worth three stars.
