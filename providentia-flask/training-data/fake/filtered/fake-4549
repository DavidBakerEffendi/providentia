Finally some great biscuits & gravy in Philly!  Side portion was economical & enough to satisfy two people, not to mention delicious & buttery.   I was a bit surprised when the yolks in my Eggs Benedict were cooked well done (hard), but the staff corrected & replaced the meal very quickly & sweetly. two little BEWARES: $6 for a large Tropicana quality/not fresh squeezed orange juice (I could get a pint of nice beer for less $).  Green Egg's small size is $3, but the large OJ is not listed, so we assumed it would be about 4.50... $6 is incredibly expensive considering an entire half gallon of juice of the same quality at the grocery store is $3.99. $30 credit card minimum- so bring cash because the food pricing is pretty fair & it may be hard to run up a $30 bill - if your not ordering large juice... I will definitely return to Green Eggs to sample more of their interesting menu, but I'll bring cash & order water.
