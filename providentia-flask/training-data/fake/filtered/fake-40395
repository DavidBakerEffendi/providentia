The food here is so good.. and cheap. It's small inside and the wait can be looonnnggg on weekends, but worth it. My friend and I are addicted to the chicken spring rolls.. OMG! we get 2 orders each. SO GOOD! and the spicy noodles (both chicken and shrimp) are good, as well as the chicken fried rice. The portions are great, the staff is nice. We love it there. Can't wait to go back. I would've given it 5 stars BUT, the place is small, and they only accept cash..which can be very inconvenient.
