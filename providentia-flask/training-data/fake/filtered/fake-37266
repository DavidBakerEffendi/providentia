My fiance and I went here for the first time today and had a great meal. We came in at around 3:30 PM so we didn't have to wait since there were only a couple of other diners. The restaurant is a bit in the pricey range (most entrees are $20-$30), but my fiance and I chose to share an appetizer and entree in order to save money. The portions were quite filling even with sharing. We got: *Beef heart anticuchos with choclo corn and potatoes *Escabeche de pescado (cod with pickled onions and yams). You also get your choice of side dishes with the entree so we chose yuca. *Chocolate mousse topped with lucuma ice cream, bananas, and strawberries The anticuchos were definitely the best part of the meal. Â We both agreed they were the best food we'd eaten all month. If you come here and you're a meat eater, you HAVE to try these. The entree and dessert were also delicious...I'm craving the chocolate mousse right now. The service was great; the waiter was always refilling our glasses of water, and the entree was ready as soon as we finished our appetizer. The waiter was knowledgeable and answered the questions we had about the cuisine. They also gave us complimentary glasses of corn cider after our meal, and roasted choclo corn kernels with some kind of spicy sauce before ordering. The restaurant has an overall nice ambiance, with tree slices and carvings in the shape of animals on the walls. Some Latin-type music is playing in the background, but it's on a low volume. The bathroom is very clean and well-stocked. Overall I would definitely recommend coming here to anyone who's looking to try something new.
