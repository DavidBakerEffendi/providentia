Just no, no bueno. They changed ownership from a cute old lady (who retired and moved to Florida or something like that) and idk who the new owners are now, but everything's gone downhill: taste, freshness, portion size cleanliness, ugh. Sad because I used to love this place! Came here for my high school graduation dinner- ah, the good old days.
