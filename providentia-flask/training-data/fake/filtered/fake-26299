Joe's is the best Italian food in the area ! Try the Chicken ,Mutz and red peppers sandwich hot. The Osso Bucco is crazy on the dinning room side! Just ate some pasta with some bolognese gravy. This was great ! In 15 years I never had a bad lunch or dinner. The staff all Â named Joe, except for Gianni AKA Vin Diesel, are all great. Could spend a day there just listening to the host of characters that come in there. If you don't love this food over all the other local places. Go back to Mc Donalds!!! Don't ask for your sandwich cut into thirds!!
