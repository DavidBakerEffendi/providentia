I've been to Blues many times and always go back. I love the atmosphere and the food. The wings and ribs are ridiculous, the meat just falls off the bones. Every person I have brought there for both business and personal have been back several times now. I love how you can mix all the different BBQ sauces they have and come up with a ton of different favors. If you haven't been yet I would highly recommend going and hidden room is pretty cool too.
