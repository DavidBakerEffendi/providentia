Ok, I made a yelp account just for the purpose to review this restaurant. I see that this place has just three stars and the reviews for this place cannot be further from the truth. My brother and I have been going here for about 2 years now and I recently got my girlfriend (who didn't like sushi) to start going and we all crave it 4 or 5 days after we eat there. The 21 or 22 all you can eat sushi deal is great and the special rolls you can order make it pay for itself. Their miso soup is great and if you add chili sauce it brings it over the top. Â  My favorite rolls of theirs: Kings Roll Passion Roll Spicy Tuna Roll Butterfly Roll (no mango) Try this place again with the rolls I listed and I am sure you will enjoy this restaurant. Do not let these negative reviews fool you.
