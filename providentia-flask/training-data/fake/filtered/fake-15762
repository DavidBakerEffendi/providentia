My family and I went to Lorenzo's for dinner on a Saturday night 1/29/12 for my parents 50th Anniversary. We had reservations for 6 and were seated at the table that Janice S. must have gotten after we asked to be moved. The table was clearly big enough for a party of 10 and my Brother and Sister in law were not happy being seated in front of the kitchen door with waiters and waitresses coming in and out. Also we couldn't hear each other talk. We asked to be moved to a more intimate table and were immediately taken care of. The restaurant was extremely busy, but we expected that. The food is always excellent the service was so so... we were there for over three hours from appetizers to dessert, but that is also expected at Lorenzo's too. They take their time with you and don't rush you, the Italian way. My mother and I got the Veal Lorenzo one of our favorite dishes, my father the zuppa de pesce, my husband the shrimp scampi, great, fresh food, large generous portions. I know Lorenzo makes his own Italian bread and it is excellent. Dessert was good too and the Cappuccino. We always talk about frequenting Lorenzo's even though it is few and far between times that we go, but we will be back...
