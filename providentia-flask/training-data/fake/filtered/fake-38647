Nice place, trendy, somehow too  noisy , good food, but the price is not aligned with quantity : The amount of pasta in the plate is very poor , the cheese we chose we had  less than 10grs including skin that we cannot eat and the rest of the plate was full of crackers and almond crumble that we don't care for ! So unfortunately this strategy doesn't work we won't go again. Cat Jan.3rd 2015
