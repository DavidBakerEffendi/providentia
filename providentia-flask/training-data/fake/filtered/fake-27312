Had dinner at Park Avenue Tavern because it near our hotel. The service was great, the food was also very good. I order a tavern salad fresh and great dressing. The New England clam chowder one of the best I've had, smoky flavor from the bacon and lots of clams. The sweet potato croquettes were delicious. Â My companions had the lobster roll and salmon. They said it was very good. The place was busy with lots of business people around the bar area.
