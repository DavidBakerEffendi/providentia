This is my favorite go-to spot in the neighborhood for happy hour or late night cocktails as well as a casual dinner.  The happy hour is fabulous with great wines as well as fantastic cocktails (2 for 1!).   And I know I can never go wrong with the sumac chicken or the double-cut pork chop (if that's available on special). I do have to give a special shout-out to my favorite bartender, Henry.  He made sure to reach out to me one of the first times I sat in the restaurant.  The second time I arrived, he remembered not only my ams, but the type of drink I liked.  He has a way of making people feel special, therefor making the bar/restaurant feel special.
