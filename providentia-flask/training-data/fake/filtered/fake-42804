Went here twice and haven't been let down yet. Their Roti is magnificent, the service is fast and the Spicy Fried Squid Tentacles leave me smiling for hours. In all seriousness, the Seafood Rice Noodles is a simple yet infinitely flavorful dish that is enough to fill one but serve two or three. The Salted Fish and Broccoli? FANTASTIC. I've yet to try even a quarter of the menu, but I plan on going back to remedy that.
