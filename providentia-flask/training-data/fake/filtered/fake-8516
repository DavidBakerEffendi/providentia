I'm originally from the area, and was checking out my old stomping grounds when we happened upon Rocco's while looking for somewhere to eat.  I was a bit reluctant as I'd never eaten there before, and, to be honest, the exterior wasn't the most appealing (although very clean).  Well, ya know what?  Who cares?  This was the best pizza I've had in years!!  There were 4 of us and we were still talking about this pizza the next day, wishing we lived close enough to visit more often.  I agree with the previous post, better than NYC pizza (at least any I've had recently!).  Highly recommended,  can't wait to go back!  Please, everyone, patronize this place...I want to make sure it stays open!
