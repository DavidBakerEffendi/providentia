I have been to Villa Barone quite often since it has been under new ownership and with good reason.  The staff is respectful, knowledgeable, and hard-working to ensure that your experience is a fantastic one.  The owners are so deserving of their success.  The food is phenomenal and they will create anything for you if you have a special request.  They treat you like family and you feel so welcome when you are there.
