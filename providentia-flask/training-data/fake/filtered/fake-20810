I used to enjoy coming to this diner to eat, but not anymore. When they first opened the prices were cheap and the quality and quantity of food was awesome, so the first price hike was ok and probably expected by most, not to mention the prices stayed decent. However that is NOT the case now, your a "new business" so you should not be jacking up your prices again and personally I think your prices this time are too high and I think it is down right rude that you dont have new to go menus and the old ones say prices updated on website and they are not even updated yet you still expect your loyal customers to pay all this extra money for less quantity and much less quality without even letting us aware the prices raised when we place our orders, rude and inconsiderate! I know longer will be bringing my business nor will my friends, so much for caring about the customers, you people did a great job of putting on a fake face in the beginning but we see through you now. Maybe you should have stuck with your guilford diner and only that one, very disapointed in the way you do your business, im sure you'll lose many customers and you should. NEVER AGAIN!
