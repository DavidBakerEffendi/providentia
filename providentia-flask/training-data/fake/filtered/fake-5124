I would say that this place is intimidating upon arrival because of the french castle decor, the petite chandeliers and drapes hanging off the ceilings.  The hostesses are of a model appearance in strict and sleek black and white attire.  There is a mandatory coat check at the front.  The crowd is also very in tune with upscale. Dinner reservations are recommended but we were accommodated with a slight wait, enjoying a few very special cocktails of fruit puree and spirits.  The dinner was what you expect of an upscale restaurant, everything was unique, exquisitely presented, small portions on big plates.  The service was outstanding and catered to every wish.  They served off the menu warm up snacks, post dinner palate cleansers and a cookie tray.  It was an "experience" to say the least, and that is what made it all the more special.  I found the environment really romantic and perfect for a date.  The bathrooms downstairs were also in a french castle style.  Its expensive, but when its delicious, memorable and you get a food souvenir in the form of a pound cake freshly baked in their "bakery"  type thing on your way out with your coat, it makes it all worthwhile.
