Some friends took me here when I visited them in NY - loved the experience.  For appetizers, we had the beets and creamy polenta.  Polenta was made with truffle oil, and I'm a sucker for anything with truffles.   For main courses, we had the short rib & bone marrow pasta - FABULOUS.  The little raviolis look unsuspecting but once you bite in, you get a burst of soft and flavorful meat.  We also got the halibut and foie gras ravioli.  Both of those were also excellent.
