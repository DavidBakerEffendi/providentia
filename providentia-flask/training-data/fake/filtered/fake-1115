Jones really hits the mark for me, both as a concept and a place to hang out.  This is the idea I wish I had first!  A casual eatery, almost an upscale diner, that specializes in good old American favorites.  The food we grew up loving.  A menu that succeeds both in form and function. Design-your-own salads to order. Appetizers ranging from tuna tacos, hummus and pita, or cheese pierogies.  A surprisingly satisfying array of comfort food favorites, like tomato soup with grilled cheese, a reuben, a tuna melt, chicken parmesan with spaghetti (which was absolutely delicious and huge and satisfying), jumbo shrimp gumbo, and even fried chicken and waffles.  Fear not, health-nuts: fun healthier choices abound, like vegetarian shepherd's pie (a really good idea, no?), turkey burgers, ALT (avocado, lettuce & tomato) etc., etc.  Brunch features things like potato pancakes with sour cream and apple sauce, big fluffy french toast, huevos rancheros, you name it.  Basic American classics -- really well done, and simply presented.
