The atmosphere was great and the food was very delicious have been to Buddakan 2 times so far and I plan on going back! The decor is awesome! The food is super fresh and the service is great. They are very personable and will help you make a decision if you don't know what to order... It's great to go for a romantic evening or with a group! The food is for sharing which is great. The desserts are awesome too! Cocktail of choice - Sangria! Steven Starr restaurants are always awesome - can never go wrong!
