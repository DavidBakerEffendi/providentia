Ok. I really wanted to know what went wrong because of all the 5 star reviews for this place. My friends and I decided to go there for coffee before school to try something different since we've always passed by the place and never really went it. My God, I regret everything. The owners were extremely rude and inappropriate. One actually had the nerve to tell us this "was not Starbucks, ladies." when we simply asked a question about the coffee. While we continued to order, their snarky and sarcastic attitudes pretty much ruined my morning. I will never go back to this place. Which is too bad, because the cappuccino was pretty good. These people seriously need an attitude check!
