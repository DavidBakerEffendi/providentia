As a former New Yorker it has taken me almost 5 years to find a legitimate good Chinese Restaurant and Schendu 23 is it. From the friendly staff and ownership to the ambiance to the food. Spicy is good, Spicy with flavor and taste is excellent and that is Chendgu 23. From the excellent Boneless Spare Ribs to the Hot and Sour to the Vocano Chicken made me feel like I was at Kam Bo Rice Shop in Chinatown.
