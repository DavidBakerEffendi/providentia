We braved a snowstorm to go across the Verazano Bridge, I wasn't disappointed! First the service was great...Our waitresses were wonderful and accommodating, we were a group of 12 so it wasn't easy!    We had everything from Appetizers to dessert. T  My favorite was the stuffed eggplant soooooo good.   Totally the bill was not bad...under 550 for the group...with two bottles of wine...but I did think the deserts were a little pricey... So if that was the worst....I don't have to have a desert!  The chef was Christine....next time we go back to try another one!
