My wife and I went in for an early Saturday dinner at 5:30 before a concert. We brought two bottles of wine because they don"t yet have a liquor licence.  The service from start to finish was excellent and the food delicious.  We started with Clams Casino and Stuffed Mushrooms and both were excellent. Our entrees were equally good. My wife ordered a pasta dish with lobster meat, peas, porcini mushrooms, garlic and onion in a light cream sauce that was very good. I had Veal Saltimboca and a side of rosemary potatoes. The veal dish had spinach and prosciuto with munster cheese which was an interesting change from the provolone you might expect on this dish. Between courses we were given complimentary salads with a nice blend of greens and balsamic vinagrette topped with shaved provolone. The only negative I could find was the the bread. Not that it was bad but it didn't match the quality of the food.  we will definitely return!
