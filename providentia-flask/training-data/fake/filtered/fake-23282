I hope we were just there on an off night, but this seemed like the perfect candidate for one of the kitchen make-over shows.  We were there on a Monday night about 6:30 - we were first told it would be a 45 minute wait, then immediately after the hostess said 'oh, I can seat you over here'.  The service was reasonably attentive, wine by the bottle was half price, and the bread with marinara was delicious.  That's where the impressive aspects ended.  One of the specials was margarita pizza with fennel sausage - but the waiter told us they were out of fennel sausage (the comical part is the specials are on a chalk board - apparently no one had an eraser to clear the 'w/ Fennel Sausage').  A number of items on the menu had fennel sausage, so none of them were available as described on the menu.  They were also out of two other dishes (three after we ordered as our table took the last Sunday Gravy).  The Braschetta was made with tomatoes that looked to be slightly cooked - I am not a big braschetta fan, but those at the table that were did not overly enjoy it.  At the table we had Aribiata, Sunday Gravy, and a sword fish special.  All were OK, but just OK per the reviews of the people I was with.  I had the swordfish, which was a good piece of swordfish, but was on top of crutons, tomatos, and cucumbers in a caesar dressing - doesn't sound bad, but the combination did not compliment the fish.   I do hope that we were just there on a bad night - I would probably try other restaurants if I'm back in the area though.
