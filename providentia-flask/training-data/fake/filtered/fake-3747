My gf and I decided to try something new in the Morristown area and came across this restaurant based off all the positive reviews. However, there was not one single positive aspect to our dining experience. Upon entering we found the place to look modern and cool and were seated at a two person table. It then took 10 minutes for our waitress to greet us and take our drink orders. Which then led to another 10 minute wait for our coffees. Luckily, we had enough time to look over the menu enough time in that 20 minute span to order right away (2 eggs & west coast scramble).   Once our order was put in, it then took another 40 minutes to receive our dishes. During that wait, our waitress came to us every 10 minutes or so to say 'our food would come right out'. We also were seated right below an AC vent that was blasting us with cold air on a mild 80 degree day. We asked her to turn that down, which she never did.   And. then our food finally came...My first bite of my eggs in the west coast scramble tasted exactly like some type of fish. I thought it was in my head so I took another bite and it was the exact same, and then asked my gf to try it as well. And she agreed with my taste buds, that something was off.  I immediately ran to the bathroom to rinse my mouth out. And my gf proceeded to tell our waitress about the fishy taste, and even offered her a bite, but she declined (smart girl).  However, she did catch a whiff of the fishy odor. For my troubles I was offered to order a replacement dish, but I decided against it bc I didn't want to have to wait another 40 minutes for eggs! The potatoes were decent, but of course those were luke warm, maybe bc they were ready 30 minutes prior to our eggs. And for our troubles, we received a 25% discount on our meal! Needless to say, I will never go back there.  We should have never strayed away from our usual brunch spot, Carver's...so in conclusion Hapgood's is HapBad
