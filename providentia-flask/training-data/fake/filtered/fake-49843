If I could give it zero stars I would, everything other ppl said was bad about this place I experienced in one night, I won't be coming back. The DJ isn't good at all plays 2seconds of a song then changes it, food is good but takes FOREVER to get that your not even hungry anymore/forgot what you ordered. Then they tried to charge me for a beer that I never got cause they ran out of it
