I have food allergies and specified what sauce to use on my food and the cook did not listen to my request. As a result, I complained and the lady that works there offered to refund my money and then told me to never order from them again. So rude and uncalled for. Plus, I saw a mouse ran from behind the counter when waiting for my order. So gross and unsanitary.
