This restaurant has amazing food, amazing place.. I came and met up with my friends while I was waiting for my other friends to come.. We ordered 3 appetizers & ordered caiprinhaa.. I love this place! i have been there 3 times.. Lots of steak and I PROMISE you will be sooooo full. ITS ALL YOU CAN EAT!!!!! Â  This is a great family place, the waitresses are beautiful and polite, the restaurant is clean and all the servers are extremely diligent and always refilling waters and checking on everything.. Overall if your looking for some new food or if your a fan of Brazilian BBQ u stop in there!! They provide parking space!!
