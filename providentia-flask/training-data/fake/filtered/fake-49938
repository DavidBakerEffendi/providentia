After living near this place I finally went there to try their famous "ripper" hot dog. Well, after having cosummed two of these I have to say I really don't know what all the fuss is about. They had an odd after taste. I can only describe it as a chemically taste. While the deep frying cooked the outside of the dog the inside seemed uncooked and flavorless. The relish was good, but the dog overall was a let down. I will stick with the NYC street dog (grilled) as a favorite. True you can never tell if an NYC vendor is going to strike you with a Montazuma's revenge like effect the industrial after taste of the Rutt's Hutt "ripper" my have long term effects that may not be known to me for years. That being said, to each their own. I know this place has an almost religeous following so my tastes will not dissuade their opinions nor should it deter yours. You are going to have to see (or taste) for yourselves. My only advise is to go there planning on being disappointed so your expections have a greater chance of being exceeded.
