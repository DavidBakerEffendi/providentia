We went late night -- around ten -- without a reservation and the place was packed.  Fortunately, just as we arrived, two people were leaving he bar, so we sat down. What an enjoyable evening.  The bartender was a wonderful host and the drinks out of this world -- definitely try the Ginger Margarita! I abhor carrots -- I go to great strides not to let them in anything I have.  But when my friend's roasted carrot and advocado salad came out, I was implored to try it.  It was amazing.  I loved loved loved it! The dinner pizzas, perfect.  Just absolutely perfect! What a great place, and we were shocked at how affordable it was!
