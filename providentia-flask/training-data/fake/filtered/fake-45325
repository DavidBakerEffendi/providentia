Went to West Hartford yesterday and  decided to try Rizzuto's for dinner.  This was our first time to Rizzuto's and we will definitely go back.  We arrived there about 5:45 PM and were able to get a table without having a reservation, but shortly after that the place quickly filled up.  Atmosphere - good, staff - very friendly and accommodating, food including the bread, appetizer, dinner and dessert - excellent!  We were so glad we decided to try this restaurant.  Looking forward to trying it again.
