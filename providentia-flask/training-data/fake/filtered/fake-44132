Unprofessional - Stay away! I just came back from there.  My young boy wanted mozzarella sticks.  The waitress suggested the kids meal and we agreed. Although the sticks were pretty good, there were only 4 of them.  My son finished them and would have liked 2 more.  So I asked the waitress if she could do something.  We would have taken it instad of the ice cream that comes with the kids meal, or paid a dollar or two extra or whatever.  He didn't want 4 more, so I wasn't going to place another order.  Instead of seeing what the customer wants and at least trying to work something out, which would have worked for all of us, she said there was nothing she could do.  I made it clear I wasn't happy and my son reluctantly took the ice cream.  When we paid at the register not only did the cashier not ask me how everything was, she acted liked she was doing me a favor giving me the change.  I've been eating in diners for quite a long time.  Go elsewhere!  There's a lot better out there.
