Due to all of the favorable reviews, my friend and I expected to have an enjoyable meal here recently, but we were shocked to encounter one of our most disappointing restaurant experiences ever. We showed up on time for our reservation and were assured multiple times that our table would be ready soon. We ended up having to wait 45 min for that table. Despite asking repeatedly for a menu to look at while we waited, we were ignored. Finally, after we were seated, my friend's raised hand and request for bread were also ignored several times, even though waiters made eye contact with her. The attitude completely prevented us from enjoying our meal. I don't know if that night was just an anomaly for this restaurant, but we certainly weren't the only ones with a bad impression because the woman at the table next to me was also upset and frustrated.
