Omg!!!! This place was EXCELLENT!! The boyfriend and I are from CA and we stopped by here last night. We ordered the Â General Tao, the bada bing and the truffle fries...all I can say WOW! Everything was delicious. My favorite, the bada bing. It is like a chicken Parmesan. Paul (awesome guy) gave us a sample of the salted caramel pretzel, amazing. My boyfriend fell in love with the general Tao..Soo yummy! if you like chicken, this is a must go to. The guys here are great! We had an awesome experience and the product was to die for! Very friendly, clean and great food! Wish they opened one in CA we would be there everyday!
