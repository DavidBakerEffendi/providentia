I've been a few times. I feel like the chicken cheesesteak is the only thing worth getting, but even then it's hit or miss. The meatball sub I got here was honestly the worst vegetarian sandwich I've ever purchased in my life. Maybe something had gone bad... No one seems happy to be working there. At this point if I was with friends who were going I'd walk down South Street on my own to find something else to eat and meet up with them again later.
