It's a shame that Bella's is so slow because their food is fantastic. I am consistently impressed with the creativity and deliciousness of their dishes, but unfortunately I can't recommend going here except at the oddest hours of the day. I am always frustrated and disappointed at how long it takes even when barely half the tables are occupied. I'm generally very easy going and don't mind waiting for good food, but the last four or five times I've gone I've brought friends or family with me. Based on my rave reviews of the food, they've eagerly ordered anticipating a great meal ahead. Every time I've been left embarrassed to have brought them as their stomachs growl and their patience wanes before our food arrives. Every time they have vowed to never come back. All agree that the food is good, great actually, but waiting over an hour for eggs is just not worth it. Apparently I haven't learned my lesson and after a few months go by I return hoping they've figured out a system to move good quicker, but it seems as though that's an optimistic wish. Please Bella's expand your kitchen. We want your food, but not the wait!
