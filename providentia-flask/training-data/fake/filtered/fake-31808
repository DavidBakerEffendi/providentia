I've been in this bar so often but last night I and my husband arrived on a motorcycle and the guy on the front door just politely said that we couldn't go in because we were riding a motorcycle!!!!!! REALLY? He said that someone got an accident so they do not allow people who ride a motorcycle get in the bar, but I thought: if I park my motorcycle at the other side of the street and just walk to the bar would be okay? That is just ridiculous!!! Anyway, I just said: okay, and turned around.
