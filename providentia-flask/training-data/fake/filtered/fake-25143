I'm not sure what can be said about the first of Jose Garces restaurants that hasn't been said already. So, consider this as an affirmation that the kitchen is still humming at this wonderful tapas restaurant. We like to pop in for a quick glass of wine and a little snack, usually on Friday afternoons. The two rose wines by the glass are incredible - we start with those and if we are feeling really decadent, we have an Albarino. We snack on olives and a few other plates. Recently, we've been getting the mixto of meats - chorizo both white and from Pamplona. But most impressive is the jamon Iberico. One day we really just wanted that and our server obliged. The jamon Iberico literally melted in our mouths. We've had a couple of full meals here and they are always amazing. But sitting at the bar and chilling over good wine and tapas - it doesn't get much better than this!
