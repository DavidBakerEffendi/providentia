Unbelievable, the owner of the restaurant was upset that someone had parked in his lot so as I was about to turn left into the adjoining lot where I had a hair appointment he pulled onto the sidewalk and blocked the driveway. Â When I confronted him he said too bad as someone had parked in his lot and I said that has nothing to do with me our the hair saloon but he refused to move. What an ass I would never go to anyone of his restaurants again!
