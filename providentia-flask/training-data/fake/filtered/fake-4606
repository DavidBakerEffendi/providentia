Its my first experience since i ve been in New York...I dont know how people here think that places like that serve good food...Really!Well the food wasn so good...First time in my life that i dont eat my all my food...Not very tasty flavors at least those we ordered...We were sitting at the bar and the barman there was awfull...we came 5 times to ask us for the order...he left on the bar where we were eating the cloth he was using to clean the place under the bar...The other barman although was very helpful and he explained us that it was his first day on his job but i dont think that for so "fancy" place those things can be allowed.Because of this guy there was a mistake with one of our orders so the manager treat us the next order and the bottle of the wine...Once again the tables for twos were so close that you could not be confortable at all...They want to earn so much money i feel that they dont care about the costumers...Who knows??Maybe was just a bad day...
