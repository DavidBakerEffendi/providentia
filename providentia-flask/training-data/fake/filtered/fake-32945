Can I give this place a zero... I'm sitting here now, Â I got in at 8 and It 9 o'clock and still no food... The waitress is bubble friendly and nice bit I don't care to make conversation with her when I came to eat . .... The drinks are bad the rum punch taste like tropical a fruit punch and the long island ice tea taste as if it's been pre mixed it's ridiculous the environment is chill nice decor nothing heavy on the eyes wish I could judge the foor but I'm still waiting
