Finally I have a minute to review one of my absolutely favorite spots in Bay Ridge.  Every time me and my boyfriend visiting Campania, we have such a pleasing time. Efficient service, delicious food, cozy atmosphere, and last but not least, is the music. LOVE IT! They play soul music and oldies...Al Green, Frank Sinatra.. not too loud, not too quiet, very tasteful like the place itself:-) And just a few words about  Jimmy- Professionalism, Charisma, Smile:-) With Love, Ammon and Liliya.
