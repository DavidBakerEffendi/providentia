ok..so when you first walk in you my think,because of what you see,thats its just a good pizzeria (there gourmet pizza IS delicious),but the resteraunt is what its all about! If your familair with the place and its owner (the 'singing chef') and all the wonderfull guest,movie stars and singing celebrities than you know what your in for.The web site gives a good idea but the pics and testemonials still can't convey the excellent,and pleasant,atmosphere of the resteraunt.They have 2 seatings-6 0'clock and 9.Which (if 6) gives you 3 great hours to enjoy the food and entertainment.Theres a lovely pianist playing from the moment you walk in.I was there with my family for my mothers birthday.And after only a few moments our very accomadating waiter was suddenly belting out a great opera song! You soon realise that the ENTIRE waiting staff sings! Which makes the wait for your food fly by.Speaking of food.Its excellent! Well seasoned (which i love.i can't stand bland food).The food portions were huge.I sampled each of my fams entree and they were all delicious.The food is extremely well priced (with entrees averaging at around $19).And its a BYOB which (in true south philly italian resteraunt style), is a big plus.The food,music,and ambience during your dine adds to an atmosphere that makes you feel like you are dining in aroom with family,although you dont know anyone.During desert our waiter lead a beautiful rendtion of happy birthday,which the ENTIRE resteraunt ,who after hearing a nite of great singing,was more than ready joyously sing aloud with us.An absolutely great EXPERIENCE.I highly reccomend Francoluigis on your next visit to South Philadelphia.
