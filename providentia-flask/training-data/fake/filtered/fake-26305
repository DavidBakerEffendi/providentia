This is a new york deli in a strip mall. Limited seating, take out, great stuff, great people! You should be here for the food, not the location Bread driven in from brooklyn every morning. Real Italian, by Italians, for Italians. The hini"s don't like it, they like the russians. What can I say? Worth the drive down 27. I know they took good care of me and my family while they were trying to close on a sunday afternoon. Real people serving real good food, a rarity today.
