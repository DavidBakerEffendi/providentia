I was visiting my friend at Yale this pass weekend.  I was in the mood for some New Haven style pizza and my friend recommended that we go to New Haven Pizza.  I was favorably impressed.  Their pizza is great!  I must say not only was the staff very friendly and attentive, you could tell that they knew I would really enjoy the pizza...and the pizza does not disappoint.  Fresh ingredients, friendly staff, and great pizza, what else could you ask for!  The next time I'm in New Haven I will definitely make New Haven Pizza one of my stops.
