Honestly, I would give them zero stars if I could. It was late in the evening Saturday night and I saw a Groupon deal that gave 50% off on $20 orders. I ordered the Lobster Bisque Soup, a Tuscan Salad, and a custom square pizza with vodka sauce, cheese, and pepperoni. My order was $36, but the deal brought that to $16 (weird math, but whatever, I'm not complaining on that). Everything was nice when ordering. However, when the pizza showed up (over an hour later), the crap storm began. I was completely unaware that the vodka sauce had mushrooms and green peas in it. Ordinarily I wouldn't have minded that my pizza was slightly off, but I am allergic to mushrooms so I obviously couldn't eat it. I brought the delivery man back to tell him and while he was nice, the cook who he had to call up wasn't. I was treated very rudely as if somehow I was supposed to know the vodka sauce contained mushrooms (because that's standard everywhere, right?). He told me over and over again "What am I supposed to do? I didn't get the order wrong. This is your fault... blah blah." Any respectable restaurant would have made me a new order with little or no fret, but he flat out refused. So I eventually told him to keep his pizza and I would just dispute the charge. That's when he really went off and started yelling, but I have no idea what he said because the phone was already away from my ear as I was hanging up (but I could still hear his yelling). So they just went from losing out on what would have been $10-$15 for a new pizza to the whole $36 dollar order and another lost customer. Very smart business. Hope the cook has a fun time explaining that logic to his manager.
