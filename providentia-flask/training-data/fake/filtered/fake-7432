Good belgian meatballs. To be honest, couldn't tell the difference between normal and belgian meatballs. But hey, they were good! Wine came in a cute small bottle, then you pour it into your own wine glass - got 2 glasses worth of wine for a cheap price of $7.50! Service and staff were lovely. Delightful little place! Oh! And the bathrooms were absolutely cool! Music playing, cool decor, cool bathroom!
