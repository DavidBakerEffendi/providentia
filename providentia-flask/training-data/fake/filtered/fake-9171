I had dinner at Alice's Arbor a few nights ago and absolutely loved it! The atmosphere Â in the restaurant was cosy and laid-back. Everything in it seems to be made from recycled materials, with old industrial tables and a lot of weathered wood. Really beautiful! The food was excellent: we had a delicious salad made with different types of green beans and superb roasted asparagus with goat cheese to start. As a main dish we had the steak frites and the trout, which were both good. The cheese cake for dessert was one of the best I've ever had. Creamy and light at the same time, and not too sweet. While the waitstaff was indeed a tad slow, they were super friendly and knowledgable, and we actually didn't mind eating at a leisurely pace for once. And if you just need some provisions for a picnic, there's also an old-fashioned type of store area where you can buy local produce and take-out food.
