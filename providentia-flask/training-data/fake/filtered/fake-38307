Great place to eat and service was excellent. Bartender and Waitress were very busy and Bartender Donny jumped in to take our order and when I asked him for advice on what to eat, he told me about the Blackened Chicken Po-Boy and that was one of the best sandwiched I ever had. My wife got the Shrimp Po-Boy and when I tasted that sandwich I could not wait until my next visit. Our second visit  was with my family and everyone loved it. I got the Shrimp Po-Boy and had to take off 4 huge shrimp  to be able to put my mouth around the sandwich. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!
