This is my first review, as I felt the need to comment on how unpleasant my experiences have been at Euro Grill. I rated this restaurant 1 star...only because I couldn't give it ZERO stars.  This is also not my first time eating here. They do have some tasty dishes but I have only had the opportunity to taste a few, so I cannot comment on the others. However, my last visit, the meat was extremely chewy and not tasty, and the rice was hard, almost like they served me day-old rice. My main issue was with the employees/management.  The service was extremely slow and the staff was not pleasant. I have talked to the manager in the past, and it doesn't even seem like he cares about this restaurant; like he only has this open because he has to. There is no management structure and when something goes wrong, no one takes responsibility. I will never, ever step foot inside this restaurant again.  If you choose to, good luck!
