Loved this restaurant and locale.  The food was great and the noise level was low which is always a plus for me when I am with friends.  The salad was large and dressed lightly with oil and balsamic.  The pasta was fresh and not overly sauced which is the proper way to eat pasta.  Finally a very nice wine selection to choose from.  Great all around.
