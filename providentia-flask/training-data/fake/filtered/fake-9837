I think this is one of the best restaurants in NYC right now.  I would highly recommend the following: -Chili Lobster, Texas Toast -Black Pepper Cavatelli, Wild Boar Ragout, Apple & Chestnut -Bell & Evans Chicken Under a Brick, Yukon Potatoes, Broccoli Rabe, Pan Drippings if they have the the shishito peppers- Get Them! They  are phenomenal!
