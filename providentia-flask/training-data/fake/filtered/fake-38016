This place is great. Super cool, hipster atmosphere- and great hearty, filling food!! Ive been here a couple times with friends at night and also done the weekend brunch. Expect a wait to be seated, but once you are-- no complaints. Wish the drink prices were cheaper (around $10 a cocktail) i guess thats the upper west side for ya! How about a seasonal menu Jacob?? been coming for over a year and its the same ole' stuff! Also, request BO as a server! He's the nicest server there (and not bad looking either ;) )He's been with the place since the beginning, so he knows the food and drinks well.
