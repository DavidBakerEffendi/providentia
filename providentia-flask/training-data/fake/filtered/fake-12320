This place is a wonderful addition to the neighborhood.  Allow me to count the ways:  The food is superb, unique to our area, and always fresh.  The french press coffee is reasonably priced (especially for the large) and is cooked to perfection. The owner and wait staff are outgoing and understand every item on the menu in detail (preparation, taste, etc), so it would follow that their service is also excellent. Finally, the music selection and atmosphere is welcoming, comfortable, and has natural sunlight throughout the cafe.  Oh, and free wifi.
