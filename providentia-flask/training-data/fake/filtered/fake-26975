The food quality was good but the food presentation was subpar for these prices.  $40 steaks served on plain white plates without a single piece of garnish seemed a little bare; you really need to order 2 seperate sides per steak.  This in itself is fine but the wait staff should have made clear to us when we ordered.  Appetizers are too small to share (3 small pieces of cheese for $14) but very good -- and the deserts were great.  I expected to pay a lot of dinner -- but was somewhat disappointed about the experience compared to other steak houses such as Morton's and Smith & Wollensky.  Great concept -- but company needs to focus more on the overall dining experience relative to the cost.
