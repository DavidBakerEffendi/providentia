Went to PYT for the first time last night. Wasn't sure how it would turn out considering they are so new and we had a huge group (once they all arrived, we were close to 20) and we couldn't call ahead because the restaurant doesn't have a website up yet. But these guys bent over backwards for us, even though it meant clearing tables out of their dining room, taking care of a rolling cast of characters. Some came for just a drink, some came for a whole meal, but all were welcome. Our waitress dealt with all this craziness with grace, humor and a smile. She even hi-fived me at the end. Our food and our adult milkshakes were delicious and surprisingly not lacking on the booze. I personally got the Royale with Cheese, an excellent double bacon cheeseburger, with a warm and tart cheddar cheese and a creamy "special sauce." The P.Y.T. folks really know how to cook a burger. When I said medium rare, I meant it. And that's just what I got. My Jack Rabbit Slim was lousy with Makers Mark and chocolatey goodness. This is a cocktail that really has a kick, despite being covered in whipped cream. And both dishes allowed me the opportunity to quote from my favorite movie (as if I needed an excuse). Thank you P.Y.T. We will definitely be back!
