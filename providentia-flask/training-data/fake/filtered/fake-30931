Years ago this was a 5-star restaurant.  My GF and I went on a Friday night, as we have done MULTIPLE times, yet to our dismay we were not seated.  Keep in mind there were several seats available.  We, along with another couple were told that they couldn't seat 2, as they were saving the available seats for the "possibility" that 4 patrons could come in and want to eat.  So, instead of splitting one of the available tables so both parties of 2 could eat, they told us we couldn't be seated. We asked for a manager and usually this can turn in your favor.  In this instance though, it only got worse.  We mentioned we had been going here for years and at times a few times per month...yet he didn't seem to care.  He was quite rude to us, which we then congratulated him on losing customers and that we wouldn't be coming back or mention it to friends any longer. It's amazing how quickly a place can go from being quite good to being out of the dinner rotation due to VERY POOR service. If you're going out on a date with your significant other, I'd recommend you go elsewhere as you won't be seated unless you have two more friends to go with you. Such a shame!!!!
