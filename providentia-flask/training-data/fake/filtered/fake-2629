Coffee=5 Service=5 Decor=5 Great little hidden gem in a busy commercial area. Excellent Cappuccinos very smooth... And yes I may be a sucker for the artwork in the froth but it's also an indicator of attention to detail. Once you've had a Cappuccino like this it gives you a greater appreciation and point of reference when compared to the mass-produced, production line, factory - coffee places. French press nicely done. The staff is very friendly and even if you've only been there your second time they make you feel as if you're a long time regular. They make it a point to remember you and your drink preference. Although seating is limited, the rustic decor is inviting and well done. The only thing that could make the coffee better would be an organic option.
