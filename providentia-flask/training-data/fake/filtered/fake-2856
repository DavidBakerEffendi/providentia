Was a fan and frequent patron. NO MORE!  There were not that many Cuban eateries in the area, so we used to go and it was good, but the quality had been declining.  But this past weekend was the last straw.  If you never get to the food, who cares?. Fed up with the RUDEST HOSTESSES ever! Who needs multiple lazy self-centered useless mannequins who do their 'job' like a bunch of mindless pigeons? Our small group was forced to wait forever while a steady stream of people pushed past us and were seated ahead of us; even though we had reservations and there were many tables available. Horrible. What a waste of time. Forget this place. Go to other restaurants that do a better job and actually value you and your business.  Cuban Pete, you failed me for the last time.  Hopefully, I can save others from wasting their valuable time too. Send your hostesses back to Robert Palmer for a refund.  They are "Simply Disrespectable".
