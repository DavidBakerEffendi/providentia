I really hate to do reviews like this but this A horrible place! 1) They gave me 5 shrimp egg rolls instead of spring rolls. I am allergic to shellfish! 2) The General Tso Chicken was so funny tasting and slimy I wouldn't let my children eat it. 3) My chicken fried rice meat was really undercooked .. A waste of $30.. NEVER WILL EAT THERE AGAIN!
