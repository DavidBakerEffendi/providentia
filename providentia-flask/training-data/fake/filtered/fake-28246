I went there a couple of weeks ago with my wife, on a weeknight.  We went for a casual dinner because we have lunched there in the past.  I ordered the eggplant parm, and my wife ordered a chicken dish..  The eggplant parm consisitd of a couple of small pieces of eggplant floating in a tomato suace, covered with cheese.  My wife got two small legs over something green.  Both dishes did not taste good.  It was the worst eggplant parm I have ever had.  There was not one good thing I could say about the dinner.  The serving size was inadequate.  Be forwarned
