This is a no nonsense authentic eatery, with simple and yet very friendly service.  I m from the mediterranean area and intimately familiar with this food.  The food quality is 5 stars, hands down. Fresh (items are prepared daily and if u r not early enough they disappear from the menu fast, I wanted the stuffed peppers...gone), and prepared right there. I ordered the cold appetizer assortments. Each 1 was perfect {except the Hummus but if u r not from Israel u would not know it (as the Hummus there in Israel is much better). As another one mentioned, the babaganoush is out of this world. The entries u may choose 2 halves of diff. dishes and I had the 1/2 Gyro/doner and half lam kifte kabab. And the lam chops. Very large portions, deliciously made. Enjoy.
