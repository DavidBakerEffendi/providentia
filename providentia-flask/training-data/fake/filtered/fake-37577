Hands-down, Four Corners serves some of the best sandwiches. Yes, it takes a couple extra minutes to get your food and yes, it costs an extra couple of bucks, but the bottom line is you're getting fresh, homemade food.   The Czech Chicken salad is the best (though they're all good).   Ask Latso what goes into making this sandwich from scratch and you'll realize.   If you appreciate good food, be patient, grab a soda, look at the decor or read on the couch and pay the extra $2 for a good dining experience.
