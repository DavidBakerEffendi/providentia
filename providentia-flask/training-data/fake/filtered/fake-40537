Was excited to check this place out because I love the chefs tv personality and the decor of the restaurant, but it left a bad taste in our mouths from the second we walked in because of the rudeness of the host. Talk about attitude! And the whole time we were there she played with her hair and literally had it in her mouth...unfortunately she sat me so she was in my direct line of sight..not the most appetizing sight. Salads were pretty good, but the rest of what we ordered was disappointing and really expensive for what we received. 125 dollars for 2 people....2 drinks 2 apps and 2 entrees and not worth it! Have a drink at the bar but skip dinner!
