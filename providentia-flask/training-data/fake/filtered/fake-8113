I was unfortunately extremely disappointed with the service at Bove's.  I was traveling to Burlington with a group of 11 people and we wanted to have a nice pasta dinner together.  Upon seeing the positive reviews listed here, I called and spoke with one of the owners, Mark, who assured me that although they do not usually take reservations, because we had a large party he was willing to do so.  A couple of days later he called and said that our reservation had been double-booked with another large party, but we were willing to compromise, and upon speaking with a second employee, I was assured that we had a reservation for a later time. When we arrived 15 minutes early for our reservation, I was happy that we had made one, since there was a line out the door to be seated.  I went in and spoke with an employee who told me they don't make reservations; and was directed to Mark when I explained that he had said they made an exception for not one, but two parties that night (the one with which we had been double-booked).  Mark came out and denied the whole situation, saying he never made a reservation for us and didn't know why I would think that he did, at which time he refused to speak to me anymore and retreated into the kitchen.  Needless to say, we did stay for dinner.  Disorganized, dishonest establishment. Go to Papa Frank's instead if you're looking for good service and great food!
