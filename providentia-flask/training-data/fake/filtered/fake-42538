The worst! Went there for our 30th anniversary before leaving on vacation for the week. Had reservations for 8:30 and we were seated on time and ordered appetizers, wine and dinner at the same time. Got the wine and appetizers in a noral amount of time, but dinner never came. Repeatedly asked our waiter where dinner was, but no good answer. They flipped several tables that had dessert twice before we finally got our main course. And my husband ordered the $38 veal trio that turned out to be a tappas plate!!!! What a joke! They offered us free dessert and wine to make up for the late joke of a dinner and we told them we just wanted to get out of the place. It was after 11:00 by this point. Do not waste your time or money on this place! Overrated and overpriced with extremely poor service and mediocre food. I had to give them 1 star to rate the place, but if I could, I would give them -5 stars!!!!
