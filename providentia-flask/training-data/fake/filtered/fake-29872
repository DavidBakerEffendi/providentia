I've been here multiple times. I really enjoy their curry and Â they are pretty good about getting the level of spiciness spot-on. (for a while it was WAY too spicy even when ordering mild, but it's toned down now) The whole fish with the tamarind sauce is yummy too. Service here is questionable. Sometimes the service is very poor. One night all of my dinnermates received their entrees, but I didn't. I waited for a good 30 minutes, out of disbelief and curiosity of how long would it take for the waiter to notice. I believe a huge part of the poor service is a result of the theater across the street and the extreme influx in diners. I still keep coming back though. Recently the service reached the opposite extreme, I swear our waiter would have sat down at the table with us! He kept lingering nearby, and would occasionally jump into our conversations. Despite the service, the owner is extremely nice! I do love the food and will keep coming back!
