We went  last weekend for dessert. This is the kind of place that you go for the fun of it and realize that your going to pay a little more than if you got the same dessert at a restaurant.   Its an experience to be there.  The smells, the energy, the idea of chocolate on chocolate - it makes it fun. THe 5 of us enjoyed it.  Our server was very good - help one member of our party select an off menu item.   I would suggest that they need to make the waffles at time of ordering vs pre-maid.  The waffles (included in a dessert) were room temperature - I think they should be warm. The bowls, cups, glasses that the food is served in is very creative.
