I love this place. I always compare other sushi places to this one and none of them come close. This place has fresh and delicious seafood. The staff is very very friendly we have been going to this place for about 6 years now. This is one of our favorite spots. Â We usually order Johns Roll, Mountain Roll, Tropicana and alaskan.
