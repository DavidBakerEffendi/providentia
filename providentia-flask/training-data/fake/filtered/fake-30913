6/28/12 My wife and I had lunch at Jimmie's today. It not good when the view is the only thing worth the price and is better than the food or the service. The french fries were oily, the fried whole belly clams were good. The clam chowder should be called thyme chowder, I could see pieces of clam but could not taste them. The stuffed clam and stuffed scallops tasted the same, with the paprika being the only flavor I could pick out, the only way to diferenciate was visualy you could see the pieces of scallops & clams. The tarter sauce was different, not good, different.We waited too long to have our order taken and again too long to receive it, and too long for the check. Some regulars came in (could tell by the conversations) after us had the same wait person and were eating long before we were. It would have been better to have left during the first wait period. jc
