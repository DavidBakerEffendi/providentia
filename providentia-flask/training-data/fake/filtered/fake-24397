SHAME!!!!! We went to Burlington VT for the week-end and it was our first time in this charming city. We are from Montréal QC. We wanted to eat at Splash at the Boathouse not for the food which was not really attractive nor the price which really were too high for the standards, but for the wonderful sunset view. The waitress was busy with another Québécois couple. They gave their name which she added on the waiting list and they asked if the Restaurant was taking reservations. She said they didn't. Then is was our turn and she first checked if we had cash. Can you seriously imagine that a restaurant of this size doesn't have a credit/debit card terminal? WOW, helloooooo, we are in 2012!! Well, we gave our name too and with the other couple we stayed near the counter and started to wait our turn. Some locals arrived five minutes later and guess what they were given preference upon us!! I asked again to the waitress if they accepted reservations and she confirmed they didn't. Then she tried to explain me that it's possible to phone and add your name on the list. Well you can call this a reservation or not, but the fact is that you will not receive the same treatment here if you are a local or a tourist. Of course I asked her to delete my name as I would choose another place to spend my evening and my money! Add this to Nicole's comment and I hope no other tourists will visit them again.
