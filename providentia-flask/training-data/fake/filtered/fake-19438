When Jimmy G's had a "grand opening" as Jimmy Goes, my husband and I ate here and the food was sub par. I got a bland egg sandwich and my husband got a burnt hot dog. We chalked it up to an inexperienced business owner but still rooted for the establishment as it is a local business. However, that all changed today. We frequent the fabulous dry cleaners next door to Jimmy G's. As I was getting out of my car with my 3 month old son, the "owner?" storms out of the Â store (after turning on the "Open" sign) and yells to me, "Hey dear. Are you going into the cleaners?" I was a little perplexed as I don't like the idea of a dirty, old man asking me where I'm going (much less calling me dear) but I responded yes. He then yells, "I save this parking spot for my customers." I was so confused that I didn't respond and kept going into the cleaners. Back at my car, I looked to see if I missed a sign that stated that parking spot was for his customers only. Shocker: There wasn't. I'm not sure what his problem is. Maybe he doesn't respect women. Maybe he doesn't like babies? Whatever the case may be, I don't think it's appropriate to yell at ANYONE because you are frustrated with your fledgling "business". Shame on you.
