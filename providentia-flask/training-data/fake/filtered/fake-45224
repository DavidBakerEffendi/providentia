I would like to say that the food here was good.  However, my wife and I (we are gay) were there enjoying a much needed date night out, we love Ethiopian food and this is the closest one to us.  We were just finishing our dinner when the waiter asked us if we were a couple . When we acknowledged we were, he proceeded to tell us that he had been cured of being gay, then handed us a pink religious pamphlet that can only be summed up as saying we were going to hell.  We were both SHOCKED and completely appalled and it ruined our night out.    If his desire was to have us never return, he succeeded!!!
