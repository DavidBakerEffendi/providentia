I am so happy I stumbled across this gem a few weeks ago. I have been frequenting this spot almost every week since! I've only been to the one on East 7th street but I am sure the one in Williamsburg is just as good. I love desnuda for its charm. It is Â small and quaint with 2 chefs and maybe 15 bar seats. The chefs are fantastic, they know just what to suggest and you can tell they have a real love for the food. Now I do not know the name of the red wine that I always drink but if you say it's the spicy red they will know and you will not be disappointed. Here are my dinner staples...truffle popcorn makes for a nice start. 1) King salmon--Fish sauce makes it out of this world! 2) Lobster ceviche--so coconuty and fresh and light 3) Tuna Foie gras--So so so delicious, and smells great too, the balsamic glaze makes it just right. 4) Tuna w/ potato crisps! 5) Hamachi collar, if you are lucky enough to order this because they only get 1 per night! It is smothered in yuzu, olive oil, some spices and is cooked to perfection right in front of you. 6) The claim dish with chorizo...YUM Now I just listed the entire menu but you get the idea, it is all amazing.
