I rode my bike over here on a rainy day to meet a friend for brunch, and I sure am glad I did. This is good food. The right amount, well made, satisfying. I opted for the Turkish Breakfast and cleaned my plate more quickly than I normally do. I also went for the pomegranate mimosa which was also pretty tasty. All in all, an excellent brunch experience and reasonably priced. I shall be back.
