Unfortunately, you're wrong!  Considering the fact that I don't drink, you couldn't be any more wrong. Second, I walked in because he did not use the bathroom. Third, I would be happy to have your illegal employees vouch for the turnover and horrible management. Shall I continue?  Or should I just have the department of health contacted?  I'll be glad to reach out to the mayor's personal office to make sure this is looked into.   Thanks Jennifer PS..How can it be that they have been with you for 10 yrs if this place was for sale just about 7 years ago when I was approached as well to buy this run down hole?
