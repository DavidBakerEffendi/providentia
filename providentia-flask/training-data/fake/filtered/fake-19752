Six of us had pre concert dinner last saturday night. We were seated around 6:15. A wiatress finally showed up about 15 minutes later. They had prix fixe so it was a very limited menu. Still, it took nearly 45 minutes for the order to come out of the kitchen. By this time it was 7:15 and our concert was at 8. We ate quickly, but the dessert didn't come until 7:45 and our coffee came at 7:55. We paid the bill and rushed out - barely finishing our dessert & Coffee. This is an expensive restaurant and they knew that all of the diners (on a Saturday night) were there to attend the concert. We went into the concert hall just as they were closing the doors. This is the second time we have had this experience - we'll never go again.
