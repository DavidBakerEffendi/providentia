Had walked by this place for months without thinking of going in, until a foodie friend suggested we meet there for lunch.   I had one of the chicken wraps, she stuck with her go-to falafel and hummus wraps and spicy lentil soup.  Delicious.  We were about 3/4 of the way finished before we realized we should take a breath and try eachothers food before it was gone.   Really pleasant waitstaff, and good service.
