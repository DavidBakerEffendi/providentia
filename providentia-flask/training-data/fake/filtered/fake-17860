Can't go wrong with the Dunganese Steam Pot with Old Bay and a mason jar of sangria, but hey I am a fan of crabs and there are few places in central Jersey to find dunganese crabs, especially off season.  Never had any other dishes here, just the crabs.  If your not going to get the crabs...well....why go to a "Crab Shack"?
