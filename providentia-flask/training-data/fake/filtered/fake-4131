I was a little overwhelmed with the list of beers at this place, it's like dining in a five star restaurant and deciding which wine to order.   I was about to get a bottle of Hoegaarden when I discovered - and couldn't believe my eyes - that they had Weihenstephaner Hefe Weiss.  I think this is the first time I've ever seen it on a menu! With that beer in hand, I had to order something that fit, so I ordered their Bierstube Burger with munster cheese and caramelized onions.  I thought I had died and gone to heaven. What's special about this burger?  It's not like any other I've had.  The bun itself was unique and made it what it was, aside from the short rib and beef combo to make the beef original and extremely rich and juicy.  I had to be careful not to get it all over my self. All in all, this is a great place to hang out, have drinks, enjoy your friends and down a few good, no excellent, no sensational beers and superb food, that is better than you would think it could be.   I've been to Irish pubs, but nothing like this place before.  It was outstanding and we will definitely be back for more of the Weihenstephaner Hefe Weiss and try some more of their awesome food.
