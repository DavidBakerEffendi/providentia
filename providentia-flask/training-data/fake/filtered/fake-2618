I was taken here on a first date, and while that didn't last my love affair for UVA continues. This restaurant is simply amazing! The garden patio in the back is a wonderful choice for a date or to catch up with family and friends. My favorite dish here is the Ricotta Gnocchi. I love it so much, I slaved away in my kitchen and discovered how to MAKE the creamy truffle and chive sauce! I will share the recipe with anyone who wants it. It is too good to be kept secret!
