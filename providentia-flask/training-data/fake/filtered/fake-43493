Been here a few times not really my cup of tea. The atmosphere does nothing for me typical bar setting with LCD tv's. Ordered the so called ny strip steak very tough not tender at all.Potatoes were bland at least for my taste.The asparagus that comes with the meal were burnt. Then again it's a bar I give city streets 2 stars.
