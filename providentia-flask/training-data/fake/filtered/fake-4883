Went there on a rainy Wednesday after work on a business trip.  No drinks that day before arriving. Sat down and ordered a beer.  Immediately after a woman who the bald bartender was interested in sat next to me.   After pouring a beer half way he decided that he did not like me sitting next to her and told me he was making a judgement call and would not serve me.  I am calm, pretty quiet and not an obnoxious person.   Make your own judgement call and go somewhere else. Rotten Ralph down the street has some crazy looking red haired tattooed workers, but they are all super friendly and provide great service. Do yourself a favor.
