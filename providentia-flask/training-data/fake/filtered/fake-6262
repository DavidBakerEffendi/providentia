I have been to Race Street Cafe many times.  The selection at the bar is amazing especially for beers.  I've always had great service there so I'm not quite sure why everyone is complaining about this. The food is always delicious and interesting!  Love love love the different menu selections.  I really can't say enough good things about this place. If your in the area, make sure you stop by and see what its all about.  It will not disappoint!
