Well, what can I say? The stuffed waffles with egg, mushrooms, onions and peppers with basil aioili was great but the service wasn't. My brother and I were eating when we were asked to get up and vacate our table so it could be given to a bigger group. My brother couldn't believe the server had done that. It absolutely ruined my meal. I was disappointed. I wanted to go back again that same week but couldn't do it. UPDATE: I called the manager a few days later about the service and she was very apologetic. She stated that her restaurant didn't do that to customers and it wouldn't happen again. I felt good enough about the conversation to know I'd eat there again.
