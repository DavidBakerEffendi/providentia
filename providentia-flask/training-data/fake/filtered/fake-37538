We attended a party at Diamonds and I was blown away over the service and the food.  Right from the beginning it was wonderful between all the appetizers and how quickly the servers made it around to everyone (even though the place was packed).  None of us waited more then 5 minutes from the time we placed a drink order to when it arrived and they were always checking on us to see if we needed anything else.  After appetizers they opened the stations of food and everything was delicious and as soon as a tray was empty they were right there replacing it with a new tray of hot food.  Everyone that attended the event kept commenting on what a wonderful job the restaurant had done.  Thanks Diamonds.  We'll definitely be back to have dinner!
