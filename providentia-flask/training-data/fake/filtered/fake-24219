I enjoy all of my visits to Vonda's Kitchen.  Love the decor.  The atmosphere is always warm and welcoming the staff is courteous and attentive.  The food is delicious.  Two of my favorites are the fried fish breakfast with grits and eggs and  the crispy chicken salad with honey mustard dressing and don't forget about  the dessert red velvet cheese cake to-die-for.  Opps! Almost forget the ginger lemonade with as little or as much ginger pieces as you can handle.  So if you're looking for Soul Food or just good food you will Love It!  - Adrianne -
