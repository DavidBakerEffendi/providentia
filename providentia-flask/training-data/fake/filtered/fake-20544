I recently ate at the newly installed Chef's Counter at Zahav.  I am still trying to relive what may have been the best meal of my life.  It was fantastic to experience a much broader range from Michael Solomonov.  All of the courses included Mediterranean flavors but I got to experience, shrimp, chicken gallentine, pasta and venison.  A play on his traditional hummus included brown butter and chanterelle mushrooms. And the use of seasonal ingredients such as corn was fantastic.  The meal is eleven courses for $90 which I think is a steal.  I highly recommend the wine/cocktail pairings that Brian has concocted as they really complement the meal.
