Shame on the jerks at this over-priced wanna-be banh mi shop. Why? Because they'd prefer to kill me or not feed me and my family after we took two trains to try to their sandwiches. You see, I'm super allergic to eggs.  I ordered 3 sandwiches, one with "no mayo, please". Douche: "Sorry, we don't do that." Me: "They're made after I order them?" Douche: "Yes, but we don't make changes. Owner's rules." Me: "I'm deathly allergic to eggs. Can't touch it. Can't wipe your precious house-made chili aioli off. I'll still get very sick." Douche: "Sorry." Me: "I see the mayo-less rolls right there behind you. Can you just forget to put mayo on one?" Nice stranger: "Can't you make him something without mayo?" Douche: "No." ("f--- you!") Me, leaving with two hungry kids: "You and your owner are idiots." ("f--- you!") We went to Baoguette on Lex at 25th instead, great banh mi, your choice of with or without mayo, with or without chilis...no attitude.  Go there instead of giving your money to these jerks.
