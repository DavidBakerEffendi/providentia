HI I just went to Shannon Rose after many people told me about this fantastic space, great night crowd, good selection of beers, one-of-a-kind modern, yet very Irish atmosphere- an Irish Cheesecake? The staff was super friendly and accommodating- the food is inconsistent but the bartenders make a mean drink. Great selection of beers too, great local place to go!
