This is the worst diner I have experienced.  This morning, I sat down and my spoon was filthy.  My fork had dried egg.  I ordered a spinach and cheese omelet, which had a horrible taste.  They use some sort cheese product and frozen spinach. Don't waste your time and money.  For a few extra dollars, drive over to Raymonds or Toast.
