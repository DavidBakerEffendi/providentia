If you want some of the best food you have tasted in years then you must bring yourself to Soco in the heart of Brooklyn on 509 Myrtle Avenue. I had the buttermilk fried chicken, red velvet waffle, creamy cheese grits and the mac & cheese, when I tell you love at first bite I mean it! Please check out my video on my YouTube channel Sista Gurl TV: goo.gl/4pOAQ Also I want to say a special shout out to my server Ruen that made the experience extra wonderful, he is golden! Be back soon!
