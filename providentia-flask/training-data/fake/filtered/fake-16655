I live in the area and have walked by this restaurant many times. I'm so glad I had the opportunity to use a groupon to try it. I was pleasantly surprised with the nice ambiance inside. We tried the eggplant with tomatoe sauce along with baba ganoush for appetizers and they both were great! For our entrees we had Branzino and lamb chops. They were both good, and the lamb was nice and tender. I'm so happy I found this gem so close to me and will come back again to try something different!
