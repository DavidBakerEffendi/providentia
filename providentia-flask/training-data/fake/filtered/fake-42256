Love this place. It was recommended to me by Jonathan, barman at The Whiskey, and that's one recommendation I am grateful for. The space is airy and cool, the wait staff are warm and helpful and the food... man, is this how the average Texan eats? I may have to move there. The dishes are so varied and bursting with flavour, from a perfectly-cooked and deliciously tender blackened trout (whole, yet fully-boned) to asparagus with egg and duck confit... I'm drooling just remembering it. Â Recommended, especially if you fancy something a bit different.
