On a busy day at work my co worker and I decided to stop for a meal. The facility is located on a mall strip and to many this might be a turn off but don't let the location fool you. Entering the establishment you are greeted by friendly staff who is willing to assist. People complain that things changed and the food isn't the same.... Regardless of your opinion in my personal experience the service is great. I had 2 slices of pepperoni pizza and my only complaint is it was a bit greasy which is y I give them 4 stars but aside from that, the speed of which I got my meal was impeccable again kudos to the team at Arlington pizza.
