Food is pretty Damn good. Great salads, fresh grilled burger taste, and great shakes. Only problem is a slight issue understanding English with their deep brazilian accents. Double check your order after you make it . Truffle fries are ridiculous, salad heads choose from calamari salad and cobe salad which have a great gathering of flavors . Have a drink at the bar while you wait for your order .
