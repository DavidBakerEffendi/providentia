Food is excellent, service not so much... this waitress actually starting serving me at a dirty table from previous customer.. i was mortified she didn't clean table before putting items down for me... she claims she has to multitask and serve me and clean the dirty table at same time because she is busy.; NEVER is my life wtf???? she then tells me when i ask for bread she only has two hands, at that point i paid for my drink and left and went to Brancachios instead. With the pretentiousness of this place, and overpriced items for this area, they should provide way better service
