Appalled and disgusted. First of all I ordered Muss Mun (aka Massaman) Curry Chicken extra spicy. When I got my order, my jaw dropped. There was 1/4" deep PURE OIL. To make matters worst, it should have had coconut milk in it. IT Was WATERY with barely, if any coconut milk. This is my fave Thai dish and I have had it a million times at at least 7 other places and it did not look or taste like that!! I told them I want something else, NOT another one and I think my second dish was purposely sabotaged. Pad Thai is my second favorite, and it tasted STEAMED, not STIR FRIED or GRILLED, and it tasted like the "sweet chili" sauce in the bottle was use for flavoring. Disastrous. NEVER AGAIN.
