Lovely decor and attentive wait staff for the most part.  Asked for extra butter, but never received it; had to ask to have the table for 12 cleared.  Extra noisy on the second floor; had to shout to the person 2 feet away from me (maybe drapes on the windows would help absorb the awful noise).  Nothing on the menu sounded tempting.  Ordered the Monkfish which came on a bed of  mushroom puree, which looked like a bed of mud, a few little quartered potatoes with broccoli rabe, and surrounded by homemade POTATO CHIPS!  Ugh!   Had to push just to get a slice of plain cheesecake (which was very good).  Only good part of the meal. They tell you it will be 15-20 minutes before your order comes out, so they push very hard to get you to order appetizers.  I know this is done because it can add another $40-$50 to the bill.  Some of us are wise to this ploy.  Sorry to say I have no desire to go thee again.
