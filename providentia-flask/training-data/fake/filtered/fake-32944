I can't speak for everyone else, but normally when I go to eat in the Main owner is awesome and attentive and friendly. Makes you feel very welcome.  Becuase of moving, It is now easier for me to go to a competitor. but normally not a bad place to eat in when Owner is the one there. I also like that they take credit card, which is something the others in town do not do.   They seem to try to go for a more upscale eat in feel. Normally during eat in you get some noodle strips and a duck sauce blow for dipping until your meal is ready. When the waitress brings the check they bring the check in a nice tray, with a fortune cookie and fresh orange slices. So I understand them being a little more pricey than competitors.
