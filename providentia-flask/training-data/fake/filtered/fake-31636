Amazing organic juice and smoothie bar. I had the Green Caffeine and a maple latte. Kudos to Sarah, she is absolutely the best barista in town. She poured beautiful latte art. Eco Bean has the best coffee I have ever tasted--way better than Uncommon Grounds or any other cafe in town. I came back the next day and had their Banana Walnut smoothie, it was delicious and healthy. I can tell they put in a lot of time to carefully perfect their recipes. They even make their own organic almond milk with special almonds they import from Italy. Everything here is to die for--a truly excellent addition to the good local business on Pine Street. Five stars!
