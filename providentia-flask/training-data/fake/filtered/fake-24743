Went on Saturday night with four of my friends.  We had to wait 15-20 minutes which was not bad of wait since it was the weekends.   This place is really tiny but cozy, would recommend for a date night. FOod: We all tried different types of dish overall the best one was the Tagliatelle allaBolognese, good portion and topped with fresh parmesan cheese was delicious.  We lso had the Lasgna however it was very small portion and seafood pasta (Tagilolini ai frutti di mare) was good. Filet mgnon dish was ok nothing really special.  I believe the price is very decent no complains.   Service: Our waitress had a really strong accent that we all couldnt not understand and gave up on second attempt to listen to the specials they had that evening.   P.S Cash only! Overall, I will return but probably with party of two.
