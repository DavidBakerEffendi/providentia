I can't say enough good things about Brauhaus Schmitz.  If you like any combination of the following three things, you must check this place out: German food, German beer, and soccer.  I was never a fan of German food (admittedly I have never been anywhere near Germany so don't know much about it) but love their pretzels, bratwurst, spaetzel and potato salad.  The Jager pommes are also some of the best bar food ever.  Try the apple strudel for dessert (it's worth the wait!) The selection of German beers is amazing, you'll find several here that are very rare, some that you will not find on tap outside of Germany.  If you're a soccer fan, you can also catch MLS (Philadelphia Union) as well as European games here (great place to watch Bundesliga games, and you can enjoy a great brunch while doing so!).  The staff is also very friendly and knowledgeable.
