While I was really hoping this would be a great place to get Mexican Food.  I was very disappointed.  I grew up eating great Mexican dishes so when I read these ratings I thought it would be great.  I thought it would be a diamond in the rough.  Sad to say, it was worse than Taco Bell if that's possible.  When you read things like "authentic" that's what you expect!  Unfortunately there was nothing authentic about the stadium cheese sauce they put on their nachos.  Is fresh shredded cheese too much to ask for.  Is anyone tasting the food.  There is absolutely no flavor. I hope something will change.  I want them to be successful.  I truly do.
