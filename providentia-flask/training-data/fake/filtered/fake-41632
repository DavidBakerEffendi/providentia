The food is good but their prices are high and they give you small portions.  I've been to other places where they give you more rice with your order especially when you order the chicken wings with fried rice.   These guys have gone up in price but have decreased their portions.  I used to go here twice a week but now go maybe once a month or when I want something different.   You get more food if you eat in. One other thing, this restaurant doesn't give out any freebies.  If you order $20 or more worth of food, while some in the area will give you a free soda or even food, this place sends you on your way with zip.
