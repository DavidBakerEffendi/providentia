i've dined here many, many times over the past few years. the 2 times i strayed from eggs or french toast, i was really disappointed. the butternut squash hash only tasted like salt. the vegan chili only tasted like salt. now as much as i love salty things, it shouldn't be the predominant flavor. yes, it is a cute diner, but i have a hard time believing that anyone in the kitchen is actually tasting some of the food that is being served. i gave 2 instead of 3 b'c they really hype up the veg/vegan options, which when i've tried them, were nearly inedible (and expensive for something not tasty).
