I was skeptical about this place from reading the reviews. After trying it tonight I have to say we had a great evening here. The food and drinks were very good. The wait staff was very attentive. The live music was entertaining, all be it all traditional Mexican. The owner (one of the singers) even came around to every table to make sure all was well. This place is almost identical to the original El Bandito in Spring Valley, NY which is still my favorite. No longer owned by them, It's actually cheaper! I will definitely recommend this place as well as return here often. Five stars all the way.
