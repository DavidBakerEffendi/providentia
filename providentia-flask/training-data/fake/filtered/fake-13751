Was walking by last night and saw that Juliana's had finally opened!  Everyone's been making such a big deal about the return of Patsy Grimaldi, so I had to to go in.  They said it was a soft opening, so I prepared myself for the worst...but I was thoroughly impressed!!!  We started with a spiedini...wasn't expecting much as this is a pizza joint, but it was delicious!  For the main event we got a pepperoni pizza...the dough was great...it had a wonderful, slightly salty, smoky flavor and the texture was really unlike anything I've ever had before in a pizza...light and airy with a lttle bit of chew.  Pizza was seasoned really well and overall had a really great flavor.   We went for desserts, again wasn't expecting much, but impressed again!    Cannoli was delicious, cream was light not overly sweet.  And couldn't resist a Brookie Bridge under the Brooklyn Bridge :)  To die for!  Vanilla ice cream sandwiched between two decadent, moist brownie-like cookies.   Needless to say, I will be going back...I just hope it takes a while for people to catch on so I don't have to wait in line!
