I had the Coconut and Conch Chowder which was $9. I ordered it for take-out and brought it back to the office and the cup was half full. Needless to say I had to call Rosa Blaca and find out if there was some kind of mistake. The pleasant young lady who answered the phone told me first that she did not know what container the soup was in. She then said that the ladle that they use is measured for what they are to serve. Well, I am still hungry after that soup. The soup was good, fresh, but not so good that I have to have it again. That container should be completely full for the price. I don't really want to make a second trip and that is sad because I work right around the corner.
