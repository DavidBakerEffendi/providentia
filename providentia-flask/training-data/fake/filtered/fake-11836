Friendly service. Food is good, not great. NOT ONE SINGLE ITALIAN working there in service or management. (I'm Italian American living in NYC for life and Manhattan for 35 years. They apparently don't know that Eggplant Parmigiana consists of **LAYERED**, THIN slices of fried eggplant including PARMESAN cheese. They just lay down three thick slices of eggplant and throw on some sauce and mozzarella. Last time, the lobster was tiny and dry with little meat for $35!) HOWEVER, we made a reservation for two for Christmas Eve TWO WEEKS IN ADVANCE and we asked for a specific table in the back corner of the upstairs room (far less noisy). The hostess specifically PROMISED this table for us and showed us how she put it in the computer. When we got there Xmas Eve, the hostess told us that they reserved that table FOR SOMEONE ELSE! We left, but quickly turned back to speak to the manager downstairs. She started to check our reservation, but a little rude man intercepted and told us abruptly that "THEY DO NOT RESERVE SPECIFIC TABLES". (Strangely, they booked it for those other people.) We told him that it would be that table or we're leaving...Forever! HE said rudely, "I don't respond to threats!" Nevertheless, he took us back upstairs and checked our reserved table and found other people there. I GUESS THEY WERE MORE IMPORTANT THAN US. He and the hostess wanted to seat us immediately next to the wait station with the computer and silverware. No way!! We went to BICE on East 54th Street near 5th and enjoyed great drinks, service, and their incredible OSSO BUCO (very expensive, but soooo worth it!!). Never again!!
