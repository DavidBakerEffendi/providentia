I love this place! I go to Hell's Kitchen all the time. It's my comfort place because it's always reliable and consistent. Great Bar Food & Excellent shows! The best part of this place is their shows are incredible and free! Where can you go to see live bands, sideshow and burlesque for free now of days? I think it's incredible that this venue is able to do that and the drinks are affordable. Best bar, hands down.
