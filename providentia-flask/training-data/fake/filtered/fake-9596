Ohhhh so good!  This place is insanely busy so the wait can be very long.  When we go we make sure to get there a few minutes before they open and there is usually a few people lined up to get in.  To me that's a sign of a great place to eat.  It's a little pricey for breakfast food but you can't compare the quality to a typical diner.  Check it out you won't be disappointed.
