Manjares Coffee is as good as it gets... They make an amazing ginger scone-ask for it warmed with butter-mmm-mmm-mmm. Â The proprietors of this establishment are warm and friendly and embraced by the community that is lucky to have such warm and delicious place in which to meet and extend community ties.
