This place was absolutely amazing. I've lived in New Haven for four years now. I never ventured into the State Street neighborhood in which it is located but I will definitely be coming back. I had the Figs and Bacon for an appetizer, I tried the Rabbit with Pasta with two other friends and ordered the Pork Belly as my entree. It was incredible. Definitely coming back. Also, the Bourbon flight portions were great and they had amazing live music. Definitely go!
