This place is smaller than most peoples' apartments in Philly, but don't be fooled. North 3rd serves the best brunch I've ever had. You can grab drink inside at their elaborately decorated bar, or even eat outside. I've since gone back within a week of trying North 3rd for the first time. Not to mention, I barely started drinking my coffe before my food came out. Nothing on the menu is stereotypical like egg omelets or sandwiches. Each item on the menue has their own unique twist to it that I've only ever experienced at North Bowl.
