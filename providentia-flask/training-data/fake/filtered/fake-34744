...hmmmm...I am in love...yay! ...to write about Sanford's is like talking about steamy affair with your new hot boyfriend .... who is good-hearted, friendly and nice (all the staff, Luis was great), trendy and clean-cut (decor, design), sexi and mysterious (ambiance), organized and on-time (service), always there for you (they are open 24/7) and knows what's he doing (food, oh, so good! :) We arrived around 1:15pm, Sunday,  and waited 30+ minutes for table, which was OK with us. After we sat down, we got our drinks going. We started with fresh fruit salad: cantaloupe, honeydew, oranges, pinapples and grapes. Fresh. Yummy. I chose a French toast panini (french toast with caramelized bananas, pecans, cinnamon). I didnt really taste the pecans, so I asked for a side of peanut butter (no charge) and fixed it to perfection :)   My parter-in-crime had a big boy breakfast - 2 sunny-side up eggs on grilled ham, with home fries, multigrain toast and 3 fluffy pancakes. We finished with second round of drinks: bellini for me and Bloody mary for him (too spicy for me, but he liked it). We rolled out. We are coming back. It's on... ps:  Best brunch so far. Period. Must try!
