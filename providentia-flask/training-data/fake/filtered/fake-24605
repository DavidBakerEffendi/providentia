Pros - Awesome food, both the soups and the entrees The 5 star above is only for the food - service, ambience and everything else is typical Chinese restaurant Cons - Long wait to get in - cash only - they add 15% tip automatically and don't tell you - Â felt so rushed that I didn't check and left another 20% tip Will definitely return for the food but will check the bill closely :)
