An unpretentious authentic French bistro on 33rd between Park and Lex. The dining room is small and relaxed with several booths and small tables, I don't think it could seat more than 30 total. .A lot of typically French signage and memorabilia. Service was very attentive.  Music was low and mellow.  It's difficult to find a relaxed place for a quick lunch this far up in mid-town.  Food as was described by others excellent,  if basic. and typical.  I had the onion soup which was delicious and the steak frites. Steak was cooked perfectly a point and frites were crispy,  salad was fresh.  The only other French bistro that compares food wise is Artisanal on which is a much larger, elegant and expensive affair on 33rd and betwn. Park and Madison.  Le Parisien is better for an informal lunch with a co-worker, artisanal is more formal and suitable for business lunches.
