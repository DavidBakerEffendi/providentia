The Pork Fried Rice is the best in the entire world! Beef and Green Beans is exceptional. Service is great (sometimes there is wait because the place is so great). Â The wait staff are excellent and dedicated to a great dining experience. We have been coming here for almost 20 years and there is no better place.
