This place is great! Whether you are a veteran Thai food eater or a newbie, there is something on the menu for everyone.  The atmosphere and aesthetic of the restaurant are great with a staff that is helpful, efficient, and happy to serve you. I have already been there multiple times since it opened only a couple weeks ago.  I would recommend the Chiang-Mai Fries and Chicken Wings for an appetizer and the Thai Burger (comes with the fries) or the Classic Pad Thai (by far and away the best Pad Thai I've ever tasted) for an entree. In a nutshell, it's a fun, upbeat restaurant with great people and FANTASTIC food!
