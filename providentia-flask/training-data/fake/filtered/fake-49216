It was amazing ! I arrived during lunch , I was greeted and sat in a booth by the bar . I was celebrating my ninth year anniversary with my husband and my sister. Our server was excellent with us, very attentive , and outgoing. the place looks great and the food was delicious ! We had the Angry Dragon Sushi Roll , along with a bottle of champagne to enjoy our special day. Our server brought out sparking candles that made the pictures we took look beautiful. I plan on coming back ! It was a great time yesterday, I recommend this place to anyone who is looking to eat or drink at a great establishment with friendly servers at a clean and fresh environment. Thank you.
