What a wonderful experience! The food is so good you have to savor everybite. The atmosphere is elegant and charming, and I wouldn't consider it stuffy. They would probably appericiate that you don't go rollin up in your sweat pants with a bunch of kids that are out of control, but I'd say most upstanding estabishments would. Our meal was very reasonable too: two entrees,two desserts, an appitizer, a take home treat of chocolate covered almonds and tip was $60.
