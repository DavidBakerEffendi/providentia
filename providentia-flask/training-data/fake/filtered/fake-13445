After reading the reviews we thought we'd pop in here for brunch and had reasonable expectations. I'd have to say that the overall experience was mediocre at best. We waited 10 minutes for a table which to be fair on a Sunday lunch is fairly standard so that was ok. What annoyed us was that once seated we had to tell the waiter we were ready to order as nobody had asked within 15 mins and once ordered the food took 50 minutes to arrive. Now I know the place is busy but 50 minutes is way too long to wait for a single course lunch. We did ask after 40 minutes and the waitress told us that don't worry it's on the way and the food is amazing so it will be worth the wait.... When the food did arrive I was disappointed with my oefs mason. The bed of spinach was too watery which in turn made the potato cake soggy, which itself was very thin and weak considering the menu suggested it was a main part of the dish. My wifes French toast faired better. The toast itself was nice and the almonds was a nice touch however the potatos on the side were too heavily salted. As per some of the previous reviews, we were sat nearly on top of a couple next to us which meant it felt a little too claustrophobic for a nice relaxing lunch as everything you said could be overheard. This wasnt a terrible experience but with the seating proximity, the lengthy wait and the food not really being that great it did not really live up to what was expected. We have been to many nice places for a similar price so we won't be going back again.
