Just ate a portion of perhaps the worst roast beef sandwich i ever had.  They have Thumanns signs all over the case, but this could not have been their product.  Shiny red "meat" that tasted only of salt, slightly stale bread and watery tomatoes.  We threw most of it away. This place used to be good.  Even the woman behind the counter who made the sub was nasty. AND there's a surcharge for using a credit card.   I won't be going back.
