I love this place. This is sort of a special spot for my girlfriend and I. The cheese Lasagna is absolutely amazing. I have had good lasagna in my day, but la lanterna di Vittorio makes the absolute BEST lasagna, period. If you told me there was better, I wouldn't believe you, outright lies! The atmosphere is classy yet informal, the ambiance is warm and inviting. The wait staff has been friendly, punctual and competent each time I've visited. Vittorio himself is a gentleman. I would recommend La Lanterna di Vittorio to anyone but my worst of enemies. If some one is too snobby to appreciate this hidden gem, then it is probably for the best, as you should keep better company. This is not an upscale restaurant but it is a classy bistro. As for dates, my girlfriend Â still asks to go back there after three years, so it can't be bad. This is definitely our kind of place. The dim lighting gives a warm and comfortable atmosphere which perfectly accentuates the delicious food. It is absolutely refreshing to enjoy such quality without the pretentiousness that so often accompanies excellence.
