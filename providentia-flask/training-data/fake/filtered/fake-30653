Head cheese? Yes, please! I've been a known brunch hater for most of my life. I work in the industry and serving brunch sucks: "I NEED WATER - NO ICE!, COFFEE, ORANGE JUICE - NO PULP!, AND A GREY GOOSE BLOODY MARY. NOW!!!!" Going out for brunch in Philly is almost as terrible: Wait in line for an hour, sit shoulder-to-shoulder with the most obnoxious people in the city, and suffer a huge plate of french toast that's always cold in the middle. Well, that was then. The Pickled Heron is now. Their new brunch menu is out-of-control awesome. As my first line suggests, I had Eggs Benedict with HOUSE-MADE head cheese and it was fabulous. Everyone else at my table enjoyed their food as well. It was all simply phenomenal. The atmosphere is perfect - warm, relaxed, and comforting. It offers just enough enough of the "fancy" one would expect of a French bistro without being silly - making it great spot for brunch with your mom or a date with your beau. I love that they support local artists by adorning their walls with a different collection each month! And as a server, myself, I sure can appreciate some good help. Our server was very knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the menu and the restaurant. He didn't even roll his eyes when we asked him to take our picture! If anyone asks me to go to brunch ever again, I'll simply say, "The Pickled Heron or bust."
