awesome spot! i thought it might be a lil gimmicky, being attached to the clothing store, but it's a fantastic stand alone restaurant. the space and decor was very open and interesting, particularly the fantastic roof view, but more importantly the menu is very tasty and VERY creative (important to me!). the lamb and bacon wrapped matzo balls are particularly awesome. really i'd prefer to give it 4.5 stars, as the staff was a little inattentive, but it was nothing extreme and they were still very nice. in any case, i feel the menu is such that i'd lean towards 5* over 4 based on that. i def recommend it.
