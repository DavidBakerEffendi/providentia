This place is just consistently serving delicious food and an atmosphere that is reveled in the best way possible. Everyone is alive there and is there to enjoy themselves with great food and people. Their special... "Ray's Burger" is one of the best I've had in the city. It's really in a class all its own, so rich and decadent. Not to mention their homemade fried pickle to top it off! I've been coming here since they've opened nearly 3 months ago and they have yet to fail me. Everything on the menu is spectacular including their "Blackened Brick Chicken." Now when I go out to a restaurant, the last thing I find myself ordering is chicken, but they do it spot on! It's right on pair with a rib eye, and that Jus is something from god. Hands down the Mexican revolver is atop the list of cocktails as is the old sage if you're in the mood. But that cookie in the skillet with a jug of milk can seal the deal for me on any given night. I wish Boulton & Watt the absolute best of luck, they sure don't need it!
