We have been here many times since we came to know this place and always have taken our guests too. Great tasty food. Since we tried their Mutton chukka my husband always gets that. In addition their Pongal Buffet was very good. Yesterday I tried Siruvani Meen Varuval in addition to mutton chukka.It was a very big portion enough for two. It was unique as it came in a traditional banana leaf with each fish covered with plenty of moist spicy masala served in a plate.Their Vege Kothu is great. I wish they were close by.
