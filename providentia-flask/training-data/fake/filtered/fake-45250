Last night, I had a craving for Chicken Marsala over pasta. All I can say is that it was fantastic!! The chicken was tender and sublime. The ingredients are all fresh. The sauce was perfection, marsala wine, butter, fresh mushrooms saut√©ed to heaven. I had it over penne. The sauce was too good to leave the bread behind. The service was excellent. A lot of food for the money. A piece of Little Italy in Bloomfield, NJ. Come see the owner Sal. He's customer friendly and so is his crew
