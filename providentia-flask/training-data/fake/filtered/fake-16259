I came here on a whim because my friend Robby suggested it. Â I wasn't expecting much from a place named 'Cafeteria' because it brought back memories of elementary school lunch and square pizzas. Anyways, I was seated quickly and Amanda was my server. She was AWESOME. So nice. On the ball and funny. She was very quirky and knew the answers to my questions and even helped me figure out some relationship problems I was having with my girlfriend. The food was good, though I think the water had sediment, but it could have been sentiment from the emotional talk I had with Amanda. I recommend this place again and try to get seated in Amanda's section. She makes the experience well worth it, though I am sure the other servers are wonderful as well. Roll the dice and take your first steps into the world fine dining.
