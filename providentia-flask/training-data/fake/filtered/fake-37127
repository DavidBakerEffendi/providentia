Corner Deli has taken a sharp turn for the worse. Turns out the founders sold out and moved South. Although menu and very high prices remain exactly the same, the food has not. The salads, wraps and dressings are just not the same, and after 4 trips post-sale to try the new owners food, I am done. What a shame. Was my favorite lunch spot for 2-3 visits a week, for last 7-10+ years(since opening)? Quality and flavors were worth the extra cost, but not anymore. Every single person I have talked to has had similar experiences. Crowds have totally disappeared, so negative experiences must be common. One positive is that apparently the hot/grill food is still good(must have same staff at grill?) I think a call to Mike & Lynn for some recipes and food prep training is necessary to save this business.
