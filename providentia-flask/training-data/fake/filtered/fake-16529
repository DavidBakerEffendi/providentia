Went to Cafe Mulino today for lunch not sure what to expect, as the restaurant had changed its name and style since last visit. We were pleasantly surprised. The interior is rustic Italian charmingly decorated and very clean. We immediately were shown to a table and given our menus. Our waiter gave us a moment and came back for our drink orders. The menu was a perfect blend of lunch choices which included appetizers, salads, sandwiches, paninis, wraps, burgers, pizza, and entrees. The selections in each category had some old standbys but quite a few were different in their ingredients and presentation. After giving us time to decide what we wanted, the waiter unobtrusively appeared at the table to take our lunch order. We both opted for the same thing...a Portobello Mushroom wrap with grilled chicken, arugula, roasted red peppers, and balsamic vinaigrette. We waited an appropriate length of time and our lunches were served. They were perfect! The wraps appeared to be spinach, and to my pleasant surprise, they were baked which I think is a great substitute for the usual run-of-the-mill doughy wrap. The chicken was perfectly prepared with just enough black pepper to give it a kick. The mushrooms were grilled to just the right amount of doneness, the arugula was fresh and plentiful which nicely played off the crispy wrap. Fries come with the sandwich. The one or two I ate were okay, not great. However, since the wrap was the main event, the fries were unimportant. The cost, we felt, was fair for the quality and amount of food. It's truly a shame we live so far away from this gem of a restaurant...we would definitely be steady customers. There are so many other menu selections that showed imagination in their preparation. I would relish the opportunity to try each one. The restaurant also boasts a nice bar thst looks out over a small patio. To say we highly recommend Cafe Mulino is an understatement...go see what you think.
