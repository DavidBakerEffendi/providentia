I ordered the Schnitzel Platter (chicken) with french fries and a side of Moroccan Cigars (potato and meat) via Campusfood for delivery. Food came in about 30 minutes which was nice. The Moroccan Cigars seemed like they would be good if you had them in the restaurant, but by the time I got them they were cold, greasy, and somewhat bland. The Schnitzel Platter had very, very dry chicken like it had either been microwaved or spent too long under a heat lamp. They were even too dry for the creamy hummus to make up for. Â The chicken was breaded in what looks like spices but tastes like... well I couldn't taste it. I would agree with Candace about the "ehhh" fries for sure. I'd like to give this place a real visit to try the food without the downfalls of delivery, but be forewarned if you plan to have it delivered yourself.
