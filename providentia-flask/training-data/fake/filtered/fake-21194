Like the line from A Chorus Line, "Dance 10 Looks 3". The Writing Room is a mixed lot. Yes it was a Friday. Yes it was crowded. But while the food was tasty (though not quite 10) the service was a 3 (at best). Can we settle ourselves in our seats before we are asked about our wine preferences? Before we finished appetizers, the wait staff was attempting to remove our plates with food still on it. The entrees were delicious but once again, the wait staff attempted to remove our unfinished plates. By the time we were given the privilege to order coffee and desserts, the long legged hostesses had circled our table several times giving us the evil eye. It's not like we were lolling about for hours upon hours, the entire dinning experience was less than 2 hours. For what we paid, I'd expect tasty food in a non-fast food environment.
