Al... you were the MAN... RIP The thinnest crispy crust - I've been eating pies for fifty years and your two part baking process was unique. First stretch the dough thin and into the pan with sauce and cheese, bake until near done then finish on the stone... where else did you get your pizza baked to order - rare, medium, well done??? Your humanity shined through every time I visited. And you never charged me enough. I miss you man. Anybody with the nerve to rate you less than 4 stars just doesn't get it.
