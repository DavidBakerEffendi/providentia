Sanford's restaurant has the best crab cake sandwich in all of Astoria! They offer a generous serving of crab cake - with more crab than batter. The staff is always friendly and for the many times we went - my girlfriend and I - seating was always readily available with little to no wait time. They are open 24hours and the food quality does not vary depending on the hour, so you can depend on excellence anytime you order or stop by. Enough of this writing, enough of this reading, get out there and go to Sanford's already!
