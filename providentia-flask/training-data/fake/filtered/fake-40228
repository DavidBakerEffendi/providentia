The good news about this venerable pizza slinging institution is that they have really great sauce, rich concentrated tomato oomf with nicely balanced acidity. The bad news is that they think really great sauce = really great pizza. It almost works. Now, don't get me wrong, Lombardi's serves great pizza. Especially if you like a lot more sauce than cheese. But any pretensions they may have to rank among the Pepe's, Sally's, Di Faras of the world are a real stretch. If you are in the area, in the mood for a great unique pizza and want to check it off your list, stop in. The line moves much more quickly than you'd think and you'll love the pizza. But Brooklyn and New Haven still beckon...
