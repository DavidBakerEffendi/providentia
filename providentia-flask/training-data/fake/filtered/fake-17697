Ended my last week with the visiting of this place -at first got huge open space for dealing with the parking. One of the amazing place though a bit simple before this never tried at here. Seemed a bit pricy from the other when first saw it for the ordering. As the first time before coming here knew a bit from the review done by others-ordered for their tacos that good really tasty. Also the meat here yummy -had only three tacos, meat and the sope------so delicious.
