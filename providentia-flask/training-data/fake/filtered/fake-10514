A really good underrated fast food place. Much better than your average Chipotle or Moe's. Probably costs about as much as Chipotle or Moe's but the quality is significantly better. I am sure you could get better Mexican food at a restaurant but this is still good food at a solid price. If this place was located by where I worked I would never go to Chipotle again.
