Continually one of the best dining experiences in NYC.  The atmosphere, music, service, drinks and of course food is all super top notch.  If there's a long wait, you can put in your phone number, go around the corner to Black & White for some drinks and come back.  Or, have one of the delicious sriracha, tequila, sake cocktails from the restaurant bar.  The new Brooklyn Brewery beer they are carrying is also delicious. Here's the way to do it:   Get an order of pork buns per person in your party (Ask for sriracha) Share the cucumber app and use the sauce on the plate for dipping pork buns into. Share shishito pepper Ramen... Modern, Kakuni, Onsen Tamago, Bakkudan for the table The green tea afterwards is a nice touch. Ippudo rules
