I celebrated my birthday there (we were a party of 5) and we got there, we got our water, and the waitress disappeared. We were waiting for her to take our order and she was standing not far from our table doing absolutely nothing so I called her over. We ordered 3 appetizers, they brought them all separately, like 5 minutes in between of Â the other. Then they brought two entrees, 20 minutes later the 3rd entree, and 20 more minutes and no 4th or 5th entrees. We cancelled the order and just ate the pad thai, which wasn't so great. I really have had better Thai food, this place is not what was described on previous reviews.
