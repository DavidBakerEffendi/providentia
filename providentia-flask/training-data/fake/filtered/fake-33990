So usually the phrase "Best Pizza in New Haven" is linked to the very famous Frank Pepes- and don't get me wrong- Pepe's is VERY good- but have to recommend Sally's over and above - just a stone's throw down the road from Pepe's is this hidden no-frills gem- with melt in the mouth Pizza that is to DIE for- can't recommend it enough- run by the most friendly and hilarious couple (who offered us food whilst we waited- freshly chopped Mango ?!!) which complemented our top notch pie! We did take out but next time plan to sit down as the atmosphere was "one of a kind"- head down there to see what I mean.... As I said- Can't recommend it enough!!
