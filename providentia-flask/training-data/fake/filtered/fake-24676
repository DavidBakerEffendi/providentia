My family and I went for restaurant week and found the food DELICIOUS! My favorite dishes was the korean beef and the brussel sprouts. A lot of the food I didn't think I would like, I feel in love with! Definitely my favorite restaurant in Philly right now! The dessert was amazing, I loved the ice cream it was so creamy and full of bold and delicious flavors.
