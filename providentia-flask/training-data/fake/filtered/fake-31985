If You Like HYPE, then you've come to the right place. Unfortunately Â the food speaks for itself and tells a different story: Overpriced, dry, lumps of meat plus bad service to boot. How it works: Line up at the counter and move down the line to get your meat then grab a seat along the other side against the wall. Decor is bare-bones so at least you don't need to dress up. Shovel the meat down and move on cause people will be waiting for yout able. Oh, and the service is less than bare bones (I guess the wait staff isn't eating at Delaney). Spoiler: on Fridays-Sunday they let the people who "supported them" in early at 6:00pm. So by the time they officially open at 6:30pm the tables are already full and you will be waiting outside in the cold. But this is Williamsburg and there's actually tastier places you can go for your meat fix. If the hype still has it's hold on you and you muuust....gooo---toooo--Deee--lllaaaa--neeey bbquuuu (in zombie voice) then I hear the Walking Dead is always looking for extras.
