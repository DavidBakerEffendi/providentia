Gottino is an especially warm wine bar with above average food and an aficiando's selection of Italain wines (Nero d'Avola anyone?).  The place is cozy and can accomodate about 30+ at the bar and more in the small adjoining room.  There is an outdoor garden but access is limited to the Summer.  All aside, this place has an amazing selection of cheeses and a tasty blood-orange salad. The meats and pate are equally delicious. I've brought lots of friends here just to unwind and it's perfect for the post-work exhale. Try the Boar.
