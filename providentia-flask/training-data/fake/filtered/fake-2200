Yesterday, (a week day), I went there 3 times with a party of 3. The morning there was a 45 minutes wait, the place is popular - fair enough. In the afternoon, it was closed and we were told to come back at 6. At Â 5 to 6, we were back to be told by very unfriendly and impolite attendants that we were too late and that they had given our seats to an earlier group. And that despite the fact the restaurant was half empty (supposedly booked but they would not take our booking earlier). You may think whatever you like of it, but this is just pancake and we are in NYC! I will never go to the Clinton St. Bakery and I think it is really crazy to see people queuing for food in such a vibrant neighborhood with so many great and innovative alternatives. Those places should learn to be a bit modest and understand that fashion will change and that what's hype now, soon no longer will be. Then they'll be happy to have loyal customers.
