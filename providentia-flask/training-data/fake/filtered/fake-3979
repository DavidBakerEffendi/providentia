Adore!!!! Perfect!!!! Had a most excellent first night here the other night, with a friend.  Extremely pleasant time chatting with the bartenders / bar owners, who were so friendly and generous with their time.   Really can't speak highly enough .... the decor doesnt try too hard (just right for a neighborhood bar, big wooden tables, knick-knacks aren't out of control...).... the range of beers is superb.... more extensive wine list might be nice I suppose?  Hot apple cider was expensive but delicious on a cold night!  Also, the music wasn't too loud on a Wednesday night, which is always appreciated when you just want to have a few drinks and a chat.   Hallelujah, the perfect neighborhood bar has arrived.
