I really like the atmopshere here, it is fun and laid back at the same time. I am a fan of the decor, the blackboards included! Went there for dinner with my boyfriend and felt that it was a great addition to the area. Boyfriend had mussels and I had the salmon, both were very well done. Broth for the mussels is so tasty, you might need more bread!!Service was a bit slow but it was busy and this location is new. Have been to the East Village location and this one definitely stands consistent and we were not disappointed.
