Their service is superior and the food is amazing.  I love their wanton soup and ginger (un)chicken.  I love vegan food but always tried to order something that I knew what it was, more whole foods.  Well Veggie Heaven converted me to love the fake meat and even made me like mushrooms.  Their lunch specials are under $7 and the take out is great.  They even deliver!
