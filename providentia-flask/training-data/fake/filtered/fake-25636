I can't say enough great things about this pizzeria.  It's family owned and run.  The staff is very friendly and polite.  The food is always great.  We can never decide on just 1 or 2 slices, we have to get an assortment always. Salad pizza?  yes it is great.  Shrimp parmesan - the family raves about it...cheese and broccoli?  another so non-traditional but wonderful slice, I can't believe I'm enjoying vegetables!. Eggplant parm pizza is my favorite, but even the standard foldable pepperoni and sausage pizza will make your mouth water. When we say pizza, we make the 10 mile ride to this place.
