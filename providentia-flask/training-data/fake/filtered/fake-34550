Simple elegance.         How about getting an email 10 days before your daughter's wedding reception letting you know there was a new manager.   Jules immediately put us at ease and even though he was new to the Hartness House, he was not new at hospitality.  Jules and Brad are gracious innkeepers that have great plans for this venue.     The reception was held in the Ballroom, it was clean and fresh.  Brad did a wonderful job decorating the inn.  We had a tremendous time.   The back motel rooms are for the budget minded (nothing fancy but served the purpose).  The main inn rooms are elegant and historic. Jules and Brad did everything to make this event memorable.  The food was hot and moist.  We also had brunch the next morning in the Governor's Room.   Jules recommended the lasagna and it was a hit.     If you want a true Vermont experience, let Hartness House (Jules and Brad) especially be your innkeepers.   You will not be disappointed.           We can't wait to get back to see Jules vision transform this inn to the next level.
