OMG ! Is all I have to say. My boyfriend and I came here on a date this past Saturday night. Firstly the service was outstanding, everyone was so kind and attentive. Secondly that buttermilk dressing with the dill is insanely delicious. We tried the Fried Green Tomatoes which I would highly recommend. I had the chicken pot pie, and it was probably the best pot pie I have ever had. The shrimp and grits were also amazing, and perfectly cooked. I would highly recommend trying the fried okra ! SO different and so flavorful. We are definitely coming here again, I have to say, this is probably one of the best restaurants I have eaten at in this area.
