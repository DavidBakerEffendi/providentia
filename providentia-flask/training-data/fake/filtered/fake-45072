This place was highly recommended, so I figured it would be great. Also, it was packed on a Wednesday night with a 40 min wait. After waiting blocking the door for 40 min with no spots to sit down, we were starving. The bread was not good, cold and tough, more like an afterthought, not even as good as grocery store bread. We got scallops wrapped in bacon, mussels, wings, and an arugula salad to start. The scallops were really really not good. They were tough and tasted either like they had been frozen or left on the burner for 10 min too long. Hard and chewy. The sauce for the scallops was admittedly good though...just like a previous reviewer said, good for dipping. The mussels were overly salty and tough, either really not fresh or overcooked like the scallops. The arugula salad was good and light, but it was really simple, there wasn't much to it. I think if memory serves me right it was just leaves and balsamic. At least they didn't mess it up. The wings were ok, I really liked how they do a simple dry rub on them bc most places pour overly salty buffalo sauce all over wings. The bad thing was that the wings were dry and overcooked. Had they been cooked a few min less, they would have been really good. We ordered a sausage pizza for the table. The pizza was ok, but I had really really good NY pizza for lunch that afternoon, so comparatively it wasn't good. The crust was ok, pretty thin crust, but the pizza had too many toppings. The whole pizza fell apart and was near impossible to eat. Topping/sauce/cheese/crust ratio just didn't seem that great. Service was friendly, no problems there. Overall, I don't get the hype of this place. It wasn't worth the wait or the money. I like going to dive places like this, but only if the food is good. Without good food, it's just a run-down old restaurant.
