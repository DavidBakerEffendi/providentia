My husband and I love this place! We have been going here for years. The main waiter knows us as soon as we walk in and can remember what we normally order even if we haven't been back in 6 months. It's not the fanciest of places but the food is great, the service is good. You can't go wrong for a nice Italian meal for a reasonable price.
