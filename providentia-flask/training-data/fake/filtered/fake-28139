We only went there because the wait for their neighbor was too long, I now know why!! The food arrived coldish, the floors were dirty, tables were not completely free of residue and service was slow at best. My hubby was ill afterwards, he swears it was food poisoning, we won't be returning to this establishment. Do better next time.
