I was given the honor of picking a place to have breakfast. I had checked this place out on Yelp the week before and decided to take them here. And Im glad I did.  Everybody loved it! Perhaps we were lucky, because the place was far from crowded when we entered, several tables were free and we picked one by the window.   The space feels cozy and laid-back, with great music (My mum squeed as they started playing Annie Lenox) and walls filled with the lovely art of Stephen Huneck. My siblings and I shared a plate of tasty, perfectly golden brown Village Pancakes with strawberries. Even my super picky little brother ate happily without complaining while my mum and her partner enjoyed their scrambled eggs with home fries and toast. We had freshly squeezed orange juice on the side which my mum called the best juice she d ever had. The young (and good-looking) staff were super friendly, happy to assist and seemed to enjoy working together. Unfortunately we couldn t stay for too long, but we all left with smiles on our faces.   Go here with a bunch of friends, enjoy the food and happy feel of this place, and stay for as long as you like!
