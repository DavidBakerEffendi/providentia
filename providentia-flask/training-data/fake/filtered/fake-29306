These are in best falafels in the United States! Every time I fly into NYC, it is the very first place I have to go to! Their lentil soup is amazing, fresh & healthy. The baklava dessert is very good. The chick pea falafels are the best! Tahini sauce is excellent. Beware of the spicy sauce...very spicy! Doesn't matter if their is a line, service is very fast. Mamoun's needs to open more locations all over the US!!
