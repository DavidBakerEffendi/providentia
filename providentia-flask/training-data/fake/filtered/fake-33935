I've had the pleasure of eating at Mistral quite a few times since it opened earlier this year in Princeton. I've had consistently good experiences and my wife & I love the thoughtfulness of the menu and the exceptional quality of everything we've ordered. The tapas style plates are inventive and taste great. I had lunch at Mistral yesterday with three guests, and it was another great culinary experience. And our waitress, Masha, did a great job guiding us in our selections. I highly recommend this restaurant, you won't be disappointed. Ron & Lauren B. Davis
