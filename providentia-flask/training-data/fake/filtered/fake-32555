Today was my 3rd time - the first two times had the pork ribs - unbeliveable - today, the chopped pork platter with the mild sauce.  Walking in to the store, the smell makes your mouth water.  Driving home - I couldn't wait to get there.  Mixed the sauce in and could not believe what I was tasting.  I'm hooked on the food there. Will have to try the other items on the menu for either lunch or dinner The Porteguese places have lost me as a customer
