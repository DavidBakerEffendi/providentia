I was in NYC this past weekend, and I couldn't have asked for a better place to spend my Saturday.  The Bakehouse has everything one could need from excellent bloody mary's, fresh baked bread and amazing brunch options.  I had the 3 eggs scrambled and it was amazing.  The staff went above and beyond to make you feel welcome and I would recommend the Bakehouse to anyone who enjoys a relaxed and cozy setting.  I can't wait until I am back in Manhattan so I can stop by again!
