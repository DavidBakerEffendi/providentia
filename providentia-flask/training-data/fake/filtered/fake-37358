I have put away quite a few sandwiches in my time. I ordered the #1 (house special) with the chili peppers and the #3 (shredded pork) with chili peppers. Honestly, $3.75 is the most I've ever paid for banh mi, but really, that's still a steal. For me, the bread is the absolute foundation and I immediately noted that the baguette was subpar. The quintessential baguette for banh mi needs to be warmly crisped on the outside, have just a touch of butter, and have a spongy softness on the inside. The bread was rather generic, dry, and .... American? The actual sandwich (#1) once I took a bite was better. The vegetables had lost some of their crispness. I did like the fact that the meat and pate were quite good, flavorful, moist with its inherent pork fat, and without overuse of mayonaise. Everything was in correct proportion. The overall portions were generous for banh mi and I killed it without much thought. So overall taste was okay, texture was disappointing. Â  The shredded pork (#3) was forgettable and the bi didn't taste particularly flavorful like it should. Needs more of a burnt-y, bitter, sesame quality. This sandwich's contents was kinda of an amalgamated flavor clump. Meh. I tossed the second half of this sandwich. I want to give this joint another shot. Perhaps the veggies are fresher in the morning. But I can't really excuse the bread .... eh. I'm not going out of my way for this. No doubt, the search for good banh mi in the city continues.
