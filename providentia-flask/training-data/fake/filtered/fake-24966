Horrible!!! I am a fan of Ruby tuesday. I always get the "so-connected" coupons but they dont work in my favorite ruby which is in elizabeth because the coupons excludes airport locations. My boyfriend and I decided to go to the one in woodbridge. As soon as I showed the waitress the coupon. She put a face and took our order and left. We didnt see her for another 30 minutes and thats when the food arrived. She was rude and unattentive. I will never come back to this Ruby tuesday!!!
