As this place has been generating a lot of buzz, I was really looking forward to trying the food. I must say, I was really underwhelmed. I went for dinner and drinks last week. We sat at the bar which was fairly empty.  The bartender did not know much about the current beer selection but that usually doesn't bother me. We asked a few question about the dinner menu and again, the bartender was clueless. He awkwardly walked away to the kitchen for clarification. Eventually i ordered the wings and the fired chick sandwich. The wings were pretty good but on the cold side. I actually preferred the wings from the former tenant. The fried chicken sandwich sounded awesome but was a complete disappointment. The sandwich comes on a biscuit (most likely a week old) which is good but since the chicken serving is rather modest, the sandwich is way more bread then desired. I was expecting a better then average meal but what was served was below average at best. I returned this weekend to meet a few friends for drinks, unfortunately they totally killed the vibe of PBR.  The vibe is now more upscale restaurant that happens to have bar. Not a bad place to have 1 drink but def not a place to hangout anymore.
