This was my first experience at the shoppe. I decided to try the famous godfather with a nutella milkshake. The two blonde fellows behind the counter made each one. One word- exquisite. The pure genius of these fine young men was astounding. When i bit into the godfather and tasted the milkshake, I knew they were slingers.
