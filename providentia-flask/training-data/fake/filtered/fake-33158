So I saw the place on  food network   Throwdown with Bobby Flay and decided that i must go there. And after all that hype the food appeared to be just ok. The green falafel was just ok and the pita was too dry. But maybe i just went there on a wrong day. The place is tiny and cramped up just  with 2 customers. They don't  take credit cards which is another downfall. Most likely I won't go back.
