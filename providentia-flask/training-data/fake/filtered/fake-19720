A most definite jewel in the crown of Bed-Sty.  The wait staff is friendly and attentive.  I've been alone and with friends and I always received top-notch service.  The food is absolutely delicious.  They serve a coconut-pineapple rice that sounds anything but appealing, but which tastes PHENOMENAL.  The rice is so good, I had a tray made for a party.  I've had several dishes and they were all good.  The prices are reasonable and the atmosphere light.  My only complaint would be the fact that they don't open until 5pm and they close at 10pm.  Not nearly enough time.  The neighborhood would be much better served with hours that started at lunchtime and extended to late night.
