Top to bottom fabulous. My two roommates and I came here for our seasonal fancy dinner and could not have chosen better. I'm a vegetarian and they both eat meat, so we thought we'd find something for everyone to love. We split the baked brie (amazing) and they shared the my favorite appetzier--sashimi, I think, and they also called it divine. I got the featured salad, which was goat cheese, spinach, and strawberries and it was very refreshing. Entree wise, they split the lamb tangine, which looked super tender, and the filet mignon and that was great too apparently. I got the mediterranean roasted veggies and couscous, and it was awesome! Honestly, it's hard to find good vegetarian food that I can't re-create at home for far cheaper, but even the couscous was flavorful and the portion was huge! Desserts were delightful--the brownie was great, and so was the peach bread pudding (not usually my thing). The creme brulee was just okay. Service was great! Our water glasses were always full, they came out right away to open our wine for us, and the owner (I think) came by to check on us several times. Would DEFINITELY come back here.
