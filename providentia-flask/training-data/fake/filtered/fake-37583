Lou's definitely earned a new customer. I AM CRAVING LOU'S JUST WRITING THIS REVIEW. My boyfriend and I finally decided to stop by Lou's Hot Bagels & Cafe this week after passing by a million times here in West Caldwell. We sat in and each had a combo meal. Our sandwiches were really good. Not bland at all but at the same time, not too salty. And THEIR FRIES. Oh my. They were one of the crispiest and hottest fries I've ever had. Just so delicious and yummy. Also...it was nice to meet Bob, the guy who owns the place. Really great guy who knows how to treat his customers.
