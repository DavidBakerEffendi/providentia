My husband and I decided to try Casablanca after reading the reviews on this site, and we were not disappointed! We started with the eggplant salad, which was delicious. For our entrees I had the chicken with couscous and my husband had lamb tagine. Both dishes were flavorful and delicious. We also had the tea, and as many others stated in their reviews, it was great.  In addition to the great food, the service was fantastic. The waitress was incredibly friendly and attentive, and took the time to explain the menu to us in detail.  I would highly recommend this restaurant.
