Imagine going to dinner at your favorite relative's home during the holidays back in Jersey that's 15 Fox Pl. Great food, service and atmosphere. Let's start with the food. One thing to keep in mind is that Fox Pl does not offer a menu, which is not a problem because there is a never ending array of antipasto, pasta, meat and dessert. Let's start with the antipasto. Approximately 10 different types of tastings. My favorites, the polenta with sausage and the fried pizza with tomato sauce. Incredibly delicious. The polenta is the ultimate! Regarding the pastas, we were served two types, homemade manicotti and some type of caped pasta in a cream sauce. Pasta was cooked perfectly, al dente! We were also served filet mignon over potatoes and meatballs with peas. Dessert consisted of chocolate lave cake with gelato, various biscotti and espresso. I'm sure I'm missing something. Regarding the service, Michelle was our server/hostess. She was cordial, attentive and has a great personality. She makes you feel at home. She is outstanding. The atmosphere is also worth noting. The dining table is well set and the rooms represent a different part of a home. We sat next to the library. Overall, a GREAT dining experience! You will not be disappointed. Can't wait to return for another fabulous meal!
