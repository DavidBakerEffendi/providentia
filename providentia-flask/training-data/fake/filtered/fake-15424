I love the place ! I must go there every weekend with my family, the atmosphere is so comfortable to hangout with people! the service is quick and the price is also very decent! I had this combo sushi and sashimi that was sooo gooddd. the sizes were big so I got full really quick lol. and then I had a fried icescream for dessert which was also big and I hardly finished what I ordered! Highly recommend the place!
