This place gets the triple play of horrendous; horrendous food, horrendous service, and horrendous value. To be accurate, if you're in Northern Liberties to eat or drink you've overtrended already any measure of value and sense. I've begun to wonder after my second visit here if they're not using that vile pink slime in their burger patties.  Not even kidding. The service is, at best, thoughtless, and at worst, offensive.  Hey, kids, nothing cool about being unable to do the job - and this counts from inept bouncer, to staff-and-customer-insulting management, to untrained wait staff. As for the pricing, it came to about $50 for 2 plates of the saddest, most poorly cooked burgers I've ever seen and a couple of their "adult" shakes.  Booze milkshakes are hit-or-miss.  The dude does not abide by poor mixing skills of dairy and alcohol.   If you wind up eating here because you are local and hungry, or out-of-towner and hungry, I pity your taste buds.
