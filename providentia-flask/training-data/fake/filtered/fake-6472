The spring rolls had too much lettuce filler and the peanut sauce wasn't that tasty.  The pho was very good and the shrimp they use is good quality but they kind of undid all that by having snotty a old man wait tables.  I don't know if he's the owner or what but he was kind of a rude scowling jerk.  The 'pho nazi' ruined it for me.  We were looking for a new weekly regular lunch spot.  We will keep looking. The pho is good but would only be average in Reno or Phoenix or San Francisco.
