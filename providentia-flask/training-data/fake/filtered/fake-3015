I am a young, well traveled professional that dropped into this place because it caught my eye on on the way to the airport... The place is very nice and the layout is good, but the service is TERRIBLE. They have a young staff that seems more concerned with hanging out and talking to their friends than taking care of the customers. My advise to the management is get professional staff well trained staff that will cater to the people spending the money. Places like this are all about atmosphere and while they did a great job on the facilities I really did not like the "clicky" attitude of the staff which seemed to be bothered by having to attend to the customers that they did not know.... In a sports bar establishment staff friendliness and service are everything and this place really needs some work in that area...
