I work nearby so Halvorson's is convenient. Unfortunately, my experiences have been awful lately. Last summer was hit or miss while this summer I find that it's usually a miss. I ordered chili to go today, and was very upset to find when I sat down to eat it that it was cold. Usually the chili can be very runny but at least at a nice hot temperature. Taking my quick lunch elsewhere.
