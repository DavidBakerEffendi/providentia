You a greeted with a smile when you walk in the door and always leave with some extra goodies.  The staff is warm and friendly and makes you feel like you are dining at someone's house not a restaurant.  The food is delicious, and everyone says it but the garlic bread is top notch!  I would recommend to anyone who is in the area to stop by.
