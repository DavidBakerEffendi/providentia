Excellence!!! Â My husband made reservations for our Anniversary on April 20th, let me start by saying that my experience was phenomenon! Starting from the hostesss to the manager they were great! They sat us by a romantic corner which was ready with a letter from Iron Chef Marc Forgione congratulating us on our Anniversary, then our awesome waiter Jason set us up with two glasses of the bubbly (tasty) as he told us about the menu....now we choose the tasting menu OH MAMMA MIA did he steer us right!! from the Frios Gras to the Lamb I wouldn't be able to choose which one tasted better then the next....the Chili Lobster with Texas toast was to DIE FOR!!!!...the Banana Jameson was so deliciousssss! as was the Strawberry sorbet, etc..Again this place made my night more special! I would of loved to meet Chef Forgione but I was happy no matter what! thanks to the staff at Marc's and my loving husband Joe!
