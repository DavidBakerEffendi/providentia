You might enjoy the food but don't go if you have a child.  They proudly proclaimed they have no high chairs or booster seats.  After eating my meal with my son on my lap I asked the owner "why have a kids menu if you don't have seating for them?"  His answer was that his clients make accommodations for the special needs of their children.  Hmm... It's not that special that toddlers can't sit in a normal chair.  So skip this one if you travel with or have a toddler.
