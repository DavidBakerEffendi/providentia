Just finished dinner at WG - the food was great and our waiter (Tom) was outstanding!  The food - from salads to shared lobster mac to entrees - was excellent.  The drink specials were great too!  Tom was attentive but not overbearing, friendly and honest.  Thank you WG - we will definitely be back!
