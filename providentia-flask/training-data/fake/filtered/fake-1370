Really enjoyed our dinner at Do or Dine and their playful takes on classic dishes.The appetizers were good across the board, being a fan of deviled eggs, I especially enjoyed their version "e666s" with cilantro and bacon. I had "A Fish and Some Chips" as an entree- a whole snapper deep fried (batter-less) served over french fries. I expected to get something closer to classic fish and chips but was pleasantly surprised by the presentation and flavor of this dish. The staff was friendly Â and attentive, even though the restaurant was full. Sparse but cool decor. A really good meal all around. Nice work
