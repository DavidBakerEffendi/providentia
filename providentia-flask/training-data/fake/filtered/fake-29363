This place has hands down the best falafel I've ever had in the US.  The falafel, hummus, veggies, pita and hot sauce are all top notch.  The hot sauce is especially good.  Combine all of this with the $3 price tag and you've got a seriously high price:value ratio. Please come to Chicago, I'll invest
