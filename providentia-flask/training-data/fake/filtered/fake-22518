The location is nice but the meals are highly priced for what you get. I ordered Whole wheat strozzapreti and Shrimps... and the dish was tasteless and not seasoned at all. It looked like somebody threw all the leftovers into the plate. The beans were raw an whole wheat pasta did not make any sense in the dish. The shrimps did not have any taste. Tasteless...Nothing holds this dish together! My husband ordered a Grilled Moroccan Chicken and it came without any vegetables on the side, just rice and chicken for 28 dollars. We are very disappointed and I think the chef needs to rethink the ingredients in the menu. I am not a chef but my salad and and dinner that I made a night before we went to this restaurant still surpasses the experience at Mediterra!
