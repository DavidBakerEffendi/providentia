My boyfriend and found this yummy Thai spot about a month ago! ...I've had authentic and expensive Thai before and I was amazed at the tasty meal we had for $35 bucks...including a calamari appetizer, the mango salad is great, two entrees and Thai Iced Tea's ...which taste better without the cream... not bad...the only thing that suck's is if you can't eat out side its super crowed inside and usually packed with a 45 min wait. boo...we've tried going back but didn't want to wait to eat that long even if it's cheap!
