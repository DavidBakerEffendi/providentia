When here for brunch on a Sunday with a group of friends. We did have reservations and were seated immediately. We did the boozy brunch for $29 per person. They are fast to fill your glass with the choice of Bellini, mimosa, bloody mary, or screwdriver. I chose the Bellini which was really good. The food we order all came in at once and was really good. I recommend the French toast and the spicy fennel sausage. The server was very attentive, can't remember his name I think Carlos, he was always making sure our glasses weren't empty and very friendly. I will definitely recommend this place for brunch. One thing, be careful going in with an empty stomach cause you could get very typsy before the food comes out. Speaking from experience
