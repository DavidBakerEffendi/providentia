Stopped in on a Friday for Happy Hour.  A bunch of friends me and I decided to check it out it out after work to see what they had to offer.  Gotta say that we were impressed!  Very cool vibe to the place and drink prices were pretty amazing. Sushi was definitely amazing, but so were the potstickers.  We will definitely be back again.  I agree with Ed, it doesn't look too impressive outside, but when you go inside...man...they got it right!
