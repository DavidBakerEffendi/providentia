This is the second year we have had Mamma cater our Holiday Party and everyone thoroughly enjoyed the absolutely delicious food. Rosario is fantastic - not only very customer oriented and friendly but gives close attention to details, offered very helpful suggestions and follow-up to confirm menu, date and time.  Jay delivered the food on time and was terrific in setting up the buffet.  We couldn't be happier with the food and service and would highly recommend them.  We will enjoy their excellent food again.
