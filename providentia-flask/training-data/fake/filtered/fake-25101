The worst experience since they first opened. went to grab a quick bite before a movie with my man, and we stood there in-front of the counter and the waiter didn't bother to say a word to us. The little waitresses behind the counter turned their backs on us and playing with their hair chatting amongst themselves. Rude little snotty witches for sure. I AM Portuguese so I understood every little word and body language, and these Brazilians think they are high class when in fact they are the lowest of all. 15 minutes we stood there and they didn't have the decency to even make eye contact. Not one. hypocritical discriminating witches. We walked out and I cursed them in Portuguese as we left, and also flipped them off too. The food was never that great anyway. Mind as well stick with applebees and sonic; or better yet, just stick with homemade food from your own kitchen. End of story. This place is hell and always was and will be. They don't care about anyone else but their selfish selves and their little Brazilian kind. Poorest and lowest customer service anyone will ever get. They don't deserve to be around. STAY FAR FAR AWAY.
