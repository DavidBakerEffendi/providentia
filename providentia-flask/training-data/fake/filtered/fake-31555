New to Blunch at Blend....did not disappoint! Â Had the chicken Vacafrita, was amazing...chimichurri sauce was delish! One Sangrita later, I was almost smashed! The wait staff was awesome, our waitress Felichia, was so attentive and helpful and super friendly. It was a pleasure from start to finish. I highly recommend! And the view....!!!
