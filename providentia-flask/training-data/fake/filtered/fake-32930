New Yorkers - you don't know what you are missing! We had a fabulous late dinner of deliciously- prepared, inventive, healthy small plates paired with a wonderful selection of reds. With only a few nights to graze, we will return again before returning home. Oh, and our other choices - Gotham Bar and Grill, Nobu 57, Landmarc and a so-so pizza choice. Don't let Kilo slide away - not to be missed.
