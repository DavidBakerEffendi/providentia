I could write an ode to this happy hour. The drink specials are fabulous, but the reason I keep coming back is for the heavenly $1 mini taco. I've had them all, and I must say the common favorite among the people I know is the steak taco. It is tender, and flavorful, and perfectly seasoned. It is, perhaps, the perfect mini taco. It can get a little loud, and more than once there has been an obnoxious crowd blocking all traffic at the bar, but the taco. It defies all reason. Treat yo self.
