I love these outdoor vendor set-ups that UrbanSpace has been setting up! Especially Broadway Bites because it's staying put for the whole summer. There are a ton of different vendors to choose from with a variety of types of food. I've tried a lot of them and have yet to be disappointed! The vendors I have tried include: - Brooklyn Taco - Mason Jar NYC - Breads Bakery - Roberta's - Hong Kong Street Cart - Seoul Lee Korean BBQ - Mayhem and Stout - Mighty Balls - Charlito's Cocina - Arancini Bros - Macaron Parlour - Melt - Red Hook Lobster Pound (Wow this list looks so long written out, but I work a couple blocks away so I've had a ton of opportunities to try the different vendors so far this summer!) Seriously, everything I tried was so good and so unique. Some of the vendors get busier than others, but the lines move pretty quickly. The only downside is that it can get a bit pricey, but I think it's worth it for a nice switch-up lunch during the work week.
