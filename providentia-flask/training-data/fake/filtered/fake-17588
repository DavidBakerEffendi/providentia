I'm a waffle eater. And the waffles here are amazing. As weird as it may sound to some, I think I would have preferred mine plain. The added toppings, ice cream, fruits, etc. seems to take away from the crisp subtle flavor of the waffle. But maybe that's just me. My boyfriend got one of the omelettes. I apologize I do not remember the exact one. Except that there was bacon in it. He liked it; he's a picky eater so I guess that means something. Go for it if you like eggs. Drinks: there is a huge blackboard with the drinks (alcoholic) menu written beautifully. And while I did not try any due to health reasons, this decor/marketing technique really works for me. The mochaccino on the other hand was amazing. (See? I got a drink! even though I normally just cheap out and drink water.) My only complaint would be the cramped space. I'm really paranoid about knocking stuff over when squeezing between table spaces. But good things come in small packages, I would Â definitely recommend it.
