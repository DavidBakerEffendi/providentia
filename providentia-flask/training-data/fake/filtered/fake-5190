I could not disagree more with the other review.  Their Margarita is well priced and delicious.  the Guacamole is one of  the best in the area.  My husband always gets the house chardonnay, we do not find it expensive.  The nacho's are great and the beer selection is local and well priced.  We have made  this place a regular stop.
