Don't Do it! Their food is okay, not great, much better falafel at the Taim cart.  Their takeout service is HORRENDOUS - we waited over 2 hours for a lunch delivery today - called multiple times - was told the order was on the way.   There are so many better places to order from -  save yourself the aggravation and don't order from ths place.
