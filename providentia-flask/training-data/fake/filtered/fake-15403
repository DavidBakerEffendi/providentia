The other night I had quite the perfect dinner. Started out with the calamari, that was so good, I could have licked the plate ( but I managed to have some self control and I didn't) . Then, as an entree I shared the parrillada for 2 and that was a little piece of heaven, I am sure of it!! The steak was cooked perfectly and you could cut through it like butter. Â The service was very good. Everyone was friendly and it was just a cool place to relax, have a good meal and enjoy a drink. I am already planning on going there again... soon!!
