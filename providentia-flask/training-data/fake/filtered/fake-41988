I might have given this place a positive review if I was ever able to actually taste the food. I had never had Thai food and was excited for the experience. We had an 8PM reservation, waited until passed 8:15 to even have our bottles of wine opened and ended up walking out at 9:15 after we were never even served our appetizers. As we walked out, none of the staff even attempted to talk to us; I've never felt so neglected and insulted by restaurant staff. This was undoubtedly the worse dining experience I have ever had, hands down. Strictly on principle, I would never, ever return to this restaurant.
