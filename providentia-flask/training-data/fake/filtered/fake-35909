Early on Roberta's was a great affordable choice in Bushwick. Now it's a pretentious hipster enclave. The service used to be semi decent. Now it's just a pizza place frat house with inattentive arrogant staff, horribly loud music and not to mention the same amount of bathrooms prior to expansion. This place's time has passed move on.
