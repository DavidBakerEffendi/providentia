I'd stopped in a few times for dinner and really enjoyed their opening Chef's food; it was an adventurous French menu with hints of Asian influences. The menu has changed under the new chef and while the food is executed well I find the options and overall menu choices to be less inspiring than before.  It also feels formulaic to the groups American restaurants Joseph Leonard and Jeffrey's rather than the originality of Fedora or Chez Sardine, which it had before. As for brunch, the food was good, not great.  I asked for my poached eggs to be re-made because they were under cooked and the new order came out the same way with the whites still being runny.  I'm not sure it's worth going back for unless you can sit in the back garden.
