This is a really cute craft beer bar! The draft list is solid, and I was so happy to see the rotating dogfish line, and I will be back to check what new ones they put on next. The truffle fries are amazing, I love the parm chz they put on top- get them!!!!! Â :) Service was great, he definitely knew his beers and the manager even came over to check on us during dessert (cherry bomb fritters stuffed with nutella). Great little spot all around, especially if you're a beer nerd like me :-)
