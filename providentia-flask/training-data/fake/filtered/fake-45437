Tried this place today for the first time and I loved it! Healthy and delicious. The Chilled Cucumber soup is so fresh tasting and filled with yummy flavorful herbs. The bowl was nice and big and filling at only 87 calories for the whole serving! I loved my Naked Falafel Salad with grains and chick peas and yogurt dressing, it was like a much healthier deconstructed falafel platter. The staff is very friendly. They have wonderful looking smoothies and fresh squeezed juices and coffee as well as delicious looking desserts, my banana chocolate cookie was a little bit of heaven and very low calorie- like 80 or something, can't remember exactly. I definitely want to try the avocado chocolate cookie next time. Every item they have is displayed with calorie content and the portion sizes are hearty and filling. It's really nice to have this place in the neighborhood and I'm really excited to go back, probably tomorrow, but maybe later today... I want more of that cucumber soup...
