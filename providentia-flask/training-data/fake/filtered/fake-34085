This Tiffany's gets a zero star  rating from this family....Service wasnot very friendly. Coffe was served barely warm and was nuked only to bring it back again barely warmed.  Chicken wrap was soooo spicy it was inedible. Salads were good.  In summary, we will not be returning to this restaurant unless it's just for a beer at the sports bar.
