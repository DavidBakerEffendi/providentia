This is a cleverly designed restaurant that has the appearance of an old diner. Apparently menu varies from day to day. The Black Manhattan is a wonderful cocktail concoction. The music is deafening! Asked the waitress if they could turn the music down. She did. It lasted for about five minutes. If having your ear drums blasted out is the Williamsburg idea of a vibe then I'm over Williamsburg. The food here is great just don't expect to be able to talk to anyone at your table without screaming at them!
