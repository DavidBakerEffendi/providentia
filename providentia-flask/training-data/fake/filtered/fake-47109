Sorry. The food at the original place was tasty, inventive, and cheap. Here, the menu is limited and the food quality has declined significantly. The cooks are young hipsters and the chef is nowhere to be found. I ordered the smoked chicken and it was a half (literally) chicken with its head and feet attached. I lost my appetite immediately and requested they cut off the extremities. If they thought that presentation would look cool... NOT! It isn't fish. Â The chicken was warm and bland. Worst of all, the meals were expensive. Entrees (remember this is lunch, not dinner) range between $15-30, which is very steep. Not coming here again. Sorry, but you're not missing much people. What a disappointment!!!
