I love Balthazar, it continues to be, after all these years, me and my boyfriend's favorite date place (actually, I think Grammercy Tavern was our very favorite date place, but Balthazar is our regular, traditional date place..  we got engaged there!)  But anyway, you can always count on Balthazar for fabulous service and DELICIOUS oysters!!  it's not too casual, but not in the least bit fancy, it's pricey so it feels special, but it won't totally break your bank.  It's great late night at the last minute or for a more planned kind of thing..  in short, it's an old stand by..  go with some friends and order The Balthazar, you won't be sorry!
