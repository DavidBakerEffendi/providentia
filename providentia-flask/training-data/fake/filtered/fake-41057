Yeah!! It is that good! Went on saturday afternoon and waited just 3 minutes to be seated. Ordered a pepperoni large pie and it was truly delicious, with a thin crispy crust that was delightful!! Next time I'll order it plain though, for me the pepperoni was a distraction from the perfect cheese pie. Anyway, when in NYC it is a must to visit this place at least just once!! PS- Four slices didn't stop me from having an Italian Sausage sandwich just around the corner in Little Italy''s San Antonio's feast, from a street vendor, MMMMMMM!!!!!
