Can't say enough wonderful things about this restaurant. We recently had a bridal shower there and it was wonderful. Guests are still raving about it. We had about 65 guests and the waiters were able to more than handle it. Very accommodating!! Restaurant allows you to decorate and set up room to your preference without making you feel like you are hassling them. Â Although restaurant is laid back, they KNOW what they are doing and how to do a party the right way! Everything was perfect! Restaurant is a little older and not as updated as others however it is clean, has great food, and excellent service. Would recommend!!!
