Although I live a few blocks away from here, I have only been here a hand few of times.  The first time I went here, I was not a fan.  However, I have recently been here, and I have to say they have me hooked on their regular slice.  I've tried different entrees and slices, and they do not compare.  The staff seems fairly nice.   I also like that this is a good place to watch the game near the bar, sit down and eat with your family, or get a quick bite.
