The dumplings and potstickers are average and are a bit on the greasier side. Â Good thing is that they are very very cheap. Extremely cramped place, expect to eat on the park bench nearby as there are only seatings for four. The ordering process was extremely disorganized, had to repeat me and my friends' order several times, and even then, there were some items missing. Okay place, but there are more comfortable locations where you don't have to be packed in a tiny place for average food (but cheap) food.
