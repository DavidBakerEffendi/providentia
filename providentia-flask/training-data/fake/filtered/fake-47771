So good. So fresh. Somehow 5 people managed to eat 3 large pizza's... and we were all on "diets." I thought I was waiting in line at an amusement park. As frustrating as it may be, bring someone ahead of time to hold your hand and make sure you don't leave and remember me saying it's so worth the wait. This sign there says something like we are not responsible if you choke on seeds or pits? I thought this was a joke. That's the greeting I get after standing here like a jack a$$ all day? I'll translate it ahead of time.... OUR INGREDIENTS ARE SO FRESH THE PITS ARE STILL IN OUR OLIVES. Fresh mozzarella like you've never had before. That sign has really put a damper on all my other pizza experiences because now I search and search for it and understand why no where else can get away with it.
