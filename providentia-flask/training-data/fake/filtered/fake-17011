Do you like slow to non-existent service?  Waiting half an hour after being seated (Saturday evening, 5:30 pm) before one gets a glass of water?  Wait another half an hour before one has the water refilled?  An hour after seating before any food arrives?  If so, then this is the place for you!  Do you want to carry on a conversation?  The decibel level is high enough that I had to lean toward the person I was sitting with to hear over the din.  Try doing that for an hour while you wait for food.  The food is what you expect - tasty.  If you want an excuse to lean close to your dinner companion for an hour before you get to eat, this place is perfect.  But otherwise, look elsewhere.
