This place was a great time.  From the outside, you would never know how much character the inside of the space possesses.  The tapas were full of flavor and there was a big variety of choices.  The service was not only good, but had some personality and charisma to it.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the portion size, but besides that it was just about perfect.
