Can't rate the food as it took them 1 1/2 hours to deliver my order. When they showed up told my front desk to send them home. I could have walked there picked up my food and finished eating it by the time they showed up. Never wrote a review in my life but this I had to let people know. DON'T order from here if you are hungry. Always used Yelp to look up reviews but finally signed up so I could write this review. They don't even deserve 1 star but unfortunately it's not an option.
