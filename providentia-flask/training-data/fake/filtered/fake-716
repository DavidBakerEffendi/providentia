Greeting - yes Vibe- World War II Price- good Parking- good luck on street Bathroom- horrible- that faucet come on! Service- friendly yet in attentive Food Sausage app $10 tastes like breakfast links on over cooked red potatoes- skip it THE BURGER- huge, stacked high and only $12.50 in restaurant and $ 7.50 in bar for a scaled down version. The meat quality could be better. But overall yes one of the best burger deals ever. Lettuce and tomato and bacon on bottom bun. French onion rings on top. Nice dill pickle wedge. French fries are not good. I think they are flour coated fake crunch Dessert- skip the chocolate cakes. Not high end stuff. Drink beer not wine here WIGB? Yes for that crazy burger!
