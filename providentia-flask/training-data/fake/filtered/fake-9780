I feel really bad giving them just 2 stars as they just opened yesterday and today was their second day doing business but it was the worst service I have every experienced in my life! They did not have any of the 4 dishes that we ordered from their menu . 15 mins after taking our orders the waitress comes and tell us that the do not have more that half of the ingredients and stuff yet as they just opened . Since it was their second day we more that happily changed our order . The Shanghai fried noodle and Shanghai chow fun were bad , bland and tasted like paper. The noodles in hot peanut sauce was really good. The food came after a long wait and there was a very long wait for the bill to come plus we were charged for the order that we had placed before which they could not make . The cashier was then missing and the whole place by then was packed with people waiting to try out the brand new restaurant which delayed the bill sorting  process even more . I definitely want to give them a second chance and hopefully it not as chaotic and confusing as it was   the first time .
