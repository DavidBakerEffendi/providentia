This place is expensive but I'd have to say that is the only con. The macarons are phenomenal. My favorite would have to be orange blossom even though I could eat any flavor.  Spent $40 on my last trip here figuring I'd have a few that night and have the rest for when I had company over the next night.  That didn't work out because I ate them all and licked the crumbs out of the box ;)
