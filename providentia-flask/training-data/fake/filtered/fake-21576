In love with this place!! Everything, salad, sandwich, pastries... Tried almost the whole menu (even if they just changed it for winterish dishes) and I can't get enough of it! By far the Memo burger is the best burger I've tried EVER but other classics sandwiches like the "Chicken cashew" or "Vietnamese wonder" or the new "El Chamo" (really really good) are ALL worth the try! Really quality food! A 5 stars for the super friendly staff and the on point delivery (never had to complain about a thing)
