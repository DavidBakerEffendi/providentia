Only 1 star because i can't give them a ZERO!! Being that i live in town mom and i visited a few times. I wanted to share the experience with my BF at the time. I was so excited about returning because the food was good and the ice cream was a +. Â I had sat down to eat dinner with my BF and noticed something black in the coconut shrimp. When i pulled it out it was a full size dead COCKROACH. I was immediately nauseated because i had begun to eat from this dish. I called the employee over who returned with the manager and could you believe that they were giving me a hard time about refusing to pay!!!!. I walked out and never returned.
