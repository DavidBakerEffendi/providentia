As an avid sushi-addict who moved to Philly back in July I hadn't really discovered a must eat at sushi place until I visited Vic's. Upon walking into the restaurant you'll see an 8 seat sushi bar and probably a small crowd of people waiting for a seat. Try to go early and you might have no wait or just ask for an estimate on the wait. Takeout is excellent too though if you live in the neighborhood and don't feel like waiting. The staff is friendly, the fish is fresh, the place has a great vibe, and the people there will truly remember you after only a few visits.: The portions are large. Each of the regular rolls is stuffed to the maximum with fresh large chunks of fish. The 3 roll special is an excellent deal with 3 of the regular rolls for $10.99 which is absolutely a great deal. The special rolls are very creative, very generous portions, and include such stuffings as pineapple, coconut paste, mango, etc all of which are blended together into a large and masterful selection of rolls from which to choose. I highly recommend the i-Roll and the Tuna Dumplings (2 dumplings whose wrapper is sashimi tuna folded around a crabmeat and avocado mixture.
