Came here for happy hour and the live music. Great live music and happy hour specials. Also glanced at the menu, looks like quite a variety of choices. I did indulge in some bread while waiting for my drinks, and I must say the butter and bread served are great!!! Overall I will definitely be back to 27 Mix for dinner, but as far as atmosphere, drink specials and service this place fairs pretty well on my list.
