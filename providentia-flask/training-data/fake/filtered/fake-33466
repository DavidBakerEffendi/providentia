I want to like this place as it's so close to where I live, but I've tried it a few times and it's just not that great. The beer selection is decent, but the service has been pretty disinterested each time I've been there. Also, the bratwurst is tasty, but it's just so expensive! $8 just for a bratwurst in a pretzel bun is bad enough, but $6 for an order of fries!?? That's nearly $16 incl tax. Radegast hall does the same thing for $7! I dont want to feel like I'm being robbed when I go out for something to eat. It's a shame as it's such a great space, but I cant see how they are going to inspire any customer loyalty with these prices.
