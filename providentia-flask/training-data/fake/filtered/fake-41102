Sofia, how I love you! This is such an adorable little spot tucked away on 50th street....apparently the same owners as DeGrezia? Definitely cozy and intimate, with a dark interior lit by candlelight, and a seemingly secret back patio that I always forget about until after the fact.  They have small bites that are quite tasty - I usually go for the meatballs and the bresaola carpaccio, and have never been disappointed! The meatballs are moist and plump, with a perfectly seasoned red sauce, and the carpaccio is just what it should be.  Perfectly and lightly dressed arugula over not too thinly sliced bresaola with some parmesan shavings. Yum! To more important things - the wine.  The wine list here is great! They have so many wines by the glass that it's hard to choose, but that's fine because the bartenders will usually give you a taste of whatever you like.  If you're feeling like a baller, they also have some reserve wines by the bottle....Gajas and the like. Go here!
