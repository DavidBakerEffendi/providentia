One of the people in our group always passed Cuban Petes and have been wanting to try it out.  The five of us hopped into the car but on the way we got our tire shredded from something on the road, and had to change the tire (on the highway - it sucked). We were determined to have a fun night and not let a bad event deter our plans, so we kept going.   When we got there the place seemed closed, but we walked toward the back to make sure - when someone waves us in.  Tthere was good news and bad news.   The bad news was the cooked had left and they were closing. The good news was - they served us anyway.  The owner was super nice and told us that he couldn't turn anyone that came to the restaurant away. The sangria and food was awesome.   We had ribs, grilled chicken, stewed chicken, plantains, ground beef, beans and rice.  (They just brought out food for us so we don't know if the items were on the menu) All of the food was great and the atmosphere is worth the trip.  The place feels like you get transported to Cuba.  Plus the place was very clean. To keep it short: I am looking forward to going back to Cuban Pete's.  Everyone is super nice,  the service is great, atmosphere is beautiful, and food is tasty.
