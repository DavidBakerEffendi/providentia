After searching around fairfield county for the best burger I decided to try, plan b, sbc, archie moores and so on. Everywhere I went things were good but I have to say the service at plan B was bad. The burger came out well done and I asked for it medium rare. I told my waitress Liz about the issue and she didn't seem to care. She took my order, brought out the food and vanished until check time. When I explained about my bad burger she didnt seem to help with my issue.
