Why people wait in line for an hour or more to go to Mo's is a mystery to me.  Home fries to die for?  They are always undercooked, and that crispy stuff that some reviewers have referred to in a positive way, is black and gritty (like getting sand in your home fries).  The eggs are pretty good; nothing special.  The pancakes are usually what everyone raves about.  They come off the griddle looking as if someone picked them apart with their fingers.  Maybe some people see that as "charming," I think it is totally unappetizing.  So-so food, low quality ingredients (juice from a can), not so clean, and spotty service make this place the worst "best" breakfast place I have ever been too.
