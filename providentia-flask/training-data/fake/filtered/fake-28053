I visited Philadelphia in August of 2012 and contacted a local yelper for suggestions.  Being from California not knowing what humidity is about thought I would wonder about the streets and try one of the eateries on my list.  As the day was coming to an end and spending hours walking in the hot sun with temperatures exceeding what felt like 115 degrees I staggered into Amada after noticing what street I was on.  I said to myself "Self, this street name looks familiar from my list of Must Try while in Phili" I was early; they were setting up for the nights agenda.  They welcomed me in seeing that I was parched, stumbling, dehydrated, and semi lethargic.  The staff was gracious and obliging.  Explaining that they made my top ten list they were excited to introduce the menu of drinks and food.  The chef came out from the kitchen to welcome me, chatted a bit and he suggested the Chefs' selection, I believe thats what he called it.  Several tapas style courses paired with wine. Double-D-licious. I would compare this meal to an experience like no other.  Like sitting with your feet in the sand watching the sun slowly set as it has over the past few millennia, taking its place below the heavens and its bright rays loosing themselves as they fall below the crest of the ocean with the gentle breeze that brings a taste of salt on your lips and the soft sounds of the pacific tenderly and rhythmically bringing you to a place of peaceful solitude. I wish I could remember what I ate; all I remember is cured meats, delicate cheese, various berries, olives, and nuts coming out in droves of courses.    I had a coworker visit Philadelphia recently and he asked for some places to visit and eat.  This reminded me of my visit and I decided to write a 2 year reminisce that was well over due.
