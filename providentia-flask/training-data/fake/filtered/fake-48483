Hands down the best cheese steak.  I've had all the other ones inlcuding Geno's, Jim's, Steve's, etc.  You have to get it Wiz Wit (cheese whiz, and with fried onions) and it's the best.  Their cheese fries is also excellent. The lines are long if you go prime time, but sometimes it can be long even at late nights.  Must bring cash!  The parking can be horrible at times and it's the the nicest neighborhood so I would go with friends definitely.
