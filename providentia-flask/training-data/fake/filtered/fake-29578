After waiting all summer to finally have the family together to go and visit this place we were ALL disappointed.  Yup, from the nine year old to the 48 year old.  We all ordered the fried chicken and upon first looking at it it looked barely fried.  I like golden-to-brown fried chicken, not blonde warmed up "fried" chicken.  The biscuits looked good but they were hard and dry.  My sister ordered mac n cheese and the server did not warn her that it would come with a splash of hot sauce, nor did she warn her that it would not be hot when it got to the table.  Upon cutting into the chicken, my husband found it was pinkish and the bone tips were red...not exactly deadly but definitely not appetizing either.  We were so sad and disappointed.  We drove all the way down from the BX and were looking forward to a great meal.  I wish I could say there will be a next time but the yummy, however salty, hushpuppies could never replace humdrum fried chicken.
