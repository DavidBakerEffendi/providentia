My wife and I decided to try this place after our inlaws' experience a few weeks ago. I'm south-Indian (my wife is a blue-eyed devil) and wanted to see how authentic a dosa place was that served western fillings was. I ordered samosas and the classic masala dosa and my wife the sada dosa not realizing that this was a dosa with nothing in it. We asked them to modify it by adding the potato filling to it but the person at the counter said they would make a new masala dosa for her at no charge! Both of us enjoyed our dosas but the chutneys were bland. the coconut chutney wasn't that coconutty and the coriander didn't have an kick. the samosas were excellent; they tasted like they were baked not deep fried. Overall it was a positive experience and we'd go again, but try the dosas with the sambaar instead.
