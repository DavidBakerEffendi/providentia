Excellent food, good ambiance and service, and clean !! We are a family of vegetarians and a non vegetarian, and have visited this restaurant quite a few times. Every time is a home run. No let downs. The food is excellent, the desserts are good and the chaat selection is awesome. The kids and adults all have ample amount of choices, be it buffet or a'la carte. Would definitely recommend Â  Try it once even if you are a sceptic!!
