Pickleback shots have become all the rage, lately.  But you have not had one until you've had it here!! Other bars that use regular pickle juice, disgust me.  The McClure's pickle juice is the ONLY way to go.  I could drink them at Sweet Afton til I drop dead.  The pickle martini is also solid. The burger here is also the best in the neighborhood.  Way better than bare burger.  Excellent beer selection, too, and fun bar crowd during the weekend.
