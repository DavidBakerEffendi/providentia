My friends and i sat down by the emergency exit, which must have been a sign.  It was packed and noisy.  Finally, a very confused and hard to understand busboy came over we could not figure out if he was checking up on us or taking a drink order.  A waitress came over about 15 minutes after that.  We ordered.  My iced tea came in a filthy plastic blue cup that looked like it was partially ingested by a Great White Shark.  It was scratched, filthy and had a chip missing.  Buy some glasses!  It's 2012, you can get them at the 99 cent store!  They never bothered to see if the three of us had utensils, so I had to get some from an empty table, since the waitress never came back.  Their menu is way too big and most of the items are the same.  Why the complexity?  This place would give Gordon Ramsay a stroke.  The burger was an oversized, dry mess that fell apart.  My friends were disappointed with their food, but we ate it because we knew that waitress would never come back.   The Woulia Boulia salad is 98 percent shredded cheese out of a bag.  Even after the place had cleared out, we had to wait an eternity for our check.  It was barely legible.   This place is only in business because of the tourists.  Low quality food for drunks.  You're better off cooking for yourself.  At least you'll eat on time.  Never again.
