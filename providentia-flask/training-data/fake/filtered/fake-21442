Everyone else seems to love this place so it must just really suck at lunchtime.  It's like a Chipotle model, but more confusing and they are really snappy at you if you ask them any questions.  I asked him if there was a way for me to get vine leaves, and the hummus and falafel and he gave me a dirty look and said those are two different things.  I said I know they're different...but is it possible to order those things.  That's what I would like.  And he said well it's in small medium or large.  And I said...ok get me a SMALL of those things!  Which he finally did...but he forgot to give me the pita with my hummus!
