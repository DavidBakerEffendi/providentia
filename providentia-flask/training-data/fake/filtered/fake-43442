I have been enjoying park lane's pizza for many years.  Jimmy always knows everybody by name, he is very  friendly and I have always enjoyed the pizza and grinders. I admit the place might need a redo but to me what counts is the food and the staff.  The sausage pizza and Hot Roast Beef grinders are my favorite's.  i have had other pizza's from other restaurants but I always keep coming back to Park lane. Hey Good food, good friends and fair prices.  if you don't like it be polite and say why don't criticize someone just becaues your not happy.  Jimmy and staff will always go out of their way to make sure you enjoy the food after all it has lasted over 35 years and is going strong so it has to be good.
