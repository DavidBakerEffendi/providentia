You see how this is going, right? I see a food joint on TV, drool as I watch and have to eat there. Day 4 of our vacation we are still in Philly and I have to go to Tommy DiNic's which is also at the Reading Terminal Market. As we ate our Miller's Twist breakfast on our first morning, we sat at a table next to DiNic's. Everyone working there was very friendly and said we should come back. Now, let me mention that we did walk by on Day 3 for lunch...but we were beyond hungry and could not handle waiting in the line. So on this day, I was prepared to wait as long as possible for my Roast Pork sandwich with Broccoli Rabe and Provolone cheese. I got in line and waited 30 minutes for my scrumptious sandwich. For me, what makes a perfect sandwich is the roll. DiNic's has their Italian rolls delivered fresh daily from a local bakery. It is crusty on the outside and soft on the inside. The pork is dunked in jus then placed in the roll. The broccoli rabe is slightly bitter and cooked in olive oil and garlic. The nuttiness of the sharp provolone was amazing. I love sharp cheese, the sharper the better, so this was perfect for me but too strong for the hubby.
