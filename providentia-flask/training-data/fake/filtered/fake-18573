I actually found this place on Yelp! Soooooo, when first walking in, I noticed that the majority of the patrons were 50+ (I'm 27) So I was like.. ok. But we got seated for lunch by a very friendly hostess, and our waiter was very attentive with all our needs. The food was great too! I got the pulled pork sandwich. And their local brews were very good. Would definitely come back again.
