ad vocem Sopia T's review: I don't really know if they served Apfelstrudel in concentration camps. Or at least not on a daily basis. And if they did, I'm sure it was so stale that it must've sparked riots, or something... Anyway, this is just a speculation on my part, as I was never exeptionally strong in history (I'm sure Sopia T can relate). On a different note: I totally understand that no NYC restaurant will let you hold a table if there are people waiting in line and you're not ordering. It's not even a question of protocol, it's common courtesy on the guest's part, for Christs sake! Also, I'm a frequent guest at Sabarsky and I consider equating the house policy of the restaurant to the Nazi party line as low, untactful and insultng. I'm really hoping that Sopia T. will keep her word and never come to Sabarsky again.
