The best food we've had since arriving in NY!!! Atmosphere is beautiful - spaciousness and really well lit while remaining cozy and warm. Wonderful and attentive service. I highly recommend the chicken appetiser - so amazingly tender with subtle interesting flavours. Apparently it's free range organic and you can really notice the difference. Definitely miles above your average middle-eastern dining experience. Highly recommended!!!
