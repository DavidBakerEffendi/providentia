Good thing for the hood--all the basics, w/0 much pretense (ok maybe a little). Been here about 7 times now, great food almost every time. Killer: butternut squash & pumpkin seed salad has a great balance of sweet flavor n savory tang, curried parsnip wuz luscious. Nice: coffee and bread. Desserts are revolving but you can stumble on awesome ones. Marinated tofu sandwich and chicken asparagus salad were just ok. Very low-key vibe, tables are made of bowling-alley floors if you look close.
