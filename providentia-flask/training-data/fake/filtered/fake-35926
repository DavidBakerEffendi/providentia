This was my second visit, the first having been many years ago when it first opened.  Let me state that my 2 star review is not a reflection on the quality of the food (still wonderful) or the service (excellent).  First, the wait in the outdoor space.  I was very excited to share the salumi and cheeses, and a rosato, with my 3 guests, but was immediately disturbed by cigarette smoke, plus cigar, CIGA,!!, smoke.  I know it is legal and all but get real. Why should the suicidal desires of the obnoxious few get to infringe on my experience?  Now on to the interior, where the music was playing so loud that it was virtually impossible to have a conversation with my friends.  At one point it was so loud that the speakers were distorting.  I am not one to complain normally, as I was weaned on rock and roll, but I save my ears for the concert hall and prefer to enjoy my dinners in relative peace.  Unless these issues are addressed I would never return to what is otherwise a terrific eating spot.
