I love eating here!  I wish they delivered but still i am satisfied.  Walking in the place immediately captivates you with such an enticing smell!  I always want to order 3 or 4 things.  Their food is excellent.   Sorry to the people who got sick, I think it's something that is impossible to avoid.  I've had food poisoning once too from a food place but not from here.
