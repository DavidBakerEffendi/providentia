All week we kept hearing about this bacon fest, now being a full bred American, we were more than excited. We started talking about all the different possibilities. (I.e. Having bacon strips instead of bread at the table, being greeted with a bacon strip when you walked in, and even down to the bacon flavored beer! We heard about the "festival" and figured it would be packed so took the train in, instead of driving. This was going to be an epic event that we could only dream of. But no. It was a huge disappointment!!! We ordered loaded nachos with bacon... The bacon was bacon bites, literally!! We laughed then tried again. Bacon cheese burger sliders, again bacon bites. Lastly we tried asking for a plate of bacon, willing to pay the price... The waitress said she did not have any bacon in the house. This was a Saturday we were looking forward to and wanted to remember. For the BACON! So we left quickly and went back to the house, wrapped hotdogs in bacon, made cheese sauce, and drank bacon beer. It's sad we were able to throw it better in a few minutes than Nicks old roast beef could and they advertised it!!!
