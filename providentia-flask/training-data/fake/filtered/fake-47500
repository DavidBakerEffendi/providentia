We all know that it does not matter how good your product is if your service hits rock bottom....bye, bye Grimaldi's. Today I was amazingly disappointed and totally turned off to this once admired and once consider gem of Brooklyn. One of the best and worst parts of a Grimaldi's "day" is the famous line that can last as long as an hour or more (even for take out!). Nonetheless for those who have survived their first wait for Grimaldi's pizza, they learn that it's essentially worth the wait. Even for a guy like me who hates lines and thinks nothing is worth the lost time. Today I have to say was my last visit to Grimaldi's forever. The only solace in the wait for a place like Grimaldi's is the perception that the line is a great equalizer, of the people for the people. Of course with the number of signed autographed pictures on the walls one has to assume that Angelina Jolie or another pretty or recognizable face might skirt passed the grimacing doorman. However, Grimaldi's may have great pizza, but it's not a nightclub nor a a place to be seen. Well after waiting an hour in line, and being second to the front, I witnessed a family exit a limousine and after a little nudging (probably to the tune of $100 or so to the grimacing doorman) they were able to cut the entire line and be seated within minutes of their arrival. Well if this is the kind of place Grimaldi's is, or has become, then their days are limited. Grimaldi's is no longer worth the wait, and it is certainly not worth a $100 a pie. Don't make the trip and don't waste your hard earned money and even more precious time at a place like this. Hedge fund managers and overpaid CEO's might be able to cut the line with their plump children and wives, but they cannot keep a place like this in business. Besides their single unisex bathroom leaves ladies a little sketched out and puts everyone in a second long line!!! Two thumbs down, and Grimaldi's Shame On You.
