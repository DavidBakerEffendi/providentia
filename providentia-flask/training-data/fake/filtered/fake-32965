Octopus is our favorite dish.  The meat is tender and soft, almost melt in your mouth sort.  My husband and I purchase Mompou gift certificate on restaurant.com as a way to save money.   There is really nothing negative about the restaurant based on our experience.  We like this place and definitely we will go there many more times.
