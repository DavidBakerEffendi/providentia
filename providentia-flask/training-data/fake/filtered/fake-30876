This was a great experience! It was my first time going today and I really enjoyed myself! The whole restaurant had a comfortable feeling and the service was great. I only got to try the pulled pork, but it was divine along with the sweet potato pudding and the amazing mac and cheese. On top of everything I must say the FunniBonz BBQ sauce was the best part. It tasted good on everything. I was glad to see that this new restaurant was busy and had a good vibe. All and all I would definitely recommend FunniBonz for a family night out.
