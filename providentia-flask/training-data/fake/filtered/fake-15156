The sushi here is all right. Nothing too special. The biggest reason I'm knocking this down to a 3-star was for the pricing. Yelp says it's only $$ but as far as sushi goes I'd give it $$$. $3 for miso soup which we all know is essentially broth in a bowl seems completely outrageous to me. and the simple rolls were all at least $5-$9. But I guess that's philly for you. Lastly, when we ran out of drinks, they didn't get around to refilling them until after we had already finished eating.
