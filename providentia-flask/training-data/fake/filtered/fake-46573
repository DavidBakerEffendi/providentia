Food: fantastic! Service: Worse I have had in my career in the food and bev industry. I understand this is a busy restaurant, and I understand the "turn and burn" mentality. But we came in at 9:45 (kitchen is open till midnight) and there were tables to spare, so it wasn't like she needed the table. My boyfriend and I literally live across the street, and we dine out at least 4 times a week so we don't always want to travel far. We had the duck and the steak with a side of roasted corn and radicchio Â for dinner. The food was fantastic! Carolina (our server) was extremely unprofessional and rushed us through the entire meal. (no stars for service) I have been in the food & bev industry for 20 years and have never experienced this kind of service. Our main course came before we were done with our appetizer. The moment I set down my fork my plate disappeared like a magic trick. We ordered a bottle of wine and it was practically poured out immediately (glass was way too full). She pushed us to order dessert immediately after we were done with our meal, even after I said we wanted to wait a min. she hovered and came back three times till I gave in just to get her away. Then dropped the check when we had full glasses of wine and came back at least 5 times while we were trying to enjoy it and flipped through the book looking for our credit card. I have NEVER thrown someone under the bus like this in the industry, but we were honestly that offended with how poorly we were treated.
