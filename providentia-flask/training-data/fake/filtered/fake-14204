One of the most underrated burgers in Manhattan and a good pint of Guiness. My gf had the cottage pie there recently and hasnt stopped talking about it. Bar staff are very friendly and a great photo of the winning St Marys SCT 2002 team on the left when you enter. Feels like a genuine irish pub, great fireplace too.
