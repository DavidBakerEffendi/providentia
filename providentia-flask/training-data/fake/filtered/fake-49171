Management is unprofessional! I left my glasses behind and when I went back to get them the waitress told me she handed them to the host. When the evening host went to ask around to the host who were there in the afternoon they told her they misplaced them.   When I asked to speak to the manager he told me he didn't have time to find any glasses because he was busy. Very unprofessional! If items are being passed from one employee to the other and suddenly disappearing or being "misplaced" then what does that tell you about the integrity of the employees? What else can they misplace, your debit card, your cash? Has anyone ever heard of lost and found drawer? Perhaps they need to check employees pocketbooks.  This place is also over rated and over priced.
