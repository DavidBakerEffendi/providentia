Place looks nice and is therefore popular but the food is mediocre at best and the service is TERRIBLE. Went in the middle of the day on a saturday when there were only 3 other tables. It took over an hour and a half to get our food and they did not even come to fill our waters. My boyfriend, who is Thai, and I agreed that the curry flavors were way WAY off balance and consistency completely wrong. If you want a trendy place to go out and are not interested in good authentic Thai food, this is the place. Definitely will not go back.
