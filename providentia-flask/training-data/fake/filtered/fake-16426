One word for Jackson hole Racist when we got there they set us at a table that was not even dry from cleaning it,second I asked for my burger to be well done and they brought it undercooked they took it back an put it back on the grill with the ketchup an cheese that was nasty to me,plus they never came back to the table to check on us an make sure everything was ok ,the service sucks,and they cater to white pple better then blacks
