I have been coming to clevenland's for almost 10 years now, i have seen the owners change bartenders for younger ones over the years which i understand for the crowd they want.  I have recently been there and i see they hired a new manager, this person used to work at cloverleaf, i don't understand how an owner puts a policy that the bartenders are no longer allowed to have a drink with the patrons but the manager can drink the entire night.  i don't come here just for the drink (there are plenty of bars in the area), i enjoy the company of the bartenders and the professionalism.
