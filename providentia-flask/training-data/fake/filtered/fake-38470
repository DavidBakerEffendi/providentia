Kelso Dining is an incredible dining experience. On Saturday, my BFF suggested that we have lunch at Kelso as she had heard of it through a friend.  I ordered the rice and peas with Oxtails.  The meal was so delicious that while eating I threw my head back and said "yessss"!!! :) It was the the taste I had hoped for. The rice and peas was amazing. I enjoy rice and peas with a hint of coconut and Kelso did not disappoint that my toes actually curled as I enjoyed every grain o rice.  The oxtails were incredibly tender and the gravy was sufficient for the rice. The salad was visually pleasing and tasty(even without dressing). The fried plantains were delicious.  My drink was bottled ginger beer that pulled everything together nicely. All in all, Kelso's bright decor, music, friendly staff, light hearted customers and yes, their delicious food helped me enjoy my Saturday with my BFF!!. Thanks Kelso!!!. I recommend Kelso for a delicious dining experience!!
