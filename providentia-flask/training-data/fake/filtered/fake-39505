Blissed out. Best service, kindest people, gorgeous selection of prepared food and made-to-order food, (egg dishes, sandwiches, salads,) baked goods and great coffee. No wonder that while this new-and-improved Manny's has been open only a week, there is already a steady stream of customers. The atmosphere is inviting: soft music, warm, vintage-y decor, a peaceful backyard and lots of light. Plus, Michael the owner has a crazy generous spirit and wants people to call this place home. You got it, friend! I'm feeling the love!
