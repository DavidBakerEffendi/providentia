Mmmmmmmm, Taking a breathe and saying wow where has NY style pizza doing in Wethersfield. It delicious and crispy thin. Its What i haven't found in CT. I had the pizza delivered to my door in 30mins. The person on the phone was very helpful and recommend items on the menu as well. The menu doesn't end at all. I would recommend Pietro's Pizza to all my peers.
