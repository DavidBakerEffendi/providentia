I have never been moved to write a review, good or bad, about a place until now. Was visiting friends in NJ and they suggested we try this new place in Trenton. All sounded well until we actually got there and the entire night took a turn for the worst....the absolute worst. Our server, a young woman in her 20's who never gave us her name, had few answers for our questions about the menu and spent most of the evening drinking soda and mingling with her co-workers. When we finally figured out things on our own and placed an order that's when it really hit the fan. Â The "giant" meatball we ordered as an app was hardly bigger than you'll find alongside your pasta anywhere else and was nearly ice cold. The other apps, the calamari and the mussels, were both rubbery and without any distinguishable flavor. It could only get better from here, right? Wrong! Dinner arrived after a 30 minute gap between the first course and my tilapia was presented to me in parchment paper that was burnt through on the bottom, so needless to say the fish was bone dry. My friend's steak was overcooked and his wife's pasta resembled something I last came across in college at the campus cafeteria. Add to it that a cover band was now playing at volumes that made it impossible to even speak to one another and well.....I think you get the picture. Total cost for this train wreck experience, $200+. AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THE PLAGUE!
