Pylos is probably my favorite restaurant in the East Village.  Food is outstanding and the decor and ambiance is simply delightful.  We drank wine based on the recommendations of the server and were not disappointed.  Portions are large, seating is tight and you better have a reservation because it gets packed very quickly.  I've actually been here without one early and been asked to eat quickly to make room for the push but we weren't offended by that whatsoever and completely understood.  Could they be a little nicer at the door?? Sure... but that being said it still deserves 5 stars with the experience we've had time and time again.  Well done Pylos!
