Delicious, inventive, and all-vegan. My girlfriend and I split six different small plates and none disappointed. Excellent cocktail list. I had the Escape Velocity, which tasted like boot leather (in the best sense) and she had the East of Eden. We then had a few of their craft beers over dinner, and then had a Done and Dusted to finish out the night. Affordable and fun. The ambience was great except they had kung-fu films projected onto a curtain along one of the long side walls and it was a little distracting. I get it but perhaps slowly changing images would be a little more soothing. Either way, I'd surely go back!
