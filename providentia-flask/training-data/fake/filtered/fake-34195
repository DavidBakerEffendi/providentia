We went to this restuarant after the theatre for a light meal. I read that the food was good and always eager to find a good sushi restuarant, we decided to give it try. We were invited in and we asked to sit at the sushi bar. Food was ok but the service and the experience was horrifying. We were not told that the restuarant was closing until the food was put in front of us and then rushed through out the meal. In addition the staff was rude and insulting in ways that I never expreienced in a restuarant before. It actually made me sick to my stomache. I will never forget this dining experience. I am 50 years old and was at the restuarant with my date. The Sushi chef at the front of the bar took it upon himself to snicker at us, talk to the waitress in japonese while indicating he was talking about us and, the final blow, he asked me if I was my dates mother!!!! All this unprovoked. I was so insulted and shocked that I didn't know what to say. It upset me for the whole night. It was a mean comment for no reason at all. We just went there to have a bite and enjoy ourselves after a show. I mean even if I was old, ugly or whatever, which i am not, how could this sort of behavior be justified??? So I will never forget this expereince and will never recommend this place to anyone. This place sucked.
