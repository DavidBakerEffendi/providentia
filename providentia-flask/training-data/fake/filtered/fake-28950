Outstanding beer selection, great atmosphere and welcoming staff. After abstract disappointment in the New Haven bar scene last week I was fortunate enough to wonder into the Cask Republic last night. Even though they were hosting an event and much of the tables were reserved we were able to belly up to the bar, where despite being in the process of pouring what seemed to be a hundred beers at a time, the bartender took the time to go over the menu and offer us samples. He was a little difficult to understand, but knowledgeable, firiendly and helpful. Didn't get a chance to try the food, but I will certainly be back. Â  This was hands down the best bar experience I've had in this town!
