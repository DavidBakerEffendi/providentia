My first ever time on Yelp with my own account and 5 stars goes to Paisanos!  Everything is great there.  The bread was fresh.  My caesar salad was cold and crisp and the dressing tasted homemade.  I ordered the Crab Ravioli and the Mrs had Chicken Parmigiana.  We swapped a little and both were fantastic but the Crab Ravioli was absolutely superb.  Too much food to squeeze in dessert so we will have to go back again soon.
