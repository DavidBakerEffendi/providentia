From the outside, you're like DUDE, but once you're inside it's like DUUUUDDEEEE. And when you try the food you're going to be like DUUUUUUUDDDDDDDEEEEEEEEE. I highly recommend that food with the thing on the plate, it also comes with a free fork and knife, and side of napkin. Unfortunately all the drinks come in liquid form, but good thing the ice is free.
