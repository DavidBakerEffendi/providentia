I had their coconut bubble tea, it was horrible. But boba was hard as if it had been out for days, and the tea it self tasted burnt and it was barley sweetened. I was disappointed to know that they did not serve warm bubble tea, since it is cold outside. Many other bubble tea places that I have tried have been much better, for a better price, and have had both hot and cold bubble tea options. I did not try anything else in the restaurant but the place did smell nice and was very nicely decorated.
