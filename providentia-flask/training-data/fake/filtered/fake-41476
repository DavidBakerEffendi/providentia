Warning: Big problems at Fuji Mountain. Normally, I would agree with the majority of reviews listed, however I will no longer be a patron of Fuji Mountain. My friends and I have been going there for over 2 years, at least once a month. Around April or May I was served undercooked chicken but didn't make much of it besides sending it back since I like well done chicken. In hindsight this was actually the first step on a downward spiral of quality that bottomed out on June 25, 2011. I usually eat there later in the evening after 10 pm, on this night I was there around 11 pm and ordered a salad, soup and 3 rolls. After eating my salad (which barely covered the small plate it was served on) I moved onto my unfortunately lukewarm Miso soup. Already I was feeling this was not on par with the quality of my regular visits. The never-will-visit-again moment occurred more than a few spoonfuls into the soup, when I luckily noticed a medium sized black COCKROACH had risen to the surface of my soup bowl. It must have died fairly recently because at first I thought it was still alive. Having worked in the food industry myself, this would be a 10/10 on an unacceptable scale. My friend and I were both shocked and disgusted. I took the soup and cockroach over to the waitress who gave me a "sorry." After her confused look I proceeded to exit the building, never to return. I'm not sure what's going on over at Fuji Mountain, but I wouldn't recommend finding out. Just a note. Prior to this post I had used Yelp but had not posted myself. Since this event occurred I felt that this issue needed to be addressed.
