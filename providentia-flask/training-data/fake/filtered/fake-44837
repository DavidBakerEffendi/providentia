Food is not great, nothing was hot when served and everything was a little underseasoned. Coffee is average at best, they don't really know how to make good espresso drinks. Service was horrible. We had two different servers both coming over to our table repeatedly asking for our drink order and if we were ready to order food. They obviously weren't communicating with each other at all. One guy dropped the check book standing up in between my husband and I while we were still eating! There were other empty tables in the dining room so there was no reason to make us feel like we needed to rush out of there. All it will take is one good cafe in west philly serving well made espresso drinks and great food and this place will be gone if it doesn't step up it's game. Two stars because the atmosphere itself was fine and it's close to my apartment.
