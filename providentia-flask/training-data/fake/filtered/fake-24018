Breath of fresh air! Went to Woodys last week and there was a new waitress there, unfortunately do not recall her name, but blonde lol. She was youthful and exuberant and very funny. Good addition to a very good bar. I promise I'll get her name next time :). Love the wings btw and the sweet potato fries. Not good for my waistline but then again neither is the beer lol.
