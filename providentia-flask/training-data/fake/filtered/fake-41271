I know nothing about their pancakes but I went there for dinner and there is nothing bad I can say about this place.  I had Mahi Mahi and my wife had the spicy shrimp special.  My wife couldn't stop talking about the shrimp and I about the Mahi Mahi. It tasted soooo good. Cooked just right and just the correct amount of spices and decent portions.  Service was fast and prices were reasonable. There was plenty of parking on the local streets. The only negative is that it is cash only but I could live with that.
