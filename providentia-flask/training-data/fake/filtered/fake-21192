I, like the young lady who got sick because of lack of willingness to accommodate modificartions, experienced underrcooked chicken, overcooked pasta, and not such a friendly bartender.. had asked for some simple modifications to my order and was flat out told no, the chef does not modify that is the way he serves it (quote unquote) they just opened.. may give it another try down the road.. lonnnng after they have time to get the kinks out. but with all the fabulous restaurants on the upper eastside, ristorante morini, vico, sette mezzo, campangola, cafe bolud, daniel and so forth.. it may be some time.
