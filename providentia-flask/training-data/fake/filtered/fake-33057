I have been to Guayoyo several times, the place has a warm spacious and vibrant Latin atmosphere with great Latin music. The organic house wine is crispy at a low price.  The sesame ginger dressing is the best I have ever try. My favorite arepa is the reina pepiada with chicken salad and avocados, the asado negro is deliciously served with platanos maduros, black beans and white rice. The guayoyo is  aromatic an delicious. I will definately be back with friends!!
