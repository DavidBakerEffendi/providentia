When I moved to Monmouth Junction from New Brunswick it was really hard to find a place that could compete with Flippos in New Brunswick., But after a few dissappointing Â pizza deliverys, BAM!!!!! there it was, Pizza Delizia. Best place around. It even gives New Brunswck Pizza places a run for their money. LOVE IT!
