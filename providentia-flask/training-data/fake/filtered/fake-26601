This place is fantastic.  We stumbled in here while walking in the neighborhood and we could not be more impressed.  The food is excellent -- very authentic and very fresh.  Really loved the shawarma and falafel...and all of the sides were delicious.  Highly recommend the Katanchik (sp?) juice drink, as well.  The staff was super friendly and helpful.  The decor is great, too -- very clean and spacious.  Definitely going to return multiple times.
