I went to this place months ago and we ate something called POUTIN, basically, duck fat and cheese or something on top of fries. It was really good and the only thing I remember eating. So we went back on Friday since we wanted more. The place was dead because it was only 6:30. One problem w/ this place is they think it's upscale and the hostesses/hosts are very snobby. Grow up. You are in Montclair. I don't know where you think you are. We sit down, read the menus and the poutin is no where to be found. Neither are any of the sandwiches from the bar menu. I asked if we could have the bar menu, the one on their website and the one listed w/ the poutin on it. They say, "Oh, we don't offer those anymore." OH, COOL. Maybe think about UPDATING YOUR MENU ON YOUR WEBSITE. So we have two waiters, one is training the other. Fine. I order a cappuccino. It arrives warm. The sugar won't even melt in it. I drink it anyway. My boyfriend orders a beer, first one they don't have that's very popular, so they give him a substitute. We start reading our menus and notice flies buzzing around us. That's fine. I swat them away. They're small flies. Throughout the next ten minutes they are EVERYWHERE. Not regular flies, FRUIT FLIES. That is DISGUSTING. There was no food around us, there was no one sitting within 5 FEET OF US. I was grossed out. Everything on the menu looked ridiculously unappealing. We told the waiter we were going to pay for our drinks and leave because the menu was unappealing and told him about the flies. He does not care. He just gives us our bill. Doesn't offer any explanation or apology. Needless to say, they did not receive a tip. I will never return. THIS PLACE IS GROSS.
