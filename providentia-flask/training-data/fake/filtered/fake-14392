I went here about a week ago with a few friends. We waited at the bar for a little while before we sat. Beer list was Impressive. A good selection of drafts and cans. As well as a lot of local beers. We started out with a few apps. Cornbread was really good; crispy around d the edges yet moist. And the duck board was also good. It conms with three seasonal sauces some sweet and tangy. We also got the deviled eggs and the salmon hash. Both were good but not to impressed. Thought the eggs could have used a little more flavor. We ordered the tasting menu for dinner. Which gives you a ton of food!! The brisket was cooked perfectly and had a great smokey flavor. I really enjoyed it. We were given multiple BBQ sauces, the spicy one was my favorite, but all equally as good. With the tasting you also get one of every side. The potato salad was cooked traditionally. The bacon vinaigrette made the dish. The sauerkraut was very flavorful you can really taste the Cloves and coleslaw was very fresh. Overall I had a good experience and will be back.
