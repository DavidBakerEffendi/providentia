Nothing like being chewed out by the owner. I have been here many times but this time and the time before I ordered a cheese sandwich. When I got it back to work I couldn't believe there were only a few slices of cheese. When I called and spoke to the owner he yelled at me. I will never go back. What a jerk. Other times I had eaten here the food seemed like it was last week as it was tough and tasteless.
