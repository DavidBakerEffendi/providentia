Unlike Kathy's experience, our service was nothing short of professional, prompt, and well...perfect (thanks Bryan). I'm not giving 5 stars simply because of the stellar service however, as the rating on this site is not intended as a waitstaff rating. You win some, you lose some. We got a good one. Let's keep this in perspective. This is an Irish Pub. In this category, The Shannon Rose is 5 stars from the parking lot and all the way throughout. You'll absolutely fall in love with the exterior/interior design. Does this place have 10 stars for that? The menu has something for everyone, is reasonably priced, and the food was very good. We started off with Potato skins. They were a Â little pricey for the quantity, but the quality made up for it. I had the Shepard's Pie (delicious) and my wife had the meatloaf sliders. We ended with the Chocolate Peanut butter cake. OMG. That cake was amazing! The drink menu looked pretty good although I didn't have the chance to sample anything that night. The atmosphere was great. It was noisy, but the fun kind of noise where everyone sounded like they were having a good time. The sound system kicked in as we were finishing up dinner. It was pretty loud and it rocked the house. Our 10mos old daughter started dancing in her seat. It was pretty cool. Anyway...go check this place out. While everyone has their own preferences, I've ate and drank at enough places in my life to have no problem telling you that this place is definitely worth a try.
