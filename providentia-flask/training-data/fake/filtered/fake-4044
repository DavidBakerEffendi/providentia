This place kills me, and magically brings me back to life every time I eat there! Â Five Leaves is easily one of the top 3 eateries in Brooklyn- maybe in the whole of NYC. Their Pavlova literally changed my life. LIT-ER-AL-LY. Moroccan Scramble, Homemade ricotta, pancakes, devils on horseback, bring it all on baby. I love you.
