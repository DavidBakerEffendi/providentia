An old favorite ... ruined! I'll never eat at Bella Mama again.  My husband and I used to dine here often and decided to go back. We hadn't been there in about  8 months or so. Were we ever sorry! What an awful experience. He ordered a rib eye steak medium.  It was overcooked, dry and tasteless.  We both hate returning food, but it was inedible. We nicely told the waitress that he ordered his steak medium and she nicely took it back to the kitchen.  The owner comes back with the same steak and tells us it is medium, starts cutting open the steak to find some semblance of pink.  What happened to the customer is always right in the food service industry? In any event, after back and forth for a few minutes, I pointed out that regardless of what he considers "medium" and what we consider "medium" I'm not at my mother's table where you eat what's on the plate or go to bed hungry.  He still argued that he was not taking it back... he'd only replace it but still charge us. Bottom line, we asked him to wrap up both our dinners and told him my dog would eat good tonight ;)  (My osso bucco was no bargain either) and they lost good customers.  We still generously tipped the waitress who was oh so apologetic and clearly uncomfortable. I'm curious when the ownership changed... hmm!
