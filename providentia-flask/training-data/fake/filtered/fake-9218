Don't let the name "Athens" throw you off as to what's on the menu.   They serve usual diner fare with a broad variety of burgers, sandwiches and entrees.  I was a long time fan of "LIbby's Blue LIne Diner" and ate breakfast there every Sunday for 3 years.  After eating a burger there last weekend I am happy to say that all that has changed is the exterior.  Excellent cooking and a majority of the friendly wait staff remains the same.   However, I was surprised that the burger was much more delicious since the change of management!   Athen's Diner is my new home for Sunday brunch!
