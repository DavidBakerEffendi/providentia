The arepas are outstanding.  The combination of savory from the meat and sweet from the cornbread really works.  The horchatas are fun - a rice milk drip served with cinnamon on top.  Plus I like supporting this place, the staff is nice and you get the sense that this is a small business owner just trying to make his dream work.
