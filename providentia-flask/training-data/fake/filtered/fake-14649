First of all, I don't know about you but me, I like to digest my food with an order of nice! Having woman glare at me, even when it's behind a curtain, tends to curdle the digestive juices.  Food, as far as that goes, is good; service, accompanied by scowling woman, not so good.  We live and work in the immediate area and it will be my pleasure to direct anyone who asks away from here!  I have an upset stomach!!
