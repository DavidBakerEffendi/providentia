We came into Joe's based on Yelp's positive accolades and were excited to venture into China Town and try their famous Xiao Long Bao.  For those unfamiliar, Xiao Long Bao is a Soup dumpling.  Joe's is particularly famous for their Crab & Pork version, and although we had never had these wonderful treats before, we were instantly hooked. We ordered the crab and pork dumplings in addition to a noodle dish, scallion pancake, and a chicken entree.  Although the scallion pancake was good, everything else was unmemorable except for the Soup Dumplings which were out of this world. The restaurant is a bit of an institution.  We strolled in around 8:30 on a Thursday and saw a large number of people waiting outside.  With only two of us, we were handed a ticket, and brought to a full table about 2 minutes the later.  The service was efficent, but certainly not out of this world--but this did not take away from our experience. Synopsis:  If your near Canal St. or in China Town, go grab some dumplings and your won't be disappointed.
