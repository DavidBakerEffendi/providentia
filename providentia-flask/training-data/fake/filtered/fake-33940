This place is a joke. Sure, the line at Pepe's may be longer, but at least once you get in, you get fast service. At Sally's, we waited outside for 30 minutes and then waited inside for TWO HOURS. We were so close to leaving but we were so hungry that we decided to stick it out. When the pizza came, it tasted good, but I'm not sure if that was because it was actually well-made or if I was so hungry that I would eat anything. I will never go back here because of the horrendous service.
