We go here a lot for breakfast, some of the best pancakes ever and at a reasonable price.  The owner's now know our faces and always come and say hello.  The only down side to this restaurant is that they do not have wifi.  It would be nice to have because we are students and would like to bring our laptop for a while.  UNH students get 10% off with school ID which is great!!
