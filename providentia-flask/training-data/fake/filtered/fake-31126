I love Athenos.  I have been there on various occasions and never been disappointed by the service or the food.  However, i need to share tonights experience.  I went there with my husband, sister and brother in law.  We all ordered. When the food came, my husband was given an entree which he didn't order.  When we told the waiter about the entree confusion, he denied knowing about the original order request even though we all heard my husband order the dish.   The fact that he lied to us about what my husband's original order was unacceptable.  my husband, being the gentleman he is, ordered a platter that would be ready in a jiffy.   In the end, the waiter apologized about the entree mix up but never admitted to getting the order wrong.   in my opinion, bad service. So bad, my husband doesn't want to go back again.  Boo Hoo.
