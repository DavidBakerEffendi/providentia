We had a group of 11 go to El Vez at exactly noon for lunch. They were moderately busy but there was an empty 8 top and several empty tables near it.  In addition, they had several large, empty booths located next to each other.  We were told they had just sat a large party and, therefore, would not be able to seat us until 2pm.  They were not accommodating at all, not even offering to split us up into the large side by side booths.  We took our $300 lunch tab elsewhere and won't be back.
