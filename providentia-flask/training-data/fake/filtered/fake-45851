I was truly hoping that this restaurant would get better with time.  It has not.  A lifetime Cedar Grove-ian was looking forward to an upscale restaurant in town.  Not to be.   The hostesses and staff look past you when you walk in - but eventually get to you - I am sorry, are we bothering you? Gave them many chances to improve.  Brunch is poor at best -  fried pancakes?, overcooked eggs, hashbrowns in the style of McDonalds?  Tea selections are poor.  Lipton and Tetley is not a tea for this type of restaurant.  Would you serve Folgers coffee? Dinner: meals have been consistently poor - overcooked pasta and shrimp and rolls, twice.  Rolls brought out burnt and well into meal.   Beverages from bar are amateurish - who can't make a cosmo?  Gave bartender another chance to make it right - -same result - watered down, clear, and without taste.  Long Island Iced Tea fine one night - a coke the next, what's up? Pass this restaurant up and go to Calandra's in Caldwell or Porcini's in Totowa. For a great meal, consistently in Cedar Grove - go to Espisito's. This restaurant is to pricey to make these errors.  Shame on you.  Who is in charge?
