One word.... AMAZING!!!! This is truly a diamond in the ruff. The ambiance is soulful and relaxing. The price is the best in town. Overall, I will place the restaurant at the top 3 on my favorite restaurants!! I can't wait to go back very soon regardless of my far drive from home! And trust me well worth the trip...
