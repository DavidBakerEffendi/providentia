I chose to eat at Cafe Sabarsky on a Sunday. It was a long line at the entrance. Obviously they work on a first came first serve base, without a waiting list. My experience was ok from all points of view, but it was not excellent. It`s a a single room with many tables. Interior design wise, nothing spectacular: old marble table tops (which by the way should be replaced since the edges are chipped), a sophisticated  millwork (but poorly finished). The food was enjoyable but in a petite size at a large price; I was not impress by its taste, nor its presentation. I will definitively not return for the food itself. The service was ok, but not remarkable. They just did they job right, but lake the friendliness. The dessert was disappointing: a very mediocre strudel at a place where strudel suppose to be at its peak. For your chef there: please learn how to properly do it; if I would like to have a cooked dough with fresh apple I would just bite the apple. Conclusion: it`s on your own risk, depending on how trained and  sophisticated tastes you have.
