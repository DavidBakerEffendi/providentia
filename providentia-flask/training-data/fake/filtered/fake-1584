One of the best dining experiences I've had in a long time. The food was delicious, and the owners (husband and wife - she does the cooking) were so sweet! I had okra that was, remarkably, not cooked into mushy oblivion; my friends were quite enamored of the aloo paratha. We loved everything we ordered, and enjoyed meeting the proprietors. I'd go back in a heartbeat.
