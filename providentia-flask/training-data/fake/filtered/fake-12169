This is the first time that I have been compelled to write a restaurant review; going to Miya's on Saturday night was one of the worst dining experiences I've ever had. I went to Miya's a number of times during college (2000 grad), and remembered a few dishes fondly.  This was the first time I was back. Service: Terrible.  We were seated at 8:20 PM and did not get our main courses until 10:00 PM.  This is unacceptable.  They did throw in a few freebies, which were starchy fillers (potatoes, fried onions). Food: Terrible.  I love sushi.  I love creative food.  This, however, is disgusting.  In general, although the description of dishes make the food sound wild and crazy, in reality, the food is quite bland, starchy, and has no balance.  The rice is bland, dry and not seasoned.  The soy sauce was weak (how do you mess up soy sauce!).  We asked the waiter to direct us (given the ridiculous length of the menu), noting we liked fish.  Two of the four roles he chose had goat cheese in them, and no fish.  I don't really recall what else was in the roles, given how unremarkable the tastes were.  Only the names were interesting.   What was good:  the deep fried spinach appetizer (this is what I remembered from my undergrad days) was good.  The spicy sake (Firecracker?) also worked.  Honestly, nothing else worked. Bottom line:  The rolls tasted like Thanksgiving leftovers mashed together and rolled up in old rice.  The names were cool.  The wait for the food was unacceptable.  If you think that sounds like a good experience, go for it!  Seems like there are plenty of people who still are in love with the place.
