The ambiance is utterly appealing to those who favor eclecticism in a 19th century cozy mode, which includes me.  I loved it.  We came in for late night dessert and drinks.  The desserts were OK but the apple crisp should have used tart apples, especially in NY State in mid-October when they are at their peak and readily available.  The bartender, a white female perhaps in her 30's, had one of the worst attitudes I have encountered in the service industry.  The term "bitch face," which I have never applied to anyone, fit her perfectly.  It seemed a pain for her to serve us, before we even had opened our mouths.  The three of us, two with extensive  restaurant and bar tending experience, would have ordered more had she not been so off-putting.  I would hate to live in her head.
