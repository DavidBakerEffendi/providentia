Believe the hype!  Friend took me there tonight and it was really a great classic dining experience. The Bone Marrow app to start is really decadent and good if you're into that kind of thing.  I had the Arctic Char w/ lobster chunks special as a main course and it was cooked perfect. Can't wait to find a reason to go back
