I would like to say great restaurant best Italian food,. I would like to reply the. review on 03/02/2014, I spoke Â with the owner when I saw this on yelp, and told me they do not understand about Italian food, because risotto should be AL al and pasta like in Italy. They did get charge for the risotto, and did not have the money to pay for the check, and short the check for $10, the owner had to stop them at the door. People in the restaurant business work very hard, why would you do that?
