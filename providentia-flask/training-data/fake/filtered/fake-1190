I am a new fan of this place. I usually go to other sushi places in Brooklyn but decided to try a new one. I went here the other night with a friend and we had a great dinner. I would recommend having the Love Boat (for 2 people). It's $45 and we even left a few pieces on the place (and I can usually eat a lot of sushi). It's chef's choice what is on the "boat" but the waitress asked us if we liked spicy or not and they brought out everything we liked. It came with a nice assortment of sushi, sashimi and a ginormous roll that was delicious. There is really only one reason I am giving it a 4 - we ordered an appetizer special called the "sushi pizza" and they forgot to bring it. We even asked our waitress twice when she took our order but they didn't charge us for it and honestly, I am glad we didn't get it. I was just curious what it would look like. I will definitely go back here and recommend it to friends in the area.
