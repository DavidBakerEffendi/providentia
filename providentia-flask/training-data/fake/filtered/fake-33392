If Geno has a Cantonese cousin, the man behind the counter at Siu Kee is him. I decided to visit Siu Kee after hearing all the hype. During my visit, I placed my order in English. Minutes later, another Chinese customer walked in after me and placed her order in Cantonese. The man behind the counter then deliberately ignored me and served the Cantonese-speaking customer first. Lovely. I walked out and went to Ting Wong instead. If you're craving fresh roast pork, roast duck, or chicken, support friendlier businesses like Ting Wong or Sang Kee instead.
