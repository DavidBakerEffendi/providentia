Zutto isshoni itai.  Had an amazing meal there last night with good friends and excellent food.  Particularly notable is the delicate sushi that was fresh and luscious, the killer steamed hirata buns that were like eastern version of sliders (yum yum yum yum) and a rich silky ramen.  Really great.  You won't believe the desserts which are out of this world.  The coffee semifreddo with zeppole is an awesume combo and don't miss the banana brioche pudding.  It's not your daddy's bread pudding but more like a Viennese style pastry.  Give this place a try and save room for dessert.
