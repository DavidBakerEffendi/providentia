We had superb food.  We went two days in a row.  Our hotel was directly across the street from Eataly; nevertheless, we left there to go back to Sergimmo. Their house special sandwich has the perfect balance of crusty and chewy, salty and sweet with complexly layered, fresh flavors that unfold succulently in your mouth.  On day #2,  we ordered the pasta y fagioli to share with another sandwich.  Once we tasted it, we had to order a second bowl. It had a slightly thick base, only hinting tomato with the beans and pasta appropriately portioned--minimally heavy if at all.  I will return for more. What made me look for this place? I was recalling the best Italian sandwich I had in my life.  My memory was from Venice, in the harbor where you get the vaporettos.  Sergimmo's is closer.
