This place has great food, and plenty of options. It is not as cheap as a buffet but the price is reasonable because most of the meals come with a soup and salad. The staff is always helpful and the place always seems very clean and modern. I don't know much about Asian food, but I always enjoy the food here. They offer meat but plenty of vegetarian things also it seems. They do have a bar, but I don't drink so that doesn't matter to me. It is good for lunch and dinner. I have taken a few groups of friends here, and they usually enjoy it. PS-The bathrooms are clean and spacious! I think they have a small heater in them now because of the cold outside, which is very nice.
