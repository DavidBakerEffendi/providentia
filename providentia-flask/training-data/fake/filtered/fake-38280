Wow! This place is awesome. The Morning After sandwich is unlike anything I have ever had. It's a must try. Also the wings and clam chowder are right on. Salmon tartare forget about it! Â If you have room leftover Ancho Chili Brownies or Lava Cake with Oreo Crust I highly recommend. Crazy good cocktail list. Will definitely be going back for more. This place is a gem. I love the fact you can go in on a Sunday watch a football game and not feel like you in a spots bar.
