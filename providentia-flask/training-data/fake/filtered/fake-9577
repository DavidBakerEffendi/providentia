Fuel is awesome and I love the food but the atmosphere is a little strange. The restaurant itself is more of a quick grab and go versus a nice sit down lunch spot. The smoothies are amazing and so refreshing and I loved the salas I got. Lots of options and all on the healthy side (depending on your choices of course). I will definitely be going back!
