This cart definitely lived up to its reputation! You do not have to choose between chicken or lamb, get both! It's a combination of chicken and lamb over a bed of rice on one side and lettuce on the other. Both meats were seriously delicious! but what REALLY made this dish was the white sauce and the hot sauce. I have never tasted such an authentic white sauce in the US before and be careful because the hot sauce is VERY spicy! I ate gyros in Europe a couple years ago and I have been searching for an authentic gyro in the US since forever ago. This place was awesome! It sounds ridiculous, this kind of quality from a food cart, but its no joke. Must try in NYC! This seems like a hot spot for after hours clubbing fanatics but I was completely sober and it still tasted awesome.
