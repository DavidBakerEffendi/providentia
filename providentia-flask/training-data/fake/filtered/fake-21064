A good place for happy hour.  Some choice appetizers are half price along with mojitos.  In a party of two, we ordered the empanadas and the nachos with half hour pricing.  The happy hour nachos are reduced in size but are still HUGE! The nachos are very good and loaded.  I recommend a party of 3-4 at least for the nachos. Fortunately and unfortunately the nachos filled us up to the extent that I had to save my cuban sandwich for breakfast the next day.  However, the yuca fries (the side) did not stand a chance to see their way into take out box; they were too good to save.  A pleasant  surprise was that the cuban sandwich for breakfast was not regretted! It still retained its crunchy texture after being "nuked" which was awesome.   The waitstaff was very nice.  My waiter made sure to give me a some of the amazing orange sauce (came with empanadas and cuban sandwich) with my leftovers without me asking.   Without happy hour this place is a bit pricey.  Either that, or I'm a bit biased because we got gipped.  We had a $25 off coupon for $35 total but when it came to check time it turned out that happy hour pricing was not included.  We ended up paying full price for everything when we had the intention of using the coupon for happy hour to get the bang for the buck.  Now when looking back upon the date, we paid full price for the nachos that were reduced to happy hour sizing... Still filled us up anyways!
