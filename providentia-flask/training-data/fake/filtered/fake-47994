I've used Yelp for a couple years without bothering to create an account or write reviews. That changed tonight when my wife and I decided to grab dinner at Our House. We simply had a fantastic experience. Atmosphere is unique and inviting, the menu is loaded with mouth-watering choices, price is reasonable, especially for the quality (they buy local when possible), and the servers are prompt and friendly. We had a brief conversation with the owner, and he is refreshingly genuine and kind. It's clear he cares about his restaurant and the people in it. He even went out of his way to modify a couple things on the menu for us; a very nice gesture! We are already looking forward to eating there again, and I would highly recommend this place to anyone. Oh, and their fried PB&J dessert is... WOW.
