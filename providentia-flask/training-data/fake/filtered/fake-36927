Ok so i NEVER write reviews but have promised myself I would for this unbelievable hidden gem in our hood. We LOVE this place they seriously have the best brunch i have ever tried in NYC. This includes everywhere i have tried in the meat packing and soho.... Love the space outside and even there regular coffee is delicious. Now it may sound like im raving about this place but I AM... and FYI I am a very fussy restaurant person, not proud of it but Ny can have that affect. The only downside is that they are not open on Saturdays for Brunch, which is a real shame as there is no where else that offers this standard of food and ambiance in Sunnyside. I do feel that this place is still undiscovered and I hope that as the word spreads they will consider opening on Sat morning. Now this is only a brunch review as Ive not done dinner here but we are planning too very soon. Food recommendations so far are: eggs benedict = perfect and goats cheese omlete= perfect oh and i have a sweet tooth so the yogurt, granola and dried fruit is a perfect compliment to the savoury. Just one tip quaint... please keep the portions generous they have been getting gradually smaller every visit..... Hope this is helpful but you wont be able to imagine the deliciousness until you try !!!
