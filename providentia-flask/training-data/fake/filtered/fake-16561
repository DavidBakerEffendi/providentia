Manakeesh has been what I call my second home, it has a very cozy atmosphere.  It's a great  place to meet with important people or where you want to just hang out with your friends or have a family reunion, it fits any occasion. I did get engaged there, so having special moments in your life, Manakeesh is a great place to have it. The employees are wonderful and hospitable as well and they do whatever they can to make your  visit a wonderful experience. The food is also amazing, my favorite is the tawook, but if you are a vegetarian I would recommend zaatar  "thyme" sandwich with vegetables. Their tea and coffee is very good. The way they present it to you makes you feel your in an Arabian country. They give it to you with a whole arabic tea set as well as the coffee.  Oh and don't forget their baklava and their sweets!! Don't go to any place EXCEPT Manakeesh for their baklava! They make EVERYTHING from scratch and everything is FRESH, sometimes if you get lucky they let you try some that just came straight out the oven!I I recommend  everyone to come here. It's one of the best places to be in Philadelphia. If you don't believe me, try it!!
