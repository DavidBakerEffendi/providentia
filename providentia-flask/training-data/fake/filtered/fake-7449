Classic looking restaurant, awesome ambiance and fantastic classic french cooking. Â  First time i went i was really impressed by the french fries, steak and chicken. The second time i was absolutely blow away by the duck confit, and goat cheese tart. Really an awesome time and great food. Can't beat this classic NY experience.
