Had dinner with 8 friends the other night and loved every bite.  We started with some incredible cocktails and moved right into the French Feast.  All of it was amazing., without question, however, was the pommes dauphinois.  These are the new french fry.   Last but not least the staff was amazing, gracious and attentive. Will be back.
