Not sure what all the hype is about. They are in a prime location, they are open super late, food is cheap. great! But last time I ordered falafel, they were deep frying the falafel and the guy who was trying to wrap some food for someone else dropped the plastic forks (like 4 forks) in the oil. He just kept going while the plastic was melting adding the extra flavor to the falafel. This is ridiculous, someone who eats that falafel with that crazy melting plastic can get really sick. I pointed it out to the guy and he was like, that's fine. Obviously I didn't buy and left the place amused. Food can be delicious, location can be convenient but end of the day no one wants to get sick because of the quality. Never ever going back. I am not a tourist and I live in the city.
