This place is the best. So convenient to where I work and live. Perfect serving portions and the food taste is like heaven. The staff is wonderful.. Quick and friendly. The chef from what I read is a local celebrity so it's pretty cool to have that in our community. Love their specials and come spring time, you'll see us all on their back porch dining on the river :) Great place!
