The food is really good! The only reason I didn't rate this place any higher is because the customer service is HORRIBLE! One time, I went to pick up my order and when I arrived, instead of acknowledging me and asking if I was picking up or making an order, no one addressed me. I was waiting and waiting and waiting TRYING to make eye contact with this women who was taking orders and she deliberately wouldn't look my way. She continued taking orders and I'm waiting to get mine which I see (getting cold might I add) simply because she chose not to acknowledge me. When I was finally addressed, I was pretty much rushed out of the place. The staff that directly deals with customers come off as rude, ignorant, and uneducated. Train your staff or people will not come back REGARDLESS of how good the food is. Disgusting bad attitudes. Get it together. It's called professionalism!
