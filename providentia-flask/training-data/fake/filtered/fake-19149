I went with my friends for a birthday party. The hibachi chef started to cut up zucchini to throw into people's mouths. My friend-the birthday girl-choked on the zucchini. It was such a large piece, and it went right down her throat. Someone at the table started to get up to do the heimlic while the chef stood there, blinking. She eventually coughed it up. My feeling is, cut the pieces SMALLER, and know the heimlic if you're going to throw food in people's mouths.
