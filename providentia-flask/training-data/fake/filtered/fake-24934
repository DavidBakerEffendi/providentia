I'm surprised by the negative reviews.  My wife loves this place and raves about how the ingredients are always fresh.  We usually go here after watching a movie at The Montgomery Cinema.  The decor has improved and the staff is friendly. My only complaint would be there could be more variety on the menu and/or specials and that's the only reason they don't get a 5.
