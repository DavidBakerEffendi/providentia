Great atmosphere, cloth napkins, poor service, food OK but nothing to brag about. Don't go here if you are handicapped in anyway, steep stairs even to ladies bathroom. Must park on street and pay to park. I had my retirement party there and was glad we went Â there but most of us wouldn't go again.
