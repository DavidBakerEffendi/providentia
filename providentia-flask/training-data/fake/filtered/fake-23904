Yummy, Â solid Mexican Food with really friendly bartenders. It is a casual, but well executed food in a funky and bright space. The Luchador Skate board decks that recreate a scene of the last supper is rad. I have been here a number of times and it serves a great go-to in Old City: Super happy hour deals, comfort food to dig into pre-movie at the Ritz, Salsa dancing on Tuesday nights for those of us who are just learning and a fun spot to grab a drink at the bar and get a snack. I am a big fan of the quesadillas and guacamole which comes piled high in a stone bowl. I have had some really good soups of the specials along with some hearty meat dishes too.
