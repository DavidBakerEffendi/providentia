I have now been to Hendricksons Restaurant a number of times and tried many different things on their menu. The Grilled Salmon Salad with their homemade balsamic dressing is made to perfection. The best restaurant burger I have had in years, Penne Vodka AMAZING and the list goes on. If you go to Hendricksons you can Â feel comfortable ordering anything on the menu and I guarantee you will be delighted, and back to try something else from their spectacular kitchen. Staff is extremely pleasant and prompt. Hendricksons has become my favorite restaurant from first bite. Great beer selection as well. Bartenders are very experienced and make drinks to perfection. That should answer any and all questions you have about this fine establishment now go in and find out for yourself. You won't be disappointed.
