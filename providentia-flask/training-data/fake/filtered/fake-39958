This place stinks and very conjusted. Basically you have to beg for every thing such as water or napkins. Waiters dont care since gratuity is 18% fixed on the bill. Also be extra carefull with the bill check it twice. Waiter tried to snick in $30 on my total for no reason and when asked she said she maid a mistake. I would not go again lousl resturant to eat.
