I enjoyed dinner here one evening last week. The food, wines and decor were delicious and beautiful. The atmosphere casual, relaxed and very welcoming. Our young waitress was extremely attentive although somewhat forgetful, which didnt matter much since she smiled nicely and apologized for mistakes made. Â I would definitely return and have already sent several friends to the lovely little French restaurant with the handsome manager and fresh food made to please people of different kind. Everything from Kobe hotdogs to tuna tartar and oysters on Tue!
