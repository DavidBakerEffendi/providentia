I'm not a sushi fanatic or anything, and I won't eat anything raw, but I had both the tempura appetizer and california roll and I thought they were both very good. The service was decent, but 50% off sushi.. how can you beat that? I would definitely go again! Nice spot to meet friends after work. The crappy part is having to put money in the parking meter until 7pm because the parking lot fills up QUICKLY!
