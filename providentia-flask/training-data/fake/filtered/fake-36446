Always wanted to eat @Casa Mono & was so so very disappointed in the staff. It's possible that a waiter could be less friendly and more self absorbed than the one I had tonight, but I don't see how. Management was equally to blame, and we were sitting at the bar, not even TAKING UP A TABLE! Forget price or quality of food or ambience or anything else...who wants to be someplace where you feel unwelcome?
