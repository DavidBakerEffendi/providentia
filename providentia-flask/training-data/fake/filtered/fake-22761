your pizza is very good. i actually enjoyed it more than i thought i would. Your waitress wasnt to pleasant she had us wait a very long time for service. she has brown curly hair tall and slim. There wasnt any customers to compare her to since we were the only table at the time. She was a bit worried about what was going on with the kitchen staff . I love the pizza but would rather pick up my food rather than ever have her wait on me again. we got a couple large pizzas and calzones which were HUGE biggest i seen especially around here. I enjoy taking my family out to eat and i was totally turned off by her lack of service. Had a bad experience right down the street at tollis with the same issue and frankly i will probably never return there for the same reason. but other than that your food was awesome and i will be picking up instead of dining in.
