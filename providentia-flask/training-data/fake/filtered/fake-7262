Poor service, cold food with little to no taste. Went here for breakfast on a Tuesday with some people from work. Waited a long time for someone to come and greet us and offer drinks. We were a party of 6 and it was an uncrowded Tuesday morning. Not sure what took them so long to come over. Over the course of our breakfast we had four different waiters. None of them communicated with each other, so we kept getting repeated questions and messed up orders. All the food came out at different times. I ordered the Eggs Florentine - served room temp at best, sitting in a pool of butter. Canned artichoke hearts. Really flavorless. Would have complained but it took them so long to bring the food, and no one checked in to see how it was, I figured it was easier to just let it go and write a Yelp review. Plus someone in our group really wanted to try the place out, and I didn't want to rain on their excitement to eat there. Everyone else's dish was also pretty poor. Luke warm, stale bread, overcooked eggs... I couldn't understand why people rave about this place. Waiter(s) forgot a side dish, brought the wrong side dish to someone else... ran into us while clearing dishes, dropped dishes next to us... it was one of the worst dining experiences I've had in NY. Would definitely avoid. Love eating out in this city, have no problem paying $15 for eggs (it's NY, comes with the territory), but I want them served warm and with flavor. Don't see a reason to try it again! Would rather enjoy any number of the awesome restaurants this city has to offer!
