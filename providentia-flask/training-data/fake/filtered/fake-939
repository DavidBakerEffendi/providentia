Love this place...always our "go to" date night out in New Haven. Love the idea of being able to pick on a little of this and a little of that. Love the meat and cheese plates and the garlic bulb to put on op of bread. you have to ask though if they have the garlic bulbs still because it is not on the menu any more. Also love the lobster fideos, grilled hanger steak, chorizo and figs, ham and cheese croquets. Sangria and mojitos are always a good choice too!
