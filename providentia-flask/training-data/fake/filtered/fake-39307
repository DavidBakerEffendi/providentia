Brooklyn Taco catered my office's holiday party, and we were all really impressed. This was so much better than a crappy cheese and grape platter, and I felt like we got a lot of bang for our buck. Jesse was incredibly patient and helpful in dealing with building insurance requirements. We had access to the building issues because of construction which threw us behind schedule, but Jesse and Seth were totally pleasant despite having to push cartfuls of food about 2 blocks out of their way to get it upstairs. The buffet of tacos was plentiful and really tasty. I found the chicken to be super moist, but I think the brisket was the most popular of the evening. Guac was wonderful and tasted super fresh. I also like that they warmed the tortillas first. Everyone was super pleased and I would be more than happy to work with them again. Thank you!
