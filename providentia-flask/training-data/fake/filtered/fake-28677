The Malt House seemed like the perfect place to have Sunday brunch.  My friend and I entered the restaurant to a warm atmosphere.  With only one other couple in the restaurant, we had a nice selection of empty tables to occupy. The menu was small, and limited for my vegetarian friend.  She ordered the eggs Benedict, sans meat, and I ordered the breakfast burger. After several minutes, my friend's meal arrived, along with a burger that I DIDN'T order-- a portabello burger.  I flagged down the waitress to get it fixed.  She took the mistake and assured me that the correct burger would arrive promptly.  My friend nibbled at her meal, trying to be polite and wait for mine to come. Twenty minutes later, it was delivered to the table.  The meat was a perfect medium, but the fried egg on top was undercooked and lacked flavour.  My friend had trouble enjoying her eggs benny by the time she got to eat it.  The fries on the side were the best part of the meal. The server apologized in a very unapologetic way as she brought the bill for the full price amount.  The warm atmosphere got colder over the course of our brunch. I hope the only other couple sharing brunch had a better experience than we did.  We will NOT be returning.
