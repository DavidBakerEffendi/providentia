This place is a first date must!  one of my favorite hidden gems in NYC, the food is phenominal (try the puffed dough appetizer or the Balsamic chicken) and the atmosphere is very romantic.  A perfect spot if you want a great meal at a very very reasonable price (entrees about $12-17) To things to note: it is cash only, so make sure you plan in advance, and they do not take reservations, so either get there early or plan on dropping your name in and going next door to the wine bar for a drink, don't worry the maitre d will come get you! Enjoy!
