THIS FOOD IS GREAT!!! I think to myself as I enjoy some delicious fish tacos. everything is made on the spot fresh, with real ingredients not grade c meat. its a comfortable environment for casual dinning not a fancy restaurant. but I mostly get take out though since its made fresh its always warm and tasty. gigantic burritos will fill any family on a night when there's no time or energy to cook. looking for something spicy? try the speedy Gonzales... I could go on but I suggest go and try it yourself experiment with the salsa for an extra pop of flavor.
