I guess I have to go against the majority of the Yelpers here. I went here about a month ago and waited about 60 minutes to be seated. The ramen tasted average. Those who say that this is the best ramen they ever had probably had never had ramen before or they just bought into the hype. While using the restroom, I was shocked when I saw dishes in the shelves. I guess people don't really care where their dishes are coming from. Just FYI, although not written, a 17% tip is mandatory according to the owner and no credit cards are accepted. But hey, if I had people waiting in line like crazy for my restaurant and still get 5 stars review coming in like mad, I would still store my dishes in the restroom and be an ass to everyone. They obviously know how to work the system. Don't know how they do it, but I have to learn.
