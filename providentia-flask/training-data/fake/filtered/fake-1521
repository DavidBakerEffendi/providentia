I love this place.  I go there a lot and sing the praises.  the guacamole dip is a great touch and I like the dim lightening.  The staff is friendly and attentive to your needs.  The food comes out fresh and the salas is wonderful as well.  I would like to see a hotter one added to the menu though.  The bar has some great mixers and the bartenders really know what they are doing in addition to the cooks.  The loaded nachos are simply that!  Enough for a few dinners for sure.  The wait is minimal too.  You willl not leave here hungry or thirsty.  All would suggest trying everything on the menu and find your ultimate favorite.  There's a well kept secret that I will share with you.  They have a drink called sangrita.  It's so yummy.  You take a shot of this bloody mary type substance that they make there, then a sip of tequila.  Worth trying-so amazing.  If for some reason you don't like something, tell them but I doubt you would have a problem.
