Recently ordered the filet of fish platter which comes with 4 decent sized filet and fries for $18.95. I must say I've had more and better for less from D'amatos which is no more than 15 min away from this establishment in the next town. My rating is based on quality and quantity for price .Either lower your prices or put more in !!!
