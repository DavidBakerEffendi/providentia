The meal I had here was so incredibly delicious that only a modicum of good manners prevented me from licking my plate.  Seriously - it was that good. This place is on the dressy side of casual without being formal.  It's also a little on the pricey side, but in my opinion well worth it. If I had a foodie friend who I wanted to impress or was planning for a date night or a business dinner Tip Top would be my number one choice.
