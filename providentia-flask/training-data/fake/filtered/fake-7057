Oh my goodness! I stopped by this place on my way back to NY and I was so pleasantly surprised! The ambiance is really nice and I was shocked to learn that it wasn't a franchise because it was so nice in there! Other than that, I came here to review on the ramen. Let me tell you, as a New Yorker I can honestly tell you I've had some kooky ramen around, but this place was really really good! It definitely passed the sniff taste because the stuff was spicy! But they also have mild ramen for all the weak souls out there! Other than that, my boyfriend ordered a panini...I think it was called the Italian? and I thought it tasted just fine. There wasn't anything grandiose about it but neither was there anything bad about it. It was simply good! I will definitely stop by here again if I ever stop by! Â But yess! try the ramen!
