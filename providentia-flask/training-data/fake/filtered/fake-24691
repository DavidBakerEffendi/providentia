The food here is really GOOD so I had to write something about it.  I tried their falafel sandwich with a side order of Zaatar fries. Plus i also ordered the egg flatbread and ba'al salad for take out. It took a little longer to get the food but the wait is worth it. Also the lines were longer because it  was lunch time. Very tasty food and awesome variety of salads.I highly recommend trying this out for yourself. Though they only take cash at the meantime so make sure to get some before you go there!
