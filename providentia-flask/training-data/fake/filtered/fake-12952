Delicious Thai food with friendly service!  We ordered the Spring Rolls, Shrimp in a Blanket, and Curry Puffs as appetizers.  All were crispy and tasty.  The entrees were the Pineapple Fried Rice with Pork and the Sweet and Sour Pork.  The flavors were excellent!!  The pork was moist and tender.  The vegetables were fresh and crispy, not over cooked.  I enjoyed the Thai iced tea - sweet and refreshing.  We were too full to order desert, so we will save room the next time we go.  There will DEFINITELY be a next time!!!  On top of everything, they deliver!!   It is also convenient to bus routes in Botany Village.  I am very happy that this Thai gem opened in Clifton.
