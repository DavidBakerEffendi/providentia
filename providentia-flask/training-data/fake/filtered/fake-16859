Came here with two girlfriends on Friday night. We ordered one of the thin crust pizzas. Chicken parm and linguine with mussels. I think our first mistake was ordering anything other than the pizza. My friend's chicken parm barely had any pasta on the bottom. They served me my linguine with red sauce rather than white so had to send it back to the kitchen. When they finally brought the correct dish out, it was basically just a plate of mussels with a few strands of pasta on the bottom soaking in mussel water. Absolutely no sauce, no taste, soggy and the worst pasta I've ever had. I had to ask the waitress to take it off our bill bc I couldn't even eat it. Â Pizza was average. I will definitely NOT be coming back here!
