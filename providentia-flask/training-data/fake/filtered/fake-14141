Pleasantly surprised - tried after purchasing a Groupon and had a lovely meal, this will definitely be our new go to spot. One authentically Japanese item that seems to be hard to find in local casual sushi joints is sweet shrimp, actually served raw. Loved the raw shrimp nigiri - they even served the head alongside, fried to a crunchy crisp (yes you eat the whole thing), super traditional. A+ And the light smoky flavor of the unique Drexel roll (crunchy spicy scallop wrapped in smoked salmon) was one of the more interesting rolls I've ever had. Misses include the unagi eel nigiri which was very tender but overdressed in sweet sauce, and the Spicy 3 combo (Spicy tuna, spicy salmon, spicy yellowtail) which seemed like a great deal but not only had crunch added Â (not noted on menu) but had much more crunch than fish in the roll, which was a bummer. Definitely planning on going back to try the specialty rolls, sweet shrimp, raw scallop and salmon, service was excellent and very friendly!
