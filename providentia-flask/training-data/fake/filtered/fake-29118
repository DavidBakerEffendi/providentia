The Kitchen cafe is the place to go for delicious housemade food like soups, salads, sandwiches and foccacia along with beautiful (and sometimes decadent) desserts.  There's nothing else like it in Hartford, and so convenient to Aetna, the downtown law offices and government buildings you can walk on a nice day.  Go on a Thursday and hit the year round farmers' market, or stop in at the Firebox for some jazz and a happy hour cocktail.  There's so much to do there you'll fall in love with the place!
