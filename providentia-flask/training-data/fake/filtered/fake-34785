Where to begin!? I work in the Flatiron District and wanted to try something new. Barn Joo has been on my list of places to dine but never got the chance until the other day. After getting out of work early I decided to give their Happy Hour a shot. Best deal I've encountered yet. They have $1 oysters, $4 draft beer, $5 wine, $6 sangria, $7 specialty cocktails and food options. The best part of this deal is that it's every day! I tried their Smoked Manhattan and it was just decadent. A very well balanced drink that really speaks to the pallet. I've heard and read that they're wings, specifically their soy-garlic flavored wings, were really good so I had to give those a try. Trust me, it's something everyone should order. Juicy chicken on the inside and crispy yet nicely glazed on the outside. Even though it was busy, the bartender's were still able to make me feel acknowledged. Overall, a great experience on all levels. Will have to try their wheel of prizes next time I go!
