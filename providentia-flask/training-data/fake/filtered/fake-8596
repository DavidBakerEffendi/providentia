UPDATE AS OF 4/18/13 - ONE OF MY FAVORITE PLACES.  5 stars to the max.  Service is good, food is good, it's consistent.  Go.  Go now. Below is original review: This was a good meal.  I'm not giving it 5 stars yet, as I've only been once, but my first trip left me satisfied.  Also, I've never had gourmet ramen, either, so I have little to compare it to except the 99 cent stuff...but I eat a lot of different food, so, I trust my palate to tell me what's good. I got the vegetarian ramen option, and it was hearty, tasty, and filling.  I like that it's not too salty.  And their chunky HOMEMADE CHILI GARLIC stuff in oil was AMAZING.  It was the only extra seasoning they put on your table.  Roasted sweet slivers of garlic, with chili and oil.  My only complaint, actually, was that I wanted a HOTTER option, too.  I wanted what they gave me(which I ate two servings of, some not even in the soup, just bites of it it was that good), and then I also wanted an option that would make my lips burn and nose run, at least a little bit.  Sometimes you can't taste food as well that way, but sometimes a bit or two of that hottness in between normal bites would have been a good balance.  That would have made it pretty perfect. Also, go for the hard-boiled egg, NOT the soft-poached.  With the soft-poached, there's no texture or actual experience of the egg once it mingles with the liquid, it just kind of falls apart. Anyway, I will be back.  In fact...I kind of want it again right now...and I only went last night...
