El Mexicano Mariachi Grill es muy bueno! Me ha encantado! I have been watching and waiting for the opening. Finally today was the day! It feels like Mexico to me. Limited capacity and delightful service It is a small menu that is authentic. Delicious Salsa, Carne Asada Burrito, and mamas Tres Leches Cake! Janet was visiting from Mexico City to help her mom with the opening. It was apparent that diners who came in had been there before. She remembered their names. I loved it and can"t wait to go back...for breakfast! 04/10 - update I haven't had breakfast yet pero ell tacos de pollo es muy delicioso! I met Ricardo and his adorable wife... I can't wait to go back!
