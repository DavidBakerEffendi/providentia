I love this place. Busy, crowded, intimate and simply outstanding! I've been here a few times - however as i am now just getting into yelp - i thought i better write a review on one of my favorite places in Soho. Luckily we sat outside at a table, inside was very noisy at lunchtime plus from what i could see there was very long line. I had a day off from the kids and met up with a girlfriend. If possible, sit outside - it is fabulous for people watching especially when the weather is beautiful. Fantastic coffee (and you should check out their cute little sugar packages - absolutely adorable) and the most delightful mimosas might I add. The food is always on point... their waffles superb!
