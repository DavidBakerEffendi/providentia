Manjares has now taken its place as my favorite coffee shop in New Haven. Most importantly, there coffee is great.  I've enjoyed all the food I've had there, though sometimes on weekends they do run out of things. The pastries are delicious - try anything with guava! On weekend evening it suddenly turns into a cozy yet chic wine and tapas bar.  The owners are very friendly, make you feel like a regular on your second time there - the atmosphere is very neighborhoody, I often see the same faces.  Sundays when the farmer's market is set up across the street is very busy -- but still a pleasure as long as you aren't in a hurry. It's such a great addition to the Westville community - my only complaint is that they're not open on Mondays!
