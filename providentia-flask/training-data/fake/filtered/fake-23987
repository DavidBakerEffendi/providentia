Every time I go here I leave totally satisfied. I've been about four times, and have gotten something different each time (except the spreadable salami which is a must!). Chef Joe has always been there overseeing the quality of the food and it shows. The timing of the plates, the knowledge of the waiters, and the attention to small details in the dish all show a high caliber of care. When I go with other people I always try their dishes and have never tasted something I didn't like. You're probably well off ordering anything. If I had the money, I would try every single dish. I give it four stars and not five, because I see the potential that they can do even better (much like what Hemingway saw in Fitzgerald after he read The Great Gatsby [in this example I'm Hemingway, mwahaha]).
