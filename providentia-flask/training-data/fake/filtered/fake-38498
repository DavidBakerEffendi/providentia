This was my first visit here and I'm so glad we came.  We were a party of 12 and to start off the service was great, water glass was always full and bread baskets always full.   A couple notes on the food.  I am a huge fan of homemade pastas so if it's offered I always order it.   I was quickly drawn to their options and chose the pasta carbonara... it was delicious!  A bit heavy but that's what you get when you order this dish.  They had just the right amount of prosciutto and carmalized onions so that you tasted both in every bite!!   My cousin ordered the grilled pork chop.  I have to say, he ordered it medium as I recommended and it was cooked perfectly.  This Pork Chop was the best I have ever had at a restaurant.  I have already requested going back so I can order that dish just for myself!  All the pasta dishes and pizzas were great as well.  My one cousin asked if they could do a mash up of 2 different pastas and they were more than happy to oblige instead of saying no!!  It's always nice when the restaurant can bend the rules a bit to make the diner have a great eating experience. I am definitely coming back to this place!!
