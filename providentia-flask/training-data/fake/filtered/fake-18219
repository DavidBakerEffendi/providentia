This was my first and last time going to the Pig and Prince. The customer service was by far the worst I have ever experienced. Not only was my server to busy the entire night to ask how I was doing but when I asked to have a TV changed to a different channel the response from the hostess was F*** that I have more important things to do. Thanks for a great evening out Pig and Prince.
