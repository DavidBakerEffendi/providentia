We were fortunate to have had a 2 week holiday in Brooklyn just a few weeks ago. It was one of our best holidays. As "foodies" our discovery of the Iris was one of the highlights of our holiday. We ate there three times in the two weeks. Everything about the restaurant was superb but the food was exquisite. The Belly of Lamb was a work of art. We tried the whole menu and would recommend everything. The chef will be a celebrity soon.
