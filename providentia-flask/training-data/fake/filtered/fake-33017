I'm an extremely avid and picky sushi eater, The sushi at Sushi Hana is always fresh and delicious. A never fail spot for amazing food. My favorite is the Swimming Monkey Roll and the super white tuna nigiri. The kitchen food is awesome too, the Para-Para is a sight to see and even better to eat, served flaming. Never a doubt in my mind that it's the best sushi sushi in town. The negative reviews confuse me, the service may be slow sometimes but the food more than makes up for it. I recommend it to anyone who craves good food, can't go wrong with Sushi Hana.
