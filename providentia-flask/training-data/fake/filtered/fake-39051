Yikes, can't believe the negative reviews about service, my experience couldn't have been more enjoyable. Â I came to town from Charleston and ate up at the bar with a few friends about two wks ago. Bartenders were very attentive and our food came quick...so maybe taking a seat at the bar is the best bet here. The Shepherds pie hit the spot, but it was a tough decision. Thanks for being so patient with us indecisive ladies, Joe!
