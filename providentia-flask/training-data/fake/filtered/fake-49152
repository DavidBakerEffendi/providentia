Salute was worth the 30 minute drive. Had the Tuna followed by caramel ice cream both was delicious. The most amazing part was the staff and atmosphere. We were there for a birthday party and they made the day very enjoyable. We will be back. The parking garage right next door eliminated the hazel of parking in Hartford. Also, the restaurant validate half of your parking.
