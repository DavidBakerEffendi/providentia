My wife and I have been eating at Park and Orchard for over twenty years.  While my wife has sampled the menu I have been ordering the chicken parm each and every meal.  It is an easy decision each time I walk through the doors.  It has become a running joke with whatever other people we dine with in that they automatically know what I am ordering.  If you try the chicken parm you will understand why I love it.  It is not like traditional chicken parm that so often is overly fried and loses flavor or is greasy.  This is a heart healthy meal that is sauteed rather than fried and in flour, not breadcrumbs.  The high quality of chicken used to prepare this dish is also a factor.  I have traveled extensively over the past two decades and have had chicken parm all over the world yet rate this chicken parm with the best I've ever had.  It also comes with a salad that is filling by itself.  The owners are friendly and walk through the restaurant conversing with each table while making sure the quality of their dishes consistently meet their high standards. From Craig finding the perfect table, to the extensive menu with something for everyone, a wine list to die for and an excellent staff makes Park and Orchard a wonderful place for a great night out!  Did I mention the chicken parm?
