I had high hopes for this shop when I tried it for the first time, I think they're relatively new and I had been highly recommended to this shop by my boyfriend's sister. The shop was a little dark, but the staff were very friendly and patient with their customers that were a little confused by the queue they have set up. I got a plain bagel with plain cream cheese (a bagel shop has to earn my trust before I get adventurous with anything). By the time I got home to unwrap my bagel (about a 5 minute drive) there was no evidence it had been toasted except for the slightest crisp around the edges, even though I had requested and observed them put it through the toaster. It was cold, too chewy, and there was a huge hole that took out about 1/6 of the bagel dough on the inside. The price of this mediocre bagel was also much higher than the other bagel shops in town. It's a price I would be willing to pay, only if they paid more attention to the dough and turned up the toaster a smidge.
