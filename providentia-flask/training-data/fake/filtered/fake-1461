I'd like to protest in the strongest possible terms against the treatment that Mr./Ms Jay B encountered at Cafe Sabarsky when confronted by the manager, whose name I will not mention. It is beyond outrage that such a refined guest, who weaves the narrative of their review with fluency and grace worthy of The New Yorker, be subjected to the aforementioned impertinence. Nobody deserves such abuse, and least of all not someone who can use the word "whilst" in a way that causes the reader to stop, think, and for at least a moment feel inferior to the learned author of the review. Furthermore, I was as deeply touched by Jay's sincere concern for Ronald Lauder's properties, as I was alarmed by the philanthropist's alleged carelessness regarding the liquidity of his own assets. I would like to take this opportunity to strongly suggest that Mr. Lauder be briefed without delay on who really frequents the establishment, and who, as a result, is forced to wait in line for an insultingly tiny portion served on an even smaller table. I actually believe that the reason for using small tables in Sabarsky is to make the portions seem bigger, but I here I actually might be wrong (Perhaps Jay B. and I should investigate this issue further). As I've learned from a well-informed source, the nature of the castings used to staff Chef Gutenbrunner's restaurants, as well as the design of the staff's uniforms still remain a subject of an ongoing debate, which aims at accommodating Â the sensitivities of as many guests as possible. I'd like to believe however, that all contributing opinions are welcome, and that all will be used to to improve the overall quality of the otherwise unique dining experience at Cafe Sabarsky.
