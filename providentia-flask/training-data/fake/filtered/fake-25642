I went to Nerai recently with a group of girlfriends and it was amazing. The restaurant itself is beautiful with crisp white and wood details, and the food is so spot on. We started with  the traditional appetizers: greek salad, trio of spreads, octopus... everything was so fresh and the octopus was perfectly cooked. We also tried the stuffed calamari which I've never heard of. It was an avalanche of cheesy goodness stuffed in one big calamari tube. The fisherman carpaccio is one of a kind, a beautifully presented plate of fresh sashimi style fish with marinated cucumber and yogurt. But the best part of the meal was a special that wasn't even on the menu: lamb ribs. They were so tender and delicious, with just the right amount of fat because hey, they're ribs!  Also great was the lobster and orzo entree, possibly the best poached lobster I've ever had. And finished it all off with warm baklava and gelato. Soooo good, definitely going back.
