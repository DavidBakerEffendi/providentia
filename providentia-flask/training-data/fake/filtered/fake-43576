Let's get right into it.... OVERRATED!!! I reserved for a party of five, but one person backed only to at the last minute to only change their mind and decided to come... I explained this to the hostess who was getting upset and seemed distressed she had to move plates from one table to another.... The Food was just alright... I am half indian and have eat Indian food all my life from various places... Everyone at the table even noticed the over use of salt to mask, or show that maybe this food is not fresh and probably from a can... Please read the reviews careful as I did not... Most people have gone here for happy hour and probably got so trashed the food tasted great after acouple of drinks...
