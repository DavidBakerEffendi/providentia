Everything I ate was delicious - the mac and cheese, the truffle locatelli fries, and garlic & crushed pepper broccoli rabe. The broccoli and mac and cheese in particular go well together. I went because I had a groupon for it, and I'm not sure I would have paid the full price for the broccoli or the fries, but I definitely would for the macaroni and cheese.
