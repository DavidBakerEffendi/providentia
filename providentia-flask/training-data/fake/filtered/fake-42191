i love juniper. Tom (the owner/chef), has worked hard to put this business together.  he was starting off when i moved to the neighborhood 2.5 years ago.  he is still working to get a liquor licence. i can recommend the following: catfish burger cheese steak sandwich (think philly cheese steak) the macaroni and cheese chorizo burger (usually sold out) there is a truffle burger too in the evening i like to order his Jambalaya, my wife likes the linguini with shrimp. anyway, talk to tom, he is very friendly owner. cash only, delivery (sometimes), BYOB (for now).  the food is great, there are cheaper options nearby, but not with a menu that so many good options.
