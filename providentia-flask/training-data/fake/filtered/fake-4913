I went here with my nieces, both of whom got linguini with marinara (almost $20 each). The sauce was pretty good, but the dish was way overpriced. I got a ravioli special which tasted like...nothing. Really, no flavor at all. Garlic bread was delicious and the staff was friendly and helpful, but overall, way too pricey for food that's no big deal.
