The pizza here is mediocre at best. If you think it's great you probably have defective tastebuds, have never traveled outside of New Haven, or have been locked in a shed for the past 20 years a la Jaycee Duggard and this is the first time you've eaten anything besides plain bread and pig slop. While passing through New Haven we decided to stop here because we had heard such great things. We were not impressed. You can probably have better pizza out of a Stouffer's or DiGiorno's box. Locals will say that people not impressed "don't get it", but it's not that. It just isn't good. I suppose it's a matter of taste. I've had great pizza in New York and I love Chicago-style pizza and the famous Chicagoland pizza restaurants. I would avoid this spot. Overpriced mediocre pizza and a long wait are not good combinations for a meal.
