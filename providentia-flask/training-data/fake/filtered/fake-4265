If your not in the theatre district but you still  enjoy high prices and small portions, then this is the place for you!  We found a parking space, during the high dinner hour, right next to the main door....which should have been our first clue.  The menu has decreased drastically, basically to the point where they should not even call themselves a diner.  The menu descriptions of the food items are very deceiving for example:  The cilantro salad that came with the very small portion of moraccan chicken, that was flavorless, was actually the drizzle that went around the plate.  Seriously???  The Sierra Mist Soda was just plain seltzer with no other options available.  The ownership has not changed hands, but his idea of how to please his customers surely has.  How it got to be voted #1 Diner is beyond me!  Our family has been long time (15+ years) customers, but sadly, today was our last visit.  The only reason we gave one star was because our server was pleasant.
