This is my go to seafood spot even after moving out of Astoria! The food is mouthwatering, the setting is laid back and service is friendly. I introduced some MH friends to Kyclades, and they are happy to make the trip to Astoria for the amazing food at very reasonable prices. We loved them all: the Greek burger, octopus (YUMMM!), freshly grilled Sea Bass and Dorata (flown from Greece), the sardines, the salads and appetizers. The only blah is the wait. We try to go during off-peak hours. Also, they have lunch specials Mon-Sat from noon to 4p.m. Awesome food at lower prices -awesome'er(?)! :D
