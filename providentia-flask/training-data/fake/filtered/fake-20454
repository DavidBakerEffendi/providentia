I felt so lucky to stumble upon this place, especially since I am not a frequent Soho-er. However, I was in the neighborhood for work, and looking for a nice place to have an early supper. Jack's Wife Freda caught my eye since I'd never seen it before and I decided to pop in. What a boon! It is so sweet in there, cute without being over-bearing, white walls, globe lamps, petite while still maintaining an airy feel. I was able to nab a seat by the window and chose to order the greek salad. The servers were very nice and accommodating, I felt super welcome and attended to even though I was just a solo-diner. My salad was wonderful, kale being a really nice change-up for the green base, and the salt-cured olives taking it into the clouds! With a glass of chenin-blanc and my book I was a very happy camper, what was supposed to be a quick bite turned into a delightful evening and I found myself walking to the train, be it through the soho hoards, satisfied and in very warm spirits. Soho can be really hit or miss with restaurants, often overly precious and/or hip in aesthetic, but leaving something to be desired cuisine-wise, or with servers who seem bored to be there and as if they can barely be bothered to serve you (the type that seem annoyed every time you ask a question about the menu, or request that your water glass please be refilled). Jack's Wife Freda defies these unfortunate commonalities boldly and brightly. A pleasant, but unassuming atmosphere, cool AND nice staff, and delicious things to eat (I've since returned and feasted on their exquisite matzo ball soup- satisfying without being too heavy in a lovely dill broth, the superb fresh-made cantaloupe juice presented to me by a very friendly bartender, french fries, and poached eggs with grilled haloumi- everything so far has been a delight to the palette). Major thumb's up!
