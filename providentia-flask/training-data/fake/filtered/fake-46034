My boyfriend and I came here last year, yes last year, and that was enough to keep us away. This place is your typical "upscale" restaurant with its pricey, mediocre, tiny-portioned food. I ordered a glass of wine which was served in a giant wine glass and filled 1/8 of the way! We asked the waiter if we accidentally ordered the 'half a glass' wine option and he assured us that we ordered the full glass option. He even informed us that this place was a fancy upscale restaurant and that's how wine is served. If you have to tell us, no, convince us that the place is fancy, then it's really not--it's just a place of high prices with little value to show for them! #sorrynotsorry
