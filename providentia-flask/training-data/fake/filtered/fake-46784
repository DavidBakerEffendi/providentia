Tried this place for the first time tonight. So disappointed. Ordered the Sesame Chicken, Pad Thai noodles with shrimp from their limited Thai menu, Sweet & Sour Shrimp and Pineapple Fried Rice. The noodles had the most unappetizing smell, gag. I tasted a forkful and couldn't eat anymore just the smell was a turnoff. The Â coating on the Sesame Chicken was very doughy and the dish was tasteless. The Pineapple rice was ok, a bit lacking in flavor. We were looking for a new place that delivers cause who really wants to go out in this weather. Next time I will make the drive to Lings. They never let me down. I will never order from Yoans again. Waste of money. Live and learn. The second star is for the service, they are very friendly.
