Went to Fin last week with my wife and son. I had heard some good things about them and also saw the very good reviews on this site. Overall they were a very expensive fail. We all were in the mood for fresh seafood and so didn't mind if it cost a bit more but as long as the seafood was  good and fresh. Not much to ask for from a place that is all about the seafood, right? We started off with a dozen Naked Cowboy oysters whcih tasted very fresh and tasty albeit a bit pricey ( $36).  From there it was downhill. My wife had a pasta and seafood dish which was bland and desperately needed seasoning that even fresh ground pepper and grated parmesan didn't help to make better. My son had the lobster tail and jumbo shrimp -- at $32 a lot was expected... but little was received.. small portions, tough lobster tail and worse... no flavor!. I set my expectations lower and went with tthe fish and chips... hard to mess that up, it's just about standard fair in these parts. It came with two smallish lightly breaded  pieces of cod lwhcih were nearly lost in  a sea of fries that could very well have been from frozen.  Not much flavor to the whole thing either. I mean how can you screw up tartar sauce?????? At over $20 I couldn't help but compare it to the excellent Fsh & Chip dinners at either the Argyle in Kearny or Thistle in Lyndhurst who come in under $20 or even Tops Diner in Harrison  all of which  give a large portions of nicely battered tasty fresh fish and friies! Maybe it was an off night.at Fin.. but we won't be back. They can keep the decor, somewhat fiendly service and poor parking.
