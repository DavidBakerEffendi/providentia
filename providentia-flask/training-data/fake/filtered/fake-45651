New to Thai food and reviews in general, I couldn't be more pleased to be writing my first about Blue Elephant Trail. Every time Ive walked in, Ive been so warmly greeted and you can literally feel such a feel good vibe. With a max capacity of just 80, you couldn't feel more comfortable.  This place is truly gorgeous. Perfectly lit to help you relax and beautifully decorated. The ideal spot to eat after a long week! Since I'm new to Thai food, I was very unsure of what I would like, and what to try. But lucky for me, the staff was there to help. The best service Ive ever experienced! You can tell that everyone is so happy to be there to serve you which is so rare at restaurants now a days. Very friendly, very kind. They broke down the menu to me in a way I would understand when it came to taste, texture, and quantity. Appetizers and dinner came out with perfect duration. EXCELLENT serving staff. Food was fantastic, and it really helped me open my eyes to a new culture of eating. And then the bar! I still think about how awesome the chairs are lol. Their specialty drinks are amazing! And Stella on tap?!?!?! How can you not love that. Great selection of beers and mixed drinks as well. Best bar service as well! Had some of the best conversation with staff and guests. I have to agree with another review "Honestly, this place is a complete treasure right in the heart of West Hartford. "   Truer words couldn't be spoken. Great place, I recommend Blue Elephant Trail to everyone I know. :)
