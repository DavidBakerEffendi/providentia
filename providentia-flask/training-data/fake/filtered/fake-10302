on satuarday when there was a lot of snow in nj and there was no power in the area my mom's house has no power too so I just take a file-to fish and I was expecting that because there was no customer the whole day so the sandwiches would not be fresh but amazingly it was good but it took too long for a drive through but it was an unusal weather so no problem
