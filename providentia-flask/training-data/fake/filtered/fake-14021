Really? How difficult is it to have a vegan option for dinner? I went here with my family, and was told by waiter, "We are not a vegan restaurant. The only thing that is vegan is the sauteed broccoli. If you want, we could make the vegetables in the poached egg and leave off the egg." Awesome!!! You mean I can order the poached egg without the poached egg? He helpfully told me that the side of broccoli was really small, and probably not enough to eat. Thanks. Not to dis their agenda, but would be nice if they had a token for vegans. Never again, Farm.
