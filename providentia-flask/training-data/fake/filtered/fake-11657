Late last week, I was in Center City (Downtown Philly) on other business, and I just so happened to be on the south side of Market, walking down 11th St. toward Market St, when I happened upon Rosa's outdoor sign promoting their $1 pizza slice. As a guy who is eternally looking for a bargain, I stopped in out of sheer curiosity and desire to give Rosa's a go. Personally, I think It's pretty good pizza all in all. Granted, I know you will always get those who may not agree, since food is always a highly personalized thing as far as what people like and what they don't like. But, for $1, how can you really go all that wrong in the first place? As it has already been said by others, some of the places to eat are spots where you stand off to the side, rather than being able to sit. But, the place looks to be clean, neat, well lit. Also, as was already stated by another reviewer... it is the cheese slices that cost $1... if you want pepperoni, that is $1.50 a slice. Personally, I think I would recommend anyone at least giving Rosa's a try.
