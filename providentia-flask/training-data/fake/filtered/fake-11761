SO GOOD.  Absolutely delicious hand-pulled beef noodles.  Some friends have called me "critical" when it comes to food, but I will say that I will appreciate food as long as (1) it is made with good-quality ingredients and (2) is freshly prepared with care, even if the surroundings are ghetto-ass and it comes in a plastic bowl.  I love how if you walk through the kitchen to go to the bathroom you can see them making all of the noodles fresh, and the huge puffs of steam are rising from the pots of soup and boiling water.  A gem and a hole in the wall. GO!
