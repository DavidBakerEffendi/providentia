I came here with my wife about a week ago. Based on what friends told me this place had to be a guarantee good time with good food. Unfortunately the time itself was not so great. Overcrowded bar with a long wait for a table full of young folks who probably arent even allowed to drink wasn't my ideal cup of tea. So after about an hour anda Â half of waiting and getting close to pure inebriation, we finally we a table right by the open kitchen where you see the masters at work. Aside from the constant steam embelishments to the face, the smell of boiling pork was heavenly. PORK PORK AND MORE PORK!!! My most honest verdict when it comes to this place. If it were not for the food, then i would avoid this place with a ten foot pole.
