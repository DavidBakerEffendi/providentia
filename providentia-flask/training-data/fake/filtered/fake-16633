This is the best sushi place per dollar in Philadelphia. 3-roll special is hands down the best deal--24 pieces of sushi for $10.95?!? Their specialty rolls are wonderful, really creative, original. They don't take reservations, and it's a really small place--probably only 12 people can sit down at a time. Do not bring a large party here. Expect to wait if you show up on Thursday, Friday, or Saturday. Nina and Jim are awesome!
