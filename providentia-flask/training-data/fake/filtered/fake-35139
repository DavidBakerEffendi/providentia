Rudy & Dean is a no nonsense establishment with courteous service and a relaxed atmosphere.  I had a great Bloody Mary (homemade horseradish!!); the oysters were fresh; mother's New England clam chowder was delicious (with homemade bacon bits).  My spouse and I shared a Porterhouse steak that was cooked to perfection; its quality right up there with pricier cuts in Manhattan.  The homemade steak relish (loved it); sides of sautéed spinach, sautéed onions with mushrooms complimented our steak very nicely.   Our chocolate desserts were delicious too.  Ruddy & Dean delivered a steak dinner on par with the best in Manhattan, at an affordable, reasonable price.   Thank you, Danny and Staff, I will be back.
