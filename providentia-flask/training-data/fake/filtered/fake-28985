The chicken wings here are the greatest I've ever had...but there's a problem you'll have to actively search for chicken wings on the menu...even then it's hard. THAT stinks but I can't in goon conscience take off starts for that. (I was tempted) No, really.  I promise you, if you look an employee at Dar for chicken wings they'll know what you mean (That's an assumption) Still, just to be safe, you should bring someone who hasn't slept on a futon his entire adult life.  THAT person might be able to translate your order and get you what you're looking for
