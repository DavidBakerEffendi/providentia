One of the worst eating experiences I've ever had.  The "salad," for which I paid $7, consisted of about 3 tablespoons of some sort of leaves and diced dried ham that was so salty I couldn't eat it, the "bread" consisted of a few half-moons of hard, dried-out bread that was also awash in salt, the tables are so tiny they can barely hold two plates, and so jammed together that I knocked the drink out of someone's hand when I and my friend tried to move to a table in a lesser traffic area.  Also:  the plates are paper and the flatware is plastic.
