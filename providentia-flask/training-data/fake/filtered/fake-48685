I enjoy food . I would never imagine having a favorite restaurant . But Empanada Mama changed that . I absolutely love this place. The food is amazing !!!!!! My favorite ? The Cuban, spinach and cheese , and the mambo Italiano !!   I would always come back here ! Everyone should try this place.  My server Melanie was very helpful and sweet .  I LOVE THIS PLACE
