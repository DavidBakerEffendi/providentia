I went here over Christmas with my boyfriend and it literally may have been the best meal of my life. The pork buns are DELICIOUS but the ramen trumps all. I still dream of that meal, even the soft-boiled egg in the ramen was perfect. I would skip the dessert next time, but just because I would want to fill my stomach with pork belly and steaming broth. I totally wish there were something similar in Chicago!
