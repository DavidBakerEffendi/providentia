Goods: Great pan cakes variety. Overall a good place for brunch. The waiter and waitress have great attitude. Bad: Totally overpriced, so cannot make frequent stops Ugly: The place has a long line for the most part, especially on weekends. Don't plan on sitting chatting after you are done. You will be kicked out. We honestly lost track of the fact that people were waiting after we had food. The owner was very rude and did not even come and ask us politely if we were done. He came and told us that we have to leave! Will never go again.
