We were not happy with the food. Waitress was great and the the food cold & dry. Don't order the cole slaw, was terrible. The baked beans were weird tasting too. The brisket was the best out of the sampling we had. Waste of good hard earned money. Nice little bar and I suppose if you get drunk enough the food would taste good. Skip this place....go to Dusty's down the street.
