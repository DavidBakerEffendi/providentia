Coffee is excellent! Poached egg with Haloumi - my poached egg was overcooked and completely solid inside. It was basically a boiled egg, some cheese, and a tiny piece of bread. My friend got the Mediterranean breakfast - Â very basic, just a few items anyone can pull out of their fridge. Waitress was not warm or hospitable at all, she just seemed like a robot. The seating is uncomfortable. They squeeze too many people in there so you will be dining with the patrons next to you. Happy to have checked this place out, but won't be returning.
