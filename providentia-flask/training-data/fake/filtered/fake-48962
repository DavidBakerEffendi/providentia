WOW! Casablanca Restaurant is amazing! You'll first be greeted by their warm and friendly staff, just as if welcomed into an old friend's home for dinner. The restaurant has some very nice decor that will immerse you in their atmosphere. You must try their Moroccan tea - very unique! Highly recommended is the bastilla - you will not be disappointed!!!!!!!!! Their tangines are so good, definitely try the honey and prunes lamb/chicken. Fantastic restaurant, fantastic staff, A++++++++++++++ would visit again!!!!
