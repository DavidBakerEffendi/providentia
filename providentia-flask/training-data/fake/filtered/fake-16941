This has long been a favorite neighborhood haunt of mine--for the yummy lates, great chicken sandwiches, waffles (cash only). So, I was stunned that after many years as a loyal patron I was denied a table for breakfast -- because I was alone!!! "We no longer seat singles at tables," the hostess told me. So, they allow duos and trios to sit at those lovely blue tables outside for hours and hours talking. But a single neighbor getting a quick bite is not allowed to sit there anymore--only inside at the bar if there is a seat. WTF?????
