I was so excited to try Mac Attack because I have a Gluten Allergy and have not been able to eat Mac&Cheese in years. I was so pumped to order my meal on a Friday night at work because this seemed too good to be true! And....it was. I placed an order for me and my two friends, and 5 minutes later they called back and said they couldn't make the gluten free orders because they ran out of prep and had to re-make it. When I asked how long it would be, they told me they couldn't tell me because 'in person' clients came first and they might get my order before I do... BUMMED.
