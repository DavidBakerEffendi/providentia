This was a great restaurant. We really enjoyed the food and wine, it was all delicious. I had the cod dinner and it was the best tasking cod i ever had. The presentation was beautiful and the service was excellent! The tables are a little small and the seating a bit tight which made us decide to go elsewhere for dessert. I would recommend making a reservation especially if you have more than 2 people in your party.
