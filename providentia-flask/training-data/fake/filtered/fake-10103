Two words: amazing gyros. The gyros are GREAT. If you go in and make an order, you can watch as the gyros are cooked right in front of you and served piping hot. The last time I went to Gyrolicious, the gyros were so hot, that by the time I got home, they had fogged up the windows of my car. True story. The side orders are nice, with favorites like french fries and onion rings. They have a pretty diverse menu, even serving breakfast at all times. I haven't been able to try their breakfast, but I guess it's nice to have on the menu, and I assume it would be amazing for people who get cravings for breakfast at night. The portions are great, and the prices are nice as well. At $5 a gyro, if I lived closer, I'd be eating from here a lot more often. If you're on the fence as to whether you want to try this place, or tired of the typical Staten Island pizza / chinese food fare, I absolutely recommend that you give Gyrolicious a try. Oh, and they deliver. :)
