Why ruin good food with so much salt? Well prepared good produce but 6/8 dishes were too salty. The gazpacho was almost inedible. We mentioned the problem to the waiter who commented "Are you unfamiliar with this chef? This is his signature style. Salty". Â One of our party ate little as the level of salt was so obvious he felt his blood pressure condition might cause problems. At 2am in the night, two of us met at the fridge gasping for water. Also the noise level meant we could not chat. They turned the music down a bit but soon cranked it back up. On my iphone it measured 84 decibels.
