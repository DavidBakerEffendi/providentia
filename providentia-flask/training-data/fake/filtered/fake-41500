My husband and I went here and it seemed kinda creepy late at night so we were so-so about going in.  I'm glad we did cause the place was awesome, the food was out of this world, and the service was terrific.  I got the chicken teriyaki, and I loved it.  He got some sushi and he is really picky with his sushi but he order more, he really liked it. :} I would definitively go to this place to eat some Japanese food.  I know were going back again.
