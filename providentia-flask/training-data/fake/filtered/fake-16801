We went for a birthday brunch on Sunday, and although we were seated late in the afternoon, most of the items on the menu were not available, and we were not informed of this until 25 minutes after we had placed our order. It took over an hour to get our food, even though the restaurant was not packed, and the entree portions were either really big or really small.  Overall, it was a disappointing experience.  Food was good but not worth the wait or the money.
