Beer selection is decent but it's hard to find variety between the other beer bars in New Haven.  Atmosphere is great.  Food is all right, but expensive.  My biggest qualm is the service.  You can sit at a table or at the bar and wait 15 minutes before even being acknowledged.  It always seems like they have a lot of staff there, but they are usually too busy talking to each other at the end of the bar.
