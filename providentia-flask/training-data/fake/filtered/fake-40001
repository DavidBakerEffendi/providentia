My husband and I had dinner here for my birthday and I have to say I was surprised in both good and bad ways.   Good: I was sure it was going to be terrible, like many of the p.r. driven places in the area, but the food was actually really good.  We had the chowder, the jamon salad, tuna tartar, scallops, and the trout., all of which were delicious followed by the best creme brulee and chocolate pudding ever.  The staff was nice, though not overly friendly, which I like.  And as far as price, I didn't think it was that bad.   but what I hated and I mean HATED: was the pacing.  The way that they brought our food out to us was terrible, my salad broke land speed records.  I could see the guy standing with our plates behind us in the mirror.  He motioned to a bus guy to check on us, and literally dropped our plates in front of us almost on top of our soup cups as they were being pulled away.  The same thing happened with our entrees.  I have worked in the service industry for years, and I understand wanting to get done with your night, but it wasn't that late.  We had a 9:30 reservation and we felt incredibly rushed.  We had cocktails and food ordered and out to us by 10:20 easily.   In short, good food but the speedy service spoiled the mood.  In my book, that's not casual dining, that's more what I expect from an dirty spoon diner.  I wouldn't have wanted to wait half an hour between courses, but  would have appreciated maybe 5 minutes to contemplate what we'd eaten, have a few sips of our cocktails, maybe run to the loo, and chat. I don't know right now if I'd go back.
