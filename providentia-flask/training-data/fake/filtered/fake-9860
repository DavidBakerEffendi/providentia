Favorite restaurant in the city.  As a NY'er you become a little jaded by all the great food here but the meal that I had here was a memorable one.  Cocktails are great, service is prompt and unobtrusive, and the food is amazing.  Great date spot and the bar had a nice lively atmosphere to it.  I would fight someone for the spicy lobster dish.  The duck breast was out of sight.  The desserts looked amazing but we were stuffed.  Next time.  Cannot recommend this place highly enough.
