I ordered dinner from here yesterday-and honestly -I have not had worse food in my life. there is food without taste-and there is food with BAD taste-this was very much the latter. I don't know how they put the dish together-without any sort of seasoning, spice etc. Even fried rice-which is the most difficult to mess up tasted so bad-that once my stomach was not growling anymore-I decided my tongue could no longer take it-and dumped everything down the garbage. Absolutely NOT NOT NOT recommended. Boil rice instead and have it with salt. it'll taste better Ordered based on the review from Yelp. Sorely disappointed.
