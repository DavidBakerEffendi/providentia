I just can't understand how this restaurant gets any good reviews.  Everything we had ranged from disappointing to bad except the olives and the tiny filet, which were good but not exciting.  The black cod was disgusting, the ham and bean soup was watery, the chicken was insipid, the manchego was probably good if you could find it but there was so little and it was sliced so thin it was invisible, the garlic shrimp was underspiced and waterlogged, the goat cheese and tomato was glop.  The bread that was served in very small quantities was boring and did nothing to enhance the dishes.  I think this restaurant is trying to exist of chef hype alone and it's not working.  I wonder if Garces has even been in there anytime recently.  So disappointed, and I dragged my son there for his birthday.
