The place was flowing and so was the wine!  I arrived at the restaurant early so waited at Bar Jamon until our table was ready and the sommelier was very knowledgeable and helpful.  We ordered a full bodied delicious bottle of red, Emilio Moro, reasonably priced and they carried it over to the restaurant for us when our table was ready.  Very hospitable and great customer service.  The food was amazing, rabbit, squid, scallops, pork belly and the artichokes with mint were delicious and cooked to perfection.  I would definitely recommend this place and will be back!  The dessert and dessert wine were a great finish to the meal and experience.  I highly recommend the Chocolate, Olive Oil, Sal de Mar.  The restaurant is quite packed with tables and limited space but the food makes up for it!
