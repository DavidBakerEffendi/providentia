I been to Mominette a while ago when it first opened but this weekend I found myself back at the same restaurant looks very different I so happened to try the salmon tartare I fell in love with it. If I was ask if there was any place that is to have  something to eat I would without a doubt recommend this restaurant. Indeed there must be a new chef because the food was done to perfection.  Great job and well done Chef.   It is also have a romantic atmosphere with a group of friendly staff in which their service can be a little better.
