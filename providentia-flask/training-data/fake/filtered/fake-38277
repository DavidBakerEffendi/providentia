I went here with some friends for my birthday dinner after finding this restaurant on a top new restaurants listing.   The menu looked amazing and it didn't disappoint.  Chef/owner Jonathan have us some samplings above our order and was incredibly generous and funny.  The fish tacos are amazing as are the oysters -either raw or fried.   The ceviche was delicious and although not a deviled egg fan, Union's smoked trout deviled eggs were very tasty.   It was loud at first when we came in but once happy hour was over it was a pleasant atmosphere with the doors open and the breeze coming in.   I would definitely go back.
