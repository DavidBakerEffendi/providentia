My favorite place to eat and drink in Northern New Jersey is now Poor Henry's.  Why? - Best beer selection around!!  - Jessie takes his time and finds beers that others are unaware or unwilling to add to their taps. - Amazing food!  - This place is much more than only wings and burgers - A bar that never feels too packed even when it is crowded. - Live music all weekend long. - Amazing people.  - A very diverse, but fun, crowd. - Amazing bartenders and servers!  - Kudos to Mike and Bob... - Ownership that cares about its customers!!!!!!!!
