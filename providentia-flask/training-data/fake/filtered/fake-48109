Well... Our first impression when we get there? Noisy and smelly. What a good start heh? The menu seemed okay to us, and we ordered a caprese and two main courses. The caprese was a joke. And when I mean I joke, I mean one of the lamest joke ever. 4 quarter of tomato, 4 slices of mozarella. Ok, it's an appetizer but still, it's not supposed to be inexistent as well is it? We first thought it was just another appetizer.. Oh, and by the way, the tomatoes were not that great, I mean, sometime you have to let the vegetables grow you know... Then the bread. Two slices. Not more. Well, if they wanted to seem like a cheap place to us, they did great! We tried other restaurants in this neighborhood, and as I remember, never ever we only get two slice of bread. Lame... Then the main course.. I had a rib eye steak. It was well cook, but hey! It was a 1lb rib eye steak, two or three vegetables and that for a 36$ pricetag?! Come on, you can prolly cook better yourself for 10$ at trader's joes... The other dish was really great. The finest cuisine ever. Meat and cheese and ham. Wait, really? Maybe there's something wrong. A clue: this dish comes from a European Country but there's no chances that this country is anywhere close to Italia, when spoken about cooking. Oh and it was fat, like, really. And don't even try to picture yoursefl eating those spinach. We had a great time. We never had such a great time thanks to a restaurant. But I'm scared we'll never have that feeling again. Ever.
