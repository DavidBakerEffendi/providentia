Very poor service on 2 different visits.  We were ignored for at least 10-15 minutes before anyone acknowledged we were in the restaurant and wanted to enjoy ourselves.  Great little local bar/restaurant - needs to develop a way to greet customers, give them a menu, get them a beer and let them know you appreciate their business!
