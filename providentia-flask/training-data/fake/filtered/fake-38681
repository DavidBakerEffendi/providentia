I had my birthday party there and we had a BLAST! The dinner was spectacular everyone loved their meal and wrote me after how much they enjoyed the food and ambiance. We ended up closing the restaurant down and were there for over 3 hours because the cocktails were so good! Highly recommend its my new favorite spot and all my friends say the same. I got the butternut squash ravioli and it was ridiculously good.
