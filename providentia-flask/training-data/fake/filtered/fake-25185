Let me clarify in advance that though I'm giving this place high marks, it is not Per Se or Le Bernardin. However, for a place where no entree tops $15, you will be hard pressed to find better food. Anywhere. The place is located 5mins from the the Marcy Ave stop in Williamsburg and is tiny. I mean the place seats like a dozen people tops, so it's great for a date, not a group dinner. Some of the seats look into the kitchen so you're able to see the chefs whip up your meal and chat with them as well. I came here with my girl a few nights ago, and being that it was BYOB, we brought a tasty bottle with us. She started with the endive and radicchio salad, and I had the duck confit. The salad had some interesting flavors and texture contrasts but I live my life a carnivore so it's not something for me. The duck confit on the other hand was something else. Oh man, you get a duck leg so crispy you can strike a match on the skin, but so tender you can take it apart with a spoon. It also came with this foie gras toast that made my day. I had the grilled short rib for my entree, which was well seasoned and well grilled. Though it was sliced thin, you get a great char on the outside but it was still juicy and pink on the inside. My girl got the kimchi bouillabaisse, which was a seafood extravaganza. It's seriously out of control. Unlike other seafood stews I've had where items are dropped in a pot and boiled, these guys take time to build up flavors; the scallops were seared off first before being added to the stew. The rice gnocchi helped thicken the broth, and also provided the carbs I'm always gorging myself on during meals. I didn't try dessert, but will definitely give it a shot the next time around. I can't wait.
