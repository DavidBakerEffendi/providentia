Food is very good. Got the Pint & a Pound for starters (lb of buffalo wings). Had an outstanding fried chicken sandwich with mashed potatoes. Table service was fair. We moved over to the main bar for a few more beers. Service was only fair there as well. They had a good (but wicked loud) live band on Friday night. We then dipped over to the attached whiskey bar. Sadly it was packed with hipsters; however, the Jameson was still Jameson and the bar maid was outstanding, so everything leveled out. I'd definitely give this place another shot.
