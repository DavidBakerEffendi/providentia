I finally made it to this place having heard people talk about it at the park.  The subs are huge and tasty and I had a hard time finishing a large sub.  I am glad that this sub shop opened in the neighborhood and the menu has a whole variety of options to choose your superhero sub from.  I will definitely go back to this place soon.   p.s. I tried the boom boom sauce on the sub and it was delicious!
