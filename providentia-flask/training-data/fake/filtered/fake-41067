If you're in NY, don't order those pizza by the slices that you see walking down the street because those are not fresh and will not do any justice to NY pizza. Do try Lombari's, wow awesome taste. We tried the clam pizza or clam pie they call it for $26, it can feed 2-4 people depending how much you eat. It is sauceless. Their salad was ok and I so wanted to try their regular pizza with tomato sauce that I saw on the table next to us. They ordered a simple pie with basil leaves and I loved the chucky mozerella slightly burnt by the oven. I will definitely go back there to try that!
