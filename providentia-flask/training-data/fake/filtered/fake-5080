Horrible! I wish I could give The Elbow Room ZERO stars! I was a student at CCSU for the past 4 years. During that time I've been to the Elbow Room on several occasions, but only twice for food. On both separate occasions, the food was pretty lousy. The service was notably slow. Once I turned 21 I started going to the side bar & using the basement dance area. The last time I was there, a black man (bouncer) came up to me (I'm now 24 yrs old) & told me that I needed to leave the bar immediately. I asked why because I had JUST arrived & hadn't even gotten a drink yet. He told me, "not that it matters but a girl that's dating one of the other bouncers says she doesn't want you here." UNREAL! He embarrassingly escorted me out. I asked to speak with a manager but was PUSHED out the doors & not allowed back in. I will never give this place my business again and I urge others to stay away from businesses that treat their customers with this amount of disrespect.
