My wife and I visited Mistral for the 2nd time and I must say that it is a truly wonderful experience. We enjoy every plate that comes from the open kitchen. There is obviously a great deal of preparation that goes into each plating and it is evident when it arrives.  Tonight we enjoyed the Hungarian Pork Belly and Tuna Tartare to begin, and ended up with the Lime Posset, Brown Butter Cake and Goat Cheesecake.  THEY WERE ALL AMAZING.  The servers are quite versed when it comes to the menu and everyone is very helpful.  We absolutely love this place and will certainly be back soon.
