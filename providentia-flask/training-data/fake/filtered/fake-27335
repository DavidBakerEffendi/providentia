Great food. Great service. Great location. My family and I went to Park Avenue Tavern new years eve for lunch, arriving just two minutes before their kitchen closed. Most places would turn people away so close to closing the kitchen, however they were very inviting and we had a great time. The food, service and atmosphere were so fantastic, we returned later that evening, cancelling our previous new years plans and had a great evening.
