I was in NYC for business recently. I went to this restaurant for dinner because it was close to my hotel and there were so many positive reviews on Yelp. Well, I have to say although the customer service was excellent the food was just okay at best. I ordered the squid ink pasta dish. The waiter was very accommodating to make a smaller portion for me as a side dish so I could order another entrée. I went to Venice a few years ago and LOVED the squid ink pasta there. However, the one I had in this restaurant was nothing like that! The pasta didn't have much flavor and the tomato sauce was very salty. I ordered the seafood risotto as my entrée because many reviews on Yelp recommended it. I also didn't really enjoy it. It was very creamy and pretty salty too. I didn't even finish it. The highlight was the customer service. The waiter from south Spain was very attentive and warm. The manager was also very nice. Overall I wouldn't recommend this restaurant if you are looking for some good Italian food in the area.
