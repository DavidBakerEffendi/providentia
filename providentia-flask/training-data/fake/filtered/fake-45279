Visited Maggie McFly's on a snowy Saturday night.  My party of 4 was seated immediately in a very comfy round/corner style table.  Service was fantastic - attentive and speedy without hovering.  Server was charming and knowledgeable. HUGE variety of menu items - almost too many to choose from.  Blue cheese burgers were dy-no-mite.  Hubby said the lobster mac and cheese was okay - not bad but not stellar.   Prices were reasonable.  Atmosphere was open, fun yet high backed seats provided privacy.  This is NOT a fast food burger joint - it's a family friendly, upbeat restaurant No slimey pick up artists, players or people looking to 'hook up' - at least in the dining room area.  (Can't speak to the bar scene.) It is nice to be served a grown up meal on a real plate with a cloth napkin. Just wish there were coat hooks beside the tables for out coats. :-)
