We went here and let me say...best French place ever! From great customer service, which included the chef who actually came out to greet customers, to the delicious food (the duck is definitely the best dish followed by the pork tender loins!), I could not have asked for anything more from a nice, small bistro. We also had the foi gras as an appetizer and the crembule for desert...both were mouth watering! The atmosphere was very elegent yet relaxed and cool. The service was incredible, as the waitresses were very friendly and conversational. Everything came out perfect and I had zero complaints...definitely the best place in town for a nice dinner. Mes Reves is a hidden gem in New Jersey, but all of you should go find it immidietely!!!!!
