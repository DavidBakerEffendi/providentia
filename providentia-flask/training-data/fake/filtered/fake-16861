Ate there last night for a girls dinner. We had to wait about half an hour for our 10pm table but it was worth it. The food was fresh and interesting. The toast appetiser was great. My halibut fish entree (main) was also great, as were the other fish dishes I tasted. Desserts were fun, esp the donuts (suprised!). Service was good, and the docor is beautiful. They were gracious even as we were the last table (we did get seated pretty late). Definitely worth a visit. I wish I could take the raw wood round table home....
