Here's the deal. The beer list is good.  Not amazing in this day and age, but good.  And that's it.  The bartender (a guy with curly hair who looks like Eric Bogasian who may also be the owner), cannot pour a drink to save his life.  We tried his cocktails, they were without flavor, and also $16.  What a joke for such a bad bartender to have the audacity to charge that price.  We got whiskey and the pour was so weak.  Just  a little small amount.  $14.  What is worse than a bartender with a lame pour?  Especially when we were tipping well per drink and there is so much competition.   The prices here are very expensive, the music was awful, and it was filled with frat boys and girls singing along to early 1990's songs.  It was that bad.  Way too many places in the city to go without that lame of a atmosphere and bartenders who know how to pour.  Go here if you're in your second year at NYU and daddy is picking up the tab.
