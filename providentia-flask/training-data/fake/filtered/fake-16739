This place is typical of W. Village bars -- boring yuppy clientele and "bridge and tunnel" types from NJ and LI (Just look at the the types that wrote good reviews for this place). The night I went, they played great music, including Joy Division, Blonde Redhead, Arcade Fire, and LCD Soundsystem, but of course the crowd was such that they wouldn't know how to appreciate the music. The people who worked there seemed to know what's up, but in terms of clientele, the place was infested with culturally-clueless button-down-shirt types and girls that weren't exactly lookers. The place isn't big, but there's some room to dance, but of course nobody was dancing. The only action you might see are drunk ugly couples making out in full view of the bar. Unless you're the lame type of person who actually enjoys this type of bar, head over to the East Village or Brooklyn to get a taste of some real nightlife experience.
