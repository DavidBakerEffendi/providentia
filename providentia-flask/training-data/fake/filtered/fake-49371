El Vez is gorgeous from the outside, wonderful design and a welcoming ambiance. There's only one catch... The poor service and mediocre food. The waitresses are extremely cold and uninviting, almost snobby until they hand you your check. The most inviting part of the staff were the hostesses. If you're paying 14 dollars for a salad, there should be some sort of flavor and pizzazz that goes along with it. It was extremely bland in taste as well as unattractively placed on the plate. Customer service is everything and if it doesn't exist in a restaurant you're out of luck. That was the main reason for the one star given to El Vez. Final description of this restaurant includes the words: snobby, overpriced, unfriendly, and uncomfortable. Although it's beautiful to look at, it's not a beautiful experience.
