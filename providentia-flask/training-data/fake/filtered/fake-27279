I guess brunch is a good time to go here, but I've never been at brunch, I've only been for dinner, and each time it's excellent. If you can manage to get there around 7 you're usually there early enough to beat the crowd that piles in shortly after. I've been several times before but it's been a while and so the ravioli that I loved was no longer on the menu. The waitress was nice enough though to make a suggestion and said the linguini w/ shrimp was excellent, and that it was! I also had one of the specials for the night which was the soft shell crab tossed in semolina and flash fried server over a cod fish potato salad type thing, it was absolutely delicious my bf and I devoured it in no time. I've never had any complaints about the food here, I will admit though that it can be a good wait before you get your food but, to me, it's worth it. If you sit on the side you can see in the kitchen and when they did have the ravioli I saw them making them by hand, do for freshly prepared food I'll wait the little extra. I also love the decor in this place! But I will say I don't think I'd fully categorize this place as a French restaurant, there are some items that are French but there's also plenty of non French foods, but they are delicious either way!
