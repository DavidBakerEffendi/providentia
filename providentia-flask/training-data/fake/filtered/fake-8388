Not only are their cheesecakes amazing but their food is too.  I try to go to Anthony's for lunch as many times as I can.  You get really good, fresh food for a reasonable price.  Their menu changes everyday so I always get to try something different every time I go in.  You can write down your email address and they'll email you their menu daily.  I definitely recommend trying this place out, you"ll definitely get hooked.
