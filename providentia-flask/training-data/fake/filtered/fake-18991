Noodles are far above the standard Chinatown place (I highly recommend the thicker ones).  I had the mixed fish ball noodle soup and the fishballs were amazing.  My friend had ox tail, which was enough to make her call this "her new favorite place." On the downside, the soup broth was bland, but after some soy/white pepper/chili paste it worked out fine.
