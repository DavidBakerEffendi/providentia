On Saturday, August 3, 2013 while en route to Princeton for a 4:00 pm event my friend and I saw this restaurant in this strip mall and decided to stop. The hostess greeted us warmly and when we inquired about the buffet that we saw set up she informed us that the buffet was over however she would talk to the manager on our behalf. She did and he said that we could have whatever was left and there would be no refills. No problem, we were hungry and in a hurry. The food was DELICIOUS!!! You could taste spices. Unlike some ethnic restaurants that water down the favors, iSpice does not. The food was delicious and the staff was hospitable, friendly, and very nurturing. I give this restaurant 5 stars and even more. We were treated with respect and they made us feel welcome!
