It was a buffet but throughout the whole meal, the server was so rude.  I'm not sure if he was the owner or not. But I will never go back there.  the day prior I bought a coupon that was $15 for $30 and the bill came to $22.00 and he was not going to honor it. We did not know the price of the buffet meal because it was not posted anywhere.  Eventually he did accept my coupon when I ordered 4 mango drinks and gave 2 of them to our neighbors (the bill came to $30 at that point).
