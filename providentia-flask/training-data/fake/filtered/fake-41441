just came back from having dinner at this terrible restaurant. Â i don't really understand how people rated this place 5 stars, the only explanation can be that you just don't know about fine cuban cuisine and if you don't do yourself a favor and go to Cuba Restaurant in the Village. There you can really experience what real delicious cuban cuisine it's all about. Never will i go back to rincon i would say the only decent thing was the coconut flan everything else was like being in a greasy cuchofrito in the middle of the worst part of a village. the only reason why i gave it a star is because they don't have half of star rating.
