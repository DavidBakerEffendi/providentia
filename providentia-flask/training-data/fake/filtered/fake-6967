I went to the restaurant this weekend with my husband. Although we had to wait alittle while for our food bc the restaurant was so busy, and has just recently opened, I am happy to say I was very pleased with our meal. Â The manager came to apologize for the wait and make sure everything was ok, which we appreciated. Also we were informed about entering to win a gift card to the restaurant, which signs you up for their email letter that includes specials at the restaurant. Ps the salad bar was great! Lots of choices.
