A great place to go with a few friends, but look elsewhere if you have a very large party. The food itself was excellent, but the portions could have been a bit bigger. It wasn't terribly overpriced, and the wait staff was extremely friendly. Their drink list is decent, and they definitely give you your moneys worth in vodka, as my drink was INCREDIBLY strong. It has a young, attractive crowd and apparently David Beckham has been known to swing by this restaurant. Enjoy.
