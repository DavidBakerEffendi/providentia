The ciabatta, sweet chili sauce, and medium rare beef is what makes the Bronte Burger so perfect. Best meal I've had in a long time! Menu is simple. Burgers and chicken sandwiches and a few smoothies.  The signature burger is called the Bronte and they really do things a bit differently on the burger front.  First, you get a side of field greens so you can ease your conscience a bit after just having gotten over your hangover.  The burgers are served on a longer French roll and are topped with sweet chili sauce.  I'm telling you, the sauce just puts these burgers over the top!  The smoothies are solid as well and I'd recommend the strawberry - banana.   Oh-Ruby's-how i wish you were in Brooklyn too! My mouth is watering just at the possibility of your amazingness in my stomach - and I'm not even hungry!
