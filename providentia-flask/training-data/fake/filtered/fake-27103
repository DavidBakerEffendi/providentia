Hon Sushi is a great Korean and Japanese restaurant in Lawrenceville NJ. Over the winter break, I visited this restaurant with my family. When we walked in the door the restaurant was decorated for Christmas with a beautiful Christmas Tree. We were met by a kind waiter who took us to a table. The atmosphere of the restaurant was completely relaxing. The lights were dim and there was faint music in the background. The menu is very diverse, giving the costumer many choices from many cultures. I enjoyed the Beef Bulgolgi Buns and the Dolsot Bibimbap. The BB Buns bridged both Chinese and Korean cuisine in a way I have not seen before. The Dolsot Bibimbap is a Korean classic served in a hot stone bowl that cooks your meal right in front of you. It was a surreal experience and I would highly recommend this dish to others. I recommend this restaurant to anyone who enjoys Asian cuisine. It is fairly priced and the menu is excellent.
