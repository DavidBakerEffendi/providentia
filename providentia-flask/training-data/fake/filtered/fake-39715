We were invited for this restaurant by friends who described themselves as very picky and were really excited going to this restaurant. When we entered to the main sitting area this place was packed and very noisy almost like entering a bar. The food and the wine were very good but miniature quantities. I understand that you want to be exclusive but to give a soup size less than a cup? This all could be fine except for the high price for the food and we stayed hungry. Even this I could forgive but not that night that followed both my husband and me had a problem all night and had to run to the bathroom so I do not get more descriptive. I know that everyone is saying that this is a great restaurant but unfortunately this has been our experience. I am wondering if anyone else had the same.
