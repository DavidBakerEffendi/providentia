Racial Sterotyping- I have been going to this restaurant for over 6 years, my best friend and I would visit frequently to enjoy the food. I was there today and when paying for my meal the debit card machine was giving the attendant some trouble. He called over the owners youngest son to troubleshoot the machine. When the son came over he instantly said "you have no money", I replied "I assure you there is plenty of money on that card". He then turned to my sister and said "how are you going to pay for this if her card doesn't work"? He ran the card again and then turned to me and said "your welfare card doesnt work"! I was shocked and horrified as there were other customers behind us waiting to pay as well (which they found his comments amusing). The son then tested the phone line to find out that someone was using the phone and that is why the machine wouldn't process my card. When the payment went thorough I told the son that he should retract his horrible accusation of me being broke and on welfare, he claimed he did no such thing. It saddens me how people make assumations about people without knowing anything about them. I am Latina, it doesnt mean that because I am Latina that I am broke and on welfare!!! I wake up everyday, and work hard to provide for my son and I. Working in the Human Services sector myself, I do not have any issue with folks who are on the system. Some may or maynot be taking advantage of it, however, I am no one to judge or try and figure that out. I am sure that there are many folks that truly need the assitance they recieve. The owner was apologetic, sad to say I WILL NEVER RETURN!
