I'm a fan of grimaldi's. Â The pizza isn't the best, but still good. The service is quick, but you might be waiting a while to get a table. The staff is friendly, until you ask more than 3 questions. Prices are cheap. And don't pull out a credit card, that kind of sorcery is not accepted here, according to the waiter.
