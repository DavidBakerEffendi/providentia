Bam, why can't other sandwich shops take the hint of every Cuban place and offer an incredible sandwich for a normal price? This place is cheap and awesome. Despite being packed, they have a separate line for Cuban sandwiches only. I was able to get three sandwiches, fried plantains, and pay via credit card within five minutes. The staff was friendly, listened to special orders and took the trouble to separate the odd-sandwich among the others (no pickles for my friend). Probably ranks as the best lunch deal I've found in TSquare, and the sandwich was incredible.
