The sandwiches are delicious and made fresh daily.  My personal favorites are the Dehli (curried chicken salad with slivers of hard cooked egg), Capri (proscuito on sourdough bread with olive oil instead of mayo), and their roast beef sandwich.  They also have a limited selection of salads which are delicious.  Their morning pastries are reasonably priced and delicious as well.  If you are looking for a great lunch spot definitely check this place out.
