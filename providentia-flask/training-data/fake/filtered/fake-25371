Mompou is def a place that is not your typical restaurant in the Ironbound.  Yes its Spanish but not the same plates or crowd that you would find everywhere else.  The best part is that you can taste a bit of everything, hence the tapas portions.  The servers are pretty friendly, but I would suggest making reservations for Thursday through Saturday, especially if you are going to a concert or game nearby.  The outdoor seating is also a plus and at times quieter than the inside of the restaurant.
