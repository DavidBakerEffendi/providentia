Tucked off of Route 10 in East Hanover, The Market Place is one of our favorite places to go to for lunch. Their salads are HUGE. Get the antipasto one if you want an incredible meal. LOVE their sandwiches. And, even though I have never been a big fan of thin crust pizzas, I have to say the one's at the Market Place are delicious. Great ambience. It is so woodsy and warm, I never want to leave. And, I have never had bad service and find the employees to always be very nice when we eat there.
