1. Very Dirty. There is no washing of hands or basil before putting them on your pizza. Bathroom makes me want to vomit. Reported them to the health inspectors who told me they had shut them down in the past for rat feces. 2. LONG wait, it is not 45 min, it is closer to 2 hours even if the place is empty. They serve you in any order they want. He will serves Blacks and non whites last. He will serve locals before tourists. Dom will also not say hi to non whites. 3. If you have asthma or COPD do not go the ventilation is very poor and he burns his pies which creates alot of smoke 4. All the toppings are from a can except the basil which is from a box. The cheese is from Costco. The absolute worst part is the pizza is just ok, nothing special.
