Here in the upper valley Carpenter & Main is definitely our one fine restaurant.  Bruce MacLeod has done a great job since taking over from Peter Ireland and I've never been disappointed with the food.  Keep an eye out for special wine-tasting dinners as they are quite a treat (and they don't skimp on the wine!)  They have a full bar, and the tavern room is just as good as the more formal dining rooms.  They also have a great staff.
