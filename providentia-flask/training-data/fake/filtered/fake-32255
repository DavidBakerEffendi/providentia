We were so disappointed by what we ordered. We went for brunch with friends and ordered the things that no restaurant that is rated at least a 3 should mess up ever. We ordered eggs benedict, eggs florentine, the soup of the day, and french toast. The egg dishes were terrible with strong tastes of vinegar on their eggs. The potatoes that came with the eggs were very bland and definitely not memorable in any good way. The soup was not tasty and in such small portion. The french toast was probably the worst. How do you mess up french toast? It was very soggy, not fluffy at all. The raspberry jam topping was overly tart and there were only 3 pieces of french toast, as to 4. Why the strange number? THe waiters were not friendly at all: they did not invite us in while we waited outside, they hurried us with the bill before we were done figuring out splitting the bill.
