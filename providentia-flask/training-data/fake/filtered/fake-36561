Let me start by saying that i LOVE BBQ. I could eat Ribs any day of the week. But, I probably would never order them from Percy street BBQ. They were practically flavorless, although cooked to an appropriate temperature. My friend and I both ordered the double down, had the ribs, chicken, and brisket (the brisket being the absolute winner). I love eating crispy chicken skin, and I couldn't even stomach a few bites of the chicken; it had a very rubbery consistency. I was intrigued by the Root Beer Chili, and was sadly disappointed (not to mention it was luke warm at the very most). Beer choices were good, but I didn't want to eat at Percy Street because of the alcohol. Dessert, however, made the experience. The Pecan Pie was heavenly! Banana Pudding was really thick, but tasty nonetheless. Service, however, was awful. Our server was aloof and inattentive. Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted rather awkwardly by a manager. I can justify a sort of absent minded server when a restaurant is busy, but i can't when there are literally two other tables seated in the restaurant who are on dessert. There are a bunch of simple things that should be done during service that weren't. And from working in a restaurant, i understand how those little things can either make or break an experience. I was disappointed in the food and service enough that I don't have the desire to return for seconds. And i never say no to seconds when it comes to BBQ.
