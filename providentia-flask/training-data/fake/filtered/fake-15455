The food was ok, service not so much, unfortunately. I visited during happy hour with a friend, we were forced to sit at the bar. This would not have been a problem, had the bar not been designed to sit only 10 people! We were offered a menu and I ordered a drink after telling the bartender I would be ordering food in a minute or so. She never came back to ask. I spent the next fifteen minutes desparately trying to at least make eye contact just to order hummus. By the time I accomplished that, it was time for another drink. Here we go again. My glass was empty, I even moved it a bit closer to the edge to indicate that I was ready for another.  I gave up and I had to  ask the other bartender  working on the other end. He then alerted the woman who was supposed to be serving me. She tried to apologize explaining that she didn't hear me when I looked in her face and asked her for a drink. Now I have my drink finally, all is well right?? Wrong the same bartender that had no idea that even existed  miraculously noticed me long enough to ask me to move one seat down so a couple could sit together. Ask is being nice. She was about to grab my things for me. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?! Why the bartender and hostess expected me to assist with their seating is completely beyond me. It was tacky and tasteless. Something I would expect at a TGIF Friday's. Then to end it all I snagged my jacket on an unkept door hinge! This city is full of great restaurants, there is nothing significant about this place to warrant a repeat offense. I recommend you go somewhere where you can enjoy the food as well as the service.
