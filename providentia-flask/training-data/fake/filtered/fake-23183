Don't buy into the hype. I really don't understand the long lines of people waiting at this cart. I guess some people go because of word-of-mouth. Some are tourists who wanna try the famous new york cart food and they see a long line, so they assume this is the one to try. Halal carts are very hit and miss in the city. I usually employ the walk and smell technique where i take one sniff at the food and if it smells good, I try it. This has yielded mixed results but I've more times than not ended up with a good plate. The food at this cart is best summed up in one word: BLAND. The meat isn't seasoned enough so it requires a large amount of the famous white sauce to add any flavor. The rice is too plain. This place was actually decent about 5 years ago but the quality of the food has really took a nose dive. If people would actually try some of the lesser known carts around town, they'd see that notoriety doesn't necessarily equate quality.
