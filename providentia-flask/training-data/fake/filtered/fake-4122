The beer selection here is amazing. I love that they refer to the cheap american beers as shiza beers. The atmosphere is is casual and the crowd depends on the night. The staff is great, especially the bartenders who put on great music. The food is great, but sometimes they run out. I was here once and they ran out of schnitzel and sauerkraut! Â They only have one bathroom, which can be dirty and have a long line if it is buy. Overall this place is worth trying. It's a great German bar, cheaper than Brauhaus Schmitts, and is in a great location.
