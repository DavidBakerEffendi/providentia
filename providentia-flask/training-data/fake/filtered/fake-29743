A perfect blend of attentive, expert service and top notch execution by the friendliest french chef to grace the streets of philadelphia.  I went in with some buddies visiting from out of town and we nearly ordered the entire menu.  Every dish was top notch and i had to eat fast to get to everything before my companions polished some dishes off.  A great dining experience.
