The best ramen in NYC! If you really enjoy great ramen, and have seen the movie "Tampopo" you know how hard it is to create that great tasting, mouth-watering broth. Well, Ippudo comes close to it. The ramen is the best tasting broth I have had here in New York. Don't listen to those who fringe on paying money for good food, just think of the moment your mouth comes into contact with the ramen, broth, and pork. Delicious to the last drop. While some ramen places are very stingy with the pork portions, I think Ippudo does a great job serving up more than 2 pieces. If you are a foodie, don't think about the prices, just go for finding the perfect bowl of ramen, cause here you just about find it!
