I'm an NYU grad student.  My department is right across the street from this cart and I ate there at least twice a week for lunch all last spring.  The prices cannot be beat. People have reviewed the dosas and the meals they have (fantastic food @ fantastic prices).  My favorite is to get two huge samosas for $3, enough food for a meal.
