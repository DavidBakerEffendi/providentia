Best sushi within 20 miles of where I live! I like this place alot.  it has decent ambience, service is fine, food is very good.  i LOVE the Hulk Roll! Their wine selection is unexciting and they seem to always be out of whatever my first or second selection was. It's a bit too much of a bar scene when you're with family if you're seated out front, but other than that, the ambience is nice. The food is pretty awesome!  I really havent had anything bad there (in my three visits).  Their menu is a little unclear and all three times Ive been there, everyone at the table has had a different version of the menu. ANyway, it's the best around here (in my opinion) and I cant wait to go back!
