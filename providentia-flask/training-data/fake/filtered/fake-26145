While it looked like a usual Chinese fast food place. My daughter and I were surprise by the fast service. My main interest was the Wong tong soup. It was very tasty had me wanting more. The Fried Noodles and Shrimp was A delight Â My daughter Connie loved her portions of noodles and the great tasting Pork strips, they were so fresh and tasty! The tea was great! We will return for sure to munch,munch.
