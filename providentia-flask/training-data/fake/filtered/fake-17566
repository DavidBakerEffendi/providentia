A group of 6 of us sat in a cozy corner booth a few nights ago and were joined by an unwelcome guest: we spotted a cockroach running along the top of our booth. Â After some of us jumped up out of our seats and a neighboring diner screamed, one of the hosts came over. Instead of offering of an apology or making any attempt to comfort us, he simply told us he had spotted a cockroach 2 days earlier and walked back to the hosts' stand. Although the food was delicious and our server was great (and also tried to comfort us with complimentary rounds of drinks), I doubt I will be returning to Jane anytime soon. Cockroaches are obviously not unheard of in NYC, but the management team's lack of concern for our dining experience--and the restaurant's cleanliness--is unacceptable service for such a place with its reputation and menu prices.
