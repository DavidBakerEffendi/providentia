While I'm from NY, I like to think I know pizza. Everyone has their fave, but if you want NY style pizza, I like Cafe Antonios. The owner is from Italy. The staff is always nice. The prices are great and they always have deals. I live outside of the area, but when I'm on my way home I stop here if I'm up for pizza. We order pizza at work that is from Robbinsville that does not come near to the quality of Antonios. I like thin crust, double cheese and there's never doubt there's double cheese. I'll be back! A++
