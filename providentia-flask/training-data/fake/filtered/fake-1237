Love The Pines. It was truly a magical experience. The space is great, the food is amazing and the staff is lovely. That was a meal I will remember for a long time. At first glance the dishes seemed simple but revealed their complexity and the thoughtfulness with each bite. Kudos, cant wait to come back.
