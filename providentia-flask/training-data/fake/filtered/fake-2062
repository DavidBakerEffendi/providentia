I had been looking forward to going to Northern Spy for a few weeks because it looked good whenever I passed by.  Well today I finally had brunch there and it was a disaster.  The kitchen must be filthy. My oatmeal came complete with a big piece of PLASTIC BAG mixed in with the oats.  Disgusting.  Couldn't eat another bite of anything else after that.  Who could?  Health department alert.  Avoid.
