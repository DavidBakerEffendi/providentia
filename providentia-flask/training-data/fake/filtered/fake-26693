Wow! Just one word - Excellent!! Love the new look - bright and fresh feel. The menu selection system is very cleverly done: you walk up to the server line, make your selections (many toppings to chose from), pay at the end of the line and you take your plate with you. From order start to sitting at my table with a full plate was less than 3 minutes! Excellent system for me with a busy schedule. Had Chicken Shawarma Salad Bowl. Food was fresh, the Vegetables were crisp, and the taste was phenomenal. Definitely will come back!
