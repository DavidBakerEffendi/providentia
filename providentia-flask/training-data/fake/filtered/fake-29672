Great Burgers.  Very downtown NYC.  The sliders are really great.  I've been coming here everytime I'm downtown.  My mother lives on 5th across from the Metropolitan so she sometimes shakes her head at me for being so "bohemian" in her words!  But actually she is 83 and she always says lets go down to that place in the East village and get a burger.  It's like a shrine from her!  And well, I thorougly enjoy the East village so it's a win win for me.
