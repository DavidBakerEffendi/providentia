The food is disappointing. You will read mixed reviews and this is why: Maderas is not what it used to be. The first Yelp review on this restaurant dated 2007 was for Roque's Mexican restaurant. We also liked that restaurant very much. This is not the same quality. Maderas is different ownership and is currently serving mediocre food. It might be the same sort of menu and style, but the flavor went from great to average. Last night's meal was a disappointment. We ate outside which is the main reason I gave three stars and not less. The outside is worth 5 stars and the food is about 1.5 stars. Each of the three meals ordered was a disappointment. Either tasteless, or tough, or generally boring. I wanted to email ownership and let them know my sadness of the loss of a great restaurant and found their web site is defunct. So I write this, not so much to warn you as perhaps to kick start some interest to try and get back what they had. The corn tortillas are still hand made on site. The free salsa and bean dip provided prior to ordering is flavorful. The outdoor atmosphere is great. The rest of the meal was nothing like it used to be. We did not have drinks, which might make the rating higher for some, but as I watched the person prepare these, I sensed she was filling a prescription and not making something great. My daughter who has wanted to return here on a number of occasions, said she would not want to eat here again, her stomach did not feel good after. It was reasonably priced for what it was. I might eat here again if only for the outside dining.
