This is one of those places that no matter what you wanna try you will leave happy you tried it!! Â This isn't by no means the typical pasta & meatballs Italian restaurant but their food is italian with a fresh twist. Their soups are always spot on and their artichoke w/ roasted vegetable and goat cheese tapas is my favorite!! For dessert you must try their panacota and their hazelnut hot chocolate. The service is great and atmosphere is cozy!! love it! This place is a date spot for my hubby and I.
