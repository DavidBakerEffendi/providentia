Great place to enjoy a nice weekend brunch or beer without dealing with the massive lines at places like Sabrina's and Morning Glory! Awesome menu that is relatively cheap and the make-your-own-bloody-mary-bar is hit! The veggie burger is indeed as awesome as people have been saying it is (I got mine with bleu cheese and it rocked!). For those complaining about the lack of TVs the place does have a projector that it pulls down, making it a nice and spacious place to watch Eagles playoffs games. Caught the game last week and I can't begin to tell you how nice it was to be able to sit at the bar and drink awesome beer (Lagunitas on tap! $4 yards ipa!) rather than scrounging around for shitty football specials featuring coors light or bud light. Haven't been during the week ( have heard the quizzo is excellent), but can definitely say that I'll be checking this place out for brunch and the eagles game again!
