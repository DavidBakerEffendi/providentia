We went to Cafeteria and waited at the bar area for our table (even though we were told we didn't need reservations when we called). The bar area smelled like filthy dishrag. The sloppy mess of some mystery sauce on the floor at our table was cleaned up only after we asked. Our waiter took our order and did not make another appearance until he rudely threw the check on our table (after we had to ask the busboy for it). We sat with empty drinks and dirty dishes in front of us. If there was a manager, he certainly wasn't supervising. Totally disappointing experience and we vow to NEVER return to Cafeteria. THUMBS DOWN!!
