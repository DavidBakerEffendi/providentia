Worst experience I ever had at a Japanese restaurant!. The waitress was rude and snippy. There were 4 of us- 3 ordered the all-you-can-eat and the 4th ordered another special (same price) that included an appetizer, entree and dessert. When the waitress started to bring over food she told the 4th person, "Do NOT eat" Okay I understand the whole concept of "you can't share" but come on really??? The person was embarrassed and so was I.The food came out at very odd times. For example, the 4th person got a steak 20 minutes before we got any roles. The waitress forgot to put in our role order and we only got 2 roles. When we asked about it she was very rude!!!! The whole experience was horrible. It wasn't a cheap bill either. They offered to take 15% off but I argued to take an all-you-can-eat price off because one person didn't get any sushi at all! I emailed them to say how upset I am (because I am an regular customer) and I didn't get any reply. Â DON'T GO!!! Go to Kumo or Sushi X instead.
