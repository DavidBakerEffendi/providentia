I have eaten here with my girlfriend on April 30, 2013 during our vacation in New York City. We took advantage of the free ferry to Staten Island and had a short walk along the coast. During the walk we arrived at this restaurant. Although the restaurant didn't look very special, we were hungry and went inside. The outside aswell the inside is simple, but it very clean. Also the staff was very friendly. After a short look at the menu we ordered our food. The food was very tasty and the vegetables tasted fresh. I myself had taken a cheeseburger and it tasted excellent, one of the best I've had so far! The staff worked very clean with gloves on. That you often don't even see in upscale restaurants. You don't have to come here for the looks. It looks more like a local diner ... which it probably is. However, the food tasted good and the view on Manhattan (and New Jersey) is really fantastic!
