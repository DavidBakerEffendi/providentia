Like it.  Spent a few weeks in Brugge and the beer was comparable (bottle's a bottle, but the drafts were solid).  The food was very good and the service not so smarmy as Monk's.  The crowd was not trying hard, which is how I like it.  If I'm going to pay good money for comfort food -- tasty or not -- I don't need to wash it down with smarm.  Met the owner and he was a good egg. Only thing I'd didn't like (on a Friday night early) was the bartender's (assume s/he made the call) horrible taste in music.  Post-modern thrash/screetchy/freaky stuff.  Would have preferred listening to a rheumatic SEPTA bus. WIll likely do my bachelor party there upstairs.  Perfect for laughing, drinking, and conversation (less the screetchy AIDS Thrift music).
