the sushi rice stinks. they used cheap sushi rice. Â they place is very nice, but too dark i can't see a thing. the waiters messes up your orders and give your food to another table. their spicy sushi sauce was too spicy.. plus its pretty expensive. i go to other sushi places which is a lot cheaper with sushi tasting pretty damn good.
