DON T WASTE UR MONEY!!!! I recently moved to the Woodbridge Area. I use to leave in the Morris County Area near Mendham and Chester. I decided to visit Castello for my first time last night. WOW..What an experience. When I arrived, I had to wait over 30 minutes to see a menu. I tried to order 2 different wines but they did not have it in stock. I decided to try the Pinot Grigio since the manager, Joe, recommended which was HORRIBLE! The wine tasted like water. My reservation was at 8:30pm, and I did not get to place an order till 9:30pm. I am Colombian and my boyfriend is from Uruguay. We were completely ignored by the waiter. We were sitting there with our menus closed, and our waiter walked right passed us and continued to serve the other tables. I have NEVER been stereotyped in a restaurant before last night. My boyfriend and I were soooooo ANGRY that we left the restaurant and went to La Griglia in Kenilworth, NJ. We highly recommend La Griglia !!! Fabulous food and service and without the prejudice attitude!!
