Food is all right, nothing really special -- one of our party was very disappointed, dishes for the other three were okay but not great.  If it were $8 for a personal pizza it would be worthwhile.  But when you leave the table having paid more than $75 for three smallish pizzas with pretty skimpy toppings, plus one pasta dish -- no drinks (not even non-alcoholic) & no desserts -- it feels overpriced.  The bread and dipping oil was good, and the atmosphere was festive.
