We ordered this for delivery yesterday for some food while watching football. Food was already cold by the time it got here, and for $20 there was surprisingly little food, might not even be enough for one hungry person. The food itself was OK, but nothing special that warrants the prices that they have. I read about this place a lot and heard a lot of good things about it, but it didn't really live up to my expectations.
