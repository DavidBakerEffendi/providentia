Although this restaurant was recommended to me by several friends over the last year or so, I finally decided to try it last night after it came up in conversation Sunday evening. I am very sorry it took me so long to get there. They serve the best Potuguese food I've had in NJ. We started with the Shrimp in Garlic Sauce, which was much better than most versions of this dish that you find in other Iberian eateries. We then ordered the chicken soup and Caldo Verde, which were both tasty, however the Caldo was a bit viscous. For mains we chose the Shrimp stuffed with crabmeat and the Carne de Porco com Ameijoas ( Pork with Clams) which were both delicious and ample portions. Desserts were also excellent, especially the flan. We had no complaints about the service, either, although I noticed that some of the other reviewers were not pleased. Perhaps because it was a Monday night, it was not over-crowded. We will definitely return in the near future!
