What a great place!  Must have eaten here over 50 times and never has there been a glitch in the fast service and perfect food.  Great service, perfect execution, and amazing value explain why the place is always packed.  If you're looking for a quiet dining experience, this isn't the place for you.  But if you're in the area and want a quick, high quality lunch, you're in the right place.  Fajitas, Route 66 Chopped Salad and Salmon San Sebastian are awesome.
