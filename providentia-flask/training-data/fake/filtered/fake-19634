Another fantastic dining experience last night!  My only "tiff" is that they have not yet acquired a liquor license.  My husband and I like to enjoy some cocktails before and after dinner.  When we asked the Manager, he said that the liquor license is still in the works.  Lack of a liquor license will NOT prevent us from coming back because the food is absolutely phenomenal!  We are very much looking forward to a bar/lounge area!
