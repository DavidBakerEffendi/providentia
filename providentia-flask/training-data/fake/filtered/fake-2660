Excellent restaurant, fresh seafood, you cannot beat the lobster deal or the oysters. Everything foodwise is great about this place. Now why did I not give it a higher star rating, well the wait is VERY long almost all the time for this place. I would say hr+ no matter when I go for dinner anyday of the week and even Sundays. Now that alone is not a big deal because I know what to expect. The service is so slow it is unreal. No matter when I go and no matter who serves me always slow. Now they have a great product and they have an amazing deal. so I see no need for them to invest or improve the service given the lines they have. That being said just know what to expect when you go here. Will I go back, 100% just for anyone trying this place out be prepared for a wait, slow service, and in the end you will say it is worth it.
