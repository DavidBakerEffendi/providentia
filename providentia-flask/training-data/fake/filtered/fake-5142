Noodle Chu has gone downhill in terms of their dim sum.  The restaurant has been here a while and it shows.   The past few times I have eaten dim sum here, I thought it was so so. I'm glad they have some competition across the street from Qin Dynasty as that is my preferred place until Noodle Chu gets better.  This place is better for large groups as they have bigger tables.
