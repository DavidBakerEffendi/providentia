We were in Philly for the weekend and were looking for a brunch place on Sunday. Sabrina's was a mere hop and skip away from our hotel in the museum district. We ordered the Beach Blanket Breakfast Special and the Skinny Dipper's Egg White Omelet. Both were darn good! The serving size is generous and the baked potato chunks that came with both dishes were beautifully caramelized and crispy at the edges! Also, we discovered that egg white omelet is excellent stuffed with apples! Yumm. The vibe in the eatery is funky, freewheeling and modern. But families just looking for a breakfast joint wouldn't feel out of place. We saw a pretty broad range of diners there!
