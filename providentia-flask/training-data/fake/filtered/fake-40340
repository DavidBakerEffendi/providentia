Great place to eat. Casual and very friendly. Also, byob and shoprite liquors is right next store so it keeps your costs down. Come in with some beer and order the burger. It's fantastic, the way burgers should be made; big, juicy, and on the grill. A must if your a burger fan. Also, my wife had the BBQ chicken which I tried and it was delicious. Very juicy and fresh and a generous portion. The sauce it was served with was excellent. It had just the right amount of heat. I RECOMMEND this place.
