If you've never had great middle eastern food, you don't know what you're missing. I first experienced these culinary delights while I was in Egypt. I tried to find like food here and found 2 places - Ibby's in Jersey City and Beyond Pita. I've been a regular at BP for at least 15 years. Food is incredible - you can't go wrong with anything. Falafel is spectacular. Hummus, tabouli, baba ghonoush - all amazing. All the food is fresh, always homemade. I can't get enough. They also cater so for a family member's 85th birthday a few years back, I decided to contribute appetizer food for the family picnic. When I showed up with trays of falafel, hummus, baba, etc, everyone was like "what is THAT?" Then they ate it - and within 15 minutes, all the falafel was gone. My family is not exactly progressive. So it tells me since they liked the food, then it's really special. Gerry and his gang at Beyond Pita work magic!
