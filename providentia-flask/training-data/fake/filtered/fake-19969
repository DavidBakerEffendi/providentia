I am giving this bar 3 stars, based on a rude comment from one bartender.  My boyfriend and I visited for the first time the other night, and were instantly in awe of the beer menu, and tapped beers.  I have worked in restaurants for about 7 years now, and one of them used to do a beer special with Young's Double Chocolate and a tiny shot of Lindeman's framboise on top.  They'd call it a chocolate covered raspberry.  I had mentioned this to my bf who (being a stout lover) was intrigued.  We first had the Chimay triple they had on tap, very good.  So he decides he'll try the raspberry stout concoction I mentioned...  He politely asks the guy if he can have the young's with a shot of framboise in it , to which he semi rudely said " yeah if that's what you want"....then I order a Sammy Smith's Oatmeal Stout, to which he proclaims (pointing at me) "Now that's how you order a Stout"  (no smile, laugh or anything to imply that he was just joking or anything)  I could tell immediately that my bf had felt immasculated and embarrased....thanks a hole!!!  We know alot about beer, and for the bartender to assume he was some sort of sissy is just ridiculous!!!  I think if you have a bar like this, it would be best for all of the staff to be happy and informative, not pretensious and rude when you don't know something like maybe pronouncing a beer or something to that nature... I can only imagine how intimidating it would be to go there, and not be a beer enthusiast.... scary!  Especially with that kind of service... now, I do have to say this was only the one bartender who seemed rude, the other one was very nice.
