I used to visit this place all the time when I lived in Central Jersey. I've had pizza all over the world and this is by far the best, even though it's tucked away in Robbinsville. The wait can be a bit much, especially in the summers, but it is more than worth it. Thin crust specialties! Try the clam pizza. Even though it sounds odd, it's really good. I miss this place!
