Ordered from Luzzo's on a Friday night per reading great reviews on Yelp.  Told me it would take an hour which I thought was a good sign as it was clearly in demand.  Have to say some of the worst pizza I've had in NYC!  By the time it got to me it was really cold and wet and slimy.  As I'd try to take a piece out the minimal toppings would slide off my soggy slice. Not to mention it was pricey.  Cost $31.00 with tip for a large with 3 toppings!  Will NEVER order from there again.  So, not good and so disappointing!
