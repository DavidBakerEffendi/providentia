I recently visited this exquisite Bar & Restaurant after attending a play on Broadway, from the outside it appears to be a warm, cozy place to have  a drink and something to eat, but upon entry it transforms into this Victorian Mansion that suddenly makes you  feel quite elegant yourself. I tried their Jean Marie Burger and truffled french fries and it was simply delectable. Their lighting is perfect,  it's not too dim or too bright but warm and soothing,  just the place to unwind after a long day with a nice glass of wine. Oh and service is excellent, the hostesses are warm, attentive, and very  pretty. Ryan the platinum blonde is simply remarkable.Their versatile clientele of intelligent, engaging, professionals looked quite comfortable at Lillies. I would think this has much to do with the overall ambience of the place, food staff, and prices. You simply must visit Lillies Times Square.
