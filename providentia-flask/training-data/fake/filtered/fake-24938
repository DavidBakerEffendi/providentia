I heard from a few friends about this restaurant a while ago so I decided to give it a try.  I ordered the meat combination platter with rice.  Even though the only option it came with was the tabouleh, the waiter was kind enough to allow me to substitute for the string beans instead.  My meal arrived much quicker than I thought, and after the first bite I became addicted ever since.  Whenever I have the time, even if I'm alone, I must come to this restaurant.  And ever since they redecorated, the place has become that much better. As a person who's been all around Jersey, especially Paterson in North Jersey,  I've dined in a lot of Middle Eastern restaurants and I can say without a doubt that this is the BEST Middle Eastern restaurant in New Jersey.  In fact, I've even been to Amman, Jordan in the Middle East and I still believe that Sahara is the best when it comes to the food.  I've sampled almost everything from the Mujaddarah to the Chicken Barley soup to their delicious baklava and nothing managed to disappoint. My point is, I won't tell you to completely disregard the other reviews because as disrespectful as they are, they're still people who have eaten at this establishment and to my shock, were disappointed.  However, I will tell you to take their reviews with a grain of salt and go see for yourself whether or not the food is worth eating because I assume that for every person that thinks these meals are "bad" or "overpriced", there are still hundreds who come every weekend to enjoy this delicious food and I will continue to be one of them.
