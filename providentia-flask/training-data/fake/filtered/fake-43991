I'm not usually so inclined to write a review, but here goes. Mac's is a great Old City bar with great food, great selection of craft brews, and a friendly atmosphere. Also a great staff and management, who are passionate about retaining their regulars and attracting new ones. With that said, they don't take any crap from the cheap and/or skeezy and/or idiot population of the surrounding area. They have taken flack on the social media sites for defending themselves against thieves and morons who try and defraud this wonderful business. Three cheers to you guys for posting pictures of thieves and the like, as its not only your business who loses money from these vermin. Per the 1-star reviews below, this is the type of a ss-hattery you would expect from local South Philly trash who occasionally escapes his meager existence for a night on the town, going to a non-sports bar to watch a garbage TNF game when there is a new episode of Always Sunny on. Go to a different bar, and stay off of Yelp if you are that miserable and pathetic. Honestly, who has time to put pubes in a drink? Doesn't happen here.
