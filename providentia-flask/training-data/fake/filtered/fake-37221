Exceptionally great food, service and entertainment. A jazz trio that plays here on Thursdays is sublimely talented and fun. It's smooth, classy music from the great American songbook (best I can tell) The pianist is so massively talented she should be a world renowned superstar. She's a brilliant combination of student and master - you can tell from her playing. Food and service here is worth coming any day/night but seeing this trio is an added treat. It's my fav midtown spot by far - been 25 times and never disappointed.
