Decided to give this spot a go but was apprehensive after reading the negative staff reviews...not sure if it was just our night or whether they've taken note and improved things since obtaining the feedback below but i have to say the service was great and my lamb entree was out of sight and less than $20! Special mention should go to the woman on hostess duties ~ 1 week ago. There was no shortage of people queuing for a table and she was very attentive and considerate of all parties-providing updates and courteous check-ins with everyone waiting so as to ensure them they were being considered. Her service in particular set my mind at ease in knowing I came to the right spot and that everything else was likely to follow in the same vein. Sure enough it did. I left extremely satiated and didn't break the bank. Why go to Manhattan and drop $150 on a dinner for 2 when budget fine dining like this is available in BKLN? A more spacious setting would have earned the 5th star for me-although its not the reason to pass on this place I'll be back:)
