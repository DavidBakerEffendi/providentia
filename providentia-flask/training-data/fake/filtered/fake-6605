Grimaldi's in Woodbridge, CT was fantastic. The pesto pizza was fabulous. The crust is to die for. Our daughter ordered pizza with tomato, chicken and bacon. I was skeptical, but that too was fantastic. Nina our waitress was very attentive. Anthony, the owner, greeted every table. It's the details that make a difference. Go check it out.
