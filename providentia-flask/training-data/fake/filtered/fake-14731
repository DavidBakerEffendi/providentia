The food is alright but the service needs improvement. I've ordered from them a couple times and every single time, there has been something wrong with the order. Whether they forgot to add something or just getting the order completely wrong. Even when asked to repeat the order, they still manage to get it wrong. Maybe there is Â miscommunication when reading the order to the kitchen. For a place that is not constantly busy, you would think that they would pay more attention to orders.
