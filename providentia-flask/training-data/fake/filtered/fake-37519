Got lucky last night after trying twice previously to get into this popular restaurant/bar. Very welcoming, even though I was accompanied by my 13year old daughter. It was very busy but the host was very accommodating and gave us a great seats at the bar. We ordered four dishes plus dessert and one glass of wine. The food was delicious and served promptly. Each dish was cooked perfectly. Overall a wonderful little eatery and bar with great ambience. Â A very cosy space, so expect to get up close and personal with other patrons.
