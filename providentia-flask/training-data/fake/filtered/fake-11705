Went with my friend the other night. Had the Kings roll and Caribbean roll. The salmon was very fresh and the sushi was delicious. The service was pretty good. The waitresses were friendly and I love being able to see my servers smile. The atmosphere is really nice and I love their green tea ice cream. My friend had a hibachi chicken lo mein and I was able to try some, it was good. I will definitely be going back soon.
