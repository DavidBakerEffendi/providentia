Walter's is located in the spot that was vacated by Rice way back when I used to live in Ft. Greene and get Jack's stir-brewed coffee on my way to the Q train. I'd almost be nostalgic if that walk wasn't so long. Anyway, I was happy to see a classy joint in it's stead. And classy certainly describes nearly everything about Walters. Â For real. The bar staff wear bow ties and all look like they visited the barbershop before coming to work. I'm not gonna lie, I barely skimmed the menu because the couple sitting next to us at the bar ordered a smorgasbord of seafood that distracted me. We got shrimp cocktail, 1/2 chilled lobster and three types of oysters on the half shell (every time I read this on a menu I sing the Ninja Turtles theme song to myself). Even though cracking lobster isn't my strong suit, my dinner companion had it covered. Turns out she brings more to the table than great hair. The rundown: there's a good feel to the place, it's in a great location across from Ft. Greene park, and you'll eat yummy food. Pretty expensive... actually, really expensive. Somehow I was okay with that.
