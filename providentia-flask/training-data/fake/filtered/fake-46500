been here at least 10 times in the last 6 months.  hands down the best ramen in the city.  just go.  if you run out of noodles before broth, they will give you more, gratis. and they're freakishly friendly inside the main restaurant, (not so at the bar, which is cleverly decorated with ramen noodles).   only down side are the pork buns.  if you close your eyes when you eat them (my litmus test when trying new food to heighten my taste sense), it's like eating pure mayo.  you will not be able to taste the pork belly AT ALL, which is an indication of poor quality, and many of my friends agree.  (stick with the momofuko pork buns - ambrosia).  ippudo has a rep of long waits.  however,  i've never waited more than 20 minutes in peak hours.  like i wrote, just go.
