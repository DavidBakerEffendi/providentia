AVOID! I had lunch there today and waited 45 minutes for my burger with no apologies or updates from the waiter. Then the burger was so overlooked it had gone completely dry, even though I had ordered it medium-rare. It was also supposed to come with onion rings but they were inedible due to the fact that the outside skin of the onion had been left on. Even the mayonnaise i'd requested to go with it was forgotten. My friend's sandwich was supposed to come on brioche but came in a burger bun instead. I told this all to the waiter but only got a feeble apology and was still given the full cheque with nothing comped. This is the second time I've eaten there and both times have been bad. Don't waste your money on this place!
