Wow. What a wonderful restaurant. The waiter was nice, the food was INCREDIBLE and I absolutely love the atmosphere. I loved how the tables were set up and it's really nice that it's located in a really nice area. Had the fish and the stuffed peppers and also the flan. WONDERFUL WONDERFUL- can't wait to go back!
