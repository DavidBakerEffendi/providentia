I love Rye.  It's got great food and drinks, fantastic service a a lovely old-time atmosphere.  I tend to take people here who are coming to Brooklyn or Williamsburg for the first time, as a sure-fire way to make them love BK and keep coming back for more.  I had a non alcoholic soda to start then I had an old fashioned- expertly mixed on both accounts- the bartender knows what he's doing.  Highlights of my meal were the scotch egg (best I've ever had), the duck breast (tender, beautifully cooked) and the scallops and pork belly combo.  Interesting combo but totally worked for me.  Our server was a doll, there when we wanted/needed her but not too much.  I've been a bunch of times and will continue to go, so I thought it fitting I write a review.  Also, you can get a table easier on a Sat night than, say, Diner.
