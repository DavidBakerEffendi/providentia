I have lived in Dayton for many years and have seen many restaurants change hands many times.  I was interested in this one, being it serves american cuisine.  My brother and I stopped in for breakfast and we both liked it.  Quickly seated by friendly hostess, waited on by a server who spoke proper english ( I hate being called "you's" or "you guys" ).  The coffee was hot, fresh,  and strong, the way we like it, and served in one of those great diner coffee mugs.  My pancakes were hot and delish.  My brothers' eggs, homefries, toast and bacon all looked good. I snagged a piece of bacon from his plate and it was nice and crispy like we asked.  I will definitely be back to try lunch
