Haven't been in years, but it is still a solid choice that is packed every night of the week.  Took an early reservation and ended up staying for four hours. Felt like I was back in Europe.  Started with a snow pea custard which was to die for.  Sea bass entree was cooked spot on- nice and lite with a kick from the cucumber and with a garlicy yogurt sauce.  As a New York standby, of course, I'd come back.  Although it does seems like the dining room has become a bit touristy over the years.
