Good place!  I was there on a Saturday afternoon with my mom and her friend...wasn't expecting brunch menu only but the food was really tasty and great beer selection!  Also, not too crowded, I'd even consider coming back by myself to have lunch and a beer at the bar.  The decor is nice, kind of a retro-industrial feel with modern finishes.   We finished our lunch at about 3pm and were planning on leaving when the server asked if we would like to reserve the table for 4:30 and go step out and come back.  I thought that was a nice gesture since a NFL playoff game would be starting at 4:30.
