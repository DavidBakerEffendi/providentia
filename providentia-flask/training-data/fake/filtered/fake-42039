Right! it took me a couple of years of living in NYC before I ventured into Noodle Town. And even then it was always after all-nighters so I was rarely in any shape to appreciate the food I was eating. I appreciated that it was cheap and filling. But having been there on a semi-regular basis lately, I must say I have a new regard for this joint. CONS: -can be crowded -not exactly sterile -waiters hard to communicate with -waiters need to be reminded about what you ordered (don't be shy) -expect some brusqueness/rudeness depending on rush hour -kitchen can be uneven (don't be shy about complaining. don't expect a refund, but demand replacements early) -salt! PROS: -tasty food that can be exceptional -cheap -not your local Chinese take away I think the mistake most folks make is ordering from the "white" (yes, yes, I know: that's racist!) part of the menu or going for the stuff that sounds familiar. Take a leap and order things like beef muscle or duck's feet. Have some chicken feet or pig's knuckle. Order jelly fish and 1000 year old eggs. That shit is good (can you tell I eat off the appetiser menu). Look for the southern Chinese dishes - after all, it is a bleeding Cantonese restaurant. Noodle soups are good, the pork is good. Stuff that sounds low-rent is good: making do with non-premium food materials, are Â the cultural stock-in trade of places like this. Be adventurous. Order something with flowering chives - that's good too. Salt baked shrimp or squid is good. The fresh tofu is good. Try the congee - that stuff is like comfort food. If you're expecting decor and finesse: forget it. The place is a dive, saved from being a hole-in-the-wall by its floor space. The Indians in the house will know what I mean when I say that this is the equivalent of a trusty dhaba. Try it. You'll probably like it.
