Franco's has good food and a decent price, however there customer service is seriously lacking. If you get a female on the phone to order you are good, she is polite and pleasant to speak with. However if you get a guy on the phone he won't hear half your order so you'll have to repeat it several times. Then when you complete your order and tell him credit card he gets noticeably irritated and takes forever to take the card number. Then to top it off the delivery driver doesn't bring a pen to sign the receipt.
