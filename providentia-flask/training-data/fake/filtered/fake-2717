Very mixed on this one. 1. I consider the refusal to take reservations management laziness. 2. The noise level is not an accident and is unacceptable. 3. Considering the owners roots, the lack of South American wines is strange. 4. $28 for 2 lamb chops is petty theft. On the other hand, the food was incredible; the Duck Confit salad was brilliant. The staff was well trained and extremely helpful and the wine shop a great and novel idea although I've seen it before in Mendoza AR at Azafran ! and 2 above will keep me away.
