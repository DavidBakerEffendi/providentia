I enjoyed the mussels thoroughly. The rocket salad was kid of slapped together and I think they should put in more effort to present it even if it is such a simple dish. My companions had the steak and salad which they liked. It's too noisy for a serious conversation but I think if you are looking for an East Village bustling experience, this can be quite a fun place to hang out. The crazy huge parfait desserts are so delicious and decadent. Our blueberry cheesecake parfait was so yum, we finished it despite the fact we were already stuffed.
