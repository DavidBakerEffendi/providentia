We were headed to Kingdom Vegetarian on North 11th, a favorite of ours for years. Sad news, they've closed!!!  Thankfully, we walked around the corner, and we found Penang.  My friend and I were extremely pleased with our service, appetizers, meals, and the facilities (including the bathroom).  We enjoyed the open kitchen where we watched a fresh pineapple being sliced.  I had the Mee Siam with tofu, no shrimp as I am a vegetarian.  Our waiter recommended this, and he was knowledgable about vegetarian cuisine, asking me about eggs and tofu.  My friend had Penang Kari Ayam which she describes as "flavorful, rich, and simple."  We will def be returning very soon!!!!
