If you are looking for a restaurant that bends over backwards to please its customers, Benito One is the place. We were just there last weekend for the very first time and plan to come back the next time we are in NYC. It was already packed when we got there and we were given a table that we were not satisfied with. The waiter was quick to accommodate, and while we waited outside to be re-seated, the owner came over to assure us that they would have another table for us. During the meal we sat and watched all the staff hustle from one table to the next. The owner was there making sure that everything was in order (even helping to clean up a mess from a child at another table) and that all customers were satisfied. I have never been to a place that treated its customers like they are important to them as this place. At the end of dinner,our waiter even did magic tricks for our table. The owner even came over and started talking and taking pictures with us. I give Benito a 5 star based on the service alone, but Â the food was delicious and definitely worth returning for. The price was reasonable and the portions were generous. My husband, our two friends, and I were happy with all our meals. I highly recommend Benito.
