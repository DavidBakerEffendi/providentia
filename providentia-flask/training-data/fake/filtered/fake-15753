Pros: Delicious Food, some highlights Appetizers: Â Spicy duck meatballs (actually had some nice spice and were very tender), scallops (cooked to perfection) Sides: Farro risotto (delicious!) Main: We all got the halibut special, which was one of the best fish dishes I've ever had (with mushrooms and a spicy tomato lobster sauce) Dessert: Apple filled doughnuts Cons: Service was a little spotty, water refilling was great, but the servers could've been a little more attentive Pumpkin cheesecake was very underwhelming, the first bite was my last
