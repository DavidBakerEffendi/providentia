First time customer and I ordered a easy chicken parm. Three pieces of ultra thin non existant chicken loaded with bread crumbs. The bread crumbs was thicker than the meat! it was like eating a loaf of sticky Â bread. The bread was not good at all aswell and Hardly any red sauce. And it was 7 bucks I wish I never spent. Go to subway than this place.
