If you want to have a drink with bugs in it, go to Koji. I ordered two drinks last night (11/08/12) and both my drink had 3 bugs in it. When I asked the waitress for another drink, she was not apologetic at all. She brought me another drink with more bugs in it. Usually, when you have bad service or something is wrong with your order, the manager comps you the meal or drink. At Koji, they didn't seem to care. Not only was it awful having bugs in my drink, but the service was horrendous! Â I will never go there again and will make sure the health department knows about this issue. I only gave it one star because the system wouldn't let me leave it blank!
