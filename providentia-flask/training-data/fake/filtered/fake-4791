The service here is terrible. The owner is really unpleasant, unhelpful and rude. I hate to give bad reviews because the space is so lovely, the coffee great and the location off the usual Penn path, but the customer service was so incredibly lacking that I have to give it just two stars. I suggest that the owner hire other people who might enjoy being there to work with the customers to stay in business. At this point, his rude attitude will prevent me from returning.
