Read about this place a couple of times and finally made it on Saturday (19th). Called ahead for reservations about 6PM but was told that they didn't have anything until 915, which is always a good sign. Found out because the place is pretty small, but intimate. Was able to reserve two seats at the bar. Well were we in for a treat! Great menu, great variety and decent wine list as well. To preface, I have celiac's, lactose, fructose and sucrose intolerance and they catered to my every need. The place totes itself as certified gluten free and they back it up. Potato vodka option behind the bar, complimentary gluten free bread to dip in olive oil and diced fresh garlic. my girlfriend, who doesn't have any food allergies was given fresh french bread as well. Drinks were quick and delicious. Female bartender was fantastic all night. Before we ordered she asked if we had any allergies. Once i told her she made a note and immediately made the chef aware as we saw him peek out from the small kitchen. I had the gluten free penne with pesto (also dairy-free). My date had fresh ahi tuna with a sliced avocado salad. Both were delicious. For the entree I had the steak with sauteed broccoli rabe and mushrooms. Swapped out the butternut squash (sucrose) for potatoes, when it came out, she realized the potatoes she gave me had butter in them. Quickly, grabbed the dish, brought it in the back and within 3 minutes I had a fresh new plate ( I knew it was freshly made again because I had sliced the steak and the new dish had two new fresh pieces (of good size). My GF had black linguini with fresh shrimp in a tomato based sauced. They were both excellent. For dessert, just had a espresso that hit the spot and wasn't over steamed. Clincher was on the way out where the chef happened to be at the door and and said "Goodnight Gino, have a good one". My GF and I were thrown aback, looked at one another and smiled. Great experience. Would def go back.
