Terribly disappointed.  We traveled almost an hour to go to a different restaurant that had a two hour wait.  Just down the road was Sake which didn't appear to have a line.  My family and I love hibachi restaurants so we figured we would give it a try.  At first, it looked lovely.  We were seated right away.  The dining area is very bright.  Not much ambiance.  We were the first to be seated at a hibachi.  At first I noticed that the outside of the hibachi and the table were filthy.  Bits of old food were stuck to the outside of the hibachi.  Yuck!  The hibachi restaurant we normally go to is immaculate.  The service was fine.  The hibachi chef was animated.  The food was so-so.  I ordered a medium filet...which was overcooked.  I was disappointed in the ginger sauce; it was different than I am used to.  The noodles were also completely different than I have had at other hibachi restaurants.  I am pretty sure it was spaghetti.  Also, they put onions in the noodles...not a big fan.  Then, to top it all off, I ended up with a hair in my dish.  Definitely wasn't mine, and I'm pretty sure it didn't belong to the chef either.  Not sure where it came from.  I barely ate any of my meal (which was also slightly more expensive than my favorite hibachi restaurant).  We will not be going back unfortunately.
