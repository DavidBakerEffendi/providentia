nothing long and involved...just gotta say that i have lived in ewing for a year and a half and we finally went here...oh my GOD so good!!! Â i noticed that someone else mentioned the amazing eggplant pizza...INDEED! you cannot get eggplant pizza anywhere that is like this...finally found a great one and this is it! the food is great, and that's that!
