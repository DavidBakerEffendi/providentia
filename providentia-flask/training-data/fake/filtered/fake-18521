I've been going here for lunch often for the last few months.   For the most part, the waitresses are friendly and quick.  I always have a half-chicken with yellow rice and beans and it's perfect 75% of the time. Every now and then, it's a bit more dry than I'd prefer.  They cook up new chicken every few hours so it's really just luck whether you get the most fresh chicken or not.  As I said most of the time it's very fresh and tender. The atmosphere is more suited for a casual lunch nothing fancy.  It's low-priced so you get a good meal at a great price.
