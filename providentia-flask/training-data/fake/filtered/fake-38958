I find this place to be generally good though inconsistent in it's food, and unfortunately very consistent in its bad service considering it's reputation. Some dishes are fantastic (the signature rigatoni a l'amatriciana; the beet ravioli w/ mascarpone) and some dishes are very dry (a recent spaghetti w/ mushrooms and cream; the overcooked quail w/ polenta that was a dry lump). The service is often forgetful, inattentive, or (most recently) an overly-familiar woman who looked unkempt and had extremely bad breath. I have given this place several chances, but I think it's a little too inconsistent for me to return for a while. Â Also, the Philly Inq. needs to revisit this place---although I am sure they gave Mr. Le Ban the best service and food they had, it is not an accurate reflection of what goes on.
