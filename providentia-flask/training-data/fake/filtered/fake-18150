This place's food is horrible. Myself and my wife went there since we live close by. We always passed by and it looks so cozy and beautiful. We really have no other complaint. Stay away from ordering food. We got two different dishes it has really no taste what so ever and it s pricey. Always remember that most 5 star comments are from their own workers and staff.
