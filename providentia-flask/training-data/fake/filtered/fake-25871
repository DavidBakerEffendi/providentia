First time there on 09/22 for dinner.  Heard they won the "Best Meatball" -South Philly, on the Food Network -  Food Feuds.  They beat out the well known Ralphs, also located on 9th street.   I wanted to take my 76 year old father there, since he has never been there and he is 100% Italian.  We were very disappointed.  There were 3 of us dining and we all ordered Meatballs and Spaghetti and let me tell you, this platter was not cheap.  $14.95 per plate! The minute the platter was laid done in front of me, I smelled burnt sauce.  Anyone can recoginize that smell, we asked the Server to take it back telling her it was burnt, I specifically asked if that was the only sauce made for the day, she said she needed to go ask the kitchen and would switch out the platters.  She did, and when they were returned, the sauce was still burnt and ruin the entire meal. ( we did not send back again, did not want to be troublesome) We did not finish our meals, we packed up to go because I wanted to go home and rinse off the gravy and look at how badly burnt the meatballs were. To my surprise, the meatballs were not burnt at all and quite tasty, but I would not say it was the best meatball I ever tasted. So that concluded that the sauce was just over-cooked, old or left on the stove too long. So for $70 ( including tip, tax, and 3 sodas) we got about 2 lbs of spaghetti and 4 meatballs that will be dunked into my gravy for dinner tonight! I will be going to Ralphs next, since Villa Di Roma beat them out in the food wars, curious to see what they will be serving up! Cash only, not CC or Debit accepted!
