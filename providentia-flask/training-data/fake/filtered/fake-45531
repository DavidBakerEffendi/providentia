Further reviews of South Philly's Pho Ha are probably redundant, for two reasons: Pho Ha is hands-down the unrivalled champ of delicious, aromatic pho, and there is really nothing about the place to criticize or critique. As such, Pho Ha really IS the standard against which several hundred competing pho joints are judged. Worthy of a mention though is Pho Cali in Chinatown at the intersection of Tenth and Arch - I'm fond of the family, who have always been loving and kind toward my kids, I adore their tiny waitress from Chiapas, whose equally tiny hubby works in the kitchen; Pho Cali's menu is delicious. So having said, someone was looking for Bun Bo Hue - the above is a good bet. Ca mon!
