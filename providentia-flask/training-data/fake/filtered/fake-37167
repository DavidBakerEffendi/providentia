If you want to spend all your money on filet mignon go ahead it will be good! but if you are getting a regular meal it won't be worth it. We got the chicken fettuccine. The chicken tasted like fish, the spinach was definitely canned and the mashed potatoes were powdered. We also had a maple glazed salmon. The salmon was overcooked with a light drizzle of maple syrup, nothing to rave about. I got a Caesar salad as a starter. The croutons were all soggy or stale never a fresh one, but it was a great big portion of iceberg lettuce. The only good thing about the meal was the awesome iced tea!
