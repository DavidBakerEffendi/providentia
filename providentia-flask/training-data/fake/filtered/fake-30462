Had an excellent time my first time there last night.  Loved the large brickhouse burgers and fries, and their Parmesan chicken wings.  The band the Diamond Backs played 11/26/2011 and I must say what a voice on the guy, excellent guitarists, and drummer.  Iron Maiden Metallica....etc    I loved the rock and role experience and would return again any day.
