ALL I CAN SAY IS WOW!!! I didn't know what to expect since this was our first time dining at Bistro Mediterranean & Tapas Bar but I have to say I was very impressed at the presentation and extras from the Olive plate, tasty warm bread to the little glasses of spirits at the end of our meal. Service was prompt and the owner greeted us on our way out to see if we enjoyed everything. We had two tapas and mistakenly ordered a entree thinking the tapas would be small because of the price, but where we surprised at the huge portion just one would have been enough for us to share! We took a lot home! The food presentation was top notch. The ambiance was beautiful like fine dining in NYC hard to believe we where in East Haven. A great place to impress a date!
