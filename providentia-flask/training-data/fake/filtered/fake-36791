Ordered two orders of pancakes for take out today. After opening the order at home, i found out that one order of pancakes were totally burnt. I have been going to this place for the past 6 years and this place is going down the hill. Pancakes are no longer moist now. I called them back and i gave the same feedback. The server told me to come back and get another order. I did not go as i live 15 minutes away from the place. Bottom line is that they should not pack burnt pancakes and concentrate on the quality.
