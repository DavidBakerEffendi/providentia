I would have liked to give our wings and barbecue 5 stars,  because they were pretty darn close, and certainly satisfying and delicious. I'm taking back that last star because of the pricing of some of the many beer choices. We dropped in during happy hour, when beers marked with an asterisk (*) are NOT discounted. We weren't made aware of this, and due to some pretty inconsistent pricing, ended up paying 12 dollars for one beer (Hitochino). It was a delicious beer- different, flavorful, and well-balanced, but I probably wouldn't have ordered it if prices had been posted ON THE BEER LIST OR THE CHALKBOARD!  I view this as an unfortunate decision of management to not inform consumers of prices more than the barkeeper's failure to mention the price anomaly.  Next time I will be asking for prices as well as choices, which is unfortunate to say the least. Go for the food, don't order the asterisks.
