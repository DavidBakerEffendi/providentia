Came across this place during Balthazar day, where they give out one free Balthazar, and ended up buying a small box to bring up. Yeah, that's how good it was. I had the apricot, green tea (matcha), raspberry and a few others whose name currently escapes me. All I really remember, is gobbling it all down. Hard to savor something that tastes that good.
