I have been going there for 2 years at least once a day  John sad to say sold deli to someone and its food taste went down hill.Told new owners that people like to have fish on Fridays and that John sold shrimp basket specials on Thursday and Friday . noticed a lot of people stop going there as food is not FIVE STARS ANYMORE . the friendly place to go is gone. Cook is rude have some of new workers don"t have clue whats going on. New owner buy's cheap bottle water and sells it for same price as Poland springs bottle water John always sold .I feel bad for new owners they don't have a clue.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!­!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!­!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
