First time dining at Wildflowers, and I'll be back! Unlike previous posters, service was normal to me, had no problems with waitress or waitstaff.  I ordered off the new BBQ menu which they do on Wed and Sat. The pulled Pork sandwich was very tasty and complimented the sweet potato fries very well.  Lots of pork and very tangy and tasty BBQ sauce.  After all the raves about the pies, I ordered a large Boardwalk pie to go, very good!!!! I will definitely be back to dine again. Well done Wildflowers!!!!
