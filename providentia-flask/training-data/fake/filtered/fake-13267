I haven't been in the place physically, but im a regular once or twice a week delivery customer. The food is great! I love the different pasta salads. In terms of portion, your getting more than what you pay for. My only critism is the delivery time during lunch hours. I've worked in similar places in nyc and you always bulk up on delivery drivers during peak hours and during bad weather (rain and what-not). Other than that, absolutely love the place and will continue ordering.
