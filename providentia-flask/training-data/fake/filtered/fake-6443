Hands down the best burgers in Philly and more. I have been going to Sketch for about a year now and never had a bad meal. To the reviewers that complain about the price for the quality you can not get a better price. Also the place is cool just to hang out and chill. This is one of the best kept secrets in the city but I do not think it will stay that way
