Woorijip brims with a myriad of freshy, inexpensive, tasty Korean dishes; available hot and fast. I figured this place would be really good and authentic since almost every person in the restaurant was Korean. Huge selection of finger food to eat with a good amount of different kinds of soju, sake, and beer as well as yummy korean drinks. Food I tried and loved: Spicy noodles Bulgogi Mook/Acorn Jelly (MY FAV BANCHAN OF ALL TIME!) Kimchee fried rice. The atmosphere isn't anything to brag about, but this place is for the cheap good food, not the decor. Definitely come here if you need a quick bite of good food to grab.
