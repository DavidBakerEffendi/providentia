The Sylvia's of CT.  If you can't make it to NY then this is the place for you!!! Magically Delicious!! This is the first description that comes to mind. The food here is sooo good. My boyfriend and I had a craving for GOOD soul food and we hit JACKPOT!!!!  We were there on May 9, and I had the smothered chicken, collard and mac and cheese. The portion size was like you were visiting family you haven't seen and they pile your plate -Perfect! My food was so good it made me think I can miss my auntie's dinner and just come here... and my auntie can throw down!! My boyfriend had fried catfish , collards, mac and cheese, black eye peas and rice. When his food came he didn't think that he would be able to finish it... But this man CLEANED his plate!!!!!! It was that good. They were all so welcoming, the young lady behind the register, Sandra and her husband. They spoke with us as if we were neighbors just hanging out. Her husband and my boyfriend talked about sports. It was just an outstanding experience!! We will be coming here as often as we can!!! I just wish they were in my area!! Sandra if you are reading this come on out to Norwalk.. I will be your best customer!!
