One of my fiance and I's favorite spots.  We live up the hill over by KC101 and come down here often.  The food is simple yet eclectic and ALWAYS tasty.  I recommend the rice w/ oxtail, the bomba rice, or the grilled squid, but quite honestly everything available here will excite you.  Additionally, the staff is always extremely friendly and courteous.  You often see the owner greeting people which is a nice touch !  As long as they keep doing what they're doing they will always recieve my business.
