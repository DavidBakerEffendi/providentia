I've never had a bad memory at National Mechanics. First time around, I tried the veggie pasta, which is unfortunately no longer on the menu. Other nibbles have included the fish & chips, tomato soup, veggie burger, plantain chips, beef tacos, asparagus & goat cheese salad, and vegetarian samosas. ALL delectable with the veggie burger receiving my honorary nomation. The only edible item I questioned were the vegetarian samosas, which were tasty without a doubt, but could have easily been frozen store-bought snacks that were heated up and served for $7 (but with a kickass mango curry!) Great specials and a solid list of beers to get buzzed on. The only thing that's left for me to try is their desserts!
