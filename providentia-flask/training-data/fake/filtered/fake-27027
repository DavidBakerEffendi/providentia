The best gift I ever gave myself and well worth the two month wait for my chance to actually taste Nick's creations.  Each course was a five star experience.  I went by myself so that I could devote all my attention to what I was eating.  I started off with the Foie Gras and each component of the dish fully complemented the entire dish.  I would have been thrilled just to eat that all night.  Next I went with the gnocchi and I swear it melted before it touched my lips and the sauce - OMG.  I forced myself to close my eyes and completely savor every bite and to make it last as long as I could.  I then went with the beef and had no disappointment except I would like to have had a few more of the mushrooms - they were sensational.  And the sauce for the beef (which was perfectly cooked) was to die for.  Lastly I finished up with the White Chocolate Pudding, and another OMG moment. Sweet and tart were perfectly done and I just wanted to lick the plate. I am also a chef (Personal Chef) and not in my dreams could I create these four fantastic courses.   It is easy to see why Nick won Top Chef - the man is a genius in the kitchen.  I was very touched when I looked up and saw him standing at my table.  Yes he is intense and yes he is filled with humility.  I will most definitely give myself this gift again. I should also mention that the service was impeccable - so knowledgeable about each dish, so warm and friendly and they made me feel like I was an important part of their night.  I did not feel like I was alone at all all  evening.
