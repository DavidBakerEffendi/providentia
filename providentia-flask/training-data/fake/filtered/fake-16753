The Vegan Tree is one of my all-time favorite restaurants. Everything about this place is perfect. My favorite things to get are the almond bubble tea, lo mein, summer rolls, and hotpots. I look forward to coming here whenever I'm in the South Street area, but most times I trek to South Street just to come here. I highly recommend the Vegan Tree!
