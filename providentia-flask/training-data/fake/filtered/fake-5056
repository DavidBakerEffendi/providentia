Looking for tasty and flavorful food? This place sucks!!! Went to their dosa night for dinner. Came back with full stomach but an unfulfilled appetite. Tried almost all the dosa offered on the menu in between 6 of us, hoping we will discover some taste in one of them. Unfortunately none of the options even deserve a mention - all of them were flavor less. The owner seemed very defensive when we tried to mention the same to him. Over all a very unsatisfied experience. I am not going back. Just to add - The ambience, the service anyway are not at all good.
