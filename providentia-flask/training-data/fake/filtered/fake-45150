This restaurant has amazing food!! The Veal LoMonaco was as tasty as it gets. The only flaw was the hostess who did not offer us anything to drink while we were waiting nor when we sat down. Our waitress was in tears at our table...talk about proper?  It was a Saturday night and everything was AMESS. Even after our meal we waited a half hour for our check!!  Put a whole new perspective on the restaurant I will be getting take out next time
