Mercato is a great deal with tons of choices during restaurant week.  Dinner for two on a PACKED friday evening went just at the right speed, and the server was attentive without being pushy. The antipasto had excellent variety and was huge, with lots of strong flavors.  The scallop entree looked dainty but was pretty good. I prefer the big, puffy scallops to the small ones they serve here. My date's filet was great!  Dessert was the hardest choice, but I settled on a not-too-sweet panna cotta, which ended up being the highlight of my meal.  I know it's not a complex food, but the flavors were classic and just right. It's not their fault the place is so small.  Great service and good food put Mercato on my revisit list.
