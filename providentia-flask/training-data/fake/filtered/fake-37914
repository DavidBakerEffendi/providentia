The sushi at Mr Sushi is good quality, but the service is absolutely abysmal. Have had a problem with our server every time we have dined there (which is why we no longer go). Sure, you can get all you can eat sushi, but after your initial order the wait staff completely ignores you. It has happened way too many times to us for it to be a coincidence. You will have to get up from your table and hunt your server down if you want to order more food. We tried to circumvent this one time by ordering a large helping of sushi initially, but we were discouraged by the staff to do so. Even when we expressed our concerns about their attentiveness, they assured us there would be no problem. Unfortunately, that was not the case and we have never gone back since. The sushi is good, and all you can eat is a great value - just be sure to bring extra helpings of patience.
