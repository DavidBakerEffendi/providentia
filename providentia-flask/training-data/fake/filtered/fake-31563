I'm a LIC resident for 12 years and had never eaten at a Blend restaurant until I had brunch a couple of weeks ago. We went to Blend on the Water and had a great experience eating at the Bar whilst being attended to by Brendan. He is a SUPERSTAR. Great server/bartender...so much so that we decided to come back and try the dinner. Again...it was very enjoyable. We were lucky to have Brendan serve us again. Proving the first time wasn't a fluke, he was consistent with his top service yet again. He had help from Rob and another guy who I didn't catch his name (clean-shaved head) though who were also exceptional. All three bartenders were attentive, polite and very pleasant. The food was also delicious. The signature cocktails were a little "try hard" so I switched to beer. KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid) Less is More. All around 'twas a great experience!
