Prime 16 is my favorite spot to eat when I am in New Haven!! I love the Menu selection and the wait staff is awesome and very friendly!! The last waiter was John and he was not only knowlegable but very pleasant even throughout the crazy busy hour. I will continue to eat at Prime 16 and enjoy the great food and great service with the New Haven lifestyle!
