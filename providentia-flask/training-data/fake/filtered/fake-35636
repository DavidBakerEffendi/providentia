I'm updatin to four stars as this place has corrected the most serious problems with their menu, but the menu is still over-sweet and over-rich, really there is so much sugar flowing out of this place from the menu to the taps it's a diabetes factory, but it's up to you to handle your nutrition - local saturated fats and simpe sugars are still those things, local doesn't automatically mean healthy. Putting a couple of pieces of kale next to 1100 calories of saturated fats doesn't make it healthy. But still, in the tiny market of Burlington your options for actually good tasting food on an actually nutritious menu is very limited and when found as expensive as this place. These are ownership/mgmt problems. The people who work there and the service is about the best you'lll find in any college town, and the staff are super super friendly. Extra star for you!
