I have been to Audrey Claire several times and always look forward to the food and atmosphere. I recently went with a group of 8 people and before the ink could dry on our credit card statements (and before I finished my coffee), we were very rudely told to wrap it up since the next group had arrived. I understand the need to turn over tables but was highly offended in the manner it was done. I will not be dining there again.
