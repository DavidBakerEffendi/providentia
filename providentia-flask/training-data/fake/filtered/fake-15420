Good food.  I've eaten here many times, but will no longer do so after my last experience. On one occasion, the waiter literally told us we needed to leave because they need the table.  My family and I had just finished eating. I forgave them that and went back several more times, always enjoying the food.  Two days ago, I ate there with two friends.  I left a 20% tip on $49 check, which was an even $10.  Checking my credit card statement online today, I found that they added on a few more dollars.  Taking my receipt back to the restuarant, the owner told me the waiter obviously read the tip wrong.  Somehow, $10 looks like $12 and the total, $59 looks like a $61.  A hard mistake to make, in my opinion.  While he gave me the difference and apologized, this is clearly not a mistake.  I am sure I am not the only or even first person this has happened too, and unsuspecting customers are not noticing the $3, $5 dollar difference on their statements at the end of the month.  The waitstaff would be foolish to do more than that surely.  I am very unhappy as this is clearly not a "misread" or mistake, but something that is done probably too often.  $2 may not seem like a big deal, but I am sure if I stuck my hand in their cash register and took $2, the police would be called.   Check your receipts and your statements!  I am sure this is not the only restaurant with waitstaff eager to snatch an extra few dollars from unsuspecting customers.  I am sure it adds up over the course of a night.
