I am a Virginia resident, my son attends college in Newark, New Jersey, I placed an order for him online and used my credit card, I left instructions for them to call my son's cell phone when the order arrived at his residence. I received a call from the driver who informed me that I had to be there with my ID and Credit Card, I offered to text the driver my ID and credit card, Instead the driver left the residence and returned the pizza to the store. I have never heard of such! I spoke with a manager by the name of Kati who informed me that they had to cancel my order and it would take 24 to 48 hours for a refund. I have NEVER heard of anything like this in my life.
