Awful....went on line to check menu...wanted to have veal ossobucco...menu had it...so decided this was a choice for us...also had it there awhile back and it was good.. Tonight not available pork ossobucco was on menu.   Went for veal and not available. Decided to have seafood combo dish with mussels, shrimp, clams and white fish of some kind. The white fish was awful and when I said it was awful I mean it...mineral taste, mushy and creepy taste..   When I told the wait staff it was as if  they already knew the fish was terrible.  We Were disappointed.  They deducted but still,that was not enough because we had a terrible meal.
