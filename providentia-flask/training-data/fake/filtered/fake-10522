We waited for over a half-hour for our simple food after ordering (fried fish, chili dogs, and a quesadilla). It appeared that two servers served nine or ten tables, so this didn't appear to be the bottleneck. If the server had come by to apologize for the wait and let us know when our food would be up, that may have mitigated our impatience. We were actually afraid that our order had been lost. The food was good comfort food, but in the future we'll eat where we know the service is prompt.
