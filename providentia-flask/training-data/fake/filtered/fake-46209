Ippudo....how can i summarize my experience there?? well, the ramen was good, but not superb. honestly, if i waited for about an hr for a table for two, i expect it to live up to the hype. and i am thinking that my ramen was not WORTH the one hour wait. the pork was dry, but i gotta say that the ramen and the soup was good. once again not superb. this place, i feel is a one-time thing. i wouldn't wait just to eat here all the time, but i just wanted to see if it lived up to the hype. i came here with my sister on a Friday night, and it was absolutely bustling at 10pm. we didn't get a table until 11pm. one thing i could've gone without are all the waiters screaming welcome in my face when i get in. holy hell, it's hella annoying and it's just way too smiley and happy go lucky for me. all i want is a nice meal and not the same scream/chant/what have you whenever someone walks in or leaves the door. GOSH. i came in hella tired, coming back from grad school for a weekend, and frankly, it was the LAST thing i needed on a Friday night. Overall, i'd say that the food is a 7/10. when you have THAT many people waiting, there is a certain expectation. and unfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype. maybe ramen is just not my thing, but i think it's awfully expensive for just a bowl of noodles with soup and a couple pieces of some darn pork.
