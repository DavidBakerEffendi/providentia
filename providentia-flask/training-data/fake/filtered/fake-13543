This club totally RULES. The gumbo is bangin' and so is the talent- oooooo boy. If Genny Cream aint your bag, don't worry, after ten shots of Old Overholt, you wont care. You want upcycled Vermont farm wood? Check. Bearded bartender with kissable lips? Check. Whiskey all day long? Check. Brunch? Everyone wants brunch. CHECK. BEST GRITS EVA. Can't wait to lounge in that back patio and talk about stuff and hang out with all of my favorite people. I LOVE YOU, CATFISH.
