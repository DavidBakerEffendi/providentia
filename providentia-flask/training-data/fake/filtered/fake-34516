the BEST thin crust pizza.  i admit, the prices have gone up, but it's still worth it, even if i can't travel the 30 miles to get there as often as i used to be able to, it just makes me want it more ;D  .Maybe I'm biased because I've been going ever since I was a little baby and needed a high-chair to eat there!!!  However!! I was an extremely picky little tyke, and still Loved The Star :)
