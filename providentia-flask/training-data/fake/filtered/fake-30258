I just left west orange diner with my girlfriend and it was not what i expected from a place I have been going to for years. My girl and I have decided we want a couple milk shakes. i ordered a Strawberry shake and she ordered vanilla. They both ended up being strawberry and contained ice cubes whipped cream and strawberry milk. Then my girl friend ordered a chicken caesar wrap which contained only chicken and lettuce, no caesar dressing what so ever. I had buffalo wings that were not covered completely with hotsauce and were burt around the edges. I do not recommend this diner to anyone. Highly disappointing.
