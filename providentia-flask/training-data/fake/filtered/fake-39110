My first visit was with tough customers: my parents, who had gotten the word from a waiter elsewhere in the neighborhood and had given it a try. Since they had enjoyed their first visit, I joined them the second time around. Food was outstanding; not a 'just okay' dish in the bunch. More noticeable, however, was the smart and artful way that the front of house is run. Our waiter took cocktail orders immediately, but as he was managing two large parties, another server picked up our table in a seamless fashion. Water glasses stayed filled, plates were cleared promptly, courses were never rushed. All of the little things were attended to, and that makes all the difference. Another visit last night confirmed the first impression. Basso 56 is a gem.
