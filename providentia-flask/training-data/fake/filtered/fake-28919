I have never been to this establishment. I live in Florida and yesterday my roommate discovered that all of his money was missing from his government issued debit card! There were a couple of purchases made in California, but the whole thing started with a $1 purchase at Joe's Mill Hill Saloon! Apparently, a $1 transaction is done initially to make sure the card is active and there is money in the account. Since it is unlikely a customer would make a $1 purchase at a bar, one has to assume it was an employee or the establishment is in Â on it in some way! I called Joe's to let them know what happened and that I have filed a police report and they haven't even had the decency to return the call (This place is so sketchy, they don't even answer their phone. Had to tell them what happened via voice mails!). BEWARE of using your credit/debit cards in this place, as there is obviously something going on here!
