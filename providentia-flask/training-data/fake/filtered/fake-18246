I didn't have a typical dinner at Pig and Prince. Instead, I booked my husbands 30th birthday party in their lounge. We had somewhere around 30 guests possibly more throughout the evening and the staff tried their best to accommodate us. While I will say they were not prepared for a group our size, I will give them an A for effort. The grilled cheese and poutine were pretty delicious. I had a Deck The Halls cocktail which was so good! I also had the bartender make me a French Gimlet with St Germain and it was heavenly!!! Our waitress was definitely nice and ill say she tried but there were definitely some issues. I guess the biggest being the wait for drinks. Some people waited 45 minutes for a beer. Other times drinks would just be set down and no one would know who it was supposed to belong to. Or an order would just end up at the wrong person and I would be figuring it out as opposed to our waitress. They just really needed a second person helping out. But illl end this review on a positive note- we have probably 10-20 separate checks and I know it was really hard for our waitress to keep it straight but she somehow DID! Everyone paid before they left and only paid for what they had and all that. Def a difficult task. Oh and we also had an awesome coconut cake made by their pastry chef. Yum! I would recommend this place for a birthday party but definitely with a smaller group. And I wanna try their dinner for sure.
