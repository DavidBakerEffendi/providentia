Amazing... amazing find.  We stumbled into this wine bar out of the rain, and were taking too cute cave-like back room where we were treated like princesses by the waitstaff.  They actually cared what we ordered, had great opinions, and offered only when it was clear we wanted them.  In short, fabulous, very intuitive service and excellent knowledge and recommendations on wine.   The pizza and mini tomato appetizers they brought us were also great - the ingredients tasted so fresh that both were a WOW. I'm coming back as soon as I'm back in the area.
