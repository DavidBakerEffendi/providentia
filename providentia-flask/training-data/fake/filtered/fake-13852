YummmmmmYYYY.  I love Spice.  A cute intimate little restaurant.  Go a couple times and the owner knows you by name.  The tempura is awesome, the tom ka soup is awesome, the shrimp puffs are awesome - get the picture?  I have yet to have anything I didn't like.  Make sure you save room for dessert.  The mango ice cream with sticky rice is to die for!
