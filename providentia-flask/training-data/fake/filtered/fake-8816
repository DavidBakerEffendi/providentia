I have eaten at Blue Ribbon time and time again .. outstanding food and service. The recently discovered Â Chicken Wings were a recent hit and were even served with live 'flame' if you wanted to roast them a bit more! I would always recommend this and all the locations for Blue Ribbon - they are all outstanding.
