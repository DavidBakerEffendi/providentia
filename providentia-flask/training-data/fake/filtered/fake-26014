While, in the interests of fairness, the food was good, everything else so far overshadowed the taste of the meal, that the entire experience was ruined.  Allow me to explain... From the moment we entered the restaurant, there was a heavy, pallid smoke in the air.  The waitress explained it away to something with the oven.  The same waitress couldnt find our reservation, which wasn't a real issue, as the place was empty. The stench of smoke permeated our clothing, our hair, and finally, the food.  Finally, after many minutes, a manager shouted across the room to us that there was a problem downstairs with the building boiler, so really, there was nothing anyone could do. Really?  Nothing?  Not even an apology or an offer to return another time?  How about a glass of wine for our acrid clothing and horrid service?  It wasn't like there were hordes of other customers to be placated. Sadly, it could have been a great meal, but I don't remember anything about the food, just the smoke and stench and attitudes of the staff, as if we were lucky to be dining there at all. Well, in the future, we won't be.
