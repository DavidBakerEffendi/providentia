I have been to this amazing establishment for dates, family gatherings and business meetings. The cuisine is exceeded only by the service. The Chef and the Owner make sure that each person's experience is absolute perfection. I had a business meeting scheduled for Monday, a night that L'incontro is closed. Upon my panicked arrival, Vinnie apologized that the restaurant was closed for private parties, offered me a complimentary drink, and made a reservation for my party at another restaurant down the block. He went as far as to call personally and ask the restaurant manager to take very good care of us. You don't find service like this anymore! Vinnie is a class act and both the cuisine and staff are pure perfection. Highly recommended for any occasion!
