The food was okay, except in my coleslaw there was a moldy carrot. Beer Selection could have been better, good fries anyway. The main problem is that the service was terrible. There was 1 waitress for the 3 tables of 2 that were there, and she was extremely slow and never checked on us. Then when we went to leave, my girlfriend asked to have her leftovers put in a box and the waitress just threw it away and we never saw her again.... If you want good pub food, go to the HalfDoor.
