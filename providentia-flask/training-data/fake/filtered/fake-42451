This was an unfortunate dining experience. I went here on a Friday night with my boyfriend and two other couples. Initially I was quite pleased - the atmosphere was small and rustic Italian and the food was great. The problem was the raucous crowd of 10 seated next to us. They were so loud for the entire duration of the meal. One woman at the table was literally screaming at her friends rather than talking to them with this deep guttural, drunk voice that literally made everyone in the restaurant shudder. The restaurant is SMALL - and it got to the point where we couldn't carry on conversations or hear one another speak and were literally cringing every two minutes. When the check arrived I kindly explained the situation to the waiter. I said that while the food was great I was surprised that we were being charged a 20% gratuity when it was such an obviously unpleasant dining experience. I was also surprised that we didn't receive an apology or complimentary dessert or SOMETHING to acknowledge the fact that we were subject to such loud obnoxious noise. The waiter just shrugged like he had no idea what I was talking about and asked if we had paid the bill yet. It was a total "in one ear and out the other" reaction. When the people finally left, as we were signing the bill, we saw the waiter give the guests hugs goodbye. I guess the staff is more concerned with keeping their friends loud, drunk and happy than with the dining experience of their other guests.
