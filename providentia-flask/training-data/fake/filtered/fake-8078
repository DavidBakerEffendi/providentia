China Pan is my favorite Chinese food restaurant, if for no other reason than the four (or more?) pages of vegan/vegetarian options. I am from Massachusetts, and whenever possible, my friends and I pack my van full of people and we make the trip for dinner. This restaurant is not only for vegetarians though. My friends all tell me the non-vegan options are equally delicious and worth the drive!
