Delicious and Friendly!  We walked in 15 minutes before close and they welcomed us warmly.  Falafel was crispy and delicious.  The green sauce was simply incredible. Roasted eggplant was yummy, and even better with some of their spicy sauce.  I'd go back there in a heartbeat.This place has some of the best hummus I have ever had. The atmosphere is great, the prices are great and the service is good. They also have amazing falafel .Great Job. Hands down THE best hummus I've ever had. Try the hummus fava! The baklava is also very good.Fresh Salad's,Amazing Pita and Laffa bread,Everything was fantastic!  We ordered a just about everything on the menu and all the dishes were really excellent. Don't miss the  Shawarma you'll be glad you tried it.this place is YUMMY. And cheap too. The service is awesome as everyone is really nice.Highly recommended. Gread JOB!!!
