This has been my favorite pizza place forever! I have tried all of the other places in town and there have been some good ones but when it comes to just straight up pizza, Foxy's wins hands down. I am not a huge fan of the other items on their menu and haven't really tried that many. Pizza night means Foxy at our house and we can always rely on it being done perfectly! It's nice to have a place in town that we like that has survived since childhood!
