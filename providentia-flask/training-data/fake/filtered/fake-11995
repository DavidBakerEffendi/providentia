This is one of my favorite tapas bars.  The atmosphere  is cozy only like 15 seats in the restaurant great place for a date or to hang out with some friends. Loved the octopus, garlic shrimp, and stuffed peppers.  Sangria was tasty but not my favorite.  If your with a group of friends the peron (not sure if I am spelling it right) is always worth trying for fun.
