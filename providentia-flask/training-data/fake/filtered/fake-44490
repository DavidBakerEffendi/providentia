What a terrific pub. The menu is out of this world, delicious lobster roll,burgers are exactly what you are looking for and coime with great fries. Lobster mac and cheese, other great bar/pub food including fish and chips and chili. Full bar and wine and beer menu. Full of local lunch /business crowd and hopping at night. Check it out, a really beautiful authentic and welcoming pub.
