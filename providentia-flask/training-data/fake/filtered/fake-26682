I really can't recommend this place enough. Pita Ziki is straight up amazing. It is a must visit. It's open until 11pm and is perfect for a 2nd dinner or late meal. I had the rice bowl with chicken shawarma and falafel. The meat was cooked to perfection and the countless number of additional things you could add to the rice bowl made for a great variety of flavors. All the ingredients tasted fresh. An overall great and healthy meal. The restaurant is clean and the music playing is upbeat and fun. An overall great environment. I highly recommend coming with friends whether it is for lunch or a late night snack. The staff are nice, funny, and seem to genuinely care about pleasing the customer.
