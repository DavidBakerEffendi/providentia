Great guys running the joint and making the sandwiches.  They care about the community and even donate bread to the soup kitchen in my church a block or so away.  They are consistently enthusiastic and kind. The food ... oh, yeah ... the food.  I've tried about half a dozen of their specialty sandwiches and every one of them has been fantastic.  Excellent portion sizes ... fresh ingredients ... tender meats ... creative combinations.  All of it very well done!
