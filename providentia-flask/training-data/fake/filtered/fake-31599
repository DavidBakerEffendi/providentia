Blend On The Water was the perfect place to have a summer evening dinner with my sister. We sat outside and enjoyed the breeze and view. Our server was Javier; he was incredible. Javier was pleasant, polite and right on point with ALL of his recommendations. The food was tasty the drinks were satisfying and the atmosphere was on point. An extra special shout out to Carlos, teamwork is reflection of leadership and you are doing a great job.
