In from out of town for a wedding tonight and looking for a great small biz family restaurant walking distance from Omni and other yelp reviews led us here- home run for breakfast or lunch. Four of us tried different breakfast dishes and all were superb. My Veggie omelet was chock full of fresh veggies- tomato, peppers, mushrooms, and onions. Side of bacon was perfect. And surprisingly, Â the home fried potatoes were a highlight. The Greek influence comes through with perfectly roasted potatoes small bites. Best I've had anywhere in a long time.
