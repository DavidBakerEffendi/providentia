THIS is where you want to go for brunch.  The locals have figured that out, and the staff knows it too: "Best poached eggs ever." "Best bloody marys in New York." "Our coffee is excellent." "You can't leave without trying the amaretto bread pudding."  They may not be humble, but they're right, and they're fast, attentive and so friendly.  Fresh-squeezed OJ in your mimosa; the eggs were done to perFECtion; a salmon fritatta with at least a half-pound of the stuff piled in a tender pink rose on top of the eggs.  I've been there four times for brunch and just found out that they're open for brunch tomorrow (New Year's Day).  My BF and I will be getting over OUR hangovers there, sipping a bloody, watching the pigeon man train his birds from Bocca's window.
