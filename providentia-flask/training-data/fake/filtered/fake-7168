They have best Chinese steam dumplings in the city. Every time I happen to visit, there's long line. Order one pork and one crab and side of cchacchayi(Chinese pickle), because if you eat 3~4e of them, it tends to get little queasy. A lot of customers are tourist and they do not know how to eat the steam dumplings. 1. You have to carefully pick it up with your chopstick 2. put the dumpling in the spoon  3. make a little hole top of the dumpling  4. drink the soup in the dumpling  5. place little bit soy sauce in the dumpling then finish.  Other dishes are so. so. but you got to try their dumplings.
