Valley Regency hires thieves  for Valets!  While attending a corporate party there last night one of their valets stole about 10 dollars in change from my car.  Shame on me for forgetting to take it out of my care before I went but bigger shame on Valley Regency for allowing this to take place.  I will never attend another corporate unction here again.  If you go I would recommend removing all valuables from your cars or do not use Valet parking.  Lesson learned.
