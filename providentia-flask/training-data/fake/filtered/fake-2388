Holy crap. This Pizza blew my mind. It was like a nostalgic bite into the world of the tomato and cheese. You can see teh freshness and feel the garlic. I could never have thought that i would be this proud of myself jsut for stumbling upon this euphoria of flavor. I want to spend the rest of my life searching out and craving this kind of pizza. The price was so amazing that i coudl easily come here all the time. i coudl easily afford to eat all of this stuff as often as I want and as often as i should. this is a great pizza. I recommend it to all my friends. Even those friends of mien that can no longer enjoy solid goods.
