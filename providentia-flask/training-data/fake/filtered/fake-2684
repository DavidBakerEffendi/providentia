This is perhaps the best find in NYC.  My wife and I have been going here for years.  It's certainly tight (cozy may be a stretch), but the food is well worth it. My only complaint is that this used to be NYC's best kept secret...now Jehangir is famous - so it's just the best "find."  You'll need a reservation if you how to get in.
