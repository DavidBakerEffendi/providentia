Anchovies, bone marrow and ground beef: It's one of those why-didn't-anyone-think-of-that-before combinations that, despite its initial impression of outlandishness, makes all the sense in the world. Â The use of marrow--heaven's butter, as a particularly eloquent waiter once called it years ago at Pif--shows not just a respect for those of us who wish it were even more prevalent around town, but also to the animal itself, taking advantage of more of the bounty a cow provides than by just settling for the all-beef patty. The addition of hyper-savory anchovy mayonnaise (charged up even more with shiro miso) slathered onto the bun accomplishes what the space shuttle's booster rockets do: Ramps the power of an already serious system that even on its own is impressive.
