I've been eating here for at least two years now, and the quality of the food seems to be going down. The last few times I've ordered the food just hasn't been as tasty, and the ingredients haven't been as fresh. My favorites are pad thai and drunken noodles, and they just aren't as good as other places in the area. The prices on the other hand, are very reasonable. I just miss the great taste that used to accompany the prices.
