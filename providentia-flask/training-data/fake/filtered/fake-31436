0 stars. food poisioning and the no one from the restaurant called us back after telling the restaurant 2x. dined on a thursday  night as a party of 6. one of the many appetizers we ordered was the fried calamari. it came out too well done almost but not  quite burnt. we sent it back and i could swear they brought out the exact same dish we sent back but ate it anyway. the 3 people that ate the calamari got sick. vomiting and stomach issues. we called the owner 2x to tell him  and only got to tell the hostess because the owner never called us back. very poor way of dealing with this  in a seafood restaurant! never go back! 0 stars!
