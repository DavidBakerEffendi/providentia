I've lived in Old City for years and always thought it needed a mexican spot, and Lucha Cartel was the answer to my longing!  I absolutely adore the fish tacos, and the specials are always on point.  It's a great place for lunch, and I LOVE that they have salsa dancing on Tuesdays; you get a lesson followed by the opportunity to show off your newly learned skill!  The drinks are reasonably priced for Old City as well. Welcome to the neighborhood, Lucha!
