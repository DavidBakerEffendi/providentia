I was very disappointed at Topaz Thai on April 12, 2014. In a nutshell, the service was very lacking, the food was mediocre. we arrived at 7PM, the restaurant was only half full. But, the server didn't have proper greeting to sit us down, offered menu, then, ignored use for 25 minutes. Then, he finally came to take orders. He forgot to bring out salad. The Emprus Tofu was poor. Every piece is huge, less cooked in the middle part. The dishes we had were not good, the vegies were undercooked, the meat was overcooked. The worst part was the server didn't close the lid properly when he packed my red curry dish. The juice leaked into my car and on my carpet through the hole of plastic bag. I will be very hesitate to return.
