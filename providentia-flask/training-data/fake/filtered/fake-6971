I dont understand why the food is so consistantly underpar. I go frequently with my friends for happy hour. I hate chain restaurants, but we are going to Tiffs next time. Even when its slow, our steaks are under or overcooked, the chili is cold, the mozzerella sticks have no cheese in them, the fries are caked with salt, burger buns are stale,and I got a Bud bottle that was warm...I couldnt believe the bartender didnt feel that it was so. This place really changed over the summer. The bartender was talking about going to their other location reopening soon in Nutley. Now that is just bad business. Its like playing slots in AC...you may win but the odds are not so good. Giovanne Nero
