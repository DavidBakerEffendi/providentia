This place is very good for 3 reasons, 1)   Its a good place to stop for a low-key drink during the week.  They have a very good beer selection and some cool bartenders 2) The menu is more upscale and the dining room is a perfect place for a date.  It's a few big steps above the regular pub food in the area 3)  BRUNCH.  The place has the best brunch special in the city.  Hands down.  20 bucks for all the mimosas or bloodys you can drink and a sandwich/burger/breakfast item off of the menu.  Also, Bob the bartender is in there to bust all of your friends balls.  The place is the best way to spend a cold winter Sunday.
