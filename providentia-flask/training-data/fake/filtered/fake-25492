Best ramen I've ever had.  After reading reviews here I'm excited to try some of the other options in NYC but I just arrived so I'm elated.  Had the Akamaru ramen with an egg and the minty special ramen with an egg and pork (we split both ramens).  Both were truly out of this world amazing.  Pork buns were also legendary, as expected. The only reason I give this place 4 stars is because my waitress was dead inside and also kept asking us what we were going to order over and over trying to flip us through the restaurant.  I was feeling the pressure to eat and leave which I did not appreciate.   Anyways, food was so amazing I would definitely return.  Thanks Ippudo!
