Agree with Steven K review. Minus signs or a black hole needed for rating icon. Friends and I have been to Moshulu many times for holidays and even NY EVE, but this will be the last time. The place was in the weeds the entire evening, at least from 5:20 till 10:15. Either they overbooked --was the private party upstairs a wedding reception? Why else the bride in dress and bouquet leaving at the same time we did  -- or the staffing, both kitchen and wait staff, was insufficient . It took 4.45 hours for our 4 course, not inexpensive meal to be delivered to us and needed one of us to get up twice to find a manager to expedite things. Although he was very apologetic and reassuring that our entree which we waited almost an hour for would be along in just a few minutes, he nor the wait staff ever returned to see if it was all right or whether we needed additional drinks. The waitress reappeared after entree plates were cleared with dessert spoons, never asked if we wanted coffee  or an after-dinner drink. Once dessert came, we asked for check immediately. The whole idea of early reservation was to be able to do other things the balance of the evening. Before we left we spoke with the manager again who really began to espouse our complaints as a personal affront. Not the intention. We saw it as huge waste of money, meals, drinks, taxes, tip around 1 k and a very disappointing holiday experience. The bright notes of the evening were the 6 pm fireworks and the fact that none of our coats were in a jumble of the coat room. Evidently coat racks had collapsed and staff could not easily find customers' correct coat!! More could be said about the quality of the entrees, like medium rare tenderloins with no pink, but we are done here,  and there.
