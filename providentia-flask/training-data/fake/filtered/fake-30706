Just moved into neighborhood. Ordered Grandma pie last week, totally not a Gma pie. Tonight, chicken parm lasagna with a side of meatballs...the meatballs tasted frozen, which would be fine, BUT they tasted horrible ! The chicken parm was lil pieces of chicken instead of full piece..When I can say I cook better than this, it sad! I will cook from now on, no matter what time I get home! Not worth the money!
