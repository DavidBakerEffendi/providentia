The (positive) reviews here did not let me down! Just back to Philly from a day trip to Chelsea district to check out galleries. I scoped out places to eat in the area online beforehand to see if there was anything not too fancy (i.e. cheaper). I still only expected 'NY cheap'. This was just what I wanted and expected based on the write-ups. A tiny, hole-in-the-wall place that was no frills, no fuss. Just straight grub big on taste. You dieting? Just keep walking. The guys in here were super friendly and it was obvious that most of the customers are regulars (always a good sign)! We got there at the tail-end of lunch, so managed to get seats at the small counter. I'm guessing there's a line out the door during lunch hour. The unexpected bonus? This food was cheaper than some of the cheap places in Philly! Anytime I'm even remotely in the area again, you can be sure I'll make a point to stop at Johny's for grub.
