Wow! What a fantastic spot! I hate the fact that I had waited so long to check it out, truly, my kind of place. I have been there twice and both times were amazing. Once with my wife and then again with my friends. This is how I like to eat, small plates that are very well thought out. We ordered a bunch and while they were all amazing, there were a few that stand out to the point of being craved every now and again. The brie with cherries as well as the ricotta with pistachio and honey bruschettas were fantastic. I also really enjoyed the lamb sausage with white beans, feta and mint sauce as well as the smoked salmon with mascarpone, pine nuts and raisins. I want to live here!
