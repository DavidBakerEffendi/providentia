This place has incredible potential! The Decor + Music is wonderful. It is the perfect atmosphere for a romantic/impressive Date Night. My fiancee + I tried this restaurant this evening, and while it was lovely + everyone there was helpful and attentive, I would only consider going here for special occasions as the food is a little over-priced for such limited choices. Perhaps with time, they will have more to offer, which will be exciting! We got the sushi/Sashimi for two, and it was more than enough for the two of us. The fish was fresh and delicious, but my favorite part of the meal was the Angry Dragon roll. It was phenomenal! As was the entire presentation for the meal. We ended our evening with tempura ice cream which was brought to us in flames. It was a neat presentation. The dough, however was a little too thick and heavy for my palate + my fiance agrees that the tempura was too overpowering and the ice cream could not be appreciated. I was sad to see that mochi/mochi ice cream was not an option on the menu. We look forward to seeing how this place does and we are excited for its potential.
