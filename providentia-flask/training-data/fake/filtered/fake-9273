My family spent a week in the Burlington area recently. We had selected L'amante for our 'big meal out'. We were not at all dissapointed! Beginning with the squash blossom fritters, gnocchi with arugula pesto, and risotto with prawns, and ending with a sumptuous ribeye for two, the fare was outstanding. Great wine list and terrific service will help us fondly remember our experience. I highly recommend L'amante to anyone looking for a delightful dining experience. They do it right here!!
