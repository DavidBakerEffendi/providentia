We order take-out on a somewhat regular basis and are generally pleased, which is why the three stars and not one star rating.   However, last night I ordered Tom Ka and it was the WORST I've ever tasted in my life. It was watered down, bland coconut milk with mushrooms and tofu---lacked flavor, none of the tasty subtle flavors. No basil, lemon grass, etc. It was gross. My husband ordered the M Saigon Rice (#38), there was ONE shrimp. Now we don't need 20 shrimp or anything,  but maybe a couple, geez! We will try it one more time but if it is just watered down coconut milk we will make the longer drive to Winooski.
