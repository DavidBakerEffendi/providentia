Finally tried this nice restaurant.  I live in West Orange and am thrilled that we have such a nice place right on Main Street.  The food was delicious and incredibly priced.  I have never tried Peruvian before and I was pleasantly surprised.  I am looking forward to returning.  The service was great and the decor was outstanding.   They only draw back to the whole night is that they ran out of the wine we were drinking.
