A mom & pop shop that serves fresh, quality food quickly & in a clean environment. This place is open VERY early in the morning and closes around the early evening... Mostly breakfast and lunch crowd, weekends they are open half day. My family & I have been going here for years. I wouldn't go anywhere else. Many of the items are home-made. LOVE THEM!!!
