The Liff was my home for years.  The new Liff has changed for the worse.  A cover charge that was rarely charged in the past for mediocre bands that I've seen dozens of times, is now charged many nights.  The best indication is that the staff has changed almost entirely, the pints are $6 and it's more of a nightclub now than a pub.  I see all of the former Liff regulars at different places now.  What a shame.
