I went to this new place in the neighborhood tonight and hoped to have a light meal and play pool. After the check the manager came out into the front and yelled at me in front of my friends and girlfriend for not giving enough tip. I went to the back with him to look at the bill and said 'yeah, we tipped 10% because the server was rude and aggressive for no reason. My friend ordered a burger and fries and when it came it had potato salad instead of fries. The server said we should have said we wanted fries when that was what we ordered. He walked away and came back and slammed ketchup on our table for no reason.' This is what I explained to the manager about why we gave a 10% tip. He wanted more, so I tried to hand him more money, but he didn't like how I did it and slapped the money out of my hand. I tried to pick it back up to give it to him and he told me to leave the place and not come back. I said that was crazy and he backed Â down. I hope this whole thing wasn't because of my skin color.
