We happened to be in NYC for the Argentina-Brazil soccer game this past weekend. After reading some reviews at yelp, we decided to head down to Porteno on Friday night. After being welcomed by Jorge, the owner, we were given the table next to the bookcase where you can fully appreciate what's going on at the restaurant.  The food was great, it was Matambrito with vegetables with scalloped potatoes. We decided to come back on Saturday after the game, and set foot at the same corner table, but this time Jorge (a native Argentinian like us) approached us, taught us a lot more about wines and what foods should be accompanied to. After that, He took us on a food roller-coaster that started with a perfectly cooked octopus and ended with a filet mignon out of this world. If you happen to be around this neighborhood, or even if you live in New York, this is the place for you, it will not disappoint you. Kudos to the staff,  Martin, Juana, Natalia, Josue and Brent for made us feel like at home. Porteno, we will be there soon!!!
