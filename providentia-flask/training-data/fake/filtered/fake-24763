Yay, our first review for yelp as Ali and Andy! I've (ali) been here numerous times before and so on a late, rainy, Friday night before Mothers day, Andy and I took my mom out to shabu here. It was the perfect meal. It was very authentic as if we were getting Shabu in Japan. Service was friendly and the taste was light and flavorful. Definitely worth it. The braised pork belly was a definite must!
