Probably the best veggie burger i've had.  Ever.  I love this place.  Great bartenders, great prices - where else are you going to find $2.50 lager pints?  And that's not the HH price - it's that price all the time.  Pretty good beer selection & the kitchen is open til 1am every night. Weekends can get crowded and VERY hot in there during the summer, so I prefer to go during the week.  It's one of those rare places in Philadelphia that, no matter what night of the week, there's always a good crowd.  I haven't had their brunch yet, but i'm dying to!
