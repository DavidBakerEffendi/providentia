"Hey Tony...  you are the BEST!!!"   My husband and I stepped into Tony's DiNapoli for dinner, before enjoying the Broadway show 'Anything Goes', which plays across the street from the restaurant.  WOW...  what a delightful evening!   Friendly and efficient service, great bar for drinks and wonderful wine selection, platter-portions of EXCELLENT authentic Italian food and "to-die-for" Tiramisu-style cheesecake!  Individual or half-orders are also available.  Our server "Brad" was AWESOME and this dinner was the BEST that we experienced on vacation.  We would definitely go back again, in a NYC heartbeat!  :)
