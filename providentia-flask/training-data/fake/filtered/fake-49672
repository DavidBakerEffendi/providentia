This was my second visit to Portofinos. I ordered a PANECOTTO - and the exact description of the plate it's as such: "Escarole & Beans with Italian Bread pancetta and parmigiano reggiano" I expected some italian bread with escarole and beans topped with pancetta and some parmigiano cheese! ..... what I actually received was a "casserole type of dish it not what I had in mind. When our waitress returned to our table to ask if everyone was happy with their meal I expressed my dissapointment at the dish as I expected something else. To my surprise this was her response "well that is what you ordered and that's about it" she did not asked if I wanted another dish nor did she take the mush looking casserole away.  About 8 minutes later after she spoke to her manager (this was observed by my co-workers) she decided to offer the option of another dish or a side pasta! ..... I declined all offers as we had already been there for over an hour and we were all on our lunch brake and could not wait for another dish. The dish remained untouched at our table until the bill came, and again to my surprise the dish was NOT TAKING OFF THE BILL!!!!!!!!  ......  PORTOFINOS it's known in the New Haven area as a high end type of restaurant therefore I expected this item to be removed from the bill as a curtasy. If chain restaurant such as dunkin donuts are willing to take items of the bill credit you why not a restaurant such as Portofinos.
