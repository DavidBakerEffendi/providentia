Oh hey, its a ssam bar but you can't really get the good ssam unless you preorder with a bunch of people.  Great.  It's like an IHOP that doesn't sell pancakes. And yes, I know they have a fish ssam but everyone knows fish is basically a vegetable. I've been to several of David Chang's establishments and I have to say I was sorely disappointed by this one.   What we ate: -- kimchi was good, unique -- I would never have thought to put apples into it.   -- rice cake with pork sauce was good, delicious.  but its a pretty basic and simple korean dish that's really difficult to do poorly. -- pork belly bun was good but really nothing all that special.  when you're cooking with all that pork fat, it is damn hard to screw it up.  a restaurant (with a reputation like momofuku's) really should do a little more than serve up a slab of pork fat and call it a day.  it's a little lazy to be honest. -- seafood stew was terrible, awful, very bad, gross.  i had a flavor i couldn't really put my finger on and i don't really care to try to. The only reason I think this restaurant has four stars is because most other non-Japanese/Thai Asian restaurants in Manhatten are pretty terrible.
