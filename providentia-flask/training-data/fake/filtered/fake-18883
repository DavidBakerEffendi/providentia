Do not, under any circumstances, go to Artichoke. The line outside is just a ruse to lure tourists, and the incomparably delicious smell emanating from the place comes from an aerosol can.  Oh sure, $4 for a giant slice of crusty magnificence sounds like a deal, but where's the red sauce?  Oh, are you telling me that this is supposed to be some kind of spinach and artichoke, al freddo pizza?  Guh-ross.  I suppose next you'll be telling me you can get a Big Gulp-sized beer to go with it.  For under $10?! Damn you, Artichoke.  Damn you and your irresistible [even at 4AM] pizza.
