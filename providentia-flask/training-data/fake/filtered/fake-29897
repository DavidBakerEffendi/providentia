Very rude!  I was told on Valentines Day that I had never made a reservation.  Picture yourself with your wife who is 8 months pregnant showing up for dinner at a place that you have reservations only to be told that they have no record of it.  They did nothing to make up for it except for allowing my pregnant wife to eat at the bar.  Thanks for ruining our evening Terrazza's.  Thanks for nothing.
