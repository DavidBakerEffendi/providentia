The owner is a bigoted douche. They have a sign stating that all orders must be in English. My Italian Grandmother who can only speak broken English tried to order a cheese steak and was flat out denied. The cashier was extremely rude to both myself and my Grandmother. I cancelled my order and literally told them to shove my order up their A$$. We went elsewhere for lunch. Never again will I go here. I had to explain to my Grandmother what transpired, very embarrassing.
