Philadelphia is a mecca for cheesesteaks.  Unfortunately, Pat's is living on their laurels.  They were much better about forty years ago.  The steaks are not what they used to be.  To add to the fun, their counter staff are marginally rude even on a good day.  There are plenty of places in Philadelphia to get a much better cheesesteak and be treated with respect besides.
