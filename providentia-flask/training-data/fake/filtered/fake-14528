I recently moved to Princeton from New York City where I spent 20 years eating great pizza.  I have definitely been picky, and on the top of my list are places like John's and Patsy's.  I was fairly amazed to go to this tiny place in Kingston NJ to find pizza that is better then anything I ever ate in NYC.  Excellent crust, great ingredients and very inventive combinations.  Really good salads as well.  This has become one our families favorite stops.  Small space but nice atmosphere....
