I bought the LivingSocial deal Bin228 was offering. When I made my reservation, I made sure to mention the LivingSocial deal that I was going to be using. The lady on the phone said she marked it down. When we got there, I asked if they were doing half price bottles, and our waitress said yes. Since I had the deal, I asked her to recommend a bottle. She picked a $60 bottle of wine. When we got the check, the bottle of wine was full price. She then proceeded to tell me we could not take advantage of both. If I was told this, I woudl not have gone with her suggestion of the expensive bottle of wine. Also, since they had noted on my reservation that I had the deal, I'm not sure why this was an issue. It would have been cheaper to go with the half price bottle of wine, rather than using our LivingSocial deal. Besides this experience, the place is cute, hip, and fun - what you would expect for a wine bar. The service was very slow and not very friendly. The food was good, but it is mainly panini's, and really, anyone can make a good panini at home in their house... I would not return for dinner, but it might be a cute place for grabbing lunch.
