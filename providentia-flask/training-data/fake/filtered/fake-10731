This place is one of the best for great Greek food for low prices in the downtown area. Not only do they give you a load of food, but it's fresh and delicious. I went there today and ordered the vegetarian combo. For 8.95 I got a giant scoop of hummus, babaghannoush, two BAKED falafel (which I love that), grape leaves, and tabbouleh with salad. A warm pita comes on the side and it was all delicious. Though not the best hummus or babaghannoush I've had, it was all really good. This is one of those places which is a hidden gem, homey atmosphere, and friendly staff. HIGHLY recommended!
