Just moved to Philly from Texas, as much as I hate the Chinatown here, this place is awesome. Authentic Chinese food, good portion and reasonable price. I have tried a couple appetizers and the beef noodle soup, they are all very delicious and enough to feed me for two meals. A bit crowded, so try not to go on the weekend.
