GREAT food here, BUT... I went last night (Saturday night) for dinner. Dinner was delicious, but we were rushed rushed rushed through our meal. It was very uncomfortable.   We got the meatballs and the gnocchi. We ate at a regular pace, not at all slow. While we were very much still actively sopping up sauce with our bread, and had a couple pieces of bread and lots of sauce left, the waitress came by and scooped up all three plates and walked away.  I'm not sure why we didn't say anything ( like wait, stop!) But we didn't. Then, as we sat with full drinks, the waitress came by and dropped the check. We paid, left a 20 percent tip, and then continued to chat while finishing our drinks. After only about three minutes, someone came by and asked if we wanted anything else. We said no (we had already paid). It was clear the only reason for their asking this question was to usher us out.  I repeat, we had mostly full drinks, and had only a few minutes earlier wrapped up dinner. Then, a minute or two after that, they came by and CLEARED OUR WATER GLASSES. Come on Northern Spy - you guys are classier than that. I've worked in a restaurant. I know when you want to turn a table, and the customers are dawdling. But we weren't doing that. Do you really want your customers to feel rushed and unappreciated when they leave? So you make 20 bucks less at the end of the night...isn't what's more important that we leave happy, and keep coming back?
