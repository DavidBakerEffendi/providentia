Just tried it for the first time. They have a new chef and so far all is good! I have herd the food was ok but we had a grilled flat bread special and it was out of this world. My friend ordered steamed mussels and she said it was the best she has had. It seams like thing are coming around at the Hook and Ladder so I cant wait to get back and try happy hour I hear it great!
