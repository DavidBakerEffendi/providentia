Not even the best food in the world can overcome a HORRIBLE RUDE waiter. Â My wife and I went there last night, and when we weren't ready to order immediately after sitting down, the experience began to suck. The food was really good, however....it took forever for the wine to come....and after taking our order on the 2nd trip back...he never was accessible nor did he proactively ask us if we wanted another glass of wine, and water refills were nowhere to be found. Looking around, everyone else seemed to be flagging him down as well....this is a competitive business, and this place is now banned due to being treated like crap. Again food was great, but that is far from everything....when you are looking for a fun night out.
