I don't understand the love about this restaurant.. it is OK food but nothing to wow about.. somehow people likes the ambiance and the extra sauced food. there are many other authentic Thia places in the city. the curry chicken we ordered was overwhelmed by the sauce and too salty. I do like their attention and service which was fast. overall an ok place but I would go for other places for my Thai food
