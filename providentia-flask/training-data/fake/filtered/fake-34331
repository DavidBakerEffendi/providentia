My friend Eric introduced me to Sushi Yasuda several years ago...my first try with monkfish liver. Loved it. I love the warmth of the bamboo walls, the interesting and helpful staff, and the amazing sushi. I've never been disappointed. Hadn't been back in five years; my husband and I walked in on Saturday night and were immediately seated. Best uni I've had, the scallops melted on my tongue, and the white salmon was divine. We went in post-flight wear (jeans and a sweater) though lots of folks were better attired. Didn't matter. The staff made us feel welcome.
