This place has great chicken and waffles, so great I would say the flavors are very similar to those of my great grandmothers back in Texas.  I'm a chef myself and love trying out different restaurants and do it weekly, I heard about this place online and instantly had to check it out.  They have great soulfood, very delicoius, the service is quick and its good for groups.
