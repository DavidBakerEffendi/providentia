I was very disappointed in Percy Street BBQ.  The ambiance matched the food well and the service was good.  The key lime pie for desert was very good as well.  The worst part of the dining experience was the main course.  We had eight people and purchased "The Lockhart" for each of us.  This was supposed to be $27.00 for all the meats and all the sides.  We didn't get enough of anything so we can all try the various meats and sides.  I am not a big portion diner but this was ridiculous.  The Lockhart is NOT all you can eat but it seems like it when you read it on the menu.  It was a good thing that the portions were small because the meat was very fatty and full of grilse.  I sure hope their meat order didn't come in and we were the exception.  I will NOT be returning to Percy Street BBQ.  Neither will my 7 fellow diners.
