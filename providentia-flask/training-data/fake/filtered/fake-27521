Best Halal food in NYC in my opinion. Best hot sauce I have ever had. Fantastic. The most perfectly cooked lamb and chicken at any street halal cart. 53rd and 7th cart is another one run by the same people that is open all day till. The more famous 53rd and 6th cart however is not open until 7pm so if you go there before and there is a cart there before 7pm DO OT GO THERE. IT IS NOT THEM!
