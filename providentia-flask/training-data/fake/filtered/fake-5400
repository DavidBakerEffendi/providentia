Sorry, but I just don't think the value is there.  Two of us each had an appetizer and shared a $27 entree.  If you wanted rice wih the entree it was another $5.  Really ?? Rice??  I mentioned that for the price, I should get rice and they gave it to me ... but really, two of us sharing an entree and still spending over $50 ... Just not worth the price.  The food however, is very good and since I don't eat meat, it is a shame I won't be going back.
