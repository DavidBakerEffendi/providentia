Once you've crossed the street, the entrance catch up your attention. There's a unique place in the midst of Broadway. Once inside Lillie's, you immediately noticed you're in a place where quality & attention walk together. You can go with friends before or/& after a musical -it is extremely closed from the main Broadway theatres-. The service is really nice and professional. The manager is always available and look after the clients, making them feel like home. The variety of drinks is wide and amazing. You have excellent beers, whiskeys and cocktails -you have to taste the Donna Bella-. Unfortunately, we don't have enough time to taste the food, so, Lillie's , make a reservation for this tourist (:
