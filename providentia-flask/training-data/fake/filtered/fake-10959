So poor service. We ordered 5 kind of foods then we waited 15minutes for the 1st one to come. The delivery of foods was so long, it comes once when we finish each food and yet we waited for about an hour and the other 2 order has not come. I feel like discriminated, for some other people who came later than us have their foods already. Such a bad eating experience. Beware of discrimination.
