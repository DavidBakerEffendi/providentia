I had an anniversary dinner at Pascolo. We had the best server I have had in a long time. Her name was Paige. She was very attentive, provided excellent service and was a pleasure to have her take care of us. We appreciated her knowledge of the menu. The food was excellent. Ravioli and Hanger Steak as well as the best Tiramisu I have had in a long time. We will be back. Hopefully we can have Paige take care of us again.
