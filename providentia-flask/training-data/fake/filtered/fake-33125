I love Red Cat! I only have been once, but I have a theory (or maybe fantasy) on what this restaurant will mean to me.  It's the type of place where I probably won't ever get the best meal of my life, but I will always get a very, very delicious one. I may have gotten the best drink of my life here.  I like unique cocktails (i.e. not always just martini, straight up) but rarely order them because they can go wrong easily and I hate it when those artificial super sweet mixers are added.  Red Cat's Autumn Sweater rocked my world.  I could see how it would be too sweet for some people but to me it was a perfect balance of sweet and bitter (no neon liquid mixers here). As for the food, it was just terrific.  Our server (Bradley, I think) was that fantastic mix of personable yet refined (i.e. friendly, great recommendations, funny, and not overbearing).  I'm hoping this becomes a regular stop.
