I find this Very good Chinese food. Yes it does take a while if you don't call your order in. That is why we always call our order in. Every thing is cooked fresh. Egg Rolls are not already cooked. I have found their kids always friendly and nice. The food has always been fresh. They have been at this location for over 15 years SO THEY MUST DO SOMETHING RIGHT. They also have a VIP card that gives you a 10% discount. Sing's Kitchen is a lot better than the two places up by the police department off of Saw Mill.
