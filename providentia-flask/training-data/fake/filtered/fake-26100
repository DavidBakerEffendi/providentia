Man -- this place may actually be one of the better / best restaurants in Rutherford. Everytime I go back im constantly amazed at the wonderful food, fresh ingredients, and awesome atmosphere. This is some straight up authentic mexican cuisine. The guacamole is banging! The tacos and qeusadillas are delicious and the steak dinners are so packed with flavor you dont wan't to leave! I've been here on numerous occasions and I am never disappointed. I would put this place on par with Cafe Matisse in terms of food prep and flavor, which isn't suprising because I hear their Chef cooked at Matisse. Azteca Restaurante is definitely one of the top food destinations in this area, all the other restaurants on Park could take a page out of their book.
