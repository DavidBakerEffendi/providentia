I have eaten at numerous spanish restaurants...and by far this is the worst restaurant I have eaten in NYC!!! My food (Pork feet to be exact) was spoiled and had a foul odor! Furthermore, there was a piece of hair in the chicken rice as well!!! When I notified the waiter of both incidents (told him both in Spanish and English) he stated "Sorry you shouldn't have eaten the food"...how rude!!! There was no apologize and I was still charged for the food. In addition, upon exiting the restaurant I noticed the letter grade was missing... To my surprise on nyc.gov/health, I discovered that as of 3/6/2014 this restaurant has 4 major violations totaling 20 points, which is why their grade is pending. I rarely write a review on a restaurant but when I do it's because I find that it has unsanitary food and it's not worth one's money nor time.
