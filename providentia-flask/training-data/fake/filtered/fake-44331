I don't want o be one of those curmudgeons that always raves about how good things were in the ol' days and complains incessantly about today, but I guess I will here.   Big Wong ("Big Wong's" is how I always called it) has always been a bit of hit-or-miss, but seems to be missing a lot more frequently. Their spare ribs run the gamut from meh to excellent and seem to be trending to the former lately.  Had them last week and they were a little too charred, were lukewarm and it seemed like we had the generally only a so-so cut as well.  The congee was only a little better  - tried the salty pork and thousand-year-old egg one - pork was good and salty as advertised, the egg was a bit underwhelming.  Usually get the "Tien-zai" (sp?) congee with seafood - that's usually consistently good. Hard to overlook the big C-rating from the health inspector out front.  Obviously long realized that it wasn't the cleanest of establishments, but now it's harder to ignore.
