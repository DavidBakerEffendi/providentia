Dear Americans, Ramen is not a noodle soup from a package. Do yourself a favor and eat REAL RAMEN at a ramen-ya. On that note, there are many ramen shops all over NYC. I am still waiting for that perfect Ramen shop in Brooklyn, but while I wait, I will gladly commute to this small/cozy ramen joint in Midtown. As an avid ramen lover, there are three major components that I look for in a GREAT bowl of ramen....the broth, the noodles, and the pork (chashu). Totto Ramen Broth: I tried the paitan ramen which is esentially their "specialty" ramen. The stock is made from chicken and is rather creamy. It is the "chicken" version of "tonkotsu" ramen, which is made from pork. A bit on the saltier side but overall really amazing broth. Totto Ramen Noodles: The noodles were cooked perfectly. Not mushy. Shiko-shiko or al dente! Straight and thin...it went very nicely with the broth and pork. Totto Ramen chashu: Slow cooked and melts in your mouth. Need. I. Say. More? They also also crisp up each slice of pork before they set it in your bowl of ramen! Downside of Totto Ramen: 1. There is always a wait to eat. I've always had to wait at least 20mins+ and there is no where to sit inside and wait so if you are going in the winter, wear layers and be prepared for the cold! 2. They have a system in which you manually write your name down on a clipboard that hangs outside the entrance of the shop. No one at the shop really monitors this system. Sometimes there are some shady folks that pretend to be other people that are on the top of the list to get a seated faster....SO WATCH OUT FOR PEOPLE WHO CUT THE WAITING LINE!! lol Hmmm.....other than that...the servers are your typical Japanese ramen shop servers. Not much for talking, fast, efficient service, and leave you to eat your bowl of ramen. CASH ONLY folks.
