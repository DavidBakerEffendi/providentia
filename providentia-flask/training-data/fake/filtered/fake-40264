The best pizza in  town!  Seriously worth the wait and the extra couple of dollars.  The freshly cut basil and extra sprinkling of cheese when the pie comes out of the oven is clutch.  Plus half of the fun us watching the cutest old Italian man craft one perfect pizza after another.  It's dinner AND a show! I have to say, though, that the regular pie is much better than the square pie.  With all the oil and cheese, the doughiness of the square pie gets to be a bit too much.  But the regular pie is the best I've ever had.  Go to it!
