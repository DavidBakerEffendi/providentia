I stopped in to buy a vegetarian lunch for my mother and immediately wished I had more time to stay for a 3 course meal. It was a weekday afternoon and the restaurant was full of patrons. Every dish I passed at the tables looked and smelled absolutely delicious! As I sat and waited for my to-go order, a member of the wait staff kindly offered me a seat and moments later served me the most delicious chilled Indian rice pudding ever! Â If I didn't have to hurry and catch a train to New Jersey, I would have stayed for an entire meal! Can't wait to go back!
