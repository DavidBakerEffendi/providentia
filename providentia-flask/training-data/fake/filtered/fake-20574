Truly one of the best Banh Mi sandwich in Manhattan in comparison to all of the other Banh Mi shops in the area.  The pork is slender cut and hot.  The patte is seasoned just right, not slopped on and soggy.  Just keep in mind, mild=spicy and hot=very spicy.   The decor is nothing special, I usually get carryout.
