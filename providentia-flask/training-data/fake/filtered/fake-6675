As fresh as it gets! Amazing! My Fiance is Brazilian, so we often venture through NY searching for great Brazilian food. It's safe to say we've found one of our favorites! The atmosphere is quaint and romantic. The food is extremely fresh and one of a kind. We started our night with their fried calamari, which was lightly battered to perfection. I then has the shrimp stew over rice. This was the best dish I had eaten in a very long time. Simply put, if you want fresh seafood or savory meat for a descent price, you must go to Malagueta.
