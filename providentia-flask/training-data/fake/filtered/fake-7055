I've only eaten here once, but I was not impressed.  I had a panini, and it was terrible. The bread was thin and flavorless, they burned it in the panini machine, and the ingredients inside were almost non existent.  I ended up throwing half of it away because it was that bad.  The menu is huge, so they may be trying to do too many things at once.  The prices are cheap which means the quality of the food is even cheaper.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
