Very terrible management experience. Dined at Bugambilias during a week night. Staff was friendly, food was good. Paid with credit and also left a tip on credit. Looked at my bank statement a few days after to see that the transaction was posted. To my dismay, the amount had been increased from $86 to $96... meaning the staff increased my tip while closing out the ticket. Whether it was a mistake or not, I called the restaurant to speak with a manager about the issue. From the beginning, of course I was annoyed at the matter but was willing to split the difference and still leave my original tip, just as long as it reflected the correct amount. After speaking with a defensive manager who, rather than assuring me things will be taken care of and apologizing for the issue, said, "your hand writing must have not been legible" ....not exactly what a frustrated customer wants to hear after the inconvenience caused. At the end of the conversation she said she was correcting the amount as we spoke. Seven days later and my account still shows no change. I have since taken this up with other management and plan to receive my full tip back from this establishment. If anyone knows customer service, it's that the customer is always right. In this case, a decent manager could have easily changed my experience by, say, offering a discount to the meal that was overcharged, or at the very least correcting the mistake that was called out. I will never go back to this restaurant, nor recommend to any friends in the area. Very poor way of handling the situation.
