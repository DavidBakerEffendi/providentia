the food was so bad... also the management was so rude... we were there to celebrate my son's 12 bday.. and they were in such rush and being so rude.. they dint took our order until all three families were there, and they kept on asking when the other people are going to arrive, we asked for papad for our two little kids and they said first your have to order and then they will bring papad, after ordering they gave us just two little Â pieces of papad. Around 10 they started us to finish up our meal quick so they could set up for saturday's buffet tables, When I asked them to provide some plates for cake, they gave us paper plates and disposable spoons. My whole experience was really bad, money went to drain.. dint enjoy a bit even after almost $$$ for six adults.
