This is not only my favorite restaurant in New York City, but probably my favorite restaurant EVER! Â I have never written a review before, but feel I have to let people know how amazing this place is! I took the recommendations of other yelp reviews and ordered the squid ink pasta and it was (still is!) my favorite meal I have ever had! I live in Florida, and can't wait to go back to NYC so I can have it again! YUM YUM YUM, everything everyone ordered was amazing and every person at my table LOVED THIS PLACE! It is extremely affordable and the olives they serve pre-meal are delicious!
