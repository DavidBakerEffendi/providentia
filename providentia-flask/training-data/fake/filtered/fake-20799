We recently had an opportunity to stop by La Sirene for dinner. Our friends have been raving about this place for so long and when we visited NYC this is where, they told us, we NEEDED to go and they were so right. We were greeted by the hostess and told her that it was our first time visiting and that we had made a reservation and she was happy to seat us right away. "The waitresses here are the nicest" whispered my friend. She also happily offered to take our coats. She later on told us they put the coats downstairs, so everyone can seat comfortably and no one steps on your jacket , which I thought was really sweet. The BYOB concept is also great as our friend likes to enjoy his very eclectic collection of wine with good friends once in a while and what better way to do it than in a cozy place with great food and an even better atmosphere.For the appetizer we had the pate which was a nicely sized pate with a little salad. It tasted as a good pate should, very rich with a good mix of flavors. And, as could be expected, all of this paired nicely with a glass of red wine. As my main course I had the hanger steak and it was FANTASTIC. The steak was presented thinly sliced and had an incredible aroma and taste to it. I could eat this steak dish every day. My friend ordered the dessert for us and out came the most interesting dessert I've seen in a long time. Ex explained that those were Profiterolles and they were a house specialty. Our server, a pretty young woman with interesting tattoos,was good, and seemed to enjoy her work, which makes all of the difference between great service and acceptable service. Plates were cleared promptly, glasses were refilled without asking, and an offer for a second basket of bread was gladly accepted after we had finished the first. I wish I had remembered her name. Overall, each of the employees that we met were really good at making eye contact, and seemed content in their tasks.What a great experience! Thank you, La Sirene
