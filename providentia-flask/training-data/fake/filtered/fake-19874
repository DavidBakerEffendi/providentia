I arrived at my 5 star rating very scientifically. 1 star for the Boudain Balls (crawfish) 1 star for the Muffaletta 1 star for the oysters 1 star for the mac & cheese 1 star for the decor We went on Sunday night of their first official opening weekend.  It's true that the wait for the food is longer than usual.  So -1 star for that.  But then the owners and the chef and even the designer all checked on us to see how we were doing.  Super friendly!  So +100 for that, which means Sugar Freak gets 104 stars, but since Yelp only goes up to 5, I will give them 5. My rating system is flawless.  ;)
