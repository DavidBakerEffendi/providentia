Arrived in New York City last Saturday. Looked for a place to sit down and get something to eat and have a drink. Found Ivy and proceeded to have a great time !! The place was busy but the service was great and the food was just as good. Everyone is so friendly. We stopped in 3 more times during the week and by Friday we almost felt like family. Thanks to all for a great time. Everyone should check it out.
