Hadnt really heard much about this little spot til restaurant week but.. wow. What a great place to have so close. Small, yet very professional and relaxed feel. The food was phenomenal. I started with the calamari appetizer and my husband with the buffalo springroll- both so full of flavor! The broccoli rabe ravioli was delicious as well as the fried oreo dessert. And we also got to enjoy our favorite wine we brought. Kevin, the owner/chef also came to chat and ensure we enjoyed our experience which I thought was a nice personal touch. He also described how the menu changes every so often, so we'll definately be back to try some new plates. Bravo Entree!
