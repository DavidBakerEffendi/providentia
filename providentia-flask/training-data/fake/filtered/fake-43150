We eat at Vito's in Wethersfield on a weekly basis.  The folks that are posting negative stuff out there need to wake up.  This place is a standard in our book.  The food and service at A+. I have to agree with one of the other yelpers- "If this was CA, it would be the best pizza ever".  It is true. Good luck finding good italian food in souther ca. Service is excellent and the quality of food is outstanding. The food is consistent with old school family reciptes and we love the family vibe.  Go Linda and Carol! And no, no one paid me to write this.  Go vitos!
