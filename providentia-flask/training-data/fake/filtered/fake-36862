The food was super-enjoyable, but our bartender, Alejandro seemed to be on another planet.  I'm not sure if he was on drugs or just got out of a serious relationship or maybe is just a rude person, but my deviled-eggs took close to 40 minutes to arrive.  They were yummy once table-side, but the price-payed of having to deal with this monster of a barkeep to get it is NOT worth it.  Coming back? Not a chance in hell.
