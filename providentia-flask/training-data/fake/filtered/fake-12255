Terrible first time dining experience Went this past Saturday for dinner to check the new place out.  We sat in the bar area, the décor is very nice and inviting.  We ordered some glasses of beer on tap and placed our meal orders. We both had the French onion soup.  The soup was excellent one of the best we've had in a long time. Thought wow this place is going to be great, not so fast speedy. Then came out our entrée's, my partner got the wrong dish, ok that happens no biggie. Caught our waitress and she had the kitchen prepare the right dish.  I got mine; I ordered BBQ ribs with fries. The fries were ice cold and the meat cold as well. I stopped one of the guys tending to tables and told him. I later find out this was the owner. I explained about the cold meal and he took it back. My partner got his correct entrée and needed to eat his or would be cold waiting for mine. So I sat there waiting, minutes go by and he returns with a new plate. He sort of apologized and said the kitchen is busy. You never say that to a patron, you just apologize and not give excuses.  This second plate - again cold fries and meat barely warm - room temperature WTH? Poked at it ate a few pieces and pushed it away.  I was very surprised that the owner never came back to our table and asked was everything good now, nothing. But he all the time to chit chat and BS with other customers when he should have been in the kitchen talking to the person that runs the kitchen and said cold plates are being served.  Our waitress later came to the table everything ok? I said nope another cold dish, she apologized again and again.  And ask if she could do anything. Nope at this point we just wanted pay and escape.  To their credit they did comp our meals and our waitress asked please give us a second chance.  So our time dining experience was ruined and I honestly can't recommend or would bring my friends to dine at this new establishment.
