I went to this place today to have lunch with my family for a birthday.  I have been to this establishment before but this is my first review on it. Honestly, the food and service is terrible.  One of the first downturns, was that my plate was dirty!  Two other people in my group also found them dirty!  After that instance, I couldn't trust their utensils and cups. Also the food wasn't delectable.  The calamari was salty, the lo mein was salty, the shrimp was dry, etc.  All I can do is complain about this restaurant.  I even found a piece of plastic in the spare ribs. The service as well seemed uncoordinated.  It took ages to get our bowls of rice, and it wasn't worth it.  The rice was dry and not fresh.  In fact, none of the food was fresh.  It didn't come steaming hot, it came cold. If I had the choice, I would never come to this restaurant again.  It was a waste of $69. Yeah. $69. Stop thinking dirty.
