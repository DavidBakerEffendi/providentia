i've been going here for over 6 years. The EO burger is my favorite burger, I think you can get it after 11pm. The food overall here is great, the wait staff is beautiful and fantastic. The drinks, well some of the best if not the best in NYC. The scene is always great, slightly pompous at times, but drink the drinks and bring your character there and you will have a good time. They have historically had great door man, but I don't know where my man JC went. Now there is some toolbox with little character at the door. So that takes one star off. Fire him and then i'll bring it back to 5 stars. Igor you're than man, a gentleman and a scholar, cheers.
