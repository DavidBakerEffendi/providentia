I passed this place one evening while waiting for a table at another restaurant nearby, and the aroma was to die for! Naturally since it was a Saturday night, they had a line out the door, around the corner and up the block. I decided I was going to try their food sometime. Well last night (Tuesday evening) my friends and I decided to go. The place wasn't too crowded and we easily found a table to accommodate the 5 of us. All descriptions of the Brisket are spot on! It is tender, juicy, incredibly delicious, and so soft that it nearly falls apart. I think the only thing that keeps it from doing so is the rub that was crisped from the wood smoke. All tables come with their signature BBQ sauce. I chose two single servings of naked brisket, because half the brisket appeared to be fat; which was accompanied by slaw, pickles, fries etc. I really did not even need the sauce since the flavor of the brisket was devine on it's own! I saw one review where the person felt the flavor wasn't that great. You don't come to the best Texalina place in town and go for the chicken! BRISKET! Â Anyhow..we ate too much. Two portions is honestly too much even with half of it fat, unless you're a guy or something.. and even then. The Brontosaurus ribs looked rather appealing but I wasn't prepared to pay the price they asked for a single rib. Lastly prepare to go home smelling like Wood smoke/BBQ (your hair esp.).
