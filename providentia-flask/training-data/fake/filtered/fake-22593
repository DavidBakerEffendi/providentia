My friend and I took her Drexel student daughter and daughter's roommate.  What a find!  We ordered 3 platters for 4 hungry people and got quite enough food.  The combination platter -shwarma, falafel, and schnitzel along with pita, hummus, rice/fries and 2 sides - was excellent.  We ordered 2 of these plus a lamb kabob platter.  We tried 5 different sides (tabouli, cucumbers, tomatoes, carrots and eggplant) and enjoyed them all. The pita were warm and tasted freshly baked.  The tahini and hot sauce were both flavorful.  Asking for pickles brought a small container of flavorful crunchy pickles and green olives.  The place is tiny but the turnover gave us a table when we needed it.
