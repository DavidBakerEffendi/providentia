I have found out that my review was not showing in Yelp, even if I sort it using post date.  Is this some silent takedown of user submitted review?  Did the business owner actually demanded it to be down?  I believe Yelp users and visitors to this restaurant have rights to know of this place in the perspective of my review as well.
