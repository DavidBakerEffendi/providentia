This is the best place in little Italy and one of the most authentic Italian restaurant in the city. I fell in love with the food at the tiny place in little Italy 7 years ago and have been going there ever since. The place is so natural and warm that I feel like I am in this tiny village In sicilia having chicken caciatorre and drinking grapa. Service is great and does not have a fake Italian accent,  I have been coming with my dates here and it has always been  fantastic and actually been practicing my italian there.
