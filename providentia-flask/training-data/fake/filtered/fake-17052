I had first tasted Cubanu when they first participated in The Taste of Rahway....and was hooked. I had frequent Cubanu quite often, planning GNO dinners and Bday dinners there. My bf fell in love with their mojitos and skirt steak. We went back for the skirt steak again but this time it wasn't the same, the steak was cold and so was the rice, but we still return. The thing that drove me away was, Â the rude and impatient bartender! It was the one day I did not see the owners there, which is probably why she had no problem being nasty and rude! CUSTOMER SERVICE GOES A LONG WAY!!!!
