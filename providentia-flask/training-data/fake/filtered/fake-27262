I can easily say I've been stopping in to Le Barricou for brunch at least once a month for the past 2 or so years... until now.  I can no longer ignore their steady decline.  I'd say that things started to change towards the end of this past summer.  First they took away the complimentary croissants and then portion sizes got smaller and smaller.  I used to leave brunch feeling full, now I leave hungry!  When they say dishes come with a side of home fries and salad, that means about 6ish pieces of potato and 8 pieces of lettuce.  And I used to love their salad dressing, I think it was a simple lemon vinaigrette; not anymore.  My boyfriend used to love their french toast, it used to come with 3 slices, now 2 and it used to come out hot, now it comes out at room temperature if you're lucky. I go in today and for the first time I ordered the side of fruit with my meal for $5.  When it came out I was shocked!  They gave me a small bowl with 1 strawberry, 5 small pieces of honeydew, 5 blueberries, 1 blackberry and a couple small pieces of pineapple.  For real?  I could still see the bottom of the bowl!  Anyway, so I eat a few pieces of fruit and not only was it a stife portion, but the fruit tasted like onion.   Bleh, I'm over it!!!! Time to find a new brunch spot.
