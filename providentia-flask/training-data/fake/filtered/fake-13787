I have been there few times, only because it is convenient.  after my last experience i will not return.  had some drinks and ordered $2.00 garlic knots.  the knots had a hair BAKED in....they would not replace them or take them off the bill.  I contacted them after the fact as well, and got no reply.  Guess they don't mind losing a lot of customers for $2.00.  Unbelievable!
