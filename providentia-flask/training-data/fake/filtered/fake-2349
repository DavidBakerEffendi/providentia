Well... You probably have already heard about their great pancakes, so I'm not going to give you more information by telling you those were the best pancakes I have ever eaten (and I have eaten a lot of pancakes! trust me!). The sevice was good, although I heard from a friend that on the "rush hours" it might be a little slow. To summarize: Definitely thumbs up!
