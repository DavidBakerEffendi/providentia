Very pretentious and snobby.  Bartenders and owner think they are great or special.  They strut around with an attitude and bark orders at the patrons!  I cant stand people that think they are better then everyone else and that.s how it is here.  Its also way overpriced for a dumpy, dark, smelly bar.  Do not even think of bringing a classy date here at night.  Drunks stumble around and the guys at the bar will hit on your girl.  On the night we went (Thursday karaoke) someone threw up on the dance floor!  Please, save your money and go somewhere else.  This place is trash.  The karaoke is good but they crammed the guy in a little area, overwhelmed him with karaoke slips and then yelled at him in front of everyone because not everyone got to sing!  The wait is long as a result so be prepared to wait to sing.  A ridiculous place.  Very unprofessional.
