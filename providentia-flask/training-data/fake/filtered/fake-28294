Great seafood spot in Astoria if you don't mind waiting an hour to be seated. Food is always fresh and tasty and the staff is always friendly and courteous and their prices are reasonable. Also a great spot in the summer if you like people watching being that it's situated on Ditmars Boulevard which has a lot of foot traffic.
