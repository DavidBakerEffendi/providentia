Much overrated. The restaurant touts its Abruzzo cuisine, but doesn't offer core Abruzzese specialties such as Porchetta (whole roasted pig - not Vertu's pork shoulder), Abbachio (roast lamb), Maccheroni a la Chitarra (look it up), & etc., etc. I've eaten there twice, hosting both large (12) and small (4) parties. Skipping over details of uneven, unprofessional, even disdainful service, a wine list that triples the state store-price of modest wines ($30 profit for a bottle of wine I regularly have at home - $20 profit not enough guys?), dishes that are based almost exclusively on inexpensive ingredients, a heralded salumi production that is admittedly OK but repetitive, overpriced and skimpily served (the duck "prosciutto" is very good; the spreadable salami inedible), I came to the breaking point on my last visit: A Brodetto (Abruzzese fish stew or soup) that smelled like low tide at the Love Canal- you could tell it was arriving from 3 feet away. When I stuck my nose in the bowl and told the waiter that either some of the mussels or clams were not right, he took it to the kitchen and returned with the news that the "chef" (I don't know which "chef") said that "everything is fresh." Well, everything might have been fresh last Christmas, but not tonight. I cancelled the order, and privately cancelled any idea of ever returning to this place. Either the "chef" wanted to bluster through or, as I suspect, the "chef" doesn't know the difference between the ocean sweetness of fresh seafood and the rotting fish he is serving up. Thanks just the same, "chef."      I note that the restaurant was busy with customers and must be popular among many. Bless them and good luck, but those who value Italian food won't find its scrupulous mandates here. Having seen the positive tribute by La Ban, my suggestion for him is to review this trendy restaurant again when he has spent more time eating in Italy. As for me it's a not-so-fond addio to Le Vertu.
