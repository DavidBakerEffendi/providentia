This place - yes. Vegan Tacos - yes. It was one of those situations where upon recieving my meal of 2 tacos, I thought I'd do the "lady thing" and eat half, save the rest for lunch the next day. However, it was so good, I could not resist - ate everything right then and there. Fresh and flavorful; and the salsa served on the side is actually spicy (coming from a spiceaholic). Best tacos I have found since the West Coast. Vegetarian options that are actually thoughtful and complete. Lots of adventurous options for my carnivorous friends too. Most of my table ordered the kangaroo burger and loved their food as well. Everything was delicious! And to top it all off tasty cocktails! I went with a large party so the service wasn't as fast as I would have liked, but nonetheless still worth 5 stars. Great eats!
