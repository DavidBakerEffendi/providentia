I love Deli's bagels, but their service is really frustrating. All of the counter staff are teenagers, and last time I went in I was stared down silently until I made an order--even after I said hi, this chick didn't say a word. At first I blew it off because it was early on a Saturday morning, but when I got to the beach, my order was wrong! Deli sandwiches come with tomates and lettuce (as it says on the menu), but all our sandwiches had was a mountain of roast beef and mayo. I wouldn't have minded nearly as much if the service wasn't so weird when I went in. This attitude seems to be getting worse and worse every time I go--once I went in after they were closed (by accident) and was told to get out before I had a chance to get both feet in the door. C'mon, guys, there are way worse jobs out there than making sandwiches. I'm not looking for a side of snark with my bagel.
