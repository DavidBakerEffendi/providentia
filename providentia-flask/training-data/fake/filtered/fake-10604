Came here more than 5 times over the past two months. Love the interior design, basement in particular, at first. The food isn't bad, just not always up to standard. The female owner from Taiwan is particularly unfriendly, which turns me off. There are more welcoming Chinese restaurants making better tasting dishes in town.
