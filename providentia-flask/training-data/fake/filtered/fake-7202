I know I am preaching to the choir when I say it, but this was a perfect dining experience.  The service was so lovely--knowledgeable and attentive, but not too high pressure. The nice char on those chewy toasts with the peas and mint made a permanent imprint on my tastebuds' memory.  Also, the samples that come from the kitchen in those tiny vessels make the moment more intimate.
