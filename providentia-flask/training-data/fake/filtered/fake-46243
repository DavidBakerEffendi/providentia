This place is decent but not worthy of the praise bestowed on it by Yelpers.  Here's some advice - even if you've been to the one in Japan why don't you wait until you've been to the one in New York before posting a review.  Can you people please relax? Overall it is a cool restaurant and the food was good.  It is not the best ramen restaurant in New York, not even close.  Setagaya and Momofuku ramen blows this ramen away.  However, the staff was cool and the food wasn't bad.  It's more of a normal restaurant than a ramen shop. I'm starting to believe you can't believe everything you read on Yelp.
