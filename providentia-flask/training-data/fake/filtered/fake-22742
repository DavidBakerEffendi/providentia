Have been a regular here for many years when traveling to the Meadowlands area.  While not Chinese "haute cuisine", they offer very consistent, tasty take out fare.  Shrimp with Lobster Sauce is an example of a take out staple done well above average.  Can also offer some upscale dishes, but best to dine in for those.  In an BYOB area, but wine/beer store just two doors down and they are very happy to serve.
