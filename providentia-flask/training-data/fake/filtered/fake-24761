The perfect second date spot. Small. Great pasta, and cheap. (by nyc standards) They don't take reservations but the bar next door is a perfect place to grab a drink while you wait. Also, there's a cute bartender next door, who's been there for as long as I can remember....many many second dates ago. But not too cute that she could get you in trouble on your second date w/ the lady. Again, its the perfect second date spot. All the pasta is great at bianca, and I recommend getting their version of vegetable lasagna as a appetizer. Though they don't call it that....
