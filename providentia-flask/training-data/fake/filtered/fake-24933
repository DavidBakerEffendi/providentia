Went here in April 2014  -- great food -- a surprise given the strip-mall location!  Excellent hummus, baba ganoush.  If you order the "dinner," it's a lot of food.  We had kebabs/ gyros combo. Very good food for the price, atmosphere is family-friendly.  Ignore the fact that its a strip mall...this place makes good food in a nice clean friendly place.  total happiness.
