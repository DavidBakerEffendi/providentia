First I must comment on someone's post- saying they had better Italian food at Olive Garden. Obviously, this person dines at McDonalds! LOL I stopped there on Sunday for a few slices. 2 slices and Snapple was nearly $11.00, so yes, they are way overpriced.  As for the pizza, it was quite delicious.   It seems that I'm not the only one complaining about the price.  I know you can't get a slice for a dollar any more, which is pretty much what a slice of pizza is worth, but I think if the owners read these posts...and they all appear to be honest, they may want to consider lowering prices by at least 30%.
