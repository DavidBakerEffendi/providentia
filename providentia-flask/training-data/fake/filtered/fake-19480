After work, this is the only place that can motivate me to go farther then 2 blocks off my route home to pick up dinner. It is so very much worth the 30 minute drive there and back.  My favorite is the Vermicelli with Grilled Chicken, with a few spring rolls on the side. Their Chicken Pho is possibly the best I've had anywhere.  Dishes are very generous, and the price just can't be beat. Three cheers for Nam Phuong!
