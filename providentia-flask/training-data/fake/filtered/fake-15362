I love the falafel here, it's cheap, big, fills you up with all the yummy veggy toppings and it's conveniently located by the L train. Their hummus is also yummy and smooth. I tried their chicken sandwich and wasn't very thrilled with the chicken... Stick to the falafel! The decor is noting special, but who cares it's a fast food place .
