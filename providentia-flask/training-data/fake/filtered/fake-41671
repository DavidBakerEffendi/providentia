We love it!! I work a few blocks away and noticed this place a few months ago when I was walking to by. My boyfriend and I go at least once a week now and we love it every time. The staff is terrific, friendly and very knowledgeable about the assortment of wine. We also order the three cheese platter with a different selection every visit and are never disappointed. I also recommend the spiced carrots and the spiced nuts! Â I am not a wine aficionado by any stretch of the imagination so the unassuming, friendly nature of the Jet Wine Bar is perfect for me!
