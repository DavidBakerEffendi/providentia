I have now eaten at Rucola twice and both times was knocked out by every dish, including the desserts.  The ingredients are fresh and interesting, the preparation and presentation are flawless, the service is friendly and fun and the ambience is relaxing and inviting.  Anyone who has an issue with portions must have been raised at the all-you-can-eat troughs at Denny's, because I ened up with a doggie bag last time I was there.  While I love Frankie's, Prime Meats and Brucie, I find Rucola to have a more comfortable vibe - it's the kind of place that makes you want to hang out longer, hoping to digest quickly enough to have the chance to try somethig else. As for the dishes that I and my wife have tried, the gnocchi was light, pillowy and practically melted in my mouth. A green salad accented with pickled ramps was absolutely delicious.  The cheese board with rosemary bread and the sliced meat sampler had an unreal mix of flavors, and I think alone (with one of their matched wines) would justify Rucola's existence.  The chicken is moist, flavorful and survives the doggie-bag test the nex day with flying colors.  The octopus salad - well, I couldn't say because everyone at my table fought over it like rabid hyenas and so I didn't even get to try it.  The cavetelli  - my fave so far - was firm and tasty with a sauce at that critical point just creamy enough to pack each bite with flavor but without at all being heavy. I agree that the menu is still limited, but that strikes me as normal for a new place.  That just makes me excited to see what's going to appear on the menu each time I go back, which will be often
