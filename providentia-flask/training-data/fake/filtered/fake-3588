I have only been for brunch and it is always very very good. I love the hash browns they serve...they are salty and delicious. My one complaint about this place is their egg cookery. No matter how clear I am the eggs never come out right. Basically they can only cook eggs scrambled. If I order them poached, over easy, over medium it makes no difference...they will 100% come out over hard. Other then that, the food is really solid. Oh and the bloody marys are really good too.
