If you are looking for good and quick mexican food, this spot is definitely a YES. i wont give it a 5 star because it's not the best ive had but i must say im very impressed to have something this good in brooklyn. I was there at the truck at midnight. i love to get food really late. I loved the tacos. the chicken was really delicious and it made me want more. i shall definitely be back to try something else
