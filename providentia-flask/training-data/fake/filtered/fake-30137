Best sandwiches in the area. Tried their Classic Mediterranian and Mediterranian Turkey. And espresso was very good! And some pastries. Very nice atmosphere, owners take the orders. Fresh good produce is used to make sandwiches! Choice of Italian Ciabata, multigrain and pita bread. Yammy! I hope the buzz catch on, glad to welcome nice new business to the neighborhood!
