My Cuban friend and I dined here recently, and she debunked any notion that this place serves Cuban food.  The food was tasteless, not authentic, and over-priced!  The menu might say it's cuban, but take it from two women that have lived in Miami - this place is ripping people off by saying they're cuban!  The "ropa vieja" she had was not real flank steak, they're using brisket - and fatty brisket at that.  The black beans were bland - no seasoning at all.  The service was okay - not great or welcoming.  At times I felt the server could have cared less that we were there.  The flan was from a mix, and the check for two with one drink each was over $75.00!  For Cuban food?  We've had better in NYC for way less!  Save your money!  Not worth it!
