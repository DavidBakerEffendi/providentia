This place rocks since it is open 24 hours, has a good variety, more than a salad bar and close to where I work.  I have frequented GH often in the past, but not in a while.  Today's lunch reminded me why.  I asked for a panini off the menu -- nothing special.  The server behind the counter grabbed a pre-made sandwich, microwaved it and then put it in the press.  Not sure why I let this go on, but if I do again, shame on me!  When I got back to my desk to unwrap the lunch I was looking forward to (anything with fresh mozz is a treat), I found that the ingredients in the sandwich were not what they were supposed to be.  A few extras plus missing some.  After unassembling my soggy panini, taking out half of the innerds (the incorrect items) and reassembling, I was left moping for the rest of the day.  LESSON LEARNED = DO NOT EVER GET A PRE-MADE SANDWICH FROM GOURMET HEAVEN!
