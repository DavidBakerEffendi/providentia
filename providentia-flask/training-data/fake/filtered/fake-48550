This place is weak and the hostess was a racist. My cousin and I decided to visit this establishment on a mild fall evening, during thanksgiving weekend. We walked inside to meager decor which lead to even poorer customer service. The hostess/server told us to sit "there", we asked for hookah. She brought a menu about 10 minutes later. When she brought the hookah menu, I asked for a dinner menu as well (one that she had snatched away when I initially sat down).  She came back 10 minutes later with the  dinner menu, and we ordered our hookah. So it's been 20 minutes, no hookah, no drinks, no food. Then a group of middle eastern people came in and she sat them down. She quickly scurried to take their orders. Meanwhile she didn't take our food orders or bring the hookah we ordered 30 minutes ago. I guess their money was better than ours because they were middle eastern and we are black.  Ha!
