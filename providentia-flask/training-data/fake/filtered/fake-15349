It used to be a great restaurant, but it has changed for worse. My last visit (for Sunday brunch) was a complete fiasco. Service was sloppy, and the food left much to be desired. We ordered our steaks cooked to medium and they were overcooked and dry. Another friend and I ordered eggs and they looked as if they had been lying around for a long time after being cooked: we both got sick that night. Please avoid the place!
