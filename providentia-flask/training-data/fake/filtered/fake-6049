I've been on a multi-state pizza binge over the last 6 months.  Until last week I had decided that the perfect pizza was Pepi's (New Haven), the perfect appetizer a mozzarella purse (Dough -San Antonio) and the perfect atmosphere Pizza Paradiso in Alexandria.  Then I went to In Riva.  The Appetizers are amazing, the Charred Octopus is  so good even my 4 yr loved it.  The Ceci Beans and Lentils are amazing.  Their Pizza is cooked in a wood fired brick oven, and has a thin Neapolitan crust with a good thick cornicione that is tender, chewy and slight buttery in flavor.   Out of the pizza I've had there, the Quatra Formago was good,  the Borcooli Misti was better (nice balance of spicy, bitter with sweet ricotta chunks to balance it out) pepperoni was excellent, the Burrata was even better, the Cippolini was even better (lots of spice and flavor with caramelized onions) and the Burratta was absolutely to die for.   Thier beer selection is pretty good, 4-5 on draft and maybe another dozen bottles.  The selection they do have is varied and all good.  The patio outside overlooks the river and is very relaxing, inside they have good music that verges on just too loud but works for the joint.  The servers are all top notch, but if you get the chance ask for Tim.  He is steller.
