I have sworn off fedoras after several experiences with terrible service. There are a few good items on the menu that kept me coming back, but not anymore. TERRIBLE SERVICE, no matter how tasty the food, it's not worth it to have the people who work (especially the people who seem to manage the place) behave so poorly towards customers!
