I signed up for Yelp just to leave a review of this place.  The service here is absolutely TERRIBLE.  The waitresses spend the entire time talking to their friends instead of paying attention to their customers.  I've never seen anything like this in my entire life.  I came here based on reading a review online about their pancakes, which were actually okay, but the service ruined the entire experience for us.  I've honestly been treated better going to breakfast at McDonalds.  Bottom line:  We'll never come back here again.
