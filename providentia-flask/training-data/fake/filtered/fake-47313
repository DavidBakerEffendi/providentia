I was initially skeptical about going here after reading some of the previously written reviews, but after trying it out, I really liked the place. I have now been there twice, once for lunch and once later in the evening for drinks.  For lunch-I loved the salad bar! they had a big selection of things to add in. On my later visit with a friend for drinks-we shared a bacon burger and wings.  Both were good especially the wings. We also tried a flight of beer (I think it's called), which was a sample of 4 beers from their huge selection.  I think the bartender mentioned they have over 20.  My friend also got a margarita which she liked as well.  We will definitely be back.
