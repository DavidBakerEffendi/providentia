I recently went to bar this Saturday Night (5/3/14) Â with some friends. We were all allowed access with the exception of my friend Dhru. He was denied access because he looked like a guy the bouncer kicked out last week. I confronted the bouncer about his accusation and he told me to fuck off. So I went inside to inform the manager of his employees (bouncers) racism and ignorance. Before I could find anyone in charge I was grabbed by the neck and thrown out. I will never be going back to bar. I will also be letting all my friends know to steer clear of this restaurant.
