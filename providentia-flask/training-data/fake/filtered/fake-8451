I was visiting Philly last week (my old hometown) and my friend and I were looking for somewhere to grab a quick drink and ended up wandering into Jones. We hadn't been in years but the cocktail menu looked awesome so we decided to try it out. I had the pink mustache which was great and my friend got a glass of wine she really liked. Our personable bartender Casey recommended two appetizers which we got to share - the nachos and the buf-faux-lo wings; both were incredible! I remember the nachos used to be an insane mountain but now they're served as individual bites with all the ingredients piled onto each chip which is not only delicious but much easier to eat! The wings had a super tasty sauce and didn't taste like tofu at all (always a good thing in my opinion). The manager, Steve, stopped by to check on us and suggested we try the "adult milkshakes" so we got a Blue Hawaiian to split. Wow. Just wow. Alcohol and ice cream should always be served together. Period. I will definitely be back to try more dishes and drinks!
