Hi had the fried chicken and waffles and it was awful, it was fried hard, the coating had no flavor, I'm guessing the batter was simply white flour and water.  For a moment I tasted a granule of black pepper and that was it.  I could get tasty fried chicken anywhere, even KFC, so why couldn't I get it here.  The bread they served at the beginning tasted odd in a bad way and the granules of salt atop of it did not add to the taste, but instead enhanced the unpleasantness of it.  The cheddar cheese waffle tasted as if it was made from the same batter as the bread that was served at the start and I didn't taste any cheddar.  The "chocolate chunk bread pudding & salted chocolate butterscotch" was also the same bread that was served at the start with just chocolate sirup pored over it with cream on the side.  It was not bread pudding, it had no sugar and clearly was not made of bread baked with milk, juice, or anything.  It was inedible and I had to leave on the plate.  Oh, and there was no butterscotch.   I was upset and disappointed, I had not had lunch, I was starving and thought that I would reward myself with a good dinnerl at this establishment since I was close by.  How could they serve that food, I can't image anything good coming out of there.  I can't believe anyone would recommend this place.  Who are the people writing some of these reviews?
