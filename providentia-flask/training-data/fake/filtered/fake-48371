This place is the BOMB! As a 1st time visitor from California, I've always had in mind the the Cheese Steak has ruled this city for eons. Not anymore. Had a cheese steak from Pat's King of Steaks and Dinic's...NO COMPARISON! Dinics hands down blows the cheese steak out of the Phili's town. By far the best attraction and a must try in Philly! Thank you Tommy Dinic's for your very, very  juicy roast pork sandwich, Please-oh-please  expand your business in Southern California..
