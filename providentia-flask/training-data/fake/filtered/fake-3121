This is the best Cuban restaurant EVER. The food is tasty and authentic... the menu is extensive and exciting. Â I live in NYC and can't find a Cuban joint that compares. I wish Cuban Pete's would open a location in NYC!!! The atmosphere is quite fun, with fake palm trees and paint chipped walls...coconuts line the walkway into the restaurant. Best flan ever as well!!! Everything was beyond YUMMY.
