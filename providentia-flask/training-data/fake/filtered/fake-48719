"If you don't work here and don't f#ck anyone who works here, get the f#ck out!"   This is what was yelled to us at 1:30 am by a friend of an employee.  I guess they were ready to go home. Didn't try the food... we were given menus but told the kitchen was closed when we ordered some appetizers. The creepy server suggested us some great beers just to come back and say they were out of them. The height of the table compared to the height of the chairs is just stupid. and The girl puking in the bathroom two feet from our table was trashy. They got the wrong set-up for the place they're trying to be.. why be a distasteful grungy carpet stained bar with the lack of business ethic you seem to uphold when you have the opportunity to be a one of the kind tavern with an artistic atmosphere run by an intelligent respectful staff. No good Eulogy.. Get it together.
