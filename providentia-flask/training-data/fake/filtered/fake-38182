Terrible service, waited 30 min. for a take out order of an omelette and a gyro.  Person working at the front desk saw me waiting the whole time and did not even bother to check on my order.  Turns out they didn't even start making the omelette until I started yelling at them.  Worst of all they didn't even apologize!  Bunch of amateurs.
