I don't see how there are any bad reviews. My girlfriend and I went last night for dinner and had not one complaint. Our waitress was extremely patient (I took at least 30 minutes to decide between several dishes). We started with the hand battered onion frizzles for our appetizer... the roasted garlic aioli was delicious! I ordered the mac and cheese with grilled chicken and bacon and I was surprised at the portion, it was a lot!! Not to mention the giant cuts of grilled tender chicken. Definitely would get it again. My girlfriend ordered the knuckle buster sandwich and brought the second half home because it was stuffed with so much steak. She was very pleased with it. It was busy, yet we were never left waiting endlessly for our waitress. All in all I would easily recommend anyone to go there, as I will go back in the coming weeks. And fyi... the servers have to walk 4 floors of stairs to bring you you're food/beverages depending on where you're seated...and I didn't hear a dish or glass even cling together.
