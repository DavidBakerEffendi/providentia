Everything about our evening was wonderful. We had reservations and arrived early, party of five, the manager made us feel welcome and genuinely glad to see us, what a nice concept! Â The Greek is cozy and feels warm and welcoming. What an extensive menu and we relied on our waiter Dimitrios to guide us in selections based on our wines which were very good. Our table ordered a variety of plates to all share so we could try many things. The standouts were the baby octopus (amazing smoky and grilled flavor, best ever), scallops were perfectly seasoned and tender, stuffed eggplant was delicious, lima beans were flavored with the most amazing herbs. Oh, forgot the bread they served and the four dips were outstanding!! Best bread ever with the fava spread, feta spread, cod and the best tzatziki I have ever tasted. The desserts change frequently, we shared two desserts a feta cheesecake with a fig glaze topping and this was the best cheesecake we have ever had. The wait staff and manager were friendly and helpful, all with a lively fun atmosphere and music. Our group of friends kept discussing this meal for days and I would highly recommend going, we will again on our next trip to NYC.
