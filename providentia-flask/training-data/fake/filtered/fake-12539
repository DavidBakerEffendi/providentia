A few years ago, my family conducted a blind pizza tasting contest with everyone's favorite pizzeria. There were 5 restaurants represented and Jimmie's was the hands-down winner. Even though the ownership has changed several times since the original West Hartford Pizza Palace, the pies have not. It is simply awesome! I travel from NJ several times a year and have Jimmie's on speed dial, calling from I-84 @ exit 35 for my favorite sausage, onions, red peppers and mushrooms. I get there a couple of minutes before the pie comes out, just enough time for a frozen goblet of beer!
