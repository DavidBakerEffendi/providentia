Took 4 hours to get there from NYC due to a 20 mile backup on the New Jersey turnpike.  Finally get there and it was a short line.  Ordered a whiz wit.  Both Geno's and Pats are living off of hype, was nothing special about either of them, steak has no flavor, Geno's is really small.  Just to say you ate there or if your starving at 3 am is the only reason to go there, i'm sure there are much better places all over Philly.
