The food is always DIVINE. I have no issues with the meal itself. We go to Single Pebble for birthdays and special events and it's always a big excitement. However, the service we received last night was embarrassingly bad. I would like to preface this review: my party of four consisted of former waitresses. We've all waited tables for years at a variety of restaurants. That said, our waitress was absent for most of the meal. As in, good luck if you have a question or need something. The food runners were flat out rude, plopping plates down and peacing out immediately. Our waitress talked down to us and only asked if we wanted more wine (push the booze!). One of our dishes didn't show up until 25 minutes after we ate, and after we told the waitress to just forget it. A food runner brings it out Â (again- we barely saw our waitress) and when we said we didn't want it, replied "well, sometimes the kitchen is busy." If the kitchen is busy, that's totally fine- just COMMUNICATE WITH US. When they started wiping off the table in front of us, I had enough. I have never in my life tipped any less than 15% until last night's meal. I shouldn't have tipped them at all, the service was so bad. I'm seriously disappointed.
