I came here to get a bite to eat before a show at the Union Transfer and I didn't want to leave. The food was excellent! I had the pork & beans (pulled pork and black eyed peas) and my girlfriend had the ahi tuna which was cooked just the way she likes it (lightly seared). The drinks were the real deal too. I enjoyed three of the 30 craft beers and my girlfriend raved about the llamaritas which are made with a healthy helping of tequlia and real juice ... not that sour mix crap! We would have stayed all night but I didn't want to miss the show, so I'll be back again. 11/09/2011 Went back again last night because the weather was so nice and had a great time on the patio with my friends. The patio is flanked by other buildings so there is no wind and they have those propane heaters to take the chill off. Maybe I can eat outdoors up until Christmas?
