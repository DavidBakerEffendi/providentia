My spouse and I were in the process of planning our reception back in March of 2013. We remember coming to Black Eyed Sally's while we were dating and we absolutely loved the food! I suggested going there to eat a second time just to make sure the food was as tasty as I had remembered. After two bites of my beef brisket, I was sold once again!! The owner was nice enough to come in on her day off to discuss with us catering packages and pricing. It was very nice to work with her. When we hosted our reception this past July, the food was delivered to us on time and very hot and tasty! We received many compliments from our guests on how they loved the food. Everything from the pulled pork, mashed potatoes, the corn bread, and the crab cakes! And I have to say they are the best crab cakes I have ever had in the state! Even my father, who can be a very particular eater, enjoyed his food very much! I highly recommend Black-Eyed Sally's for a fun night out and a great meal. You will not be disappointed.
