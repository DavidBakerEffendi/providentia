This place is absolutely brilliant!  The fried goat cheese in lavender-infused honey was to die for.  We loved it so much at the beginning of the meal that we added another order at the end.  The agave crusted chicken wings were also fabulous. The sangria ingredients are top secret and this magic mixture will definitely take you for a ride.
