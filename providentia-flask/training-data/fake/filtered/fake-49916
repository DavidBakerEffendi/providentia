Best beer in Hartford (I've worked in the city for about three years and tried much of what it has to offer). All their beer is brewed in house and is rotated on a regular basis, with ten or so beers on tap (plus ciders) at a given time. My favorite is the Careless Love, a strong amber ale with a ton of flavor. Some of the best food in Hartford, in my experience. I absolutely love their burgers, always cooked exactly as I ask (a flavorful medium rare), but there is a ton of variety on the menu. My vegetarian sister also thoroughly enjoys the menu, so there is something for everyone here.
