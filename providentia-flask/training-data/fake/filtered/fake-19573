I never write reviews usually, but this dinner was so great that I just have to recommend it to whomever I can.  Also, I know Acme just closed across the street, and if the same thing happened to Great Jones Cafe it would be such a shame.  Really really spectacular food (there aren't enough creole places down here) and the drinks are great as well (try the Shaggy with dark rum!).  I love the concept of a rotating chalkboard menu.  Everything's super reasonably priced for how MUCH you get and how GOOD it is.  I think my favorite parts of the meal were the small touches (the honey drizzled on top of the jalapeno cornbread, the freshly whipped, unsweetened cream accompanying my slice of pecan pie, the chives in the mashed potatoes).  The crowd was great too for a Friday night.  I can't remember the last time I've sat in a restaurant with so many not-obnoxious people.  Even though there was a wait by the time we finished eating, the server was never trying to rush us out so we got to sit around and wrap up our conversation unhassled.  I guess what I'm trying to say is PLEASE support this business.  Dinner here was an extraordinary experience.  I can't wait to try brunch!
