I won't ever understand the logic behind having 4 Thai restaurants on the same city block in a place where there are not many Thais, but this place comes out on top.   The ambiance is a little hokey and diner-like, but the food is quite good and the service is fairly fast.  The drunken noodles are definitely the best around, and the pad thai is quite good as well.
