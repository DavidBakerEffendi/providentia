WOW!!!!!!!! This pizza was amazing. Today I ordered a pizza with black olives and pepperoni, and  it was the best pizza that I have every had in my 60+ Years of living in Bayonne.  It was absolutely delicious, and the best part was that it arrived quickly. Up until this point I have all but eliminated all of the pizzerias in Bayonne, except two.  That would be Tony's near 10th and Broadway and Joe"s on 46th and Broadway.  I liked Tony's for the taste, but Joe's for the taste and the late hours and opened 7 days a week. However after today, Pizza Master has zoomed right into first place with flying colors.  Everything was just perfect from the time the young lady answered the phone, who  was polite and pleasant and repeated my order back to me to make sure that she got it right, to the mannerly delivery fellow who was at my door within 35 minutes, to the reasonable price, to the most yummy....perfect pizza. I know that people need a break, and being opened 7 days a week must be hard on the staff, since before I retired I worked 7 days a week too; but I so appreciate that your establishment is opened everyday. Thank  your dedicated staff for taking on this challenge.  And again....thanks for making the best pizza ever, and I am looking forward to trying some of your other menu items in the future. A Very Happy Bayonne Grandma Pattie A.
