A group of 8 of us went to Kelly's for dinner over the weekend. We were surprised to see how busy the place was being that they are fairly new. Â We shared some apps, the quesadilla, spring rolls and coconut shrimp. All very good and the quesadilla was huge! The wait staff was friendly and attentive but not smothering. We all had something different for our meal and we all left with doggie bags. Portions are really great and so is the price. I will be back again for sure.
