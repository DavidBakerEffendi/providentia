Great food. Fantastic environment. The biggest gripe most people have with Cafe Havana is the lack of space when seated at a table.  But if you can get off your high horse and refrain from arriving at Cafe Havana with bags and suitcases then your experience here will be enjoyable.  **Cocktails** Mojito or Caipirinha **Appetizers** The Mexican Corn aka Elotes **Main Dish** You cant go wrong with any selection here. We have enjoy the fish tacos / grilled shrimp tacos / and their steak flank and eggs. Everything on their menu will not disappoint so feel free to explore. And if you are short on time but need your Cafe Havana fix then consider hitting up the annex next door which sells their take-out version of the menu.  Its Soho - you can eat / text / IG / FB / Tweet / walk at the same time.
