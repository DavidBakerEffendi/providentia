Ok..so your hungry......Fernando's in Hightstown, NJ is DEFINITELY the place to go! No matter what you order....your taste buds will be singing with joy!! I think it's because they cook all of their food fresh.....and everything my Family has tried...they've LOVED! Their burgers are to die-for....( VERY high quality meats are used)  they also have an AMAZING grilled pesto chicken sandwich that's...HEAVEN in a sandwich! The dinners are just fabulous as well! I, myself, am addicted to their Melon Talapia & Jumbo shrimp salad..  5 stars ***** Staff is A ++++  ask for Shaun/Shawn if you can..he's the best EVER and such a sweetheart....accommadating your every wish!   Warm/darker ambiance lighting ( makes you look good, lol)   Music is jazzy/classical so you feel like your at the Ritz and can RELAXXXX!  :) When dining in there's really no need to be all dressed up.....jeans will do too! Eitherway...you'll be served AMAZING FOOD and have an amazing time! Total 5 STARS **** when it comes to taste and service!! My ONLY negative is the parking...parking is on the side of the building and most of the time it's packed and you have to walk down a hill  :(
