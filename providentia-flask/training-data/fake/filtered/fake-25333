Wow!!! After livng in Vermont for more than 20 years, I've finally found a great Asian Buffet in Burlinton area!  well, Essex Junction to be exact. Good buffet reaturants are so hard to find here, some of them started out pretty good, but the quality of the food drops so quickly,    After a friend's recomendation, I tried out Grand Buffet, great selection, fresh and hot dishes all the time!  the price is very reseanable!   And they have been there for more than 2 years!  I wish I've noticed this place at the first day they opened!  Keep up the good works fellows! I will be back soon! !!
