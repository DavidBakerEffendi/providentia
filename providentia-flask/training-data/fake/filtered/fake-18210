Cafe Zona Sur is a recent and most welcomed addition to the neighborhood. All breakfast plates, and particularly the specials, are delicious. The Madame Croque, the Steak N Eggs, and the French Toast are highly-recommended. They serve La Colombe coffee, definitely not the watered-down deli stuff. It is a nice, mellow place, with lots of light and friendly atmosphere, without hitting the absurd levels of pretentiousness of the Slope. Looking forward to the dinner menu and the patio space in the back!
