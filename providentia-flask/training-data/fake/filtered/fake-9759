My husband and I just dined on Goodfella's "sky deck" this past Saturday. This was our first time dining here outside. The service was outstanding, and the outdoor atmosphere was beautiful. They truly lived up to the expectations of their "Best Service", "Best Outdoor Dining", and "Most Romantic" awards from CT Magazine. We ordered the Filet Cognac which is the chef's signature dish. It was cooked just the way we asked for it and was served to us at a reasonable pace. We were completely satisfied by the end of the meal. They truly lived up to the expectations and beyond.
