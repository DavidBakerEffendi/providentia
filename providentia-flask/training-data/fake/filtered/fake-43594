Let me first start by saying that I have eaten there on 3 other occasions and thought that the food and service had always been on par for the price paid. The last time we ate there it was a group of 15 and I have to say that we were very disappointed. There was only 1 server for our entire party (no busser). Our side dishes came out first then our meals followed about 20 minutes later. 3 of the tables meals were not prepared properly (there were special instructions that were not followed). After we were finished with our meals we ordered coffee & dessert, the espresso was the worst I have ever had and cold! Â When we complained to the server, she said "Our espresso machine isn't that good here". I wish she would have told us that important detail when we ordered it! In the end our tab came out to over $800 and none of the incorrect items and the 5 espresso's were taken off the bill! The only reason I gave 2 stars is because the food was good (not great). The next time we want to go to an upscale restaurant, I don't think this will be our choice.
