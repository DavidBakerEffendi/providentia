This place has the best food and it's SOOOOO cheap! I love it. Ironically, I wouldn't recommend them for noodles, but their BBQ pork, roast duck, and salt baked squid have to be tried to be believed. It's always packed, seven days a week. When the place next door is empty, this place is full. That tells you something. Also, don't expect nice ambiance, clean bathrooms, or friendly service. This place is a dive, for sure. But what a great dive it is!
