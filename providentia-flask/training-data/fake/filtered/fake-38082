From the ambiance, to the service, to the exquisite food, Samba is an amazing dining experience.  Ilson, the owner, made us feel like V.I.P. guests.  When one thinks of stroganoff, one may think of a heavy dish, but Samba's stroganoff was light with with all of the flavor of a hearty dish.  The salmon was fresh, prepared to a perfect temperature and served with a creamy, light sauce that had a hint of fruit. Saying that the food was tasty is an understatement.  I am still reeling from the passion fruit mousse. Having the passion fruit dessert was a transcending experience.  It brought me back to Puerto Rico.  We highly recommend Samba Montclair, and are already looking forward to going back...
