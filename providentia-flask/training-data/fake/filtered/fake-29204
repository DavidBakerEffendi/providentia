What can I say??  I travel an hour and a half just for take out.  It isn't overpriced AND you get huge portions.   The chicken is my favorite.  Take a bite and the flavors just explode in your mouth! So what do I say?? Come one come all for the best Portuguese food North, East, West, & South of the Avenue!!
