There are thousands of good reviews of this place, this one start wouldn't even leave a dent in their reputation, but here goes.   Food: Ordered some shrimp special appetizer.  All I could think about when I ate it was how salty this damn shrimp was.   Ramen was okay.   I had much better elsewhere.   Service: Server was an idiot.   Just the worst service EVER.  Gives customer bitchy attitude like he is someone important.  Maybe they have a lot of tourist customers and he is used to treating people like crap, but no matter how good the food is I and none of my friends will never dine here again.   In this case, the food wasn't even good so no brainer. I do not recommend this place to anyone.   I had better food at restaurants that do no specialize in ramen.
