Went to Lucali for the first time last night, a Saturday, and both the pizza and the calzone are amazing, but I have to say the service is great too.  Vanessa's job is near impossible, but she makes it look easy.  At a certain point in the night, she pretty much has to turn everyone down and does so with a smile on her face, even when faced with people who just thinks she's being rude and exclusive.  If she tells you there's no more seating, its not because she doesn't like you, so just say thank you and don't make her explain the science of hostessing to you.  Nicole, our waitress, was also very nice and all smiles.  I love this place and its staff.  Thank you ladies.
