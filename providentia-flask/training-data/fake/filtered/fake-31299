We were vacationing in Brooklyn, NY, and selected The Bounty for dinner. Â The staff was extremely attentive, everyone in our party was fascinated by the unique decor and best of all the food was yummy. Everything was fresh and well seasoned. The roasted duck breast was perfectly prepared. Kudos to the chef.
