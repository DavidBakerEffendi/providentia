WORST customer service ever...We placed a delivery order for just under $300 and gave a $60 tip..One salad was missing and they wanted to charge us $5 to bring the salad over..REALLY??!!! When we called to inquire the lady on the phone was beyond rude and nasty with us...We are all completely disgusted with the service here...And the food was definitely not worth it..With all the places to eat in the area I would NEVER recommend this place...And we never got the salad
