I have dined here a handful of times. The food is always amazing, sheeps milk!? Say no more, the atmosphere is great, in the summer and winter, I even caught a glimpse of a celeb quite a few times. The only thing keeping me from giving it a 5 star review is the management, well one particular manager actually. I don't know about you but when a managers breath smells of alcohol I think you have a problem, this short man, doesn't look old but seems to be balding, made customers and employees feel uncomfortable. I don't recall him from any of my other visits but he left a lasting impression this time. Just because you have great reviews, publicity, a great chef, amazing food does not mean you should treat people as if they are lucky to be in your restaurant. Celebrity or not we are all customers. I hope upper management reads this and I apologize for not having a name as this was a few weeks ago and I didn't plan on writing a review till I was browsing for places to dine this past weekend and I read so many of the reviews, I thought I would put my two cents in. Other then this individual my visit was amazing, I left stuffed with delicious food and great wine.
