Just went here for brunch for the first time.  Food was solid: I got crab potato cakes with poached eggs, and while I couldn't taste any crab, I was satisfied.  My boo got the French toast and said it was the best french toast ever.  The space itself was really pleasant and a great place to spend Sunday afternoon. Overall, a really nice experience.  But... I live in Bed Stuy because it's affordable.  And this place is just...not that.  A 20% price markdown, an this place would be in competition with other neighborhood businesses; even just a 10% markdown would have me considering coming back, because it's "artisinal" and the restaurant does bring some interesting stuff to the table.  But this Alice's Arbor is serving up East Village prices for a Bed Stuy crowd, and I could never justify paying over $20 for a single-serving, albeit tasty meal when I can go around the corner and get another meal just as good for half the price. Nice place to visit, but I'm priced out!
