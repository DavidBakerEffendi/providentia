Juju was 5 star but now its only 1 star.  For the last few times, I haven't had a good experience.  Once I order Hot Chick sandwich and when I got home, it was Lemongrass Chicken.  Wasn't very happy with that.  This time we ordered Hot Chick Sandwich and Bahn Mi Fries.  Sandwich was Hot Chick but it was a very cold sandwich. Chicken was very cold, it felt like it was just out of a fridge.  One half of the sandwich bread was fine but the other half of the sandwich bread was broken.  My another disappointment was with the fries.  It didn't have as much vegetables and sauces it used to have and also all the fries were soo little, it looked like they gave all the good ones to other customers and we got the remaining little tiny bitty fries.   DISAPPOINTED :(
