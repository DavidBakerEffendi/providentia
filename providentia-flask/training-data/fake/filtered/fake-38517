Lunch. It's the, meal that you don't expect that much from, so it's shouldn't be too hard to impress a guest. I never had A.kitchen on my list of "must-try" restaurants, but it was a holiday treat from a dear friend and who ever says no to a free meal? The restaurant is a classy little place. Located right on Rittenhouse Square, who could ask for more than this cozy little contemporary gem? Except for more food. My friend ordered grouper; it was a smallish, actually stingy piece of fish, unaccompanied except for a flourish of dots of sauce artistically dribbled around the plate. My lunch was a salmon salad. The salmon was obliterated to the point of looking like cat food sprinkled atop the salad, the dressing was sour and it was way overly salted. Plus it was a meager portion. Seriously, when you're offering a salad on your menu, what do the greens cost? I understand that a chef may not be able to pile on the expensive ingredients but this salad was at best a sprinkling of greens. Mid meal we asked for bread and were blessed with two parsimonious pieces of standard south Philly bakery bread. Â Yawn. Sadly, on the way back to my office, I had to buy a hotdog because I was hungry. This is bad considering that the chef of A.kitchen has an incredible pedigree and the owners have pockets as deep as Midas. In contrast, earlier that same week I had lunch at the English pub just a few steps away, and that lunch left me happy and full. One last note, A.kitchen cleverly uses inexpensive kitchen clean-up cloths for guest napkins. When leaving the restaurant, my lovely black slacks were covered with white lint. And you wonder why I keep a roller brush in my desk drawer? You'll love A Kitchen if you're on a severe diet or anorexic. As for me, unless it's another treat, I won't be able to go back to A Kitchen and pay handsomely to leave hungrily.
