I must say the negative reviews are appalling. I can't believe all the negative reviews on this place all because of one thing. I've been here every other day for 3 months straight during the summer, and now try to come every weekend. I love it here. This is a new establishment so they are working through what works, and what doesn't. The food is great. Its different and creative but not so creative that you wouldn't want to try it. (Think the Big Mac's special sauce) They have 3 kinds and they're ALL very Yummy. I'm addicted to the homemade hand cut french fries and adult shakes. The drinks are great and aren't weak like some spots. You can count on a good mixed drink. (Shout out to my fave bartenders Stan & Davis! =)) Also in the evening, usually restaurants in the city close at around 10pm-11pm. This place stays open til 2am and serves til about 1am. Its great to stop by after a dinner date and dance (They have awesome DJs scheduled almost every night) or if you get up and out late or just get off of work too late, PYT is the perfect place to come chill. No one judges you here, its not snooty and doesn't have a lot of uptightness in the atmosphere. (Think Starbucks but with burgers and alcohol lol=p) I've known Tommy for about 5-6 years now and he has really worked hard to get a place of his own to cater to the public. I don't know another establishent where the owner comes almost everyday to make sure things are on the up and up. My knowing him doesn't equate to a 5 star review. I gave 5 stars because I can easily say, I promote this place subconciously. I find myself telling ALL of my friends, (old and new) to come to PYT even if they aren't going with me. Where else do you know that serves dollar drinks as a happy hour from 10p-11p everyday? I love it! Hands down~
