Where can I start with Trumbull kitchen? Lets see, I've lived in Hartford for over five years and I have never been compelled to visit this establishment. The first thing I noticed, the foul smell as I walked in. The hostess was nice enough and we sat at the bar. Bartender proceeds to ignore us for 10 minutes, no problem, it's a Friday night and its busy. He then proceeds to throw two napkins on our table and walks away. No menu, no hello, nothing. Just, what would you like? I proceed to ask for a wine list, no response, he turns the menu over and walks away. We order wine and a filet mignon appetizer. The atmosphere was that of a dank & damp dorm room, donned with the typical flare legged jeans and American eagle button down. It could also have been, the plethora of sweaty feet in forever 21 pastel colored heels, I'm not sure. We ordered the filet mignon, medium rare, what did we receive? Dry, grey beef, with a god-awful sauce. Our frisee was damp and brown. We eat one or two and ask for the check. When asked what was wrong, I responded that our steak was not cooked correctly, the blue cheese sauce was horrendous & the "truffle" tater tots where borderline inedible. Typical Max's group restaurant; entitled patrons, damp atmosphere and bad food. It is an embarrassment. This is the antithesis of fine dining. My taste buds will never forgive you Trumbull kitchen. 1 star!
