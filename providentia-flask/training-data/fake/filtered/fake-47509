No no no! A tourist trap at its worse. I took my husband there when he just moved to NY to show him the true new york place. I remembered Grimadi's from ten years ago, back when they had only one floor. Our pizza was unbelievably salty and almost impossible to eat. We asked for olives and they put too much which definitely added to saltiness and screwed the whole taste - we had to manually remove the olives to get it to a manageable and palatable level. But what really got me was the host - the old Italian men is undeniably and unbelievably rude to the customers. I understand that you got the name and all but there are some borderline of decency you should not cross. He was really not accommodating about our table preferences :-( On top of it, I just really hate place that dont take credit cards - it always ticks me off a bit.
