If you're looking for the place where locals eat, this is probably it. Take-out only, but there are nice benches outside to eat on. The best thing about Hoagie Haven is definitely the variety. There's something for everybody, even the your picky or health conscientious friends, who will inevitably try to veto a trip to Hoagie Haven Classic hot and cold sandwiches, not to mention their special sandwiches and even a few Greek specialties. I've had almost everything on the menu and can attest to the fact that what you order is what you get. The special sandwiches have everything on them: fries, burger patties, mozzarella sticks, eggs and bacon.. you get the point. If any of those sandwiches sounds appealing then go for it. The cold sandwiches are also great. The souvlaki is one of the hidden gems if you want something hot but not fat-laden. If you ask, you can also have just about anything made vegetarian -- ie replacing the chicken steak on a 'phat lady' with eggplant. The portions are huge -- $10 will buy a hoagie big enough to feed a small family, or a hungry college student. The only drawback is the restaurant gets extremely crowded and when it's crowded the staff sometimes rushes and won't ask you what extras you want on your sandwich if you aren't attentive.
