We went to 27 Mix before a show at NJPAC this past Wednesday and enjoyed everything about this place .The food was delicious and served hot, the background music, the decor (exposed brick walls decorated with local artist paintings) all terrific. We were served bread with their special honey butter at our table as soon as we sat down and told our waiter our timeline.  He delivered our appetizer (Wild mushroom risotto with peas and zucchini..yum!) promptly and our entrees when we needed them limoncello chicken and lobster ravioli - delicious!   A downtown treat with a nice level of sophistication, great food, great service!
