Great for what it is, but better for what it isn't. No shortage of dive bars in this neighborhood so I was plenty happy to see the eye sore that was Nice Guy Eddie's (the reverence for the Kiss mural is nice, but come on) replaced by a proper local. Food that's heavy on comfort with hearty options like chicken pot pie and mac & cheese (both solid). Some good craft beer on tap and a few pretty serious cocktails. Hoping they keep the kitchen open a bit later eventually as a few menu options scream late-night dining to me. The vegetarians out there will find a few items to their liking. Also the pickle selection is kind of awesome (do not leave without trying the pickled pineapple). Call it a bar with good food or a restaurant with good drinks. I call it a welcome improvement.
