Spontaneous lunch at Leone's was the most delicious Italian food I've had in years.  We had stuffed mushrooms, pear salad and spinach ravioli with shrimp, sun-dried tomatoes and pink sauce.  Michael was a very gracious host after our waitress apologetically brought out each person's plates not on time (really only a few minutes apart).  I didn't think it was a huge deal, but the way Michael made up for this (with some very delicious cannolis) added to the already great tasting experience.  So, five stars for food, customer service and a good space inside and out on this sunny day.  We'll definitely be back for the brick oven pizza I spotted on other folks' tables.
