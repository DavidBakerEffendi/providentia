Whenever family or friends come in town, I always take them here. I've loved absolutely everything I've order, but I think my favorite still remains the bacon wrapped dates. YUM. Also- the Mac Attack (which is a tasting of all three flavors) is amazing! I love the atmosphere, and the food couldn't get better.
