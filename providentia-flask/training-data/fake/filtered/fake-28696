I've Â never reviewed before but just had to warn everyone about this place. Went to try the juicy buns and eggplant in garlic sauce - both were disgusting! The crab meat and pork buns smelled like they went bad and tasted much worse - only ate 1/2 of one bun and still got charged for the full thing. Would have given 1/2 a star if I could have just for the decent bubble milk tea.
