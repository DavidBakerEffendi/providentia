Had a Spinsaver coupon for Piccolo Trattorio in Newtown so I took the whole family there for a quiet Friday late lunch the day after Christmas. The restaurant had only a few patrons. When it came time to use my spinsaver coupon, the server pointed out the fine print that states it's only good for a Sunday-Thursday. I didn't see that on the Spinsaver before I bought or I wouldn't have purchased it-shame on me. But when I spoke to the manager to attempt to work things out, the only thing he would do was give me face value for the "next time" I eat in. Since there was nothing they were able to do, I certainly will not come in a "next time". Seems that if you're doing extra marketing to bring in extra business, they could've worked with us to make us happy "this time".
