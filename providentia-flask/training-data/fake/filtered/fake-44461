First of all, if you have a website that says your happy hour is 4-7, your happy hour should be 4-7, not 3-6. We drove over and arrived just after 6 to be told that we couldn't have happy hour specials. And, despite our polite inquiry, they were grumpy about it! Â Secondly, why call them Irish Nachos if they are exactly like any Tex-Mex Nacho? I've had Irish Nachos before and they are made with some sort of Potato (e.g. fries, waffle fries) The two stars are because we stayed and had some really good draft beer.
