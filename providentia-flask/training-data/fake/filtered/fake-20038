Delicious. First course: Sweetbread saltimbocca for me. Mozzarella in carozza (Fried Mozz) for him. Both were delicious, but small-ish portions. First time I had sweetbreads, and I'm hooked! Second course: Polpo pizza (mozz, octopus, red pepper). YUM. Just the right amount of spice. Get one for yourself if you're hungry. Dessert: Cannoli. Cream/dried fruit/nut filled. Interesting interpretation and delicious! Service: Attentive without being smothering. Melissa (I think) was fab. Also cool to see Vetri walking around, schmoozing the regulars. The only reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is the portion size - small for the expense.
