I have been to this place a lot. Probably over ten times. It is good. It is a local bar with decent food. It can be pretty inconsistent. Sometimes the food is awesome, others it is just alright. The beer selection is good but nothing out of this world. It holds nothing to Monks or Belgium Cafe, but those are beer heavens so it is unfair to compare. Sometime the service is good. Alana is awesome and so is Megan. They can both have attitude but it is just hipster attitude but I can see how some would be offended. The other servers are alright, but nothing memorable. This a great place for sports and beer but there is better out there. Just have your expectations in check and you will be ok. This is a bar first, restaurant second. Just remember that.
