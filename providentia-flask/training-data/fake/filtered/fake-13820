First of all, the excitement this place gives me when I walk in the door is like a kid in a candy shop. Its like a mall of beer, cider beers are my favorite and there is a whole fridge just devoted to them! All different kinds, and while I enjoy trying new ones, there are always my originals available as well. Mix and match with a 10% discount on a 6-pack...sweet, I know. The food is also a major plus here, I love the braised beef sandwich on a pretzel bun-so delish. I'm truly happy this is a new establishment in the city, definitely recommend checking it out.
