Gotta tell you that I eat here Saturday night. Best friend recommended it. Walk in with friends from St Louis - NO RESERVATIONS- hostess said 25 min. Well we ordered a drink at the bar & 15 minutes later we were seated. Service was real good & GOTTA Tell You BEST PORTER HOUSE STEAK I ever had. Seasoned just right & cooked to perfection. Really impressed my friends & they also enjoyed the meal. Great place & I'll be back. Thanks for making a GREAT Day with friends even BETTER!!! You get my 5 ******* STAR rating!!!!!
