I am seriously getting hungry just reading about this place. I came on this at a food truck set up over the 4th of July. It was not just good, it was amazing. I then set out to find it in the city. And find it I did. I nearly ran to this place. You MUST try the lobster roll. Everything about it was delicious. And the maine sodas. I am sad it is so close to my house. I might grow claws!!! YUMMY!
