This place is amazing for happy hour!  I went in on Friday night with a couple of friends...we each had a flight of red wine and our bartender Olivier was very knowledgeable, funny and welcoming to us.  He took the time to recommend different wines and explain to us the region and taste of the grapes.  He is also incredibly handsome!  We ordered the HH food specials the escargot and the goat cheese ball.  Both were delicious and left us wanting more. We ended with the banana crème burlee which I highly recommend.  I will definitely be back for dinner and I would recommend this place to anyone.
