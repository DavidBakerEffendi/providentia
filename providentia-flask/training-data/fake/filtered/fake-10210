Been going to Eli's for the last couple years, love the bar and it's service. There is no shortage of TV's in the building as it seems that from any seat you can see a TV. I got there late for a NFL game and the place was packed and the manager found a TV for me and my friends to watch our game, impressive. Waiter/Waitress service was always good to me, very personable and they check on you often but not too often, which is good. Food is very good as well, I am hooked on the nacho's. I have observed an incident with an intoxicated person at the bar (who had arrived already intoxicated) and I thought the management and bartender handled it very professionally and swiftly.
