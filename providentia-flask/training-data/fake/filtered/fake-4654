Let me start by saying that opinions (good or bad) are just that, "opinions".  It's just like anything else, some people will like you, some won't and some will just fall to that mid-space of whatever. I have been going to Libretti's for many years off and on and just recently started becoming more of a regular and with good reason, the food, the staff, the everything (even those random folks that you meet) have been great!!!  I have not had a bad experience and always encourage friends, colleagues, etc. to come out and enjoy the experience.  Danny, Donna, Sue, Joanne, Pat (Party Pat to those who know), Eddie, Amanda, Christina and the list goes all, always do their very best to make sure that everyone walks out happy, full and feeling great.  The food is fantastic, the servers are ALWAYS pleasant and this is my "Cheers" because everyone knows my name.  Again, this is my opinion because this is what I have always experienced. If you don't see something on the menu, ask for it (the worst they can say is no, we don't have it), if you have bad service (which I find hard to believe), speak on it, if you have GREAT service, take a moment to acknowledge it. One of the main reasons that I dislike social media is because everyone wants to take anyone's words for gospel, try it, see if you like it, if you do, come again and if not, go elsewhere, life is all about choices.  Oh and for anyone who wants to go to an Italian, Spanish, Chinese, Mediterranean (or whatever) restaurant in America and only want to be served by people who are of those ethnicities......, contact your travel agent and book a trip, you may have better luck..........., #bigotryliveandwellinamerica I love Libretti's and will continue to do so and I thank you all for making sure that I am always taken care of and for that you have my gratitude and much respect.
