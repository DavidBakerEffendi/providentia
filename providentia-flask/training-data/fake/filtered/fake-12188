I really like Miya's, although I can see why some people might not. It's not your typical sushi, a lot of it might not be classified as sushi at all, but I think it's fantastically executed, tasty, and sits well in your stomach. Miya's is good at putting together odd flavors that actually work together. [If you want 'regular' sushi, go to Sushi Palace in Hamden]. My only major complaints are that the prices are rather steep for what you get (I usually stick to the cheaper "Sushi for the masses" menu), and that the menu has changed drastically in the last few years and dropped a lot of my favorite items. It takes a little experimentation to figure out what you like, and that's not cheap. Bring back the Italian Stallion! Also, as a warning, the names of a lot of the rolls are impossible to say while maintaining one's dignity. "Charlie Chan's Ching Chong?" "Chinese Pygmy Rodeo?" I'm not sure I'd ever want to order at this restaurant in any kind of professional setting.
