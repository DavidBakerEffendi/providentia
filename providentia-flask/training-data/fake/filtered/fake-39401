My parents live in philly so I try to visit whenever I can.  My last trip during christmas and new year's week, I tried Koreana with a couple of my friends.  I ordered the dolsot bibimbop (stone hot pot!)... not too bad.  Pretty good service as well.  My friends weren't too big on the place, but it was alright for me.  The price was definitely a plus.  Definitely had better Korean in philly though.
