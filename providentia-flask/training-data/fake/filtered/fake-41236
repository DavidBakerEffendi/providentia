Totto is one of the most amazing places to eat ramen in the city. I can officially say I have tried all of their ramen bowls and I have to say I love the Veg Ramen for it is amazing broth (and I am a meat lover too). Just add the meat if you really want it. I inhale the bowl every time and enjoy the odd looks for requesting an extra bowl of noodles (95 lbs girl here). Â  I have a lot of trouble eating noodles when the ramen broth is too salty. This is most of my experience in most of the ramen places in the city I am sad to say. But at Totto, I have yet to have and discrepancy in getting a salty bowl. The ramen is amazing every time. I am so glad I found this place and you would too.
