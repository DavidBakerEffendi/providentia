Okay - lets first start by saying .. WHAT ARE YOU PEOPLE TALKING ABOUT?!?! a: its NOT a tapas place (and can we please spell it correctly if we are going to review?!)   They have a full menu, and every time I've gone, I've had a wonderful 3 course dinner (including awesome cocktails!)  My favorite would be the coconut mojito .. i think they call it a cojito?..  Its wonderful and I highly recommend it to ANYONE who goes here! b: Angelica; you are wrong.  It does age well with time!  Its been around for 10 years or more. I can remember back to when it was Main Street (not as good as Calle Ocho) and I can only say it has gotten better with age! The food has been pretty consistent over the years but it seems they switched up their menu recently (which was not a bad idea!)  The food does, has, and will always BE AMAZING!   The food is not dry, and as for the wait; this is nyc guys!  I have always found the wait to be reasonable and definitely worth it for the food - and the wait is made easier by having a basket of their reallllllllllllllly good bread balls.  They have cheese in them and they kick a**!!! Overall; dinner has always been fantastic there.  I went with family this week, they had never been, and they were blown away. Kudos to Calle Ocho!  All the haters need to go away - it isnt their fault they are a popular and busy restaurant! Which is a BLESSING in this economy! I definitely recommend making a reservation; the brunch seems to fill up very quickly!! The sangria is a good deal...it's free..what more can you ask for?!
