First nobody tells you it is CASH ONLY! There is no sign anywhere that says so.  The wait is long. The maitre d' points you to a table but is too busy texting to accompany you to it. So you sit yourself and wait for another long while. Finally a scrawny looking waiter asks for your order but fails to give you a menu. You were supposed to know on your first visit that they DON"T HAVE MENUS here! You were supposed to look at a chalkboard on the wall and that was the menu.  The food comes and it lacks taste and flavor. The marsala sauce and the marinara lack something very Italian - garlic and salt. Here's the best part - this place is so EXPENSIVE that the seafood marinara at $26 and the chicken marsala at $24 does not come with linguini. The pasta is an extra $12 ! What a rip-off!!! Stay away. Lenny's, Vincent's, Mama Theresa's, Bertucci, and Olive Garden are better value Italian restaurants.
