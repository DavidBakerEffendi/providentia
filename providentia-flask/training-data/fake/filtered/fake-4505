I appreciate byob's... for one you're not running up a bill due to alcohol consumption! lol This place is great for a date or just hanging with the girls. The service is spectacular, with servers from Lebecfin including the chefs!  Can you believe i had escargot for the 1st time and it was amazing, but I was one and done. I highly recommend this place,  the menu is wonderful and well thought of.
