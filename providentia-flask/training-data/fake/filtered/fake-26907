Decided to eat butcher bar last night after hearing a lot of hype. I decided to go with the Brisket Sandwich, which was a little dry for my liking, but the flavor was there. I went with the Mac and Cheese on the side which was awesome. the staff was friendly and helpful. I would reccomend this place to anyone looking for bbq in the area.
