My wife and I, along with our 7 month old baby stopped in this shopping center for Chinese. However, the smell coming from Guru Palace lured us in instead. We were quickly surprised by the atmosphere. Calm, dark lighting, very mellow place. The staff was incredibly kind and courteous and professional, which is a rarity these days, especially when you're bringing a baby into a restaurant during dinner service. Most waiters frankly get annoyed. However, the staff at Guru Palace treated my wife and infant son like royalty, asking questions about him, responding to baby talk, and being overall accommodating. The food came at a reasonable pace (not too soon, not too late), and was probably the best Indian Food that I've had in a long time. Absolutely wonderful flavor and texture. The prices were reasonable. An appetizer, two entrees, and drinks ran us about $40. We will definitely be visiting again next time we're out East. As for the negative reviews on here, I'm sorry the other users had unpleasant experiences, but we experienced nothing like those reviews.
