I found all the negative comments here the exact opposite of what i witnessed! The owner is a very nice guy! He is friendly to all his customers. The pizza was marvelous, Went home nice and full! And the barbecue wings were being ordered every second they are loved and look so Delicious! I say go to Goodfellas I've gotta say, this was probably the best pizza i have tasted!
