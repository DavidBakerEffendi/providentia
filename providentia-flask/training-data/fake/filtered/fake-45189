Went last night and were seated immediately.  Service is friendly if a little hovering.  3 of us had the modernized Shepherd's Pie with beef short ribs, carrots and mashed potatoes - omg it was delicious.  The sole pasta eater was extremely happy too.  Will definitely go back, once I've saved my pennies as the prices are on the high side for this area.
