I love Hoagie Haven, it's my all time favorite place to get a sandwich. Their Sanchez really hit's the spot especially for the late night munchies. The people are great, they even have a wall of pictures from their customers wearing their T-shirt and doing a variety of cool things. Plus they have very reasonable prices. My suggestion, COME (:
