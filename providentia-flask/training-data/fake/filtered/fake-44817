Went to Don Peppe's last Saturday. The wait was more than 1/2 hour. We finally got seated. The food was very good, tho I've had better Italian food in Forest Hills and the city. House wine was surprisingly good too. Portions were generous, true family style fashion. So why am I only giving them one star you ask. Well, after we were "prompted" to pay we settled the bill...we lingered at our table for a few more minutes. I was finishing my wine. A guy (owner or manager?) came to our table and asked us to leave as there were people waiting to be seated. We waited to be seated too! Okay, we want to be considerate, we get that. But, he could've told us in a nicer way. He was RUDE and we felt that he didn't care about us, as customers. It was like, you paid, now get out! No class at all. We will never go back there again!!
