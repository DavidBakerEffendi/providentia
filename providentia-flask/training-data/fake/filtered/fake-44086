Don't bother!  The service is so bad, it is surreal.  The staff, to be charitable, are idiots.  Be prepared to wait 10 minutes in line at the register behind 3 other parties waiting to pay or waiting for their food.  A walk in off the street will go straight to the front of the line and talk to the cashier about yoga.  And she will oblige in yoga talk, and then TAKE AN ORDER from yoga troll, without having acknowledged the presence of 2 waiting customers who arrived before.   Oh the food?  Not bad.  But it is nowhere near as good as the food at BROTHERS MOON (takeout or semi formal dining only), which averages about $2 cheaper with a similar but more refined menu.  And impeccable service from a professional wait staff.  Do yourself and your blood pressure a favor.  Go to Brothers Moon, save money, eat better food, and eat at home.  Peasants Grill might be a 3 star if they fired their customer service and got more organized in the kitchen.  They are in over their heads and clueless.
