I used Mama Mia for catering a barbeque at my home on 8/2/14. Â Rosario and his team did a wonderful job and we are so happy we chose Mama Mia for our special celebration. Rosario's staff are hard working, friendly and easy to have your party and his food is delicious! My guests had a wonderful time and I did too thanks to Rosario and his crew at Mama Mia!
