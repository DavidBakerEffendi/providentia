Ate brunch with reservations on a Sunday for 12:30.  Front of house was great and friendly and was seated immediately.  Locanda Verde was packed as was the bar.  The tables are a little too close together but was not really a problem for me.  We ordered sheep's milk ricotta with honey and toasted bread and carrot bread as an app.  Both were delicious!! Loved the mellow orange flavor of the toasted bread and the honey in the ricotta.  We also ordered cappuccinos and I had a bloody mary.  Not a fan of the bloody mary, have had much better but the cappuccinos were delish.  I had the scampi and grits and my husband had the breakfast stromboli.  We switched plates mid way and honestly both were very good.  Although the wait staff was pleasant and on the ball, I felt as if the food was being pushed too quickly from the kitchen to the table.  I am not one that normally lingers for hours at a restaurant, but would have liked a little slower pace.  Great decor, great location, great food.....will def be back.
