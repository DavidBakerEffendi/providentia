Was looking for a good burger and beer place after working in Hartford.. A few people recommended this place for their beer...on a Tuesday night the bar was pretty empty so didn't have any trouble finding a stool. The beer was good.. The most popular being the naughty nurse a pale ale. I wanted to try the in house stout but they ran out, so just stuck with the ale. As for the food I had a BLT burger and was very satisfied.. The bun was nicely toasted, bacon was crispy and the patty that I ordered "no pink" was cooked through but not dried out. I would recommend this place anyone looking for good beer and pub food.
