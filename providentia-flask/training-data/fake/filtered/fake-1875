I had a couple of beers here once. The atmosphere was cool, cozy and eclectic. Everyone seemed like regulars in some small, midwestern town. Bartenders were really courteous, yet quite speedy (busy, busy). Â I'm looking forward to going back some day soon -- unfortunately, I live too far away to become a "regular." Oh, and they happened to have live accordion on the night I was there, which was awesome.
