There is an oasis on 66th street and second ave. A restaurant you walk into, are warmly greeted by a pleasant & accommodating hostess. My friend and i were seeking refuge  from the heat and  noise generated because of the second avenue subway construction, when we entered  Mediterraneo. On to the food, we each had different , delicious cold crisp summer salads. and a coconut sorbet. The wait staff were pleasant , efficient and made our summer lunch a delightful experience on a hot noisy day in Manhattan. Prices are moderate.
