Eek! Methinks not is right. This was the first, and last time, that I'll visit Cafe Orlin. I'm not sure what everyone else raves about. The food was slow and cold, our coffee came after the meal was finished, and our waitress could not have been more disinterested in her job. Not to mention the french toast had some disgusting orange fluid on it. I'll use the word fluid because there is little chance it could have been syrup because it tasted so atrocious. The service of this restaurant forced me to write my first yelp review, because normally I love the recommendations on yelp. -Dr. G
