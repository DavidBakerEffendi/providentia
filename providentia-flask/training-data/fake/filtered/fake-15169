I am so happy i FINALLY checked this place out!! The manager first came over to us and thoroughly talked us through the menu. Recommended a couple of dishes; which we tried - the fish, goat cheese app., and the filet - everything had so much flavor!! We had sat at the bar, and the bartender (who was the manager) was not attentive and way too quiet for a bartender. We would have ordered more drinks, but did NOT pay any attention to us. Other than that, the service was great by the other wait staff. I would definitely go back!!
