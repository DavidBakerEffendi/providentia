you get what you pay for... this is the perfect place for dropping by after the club for greasy burgers and macaroni and cheese with your friends. i personally wouldn't eat here during normal hours, but the prices are reasonable and they're always open. the staff is generally snooty considering how not cool this place is anymore, but like i said, you can't beat the prices and the hours.
