This place sucks!! My boyfriend and I wanted to try a new place because we love sushi. We probably should have turned around and got back in our car when we walked in and saw the sushi chef playing with his kid on top of one of the tables. The place probably hasn't been vacuumed since the 70's and the fish seemed old too. We dint get plates I had to eat on a napkin. I can't even give this place a star.
