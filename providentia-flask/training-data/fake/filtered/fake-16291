Absolutely delicious!! This restaurant has changed a lot in the past few years....the menu is vast and they have all the "favorites"....great deals on food including 10% off card and a sign off card where you get a free meal after buying 8 or 6 (depending on lunch or dinner). The food is made fast (within 10 minutes of ordering) and delivery is a breeze. Don't listen to these other reviews....those were from before the restaurant changed. It's a fabulous place now and I highly recommend it to anyone!! Actually, I think I'm going to have some for lunch today! :)
