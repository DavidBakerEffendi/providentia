Came here with my family for a birthday dinner and was completely blown away. We ordered the shrimp & curry, mango chicken curry, steak and polenta, and the herb crusted salmon. All the dishes were made from fresh ingredients and the flavors were spot on. The desserts, however, are what really stood out to us. The passion fruit pave is to die for. There was real passion fruit in it (no artificial flavoring), had just the right amount of sweetness and had a wonderfully light texture. Definitely worth more than the $7 they charged for it. The Guinness chocolate cake was also really good. Not only did it taste great, but the texture was also perfect. Not too dense, very moist, and not too sweet. Overall, we were impressed with this little restaurant and will be coming back to eat here again and again.
