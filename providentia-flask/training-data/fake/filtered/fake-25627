We decided to try this place out last night after having dinner at Kraftwork nearby.  Waiting in line to be let in by the earpiece-wearing bouncer felt a little ridiculous, and I was a little nervous about the particularly douchey looking crowd.  It felt a little too Jersey Shore for my taste.  But once we got inside, I was totally pleasantly surprised.   Granted I've never been to a beer garden before, so maybe this is what they're all like, but it was a really nice set up with tons of picnic-table style seating in the open air court.  I didn't get anything to eat (and the $8 soft pretzels seemed a little over the top), but the beer was very reasonable.  I love the walk-up-window idea - it means no one rushes you out and you can sit for hours with your friends.  I also liked that the bouncers seemed to be counting people as they went in to make sure it didn't get too crowded, which made for a much more pleasant experience. So overall this is a really unique spot, and I'm hoping that once it's open for a little longer that the crowd will become more diverse, but I definitely recommend checking it out.
