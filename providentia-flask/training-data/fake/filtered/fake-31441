This is a secret seafood gem!   it seems to be a real hit with the locals as all my friend's are buzzing about it.  It seems to have already formed a loyal following. The service is super friendly.   More importantly the fish is super fresh.  I tend to go off the regular menu and order from the yummy specials menu. An overall great experience. I highly recommend it!
