The food was excellent.  The chicken heart was my favorite.  The chicken liver, smelt, and pork belly with scallion and ponzu were also memorably good. I would have enthusiastically given this restaurant five stars if it were not for the service.  Everyone was unwelcoming, but the hostess was especially rude.
