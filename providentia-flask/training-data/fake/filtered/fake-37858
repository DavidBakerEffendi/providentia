Had dinner there last night.  The filet of sole muniere and the sauteed spinach was out of this world.  Before writing this, I read some of the reviews and it's hard to believe those people went to the same place that I did.   The atmosphere was nice, quiet, and the waitress was very accomodating.  My friend and I enjoyed the meal, and were glad to not continually be asked a hundred times if we wanted something more.  We wanted to chat and were glad not to be rushed out. Sounds like a place where you need to go and experience it yourself.   --   Kerry
