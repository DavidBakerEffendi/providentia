My boyfriend and I ate here last night. It was awesome. The area is really nice, and calm. We had the degustation menu which was perfect. Amazing fusion tuna w/rice crackers, wines were perfect match with the food. The service is also very good, our waitress was really professionnal and attentive. We had a great time here ! Would highly recommend!
