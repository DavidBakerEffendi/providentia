The veal Saltimbocca is my all time favorite. The staff is always friendly and attentive. I think it says a lot about a place that can retain the same employees year after year. The little strip mall it is in is nothing to look at from the outside, just goes to show you can't judge a book by its cover. Decor inside is warm and food is consistently delicious.
