I organized a dinner for 96 people on the Moshulu. Drinks on the deck, then downstairs for dinner, roast of a colleague with slideshow presentation etc. Everything about the Moshulu was great. I'd organized two other events for this crowd the previous evenings that had been okay, but just okay. So I was nervous. When I arrived, everything was sorted. I was assigned Danny, who looked to be about 12. I said "what do you know about this event?" and he said "everything"... and the proceeded to rattle off the exact details of what I had asked for down to the last pedantic detail. From memory. Very impressive, and we had a splendid night. I had negotiated a little on the price due to our constrained budget, and I thought they might try to make the money back on the alcohol (I had a limited open bar for three hours). But not so. Everyone was greeted with drinks as soon as they walked in, and it flowed continuously. Very impressive and a great spot for a mid-week corporate style event.
