Me of my favorite restaurants in the whole city!! There aren't many places left like this downtown. The owner greets you at the door every time you arrive and will ask you to go an grab a drink next door at Von until your table is ready. He then comes and grabs you and offers you to bring your drinks back next door to sit for your perfect Italian home style meal! It feels like being in someone's Italian grandmas house. Highly recommend! Great place for a bottle of wine with friends or loved ones.
