Why would it be less than 5 stars? I guess it's crowded but that's because it offers so much and I take that as a good sign, obviously. We mostly go here for the lovely selection of raw milk and meats from the Fair Food Farmstand but we've eaten lunch at a few of the stalls and bought some very tasty cookies here before, too. It's a great place and we are grateful to have it in philadelphia. We drive an hour to get here! I guess my only beef is that a validated ticket only gets you a $2 discount in the parking garage... mostly in other places, validation gets you free parking (we spend 60-100 bucks here sometimes!) but such is life. Now we've taken to dropping one of us off and circling the area until we get our goodies lol!
