I have been to this location more than 3 times with my family and friends, and the food is the same (Exceptionally Good) as the other restaurant that they have up in northern NJ.    I see people saying that the service is slow, not sure how many people know this but they do make the food fresh!!!!  I rather wait to get good food then the food that has been cooked and just being reheated.  That being said, I usually order the chicken Lollipop and the Lamb Biryani both always come out great, also the Dal Thadka.  I once tried the Kankon Shrimp and it was very very tasty!
