Just a quick note to say that The Great Wazu - in both locations (Parsippany and East Hanover) is the best place for excellent quality, fresh, individually-made sub sandwiches in Morris County!!  The atmosphere is always friendly and the sandwiches are absolutely knock-out delicious!!!  A perfect alternative to the "fast-food" chains.
