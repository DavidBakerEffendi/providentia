I went to Trumbull kitchen on Saturday night and was helped by the most lovely young lady named Marta. She was so incredibly sweet and helpful and patient in answering all our questions. She was informative and knew the menu so well. She asked us questions to understand our taste and really helped us order the exact right dish. I had the seafood pad Thai and it was amazing! If I could I would give this place A MILLION STARS because it was just too good. The food was outstanding but the service was what really made it stand out. BRAVO MARTA!!!!! BRAVO
