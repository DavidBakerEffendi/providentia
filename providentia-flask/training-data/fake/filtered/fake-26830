The space is definitely cramped and you WILL have to wait if you come on lunch hour, but the place does have a nice feel to it.  The vegetarian platter is alright, but just a bit bland.  The guacamole and fish tacos are both pretty good.  Good-sized portions, reasonably priced.  The standout, however, is the red wine sangria.  Don't miss out....
