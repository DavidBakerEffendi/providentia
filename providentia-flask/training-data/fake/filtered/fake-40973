I really enjoyed the pizza here. The ingredients were very fresh, the cheese was so Â stringy, delicious tomato sauce was beautifully complimented by fresh basil & romano and the thin crust was absolutely delicious. The place was extremely busy, but It was worth the wait! I have seen many negative reviews, but we had a great experience!
