The Boil is Red Hot!!!!! What an incredible place-the best dining experience we have had in years,the charming and dedicated owner Donald has created a superb niche market in seafood dining!! We arrived to be sat near the kitchen area so we could observe the fantastic seafood being prepped for our delectation.we were aproned and gloved and soon our bags of perfectly cooked and sauced crawfish shrimps lobster and clams arrived all as fresh  as you could  possibly imagine.One of the benefits of being a great place is the freshness is guarenteed and boy this place doesnt fail .!! The sauces they were cooked in ensured a fabulous meal and the staff and Donald were all very attentive and couldnt have been friendlier-if there was a boil in the UK we would be there very often! Full marks to Donald and his team for finding a great idea and then making 100%effort to make it work-brilliant result -you definately wont be disapponted at The Boil
