This is quite possibly one of the best restaurants have been to . Great service , proper coffee and pizza that is to die for . My friend had the cannelloni and the sauce is to die for . This a true hidden gem . Thee owners gave us a trial of some other flavour creations they were working on as well. I'll be here 5/5 days I'm here . Â Quality ingredients , fresh and delightful.
