No wait when we arrived on saturday afternoon. there were multiple tables open, jet they chose to seat our party of three on top of the server station in the back. Green Egg Cafe owner - if you take anything from this review, please do something about this table location. i understand the need to pack as many tables into the cafe as possible, but it is clearly the worst seat in the house. Under no circumstance should you ever let your customers see into the back of house, and what happens on the floor of the kitchen. From this table the atmosphere is, behind the bar storage and dirty floor to my left, server station with dirty dish bins and the restroom fully exposed straight ahead. can you please put doors on the opening to the kitchen, or plants or a screen to block the view? I We were serviced in a timely manner. I ordered the huevos rancheros, and friends had grilled cheese with tomato soup and egg white omelet. The huevos rancheros was listed as black bean and cheese quesadilla with fried egg, salsa and guacamole. I was extremely disapointed to find canned refried beans in my meal and not black beans as stated. The side of potatoes was cold. I am someone who usually finishes my meal as a matter of habit, but this i didn't even want. My friend wasnt even sure that there was cheese on his grilled cheese sandwich and the tomato soup tasted condensed. The egg white omelet was just ok. after our food was brought to us by the food runner, our server didnt come back to ask if we needed anything or even refill our ice tea. I wont go back here, and i am wondering how this place got a two bell review from Craig.
