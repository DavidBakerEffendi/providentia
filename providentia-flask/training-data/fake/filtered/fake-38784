Terrible customer service, and highly disappointing for special orders. Don't even bother! I ordered a cake for a co-worker's birthday. It was supposed to be a surprise, and because I wasn't in the area, I asked if it could be delivered. They were the first bakery I called who would deliver (for a fee). Her birthday came and went, and the cake never arrived. Other co-workers had to go out and buy another cake, and the surprise was ruined. When I called the bakery, they said they had the cake sitting right there, and they FORGOT to deliver it! Unacceptable! Don't take the order if you can't bother with remembering to actually give it to your customers! All they offered me was a refund on the delivery fee! The party was ruined, I was already out the cost of ANOTHER cake to make up for their foolish forgetfulness, and they still expect me to pay for the whole cake? FORGET IT! I am so upset with this bakery--absolutely unbelieveable.
