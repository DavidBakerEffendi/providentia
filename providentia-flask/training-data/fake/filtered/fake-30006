I had a very bad experience, and it was a waste of money and time. No "hi," "hello," or "thank you" was said. They don't know how to properly provide customer service. I ordered a vegetarian biriyani and they had put chicken in my biriyani. I confronted them about the mistake, the man took the dish back into kitchen, threw the chicken pieces out, and returned a second later presenting me with my previous dish. I was appalled, being purely vegetarian, and couldn't take the rice that had previously embedded chicken pieces. No one had apologized for the mix up Â and I cancelled my order, pissed.
