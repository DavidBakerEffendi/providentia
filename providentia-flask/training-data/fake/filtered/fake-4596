Giant FAIL! Place is fairly nice looking although more loungy than I expected. With such a renowned chef one would hope the food would be at least serviceable...its not.  The quail was overwhelmed by the bacon and way too salty. Patatas Bravas were soggy  and had no punch. The shrimp were flavorless and muddy. And that's just the apps! As for the mains the suckling pig did, the steak was tough and the chicken was so tart I puckered. Big MEH. Dessert was skipped as the bill was already too high.
