We ate here the Saturday before christmas, and found the food EXCELLENT! We made a reservation a couple days ahead of time, as they fill up fast, and NO table is left unaccounted for. The service was so/so, as they were very busy, and our waitress seemed slightly overwhelmed. Towards the end of our dining experience, a new waitress showed up, and was extremely friendly and on the ball. All in all, i would absolutely reccomend anybody eating here.
