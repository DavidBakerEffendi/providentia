I'm from NYC and have been to the best sushi places around.   Morimoto's, Matsuri, Sushi Samba to name a few.   Sushi California is on par if not better than the places I mentioned.  The biggest difference is the price.  Sushi California is about half the price.  The fish is fresh and the rolls are packed.  Other places like Fuji (mentioned below) use tons of rice and batter on the fried rolls.  I've been to tons of sushi  places all around so I know my sushi.  Trust me, this place is great.
