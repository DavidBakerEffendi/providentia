Fellow foodies behold.  A new and interesting dining option in the Montclair/Bloomfield area.  The Orange Squirrel Restaurant and Bar on Bloomfield Ave. I ate there last night with a group of friends and we all thought the food was great. Upscale, modern bistro with a cool NYC vibe. Nothing like it in the area. Getting right to the food -- we had the shrimp cocktail (came with 3 interesting sauces and shrimp were enormous) and Prince Edward Island muscle appetizers were both top notch. Then we shared the four cheese and the truffle brick-oven pizzas along with the home-made Manicotti pasta.  All were delish. For entrees, the Chicken Pot pie was a surprise as it came out in a cast-iron skilled with the flaky crust baked on top.  The huge Rib Eye steak was also served in a skillet.   Colorado lamb chops were tender and tasty. A friend had the whole Bronzini and raved. -- each entree (except the pot pie) cam with a side dish and all I can say is YUM -- creamy gorgonzola polenta, brussel sprouts with pancetta, fontina mac and cheese and cheddar mashed potatoes (you eat with a spoon, not a fork)  were all delightfully, non-traditional. A nice touch was the Chef came out to say hello.  We learned he came from some very impressive NYC restaurants.  He was also rather entertaining when we asked how he came-up with the name.   They served some unique wines by the glass and bottle.  Not your standard seletions.  Some fun coctkails were made with their own infused vodkas.  Also, a complimentary amuse came before the meal and a complimentary Bailey's-like drink was served at the end of the meal.  A little chocolate squirrel came with the check.   Prices are above average, but are totally in line with above-average  level of preparation and cuisine.  As they say, it's all in the details!
