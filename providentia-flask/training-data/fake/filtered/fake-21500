The worst bar experience I have ever had.  I have never encountered a bartender that was more RUDE!  The staff was pushy, rushed us, and provided extremely poor service.  It was a completely miserable experience and I wish I could have my money back so I could go to one of the hundreds of other bars in NYC that are superior.  The atmosphere was dull and the room was very dark.  The bartenders were so rude I would never step foot in the establishment again, even if the drinks were free!
