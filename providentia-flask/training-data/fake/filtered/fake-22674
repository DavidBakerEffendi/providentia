I just tried their WV location. The outside area was just set up that night so the service was somewhat disorganized but our waitress was very sweet and helpful. We had the butternut squash soup, brocolli rabe, the fennel salad, and the polenta. It was very fresh and the really good. I would definitely go back. Note--we waited for 30 minutes and we got there at 6pm. It's a busy spot!
