This is complete new experience in US. If you are looking for authentic south indian breakfast/ meal. I recommend this place. The varieties i liked in the lunch buffet are Idli, Vada, Pongal & a real coconut chutney which i usually didnt see in other US  offerings.. Though the name gives us an impression that this is a kind of dosa specialty but this is a typical south indian veggie restaurant.. Restaurant also offers north indian flavours.. Rasa malai & payasam were also good & yummy..  I was very satisfied with the meal !
