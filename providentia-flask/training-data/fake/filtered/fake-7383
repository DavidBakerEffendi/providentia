So far Ive only been for drinks at the bar. Its a great place for people watching, it has a really good ambiance - lively but not overbearing. The bar staff are extremely professional and know their stuff. They are always polite, chatty if you want them to be but mostly leave you alone once you have your drink and they don't seem pretentious. Looking forward to going back on my next trip to NY to try out the food.
