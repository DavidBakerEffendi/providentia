I've heard some mixed reviews on Geno's and I figured I would give it a try. I wasn't all that impressed.  I waited in line for about 15 minutes.  I ordered a cheesesteak with the whiz and onions.  I finally received my cheesesteak opened it and took a bite.  The cheese whiz and onions were amazing.  As for the steak itself, it was very dry and cold.  I think I will try Pat's next time.
