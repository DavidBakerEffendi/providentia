They have a ton of dipping sauces for fries, everything from rosemary mayo to black truffle oil. The fries are good, not the best I've ever had but certainly better than most.   This is the ideal spot to visit after a night of drinking.   My only complaint is that my friend's order got lost in the shuffle.  They should try to come up with some sort of streamlined ordering system.  Although, I'm not one to talk because I wouldn't be able to come up with one!
