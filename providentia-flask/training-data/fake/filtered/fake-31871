My husband and I LOVE Fonda in Brooklyn and are frequent visitors. We have recommended the Brooklyn location to at least 10 of our friends, who've recommended to theirs. We have been very happy with this place...until we went to the Manhattan location this past Saturday. We made a reservation for 7PM, and we got there about 20 min. early, so we decided to get drinks and guacamole at the bar while we waited for our friends and table. Everything was fine until out table was ready- that's when the service went completely downhill. We were rushed from the very beginning- the hostess came over and told us that she needed us to sit and order right away because she had another reservation for our table. More than half of our party had never eaten at Fonda, and before they had a chance to even open the menu, our server came over to take our order. When we said we weren't ready, she said that they had other reservations and that we had to order. She gave us a lot of attitude and made us feel so unwelcome. My husband and I felt embarrassed in front of our guests because the restaurant was our idea and we've spoken so highly of it. The employees kept mentioning that they had other reservations-SO DID WE!!!! Once we ordered, we got our food quickly (even BEFORE our appetizers) and our bill came just as quickly. They REALLY waned us out, and had no problem showing it. I am not sure if we will ever visit this place again...the Manhattan OR Brooklyn location. Maybe we will give Brooklyn another chance, but the Manhattan..NEVER.
