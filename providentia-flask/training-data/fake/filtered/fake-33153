Food is ok. Place is WAY too small for the volume of business. Why 1 star? Since there is no room to sit inside we sat right outside on their bench. As we are eating we noticed that the workers are constantly bringing food from the basement next door - constantly. Not 1 minute passes and a big RAT comes out of that same basement that all the food came out ### now how would you feel While you are eating your falafel that practicaly 70% was made in this rat's home? Taim's owner - you make enough money (All CASH) to afford a bigger place where you would have enough space to make our food without sharing the space and ingredients with RATS. That stinks!!!!!!
