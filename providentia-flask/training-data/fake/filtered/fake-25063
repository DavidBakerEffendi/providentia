Hands down some of the best pizza we have ever had. Trips down to New Haven include Ikea and this stop for sure. We even get an extra pizza to take home with us. Half of  which will be gone by the hour ride back to Western Mass!!!. As for the wait. It's part of the experience. And you can simply think about how good its going to taste. When that steaming hot pie comes out, your senses explode and a huge smile is upon thee faces of the GRUB BUDS! Grub Bud (female) enjoyed the Clam Pie , but Grub Bud (male) always goes for the Tomato pie with mozzarella. We also loved the local Foxon Park  sodi's that are offered. Damn, just writing this review is making me plan the next trip down to New Haven. A MUST !!!
