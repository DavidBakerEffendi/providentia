Just came from here for a late lunch/early dinner. There were two other tables that were big parties and the waitress sent the busboy over to play waiter! Service was terrible. Food was okay but not great. My husband and i had entr√©es. We were surprised that neither was offered with pasta and we were not offered any side dishes either. This may be because we did not have a real waiter. Overall the experience was not the best and although we live in the area and this place was highly recommended, we will not return.
