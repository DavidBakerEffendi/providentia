I cant say it's the best restaurant in Bayonne. BUT...it is definitely the best CHINESE restaurant in town. Here's my review: i ordered a roast pork with pepper and tomato with brown rice, small boneless spare ribs, and a shanghai roll. the roast pork w/pepper and tomato is my favorite of them. the taste blends in so well with another i will definitely order another one soon. the brown rice is just a healthier choice than white rice. boneless spare ribs have a honey taste to them. some of them is over grilled and burnt a bit, but it's understandable since the piece is thin and on the edge, it was hard to get the tempurture just right through out the ribs. i would say 99% of the ribs come out to a perfect crimson color with just enough honey taste in it to lure me in for another run. shanghai roll was also a great appetizer. it's small so i assume it doesnt have too many calories. small in size, but great in taste. crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with vegetables such as mushroom and cabbage. would i recommend yummy yummy to others? most DEFINITELY!!
