My husband and i went here for brunch based on the great yelp reviews. Food was good and so was the service, however i think my expectations were a little high based on the previous reviews. As expected there was a wait on Sunday morning, but they got us in a resonable amount of time. Wish their menu had a little more vegetarian options.
