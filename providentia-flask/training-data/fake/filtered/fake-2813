I have never eaten at this restaurant, nor will I ever step foot inside. I'm passing along a message from a friend- If you want to be cursed at and lied to by the owner himself, then by all means, go here. A friend of mine is a white American, who went here with a group of 15 people. They were told the wait will be 2 hours, then after 2 hours, another hour and another hour, so on. Close to 11pm- the owner says "When will you F****** white people leave?" REALLY!---- Please do yourself a favor and go to a place that actually deserves the business. This place is a joke. I'll tell every person I know of this story. Â Zero stars!
