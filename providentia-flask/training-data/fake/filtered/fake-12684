I have been coming here for many years.  Over the years, there have been some ups and downs, but overall it is still one of my favorites.  i've brought friends and colleagues and all of them have left happy.  The staff is attentive and the food is consistently good to great.  The portions are always generous, you do not feel like they are ripping you off, which I have felt in neighboring restauranat.  Fortunately, this one remains true and humble.
