If you want great Pizza, go there; if you want a nice place for dinner, probably it is not what you are looking for. An obvious thing you will see: there are stacks of empty PIzza delivery boxes all over the place, and they are gone fast! The owner probably doesn't care a upscale environment, after so many years, it is not improved, but people still go there, just for Pizza.
