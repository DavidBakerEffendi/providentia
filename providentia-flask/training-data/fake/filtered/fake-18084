I haven't had lasagna since I have given up dairy, last year, and my husband discovered he had a gluten allergy so I was very happy to see the dairy and gluten free lasagna on the menu. Well, I must say that it was fabulous! It was made with layers of polenta and a soy "ricotta" and a layer of greens with a delicious tomato sauce. Can't wait to return!
