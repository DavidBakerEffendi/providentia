I went last night, as one of two people.  We both ended up giving it an average mark. We started with the hamachi and scallops, both were elegantly made, and the scallops had a delectable, delicate sauce, although the luke-cold temperature was startling. For dinners I had the tuna and my partner a white flaky fish - the names escape me.  Both were on the winter side of seasonal, heavy in what seemed like root vegetables and accompanying meats.  In preparing my tuna steak, they focused on the 'steak,' presenting the tuna coarsely cut, glazed in a ginger/peanut paste (I think), and heavily doused in an au-poivre sauce.     The service was friendly, and amusing, if not always prompt or informed.   The ambience intimate, if a little dark. The prices felt expensive: $35 for an entree; $15-$20 for an appetizer.   Ultimately we left feeling that Little Fish missed the mark.   We entered anticipating light buoyant reasonably priced fare consistent with Philadelphia's BYOBs  We left feeling a little drained.
