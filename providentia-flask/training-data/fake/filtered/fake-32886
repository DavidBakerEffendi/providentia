I went alone on a Sunday night around 6:30pm and waited about 40 minutes for a seat at the bar. I don't consider that a terribly long wait especially if the food is good. And indeed it was. Hirata Pork Buns - Good. Simply dressed with iceberg lettuce and mayo, the pork belly was glazed with their "special" sauce. They were as good as any I've had, but nothing terribly unique or exciting. Akamaru Modern Ramen - Amazing. Slightly chewy noodles in an "intense" pork and miso broth with half a soft boiled egg and piece of Berkshire pork. This is probably the most "flavorful" Japanese dish I've ever had. I don't think the price is too steep considering I'm likely to pay the same or more for a plate of pasta, which probably takes less work to make, at any decent Italian restaurant. The wait is the biggest downside. The staff can be quite loud as well. Friendly, but loud.
