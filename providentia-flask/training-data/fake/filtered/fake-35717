This is seriously the best Greek food you will ever have. It's a small place, but it's really nice, great food and service. Great lunch spot and the owners are really nice. Haven't tried everything on the menu, but the gyros are out of this world. One of my fave things is the stuffed grape leaves, mmm, so good. Also, if you're the kind of person with a sweet tooth you have to have a piece of the baklava, it's absolutely amazing! I never have a bad meal here and I will always keep going back for more.
