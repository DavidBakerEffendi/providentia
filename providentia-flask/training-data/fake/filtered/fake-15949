On their menu they have a quote that reads "remember how good Chinese food used to taste?  It still does!" and it's true!   My wife and I have been ordering take-out from Bergen Dragon for almost 3 years and have been impressed every time with the quality and taste of the food.  As the other reviewer mentioned, their egg rolls are probably the best you'll ever have.  We normally order the same thing at every Chinese take-out place, but feel comfortable enough to experiment with new dishes at Bergen Dragon.   Since we dine out about once a week, we find that consistency is the #1 problem at most restaurants.  We have not had even a slight problem with orders from Bergen Dragon. The food is always ready 10 minutes after the order is placed and we must pass 3 or 4 other Chinese places to get to Bergen Dragon, but it's definitely worth the trip. If you're in south Bergen County and looking for great Chinese take-out, you've got to give Bergen Dragon a try.
