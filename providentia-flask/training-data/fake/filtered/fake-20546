Best. Burger. Ever. You can see from my profile that my dying wish would be to have a burger from Village Whiskey. They are plump, juicy and bursting with flavor, sitting on a bun that is soft but somehow never gets soggy. I like burgers medium rare, but since so many e-coli scares, I've noticed that no matter how I order them, the burgers always come well done. Not so at Village Whiskey. If you like your meat medium rare, you get it that way. Jose Garces must trust his beef supplier (and possibly his liability insurance company!) And who would have thought duck fat fries could be so completely satisfying? In a town of good burgers, a Village Whiskey burger is great. I typically go about 3 p.m. That's after the lunch crowd and before the dinner crowd packs this place. It's a really small place, and they don't take reservations, so that's really the only way to ensure getting a table without a wait. The ambiance is faux-old-boy with a walnut bar, tiled floors, and mirrors behind the bar. It's charming and could be romantic, if you could get a table when your date wanted to without waiting a long time.
