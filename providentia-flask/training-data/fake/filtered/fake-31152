Food was okay, service not so much. Went there a few days ago and it was absolutely freezing in the restaurant, so I asked the waiter if it would be possible to turn down the three ACs that were running at the time. He replied no, that it would be too hot for the cooks in the kitchen. What happened to customers first? I heard a few other patrons comment on it as well. Just seems to be a bit rude to me.
