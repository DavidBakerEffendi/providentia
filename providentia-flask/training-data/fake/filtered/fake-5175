My boyfriend and I unexpectedly ran into this bistro and decided to give it a go and I loved it.  We were seated inside but close to the outdoor seating area so it gave us the best of both worlds: shielded us from the sun but had access to the wonderful wind and view. Our waitress was very friendly and patient. To begin, we ordered a warm goat cheese salad to share. It was tart and delicious. For our entree, I ordered the Coq au vin which was very good. I think it's the best I ever had! My boyfriend had the Hanger steak with frites that once again was delicious. It came with a sauce that was just amazing! The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the ketchup, it tasted weird in a way I really can't describe but ketchup is optional so its fine.  For dessert we ordered the Tiramisu making it the perfect end to a great meal.  Lovely service and food. Would recommend a thousand times and more!
