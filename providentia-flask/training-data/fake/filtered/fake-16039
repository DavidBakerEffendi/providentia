My husband and I were walking around the Soho area looking for a place to eat and were greeted by a girl in a beautiful bright costume which sparked our interest. When she informed us that it was a new Ukrainian restaurant, Â I was immediately interested in eating there. My grandma was from Ukraine and would always cook for me when I was little, but I've never been to a Ukrainian restaurant before. I convinced my husband to try something new and we decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised at how traditional and authentic the food was. They had everything that I remember eating as a little girl and more. We tried three different types of Vareniki and they were all delicious. The cornish hens are also a must try, and the bacon infused vodka was unlike anything we've ever heard of/tried. Needless to say, we will be back very soon! Very cool place to try something new.
