I LOVE the Brooklyn location in the summer. Outdoors, very cool and friendly vibe, but this location is not worth it at all, VERY VERY cramped, literally on top of the person next to you (and not the person you're dining with). Food is ehhh. OK, they make that yummy corn but I could get that to go next door. For some reason, people love it and it's been around for years. I would rather get takeout at la Esquina's window and eat at the park across the street or eat at their laid back cafe. Similar food, quality, but not the claustrophobic scene...
