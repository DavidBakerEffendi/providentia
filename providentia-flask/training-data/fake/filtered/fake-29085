This sandwich chain is amazing. I can't say enough good things about it. I really don't like traditional American sandwiches as I tend to prefer Asian flavors, so this is the perfect combo for me. I highly highly highly recommend the spicy organic tofu sandwich. The sprigs of cilantro and flavorful sauces and marinades are what really make these sandwiches come alive in your mouth. I would eat one for for all three meals if we lived in a world where carbohydrates didn't make me fat.
