I loved going to AC Peterson's, however there service has been falling short. The food has become skimpy (very small portions). Â A couple next to me was also complaining that their OJ was watery and the soda had some sort of residue. The waiters/waitresses were super friendly but lately they have been short and moody! They have lately been lacking that hometown friendly atmosphere...
