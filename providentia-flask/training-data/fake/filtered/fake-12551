This was "THE" most horrible restaurant experience I have ever had. Reading the general reviews, I thought of this to be a decent place in the vicinity and decided to go for dinner. When we entered, the restaurant was deserted with no sign of any other guest. We thought that this could be because it was a weekday and sat for dinner. The staff was very rude but we ignored to avoid spoiling our mood. We ordered a starter which was all oily. For the entree the staff never asked whether we wanted soup or salad with it unless we called him to ask. And then came the disaster pasta dish, where the pasta was undercooked. We complained to one of the staff which agreed that the pasta was not cooked properly but later the manager came and said that this is how they cook Pasta in Italy. It is not the only Italian place we have been to not know how it is done. We paid and left. After this terrible incident, when we left the place and went to a nearby shop, I realized that I left my cap in the restaurant. I returned to pick it up only to realize that "Positano Mediterranean Grill" was closed and locked up at 10pm when the operating hours clearly mentions open till 11pm. This was one of the worst meal and service I have ever seen. And all of this happened on my husband's birthday. It ruined the day for us. I would never again visit this place and would also recommend the same.
