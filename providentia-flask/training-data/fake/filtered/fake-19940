Every now and then, through sheer luck, you find an amazing restaurant that you otherwise would never have experienced. Cascalote Latin Bistro is one such restaurant. My girlfriend and I were walking through Spanish Harlem, looking for a place to eat, when we noticed a cute and cozy 20 seat Latin restaurant with a very appealing menu. Â  I've worked in the restaurant industry for over 12 years and I can honestly say that our first visit produced nothing less than exceptional results. My girlfriend ordered the the jalapeno marinated pork chop with smoked bacon and sauteed onions. The pork chop was perfectly tender with just the right amount of heat. The bacon added a hint of smoke and the carm onions brought out a sweet crunch that brought the whole dish together. I'm normally a gentleman on a date, but I have to admit that I stole an extra piece while she wasn't looking. It was that good. I had the slow roasted short ribs with the crispy potato croqueta topped with a shaved radish salad. The short ribs were flaky and delicious with a hint of beer in the marinade brought out a nutty aftertaste. The croqueta was a perfect addition in that it added body, texture, and crunch to the dish; not to mention that it soaked up the delicious sauce the coated the short ribs. And the crispy radishes were an ideal match with the soft moist short ribs. Unfortunately we had no room left for dessert but we both agreed that, after we told everyone we knew about this place, we would certainly go back. I advice anyone reading this who is looking for unique and perfectly executed Latin cuisine to take a trip up to SpaHa and experience this absolute gem of a restaurant.
