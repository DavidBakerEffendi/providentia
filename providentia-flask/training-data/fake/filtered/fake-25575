i grew up in tucson, az so i'm a bit snobbish when it comes to mexican food. senorita's definitely offers the best mexican food in the area (i.e. i'm not a big fan of mexicali rose) and the restaurant itself is quite nice. the portions are generous, tasty, and you never have to wait to be seated. it really is one of the best things that's happened to downtown bloomfield.
