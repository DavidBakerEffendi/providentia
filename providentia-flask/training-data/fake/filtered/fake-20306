I just stopped there yesterday. Made it a point to infact. I'm from the burbs and don't get there as often as I'd like. Usually I only get therre around Christmas when I'm buying turtle acroos the street for snapper soup. But George's is DYNO-MITE.  Can't beat the pork and for me, the tripe is out of this world. In fact its's the only place in the world I know of to get it.   My man who serves surely isn't  Mr. Sunshine, but camn he can cook and serveice is great.  This is quintsential South Philly food. A mall hole in the wall with A+++ food.
