Now these are not your run of the mill bartenders. These guy know what there doing big time serving the tastiest drinks in the area. The bar is well equipped with tons of selections and a good wine list. We always sit at the bar as you can order from there menu there. The Tapas and main dishes are delicious. Do yourself the favor and pass by you won't regret it !!!!!
