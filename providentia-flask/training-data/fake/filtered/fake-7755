We Yelp everything  which lead us to Handy's.   We loved everything about this place - the homemade cooked meal, the good old fashioned friendliness,  the horseshoe counter, the price and the owner.  The owner, Earl,  was super nice- he even took his time talking to us. He has a heart of gold-I would most definitely go back again.
