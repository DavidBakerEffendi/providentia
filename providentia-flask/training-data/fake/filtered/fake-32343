This is hands down the best falafel you can get in NYC- I don't care that it's in Astoria, make the trip and try it just once and you'll be hooked. It is hot, fresh, perfectly spiced and so delicious.  The guys are friendly and give you free falafels as you wait.  I know it's a long line, but get there early or go on a rainy day- there will still be a line, but a bit shorter.  Trust me, it is worth it.
