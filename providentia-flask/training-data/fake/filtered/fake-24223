I'm switching to Da Vinci's. Or Enzo's. Or both. Villa Victoria has, for the second time, taken well over an hour to deliver my pizza. And when it arrived, it had an average of 3 small pieces of pepperoni on each slice. When I called the manager, she couldn't have cared less. To hell with this place. I'm sure there are better ones out there.
