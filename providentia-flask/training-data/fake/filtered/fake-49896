Went here after work on a Friday evening with a group of friends. The place is alot larger than expected with several floors with many seating arrangements and a Comedy Club on the lower level. The atmosphere is great and the staff is friendly, we were seated on one of the upper levels where we were greeted by a friendly waiter. They had quite a few selections of drafts and the food was actually really good. Usually when you go to a place that brews there own beer the food is ok at best. I would recommend this place for a group of people or events.
