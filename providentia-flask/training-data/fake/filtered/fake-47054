Picked Rubirosa based on its Yelp reviews and was not let down. Everything was perfect. The server was attentive and quick. The Rubirosa Supreme (which included meatballs, basil, and garlic slices) was terrific. We tried the antipasto plate as an appetizer, which included house-made mozzarella. The desserts were amazing - decadent cheesecake and a tasty berry cobbler. Finished it off with some house-made limoncello. Overall a fantastic experience!
