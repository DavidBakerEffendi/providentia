Went here to get a snack after a night of drinking and it was delicious! I got 3 falafel sandwiches: the first one, I made a mistake by putting a lot of the red sauce and man it was spicy! so I threw that one away. And cause it was delicious, I ate 2 sandwiches. Cause I ate it when I was drunk, I went back when I wasn't drunk to confirm the deliciousness. And the verdict is...its still amazing! Small place but its GOOOD! Go easy on the red sauce though~
