Me and my wife were trying out this restaurant with two of our friends this Saturday night.  We tried many different restaurants and cuisines, this was one of the very few restaurants that we finished every single dish (10 dishes).  Pricing was less than what we expected.  Food was better than what we had in the other higher price restaurants.  Service was A+++, our waitress Catherine was very nice with a little bit of British accent which we loved.  My favorite dished were the Grilled Atlantic Salmon (Entree) and AHI Tuna Tartar (Appetizer).  The Steam Mussels was pretty good too (the sauce little bit too sweet).  Overall, we will go back very soon to try out other dishes on the menu.
