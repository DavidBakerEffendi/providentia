When I moved to Rahway in 2003 I visited here and knew I hit a home run! It was comparabale to some of the best pizza I have had in NY.  Vito & Joe are funny as hell!  Vito (the father everyone says is grumpy) is a sweet older Italian from Sicily who doesn't play so I guess to the sensitive he can be viewed as grumpy but he is actually very sweet. Try the lobster bisque it is fabulous (could actually use a lil more lobster but what do you expect for $5). They would never win a decor contest. But, hey some of the best foods come from the "Mom & Pop" joints. Definitely come in try it. You won't be disappointed...
