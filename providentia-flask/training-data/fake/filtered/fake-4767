Beautiful. That's what I said and felt when I walked in. I saw suited men. It is a proper whisky (or whiskey in this case) ;) cocktail bar. Now, I'm not a dedicated whiskey drinker but the Hound Dog and the Noreaster were absolute elixirs. I understand the Manhattan and the Old Fashioned are also excellent. The food was delicious although I did not like the cornbread little bites at the start - soooooo salty! Too salty. Still, service was excellent and we were not rushed at all. Thoroughly enjoyed, although for me it is the draw to a proper cocktail bar and the vibe inside that keeps me coming back for more.
