116 Crown is a elegant laid back, can be romantic place. The food was good, but drinks high priced. The menu that is on their website is outdated, so you can not go by that; that was my mistake because I wanted to order a salad and beef BBQ ribs which they had neither. I was disappointed about that, but overall, it is a really cozy place to relax and chill with some friends or a partner.
