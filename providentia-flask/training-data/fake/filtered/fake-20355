This place might be good for a drink but is definitely not a good place for burgers. This is written in the yelp description though. We got two cheeseburgers for lunch and they were basically just two small steaks in a cheap bun with tomato, served with frozen French fries. Definitely not a good experience, the service wasn't very nice either.
