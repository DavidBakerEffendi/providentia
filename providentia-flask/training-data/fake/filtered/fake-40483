I've been going to East Garden for 15 years.  It has been a fixture....food is always very fresh, and it is the best deal in town.  The General Tso and Sesame Chicken are the best in the area, and the egg rolls are also the best in the area.   The proteins and vegetables are always fresh....never had a problem with "mystery meat."   They give you a very big portion of Dumplings (8 instead of 6) and they are pretty good...not the best I've ever had but definitely a tasty addition to your order.  The delivery is usually very fast...although sometimes it has taken 45 minutes to an hour on a busy weekend.  Overall, if you are thinking of ordering Chinese in the West Orange area and you are NOT ordering from East Garden...  you are either happy to pay a bit more for higher quality of food...or you are ordering from the wrong place.  Best bang for your buck in town...period.
