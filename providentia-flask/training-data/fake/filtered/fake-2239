Had a Google offer for a homespun dinner for two - included two entr√©es, an order of pancakes, and two drinks. It was probably a BAD idea to go on the day the offer was expiring. I mean I've heard it's usually a long wait, but it was PACKED! The place is not that big and tables are pretty tight. Down side was it started to rain, so waiting outside was not that pleasant. We left our cell number and they texted us when a table was available. We ended up being seated at a makeshift counter table. The chocolate shake was not too impressive, but the root beer float was nice, as was the virgin lime squash cocktail. The Grilled Heritage Pork Chops were pretty moist and tasty. It came with peach jam and buttermilk onion rings, which made the dish both sweet and savory. The Blackened Cod Fish on Macaroni and Cheese was also great. The dishes didn't look big, but was very filling! By the time our pancakes (topped with bananas) came, we were so full, we couldn't finish most of it. Service was OK. Our waitress was not very attentive, but that was understandable. She was pretty nice and did take some time to explain the deal/menu with us. All our food and drinks came at a reasonable time, so it wasn't too bad.
