Great food that taste fresh and awsome service. The soups were out of this world especially the lasagna soup WOW. the place felt like home thanx to the fireplace and comfortable setting. I have officially become a true coffee fan with there Hawaiian Coconut coffee and the Costa Rican blend cooffee. A true coffee shop with many extras....... I will deff come back and do Â recomend this place.
