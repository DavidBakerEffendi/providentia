If you want to go to a boisterous, over-priced tourist trap full of loud groups celebrating birthdays (with "happy birthday" played over the sound system *every time*, over and over and over again), then this is place for you.  I didn't realize there were places like this in NYC outside of Times Square.  For a nice Italian meal, try Da Andrea instead: for one thing, they actually have good food.
