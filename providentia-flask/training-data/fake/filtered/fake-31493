The waiters are terribly rude and seem to know nothing about the restaurants food, cocktails, or wines. They also seem to know nothing about service. After speaking with the manager on duty the other night, neither does he. The food is basically catering hall fare with a latin twist (seriously don't get the hype or good reviews here on yelp). Our meal was soooo expensive too, and we didn't even have dessert. The view is pretty, but my suggestion would be to dine at one of the better restaurants up on Vernon and then go for a post meal stroll through gantry park instead. Stay far away Blend on The Water.
