I have been waiting for an Italian restaurant to open within walking distance from my apartment. On an unsusally warm night over the winter, I took a walk and stumbled upon a sign that read Il Triangolo. So I waited patiently all winter until this restaurant opened and finally got to try it the other night. From the decor, to the homemade bread and friendly staff, including owner Mario Gigliotti, everything was incredible. Mario did all of the renovations himself, construction was his business before this restaurant, but you can tell that the food industry is truly his calling. I am only sad that soon everyone will know about this fantastic little Italian Restaurant and I will have to wait to get a seat!
