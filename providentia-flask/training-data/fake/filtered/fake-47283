Amir's Kabobs are easily the best in town.   Amir's street cart \is easy to find on Church Street and offers a large variety of kabobs that are prepared within minutes and very affordable.  Everything that I have ordered from Amir's has been fresh, cooked to order and absolutely delicious. If you're downtown for a show at the Flynn or visiting the bars and find yourself hungry; stop by Amirs Kabobs on Church Street for a quick and delicious felafel. The employees of Amirs Kabobs are always exceptional, extremely friendly and very patient.   This is a huge plus given that they are open when the bars close at 2 am.  Thank you for the amazing kabobs that you offer.
