All of the good things being said about this bakery cafe are true: it's tastefully decorated, has delicious food, has courteous staff.  HOWEVER: there is a pay site for the wireless internet in the cafe, something even the big chains got rid of years ago.  Quite frankly, with another cafe only a block away with free wireless access, Manakeesh, whose arrival we'd been anticipating for months, got a huge thumbs down.  In fact, we finished our drinks and walked up to the other cafe to work, spending twice as much there over the course of the afternoon.  I hope this will change, but for those needing a place to sit for awhile and work-- this may not be the place for you.
