We went for lunch before seeing Wicked at the Bushnell. Our meals were amazing the service was quick and friendly. We had the "almost famous" garlic bread with cheese and we split the pesto gnocchi with sun dried tomato and grilled chicken and the grilled chicken sandwich. To top off our lunch we had the "Rated X" martini! To make the lunch even better if you are going to see a show in Hartford, Salute gives you 10% off your meal!
