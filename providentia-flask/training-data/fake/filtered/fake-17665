I had been staying at the Marriott hotel down the street and decided to order some take out Saturday night. They guy who answered the phone was very polite & asked to place me on hold, being a Saturday night I assumed they were busy & had no problem waiting. I ordered a steak & cheese sandwich with sweet potato fries & he told me it would be a half hour. I showed up at 9:20pm (30min later) and the place wasn't busy at all, I think maybe 4 or 5 parties total in the place including the bar. I get back to my hotel and open up my food and it looks great but ice cold! I think my food had been ready and sat there for a good 20mins before I picked it up. If I had been told the correct time to pick up my food & it was hot or even lukewarm I would have given them another star.
