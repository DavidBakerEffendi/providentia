Fantastic Food and great customer service! I've been a regular customer at Saigon Shack pretty much since they opened and I have to say, they are always consistent with the quality of food and service. Everything that i've tried has been tasty but the vegetarian entree is actually my favorite. (and i'm not even a vegetarian!) The chili sauce that it's served with is really delicious. Even after several years, the staff still strive to make sure that it's a great experience! That's the mark of a great restaurant.
