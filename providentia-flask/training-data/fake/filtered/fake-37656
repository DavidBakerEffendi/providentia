SUBWORKS HAS THE BEST SUBS IN THIS STATE. i have been to many sub shops and nothing compares to the soft fresh varieties of bread, perfect amount of meat, and to top it all off its affordable.Not only that, the people there are so friendly and polite.They are always ready to serve a sandwich with a smile! obviously the people complaining about the service walked in there with bad intentions. i recommend this sub shop to anyone who loves a good old fashion sub. Try it yourself and you'll understand.
