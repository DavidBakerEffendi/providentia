Probably now my favorite place in chelsea to eat, great atmosphere and incredible drinks, great service minus this one bartender little stout man showed me attitude acted like I shouldve known this drink i've never heard of!!, the other workers were friendly though and the service was quick! Only my second time there definitely will return.
