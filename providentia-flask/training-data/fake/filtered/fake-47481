Not worth the wait.  Arrived at 500pm on Friday night - no one on line but we were kept waiting outside for one hour while they cleaned (?) and did something to the coal oven.  After being admitted we were taken upstairs where we waited for 45 minutes for our pizza to arrive.   Waiter was surly, the table was in an area that was warm - no fans or AC.   The pizza was good but what's the pleasure of eating it when you are experiencing restaurant abuse.   Have been going to Grimaldis for years with out-of-town visitors and it's always been inconvenient to park and the waits have always been long.  Now,  I'm happy to say I have a reason to boycott them.
