Sweetwaters just hosted the third holiday party for my business, Outdoor Gear Exchange and once again outdid themselves.  The food was out of this world (I got lots and lots of comments from my staff and guests on how amazing it all was), the bar was well staffed and stocked and the space could not have been more perfect with room for standing, sitting, and dancing.  I highly recommend Sweetwaters for your next party of 80-200.  If it's just you and a friend - their chef and kitchen staff will wow you with creative treats.
