My husband and I, with our friends, were so excited when we stumbled upon "The Kitchen Table" restaurant this evening.  The idea of eating "sustainable" food was right up our alley, and the dishes looked great.  I chose the "fish 'n chips" as the said the fish was caught in a sustainable way and I felt I could trust it would be good.  The plate was full with fish and finger potatoes.  Little did I know I had a bonus waiting for me under that golden fried breading, someone's finger nail!!!!!  I was so grossed out that I couldn't touch another bite.  When I reported it to the waitress she returned from the kitchen with the chef saying it was a bone!  Since when is a fish bone flat and rounded like the shape of the end of a finger!  No apologies were given, the chef did not come out and offer to make me something special.  I did not have to pay for MY dish, but well I didn't eat it anyway so why should I.  No offer of a free meal, nothing!  Sadly, I will not return to  that restaurant!  My husbands ravioli was pasta with very little stuffing as well!  Too bad.
