My group From Grapes to Glass did a wine crawl on Saturday afternoon in the East Village and Nai Tapas was our next to last stop. They were able to accommodate our large group and we took over the bar and tables in the window. Nai Tapas hands down is the best place in the city for tapas!! I have tried everything on the menu and it is all delicious!! I suggested that everyone try the sangria because it is insane and is always lip smacking good. They also offer an excellent selection of spanish wines, so everyone in the group had something new and delicious to try. I love the atmosphere and somehow they manage to be a great location for groups and dates. They have live flamenco dancing and the place gets super lively. So much fun. We ate and drank our lions share and all agreed that everyone would be back to Nai Tapas. Thanks to Nai Tapas!! Viva la Grape!!
