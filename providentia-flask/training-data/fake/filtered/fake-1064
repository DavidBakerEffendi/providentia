Service is totally lacking. When we tried to split our check half cash half card, he pocketed the cash and charged it all to the card. When we noticed the error, he avoided us, until we asked another waiter if we could speak to our server (funk). Without even coming to the table and asking us what the issue was or if we needed anything else, he brought over the corrected tab and told us the button on the register must've gotten stuck. If he didn't do this on purpose trying to get more money from us, he would have come over to our table first and asked what he could have done for us, instead of just claiming guilt by bringing us the fixed "error".
