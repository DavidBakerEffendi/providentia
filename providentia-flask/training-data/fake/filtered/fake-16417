Excellent! The reviews are way off! You get a ton of food for your buck and everything is delicious! Try all their appetizers like pelmini, eggplant (not babaganoush), samsa, crsipy chochberra and the lamb and palaf combo, and other signature dishes you won't regret it. Plus it's BYOB and nice ambience and music.
