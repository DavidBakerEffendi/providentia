Not what you expect from an italian place as concerns the decoration and especially not like an italian cafe bistro.....but but but the food is amazing period.100% authentic handmade fresh italian food.The bread is awesome the pasta is hitting the spot.there is no particular service cause you order at the counter and the owner has the right amount of italian "craziness" everything is so cute and authentic congrats.
