1 star seems low, but i included wait time and expectations into my review, otherwise it'd be 2.  a cheese steak is basically 3 things, bread, steak, and cheese so i judged on those 3 components.  first the bread.  it was average.  nothing special, and not toasted.  the steak.  that was well below average, and i actually spit out about 3 bites of it into my napkin. I'm the type that generally eats gristle, fat, pretty much anything, and i had to spit out a few pieces.  it's the first time i've ever had to do that with a cheese steak.  now the cheese.  it's cheese whiz.  nothing wrong with that, but between the cheeze whiz, average roll and below average meat, there's nothing at all noteworthy about this. add on top of that a 45 minute wait and rude service and this place is clearly for those that just don't know any better.  i don't know if this is better than Genos, but i've had better from dozens of places near me in north jersey
