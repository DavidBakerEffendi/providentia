I recently had my son's wedding  rehearsal dinner at Gennaros restaurant.  I just wanted to say thank  you so much to the staff at Gennaros for making this occasion so special.  First of all the food was excellent, please tell Art thank you.  He is truly a skilled chef. Secondly, the service and atmosphere could not have been better.  Everyone commented on the variety and taste of the food as well as the attentive service.  Lastly, thank you to Larry for his personal touch.  Just the fact that he continually came out to the patio to check on us, made us feel that everyone really cared. Please thank everyone for me and I hope to see you again very soon.
