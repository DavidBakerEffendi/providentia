We visit the Soup Girl at least once a week.  The soups are outstanding, and they're filling -- not like the watery chicken noodle or tomato from the can.  My favorite is the seafood chowder, which come to think of it I haven't seen for awhile.  Soup Girl -- please bring it back!  The apricot lentil and Moroccan lentil are outstanding.  Our other favorites include chicken orzo.  And DO get the rice pudding.
