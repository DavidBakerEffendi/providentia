I love John's. They have the best sandwiches EVER!!!! Plus not to mention, I know everyone that works there, they are very close friends of the family and my aunt works there. Everyone is SO nice!!! There is no better place to get a sandwich (hoagie, chicken cutlet, pork or steak) when you are in Philly!!!!!!
