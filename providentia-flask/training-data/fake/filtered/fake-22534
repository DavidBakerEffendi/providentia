Of all the Thai restaurants I've tried, this is at the top of my list. I love duck and they prepared it to perfection. The basil sauce was perfectly prepared and spiciness was just enough to cause a little sweat, but it was truly delicious, along with the "money bag" as an appetizer. Only disappointment was their refusal to serve the fried banana dessert with two ice cream flavors, when my adorable daughter requested it and they could not oblige. We will revisit this Philly gem again in the future and try their other dishes.
