Wait, Wait, then Wait some more.   Staff is completely unattentive and took 45 minutes to get and pay for an omelet (eating it took less than 5 minutes).  Food is overpriced, but not bad. Why they should go out of business 1) It took 45 minutes to order and pay for an omelet 2) Nobody wants to wait on line holding all their bags when seats are available 3) Can't order omelets to go 4) They don't sell decaf coffee or capuccino (despite what the menu says) 5) Once seated I had to get up after 10 minutes to flagged a server to take my order (The woman next to me got up and left before ordering) 6) Servers don't think to ask if you are in a rush (even after realizing you waiting 10 minutes to order) 7) Waited 10 minutes with credit card out to pay the bill, but my server was busy talking to others at the front desk.  Had to get up and ask to pay. Recommendation to Management: 1) Let people order at the front, take a number to put on their table, and then take a seat.   2) Hire one or two good food runners/bus people and a good cashier to take orders and fire your wait staff and current cashiers (they should not be in the food service industry). Recommendation to Guests: Eat before you enter the security area for Terminal A __________________________________________________­____ Details below:   8:05AM 1) Stand on line to order food to go After 5 minutes cashier finally looks up and notices me and asked what I want.  I ask for an omelet to go.  She tells me you can only get omelet to stay, so I walk away looking for something else to eat. 8:15am 2) Aribica across the hall is out of breakfast sandwiches at 8am, so I'm forced to walk back to Earl and get back on line. 8:20am 3) I get back in line and realize their are actually two lines (I didn't see any signs for this, but now realize I waited on the line to be seated the first time for no reason, open lane to right is for take out only. Wait on line for 5 minutes (even though tons of open bar space and tables) then I get seated. 8:25am 4) I get seated. 8:35am 5) After 10 minutes, I get up to find a server to place my order. Me "Can I get a server please?" "Do you need something else?" Me "Yes, I need to order".   (She gives a nice smile) "Sorry, what can I get you" Me "I'll have an omelet and decaf coffee" "We don't have Decaf coffee" Me "How about a decaf Cappuchino then" "We don't have any Decaf" Me "Oh, you are out of both?" "No, we don't carry any decaf, I'm not sure why the menu says we do" Me "Really?, fine I'll get my coffee at the show across the hall, let me have an omelet" 8:40am 6) Omelet served by a runner, my server never comes back (she is busy standing at the front counter talking to the other servers) 8:50am 7) I'm done eating and place my credit card on the table. 9:00am 8) 10 minutes later, I get up to find someone who can take my credit card so I can leave.  They send over someone other than my server who takes my credit card and I sign and leave. Waitress gets a bad tip which she probably assumes is because I must be cheap and not because of her horrible service.
