Went here for a nice casual Saturday lunch with some out of town guests.  The food was okay, but the waiter was extremely rude and condescending.  The guy obviously had no patience and was visibly annoyed that questions were asked about specific items on the menu.  We definitely did not feel welcome there and the waiter's "snobbish" attitude absolutely ruined what could have been a decent experience.  It's a shame because the food was alright and I would have considered coming back, but unfortunately the waiter killed the mood and left us all with a very bad memory.  If the food was outstanding, the bad service may be overlooked, but the poor service along with the "okay" food?...no thanks!
