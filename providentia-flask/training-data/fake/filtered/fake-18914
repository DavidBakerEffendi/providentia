What's up with this place? The write-ups were great.  Tried going there on the weekend - twice.  Twice shuttered.  Some note about trying to help them find an apartment closer to the store? Um, guys - ever think about hauling your ass out of bed a bit earlier? Millions of people commute to Manhattan everyday. I want to say I like the food - but god damn it, they have to be open first.
