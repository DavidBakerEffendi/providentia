We went here for lunch today and the service was horrible. The waitress brought out our tea and water and didn't come back to take our order. She ignored us for a good 7 minutes before I had to call her over to the table! I then asked her for hot sauce and she never came back with it so I had to ask another waitress. I was really unhappy with the service. Another waitress served us midway and brought us our check. I liked her and I wanted to give her the tip. Unfortunately the first waitress got it. The food was ok the beef and pork were too slimy and chewy. We are going to Shanghai Cuisine down the street next time.
