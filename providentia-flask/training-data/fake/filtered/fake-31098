Stopped by the Cambridge for a drink or two before dinner reservations at a restaurant down the street with my wife and myself. We were seated by the table by the window by a very pleasant Waiter. Ordered two beer from the bar and waited a little over ten minutes for the beers to be served no fault of the waiter but the bartender who proceeded to wash over ten beer glasses while we waited for our beers.After the waiter approached the bartender over the beer order the bartender glared at me and I glared at him over waiting for our beers and he then proceeded to wash some dishes and then some more beer glasses then poured our beers. The server was more than accommodating that is why I left him a big tip. The bar was full so that is why we sat at a table for a few drinks and maybe would have stayed for more drinks if not for the service of the bartender.\ We were Â at the bar about a quater to six. Sorry to say that the place lost our business tonight and the future!
