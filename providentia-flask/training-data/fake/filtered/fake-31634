I stopped into Eco Bean & Juice for my first time after hearing this place offers amazing organic coffee and juices.  I was pleased to see that these guys had a create your own menu with juices starting at $6.50.  The other juices on the menu at Eco Bean are a little more pricey due to the fact, ten ingredients go into making these juices the barista explained.  I have been an avid juicer for many years and I decided to see if I could replicate making their juices at home for a cheaper price.  It turns out that after buying everything organic like they offer the juices actually costed me more per juice after I did the break down.  I started my cleanse a week ago and will be back to see these guys.  Cleaning up my juicer was a pain.  The juices at Eco tasted Fab!  I'll be back!
