we went to this restaurant in the weekend. my wife wanted mirch masala so we place the order for that. we got something that didnot look like mirch masala so I went and told the supervisor. his responce was that they dont have mirch masala so he "ordered" mix masala and we should be ok because they are both "veg". I was shocked with his responce. I ordered goat biryani and its full of bones (common coplaint I guess) but I decided not to make a big deal about it. I would not go to this again.
