So Ive been  to mulberry for a few months now I must say it has changed drastically, they serve better breakfast items than before.  I wouldnt recommend the pancakes,they are a bit harsh after taste. the eggs and oatmeal are very good. They always have different soups weekly not in love with any of it, but their peruvian walnut is to die for. Omg what about the decour AMAZING, the place is always clean and spotless with the exception of a few baby mess. I love the QUINOA, CAULIFLOWER AND KALE SALADS. The staff is amazing also they are very helpful and very polite, but there is one young lady in particular I am absolutely inlove with , the asst manager (african american lady) Sharlene or marlene I believe she said her name was, she use to handle deliveries but most recently handles the counter and food run, ive never seen someone move the way she does, Her personality is unmatched very friendly and wierd, So one time I believe it was a delivery order gone sour, I waited almost 2hours for my food ,she called me personally, apologized and sent me a new much warmer order within 10 mins with a smiley face, a sorry note and her name free of charge, I COULDNT STAY MAD at that amazing gesture. If you go to mulberry ask for her or olivia shes AMAZING AS WELL...I open my store in a few weeks PLEASE tell them id love to have them on my team...ASAP...SHARLENE email me if you ever read this lol ...
