My FAVORITE taqueria in all of NY!  Since this spot opened in my hood, I have been a frequent (read: almost daily) visitor.  Besides the food being so delicious and reminiscent of the west coast mexican food I grew up with, you get to listen to TOO $HORT and E-40!  Great food, great vibes, great aesthetic.  And on the cheap. Can I also state everyone that works there is a major babe?? Doesn't get better.
