I'm a pilot and fly into and out of Newark fairly regularly. I live close by in Livingston.  My copilot on one of my assignments told me about this restaurant that has the most incredible karaoke as well as great food, even though it's known as a pizzeria; it's close the airport in W. Orange called Starlite.  I came for a quick dinner but wound up staying 'till midnight with the KJ. I've done karaoke in all 4 corners of the world but have never seen anything like this; speakers and tvs all over the place and a little stage also. The guy said there were 40,000 songs to choose from.  I had a great time. The dinner was a special too; I had this delicious prep of swordfish with saffron rice and perfect vegetables.  It was so pretty I took a picture even though I'm an amateur photographer; it came out great.  Anyway, go! - Dine and sing!
