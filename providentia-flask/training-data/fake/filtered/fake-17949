Three words to describe this place: Cramped! Loud! Gross! My kung pao shrimp was the worst I've ever had.... The sauce was this weird orange color and reminded me of ketchup. (Maybe they mix it with Ketchup? I dont know lol. It sure tasted that way!). Â The shrimp were squishy and looked 5 years old. I had a couple pieces and left the rest. I complained to the server and he got so mad. He curtly said "that's how they are!" and said some stuff in chinese. My bf and I were about to walk out, but I chickened out and asked for the check. Oh and DON'T drink the water here! It was yellow and there was some weird stuff in it!
