Right when you walk into this "hole in the wall" restaurant you'll realize the atmosphere is immediately unique. It's in a weird spot but DO NOT JUDGE A BOOK BY ITS COVER. Spontaneously, my boyfriend and I were both craving Italian and it was our date night. Yelp reviewers ranted about its delicious entrees. Boy were they right. The moment you open the door countless awards cover the wall between the entrance and hostess area. I had never even heard of this restaurant and honestly, it's quite pricey. From the moment we got there- right up to leaving, the whole experience was romantic, delicious, and the servers knew what they were talking about. Even the bread with olive oil and seasonings was flavorful. Everything was excellent. I ordered the Gnocchi Genovese I believe it was and my boyfriend ordered the Free Range Organic Chicken, both were fabulous. Â My dish was cooked to perfection! I didn't even need a knife to cut the meat, it was tender, like butter! With the fresh/ organic ingredients they use, it's worth EVERY penny. We will definitely be returning. If you have any doubts, just go, you won't regret it!
