I frequent this restaurant quite a bit. The food has always been good and the service exceptional. They offer special salads which are always right on the money. If you like mussels, both a red or white sauce complements these tender morsels with plenty of sauce to dip your bread into. I've had most of their veal dishes... tender, melt in your mouth. Their eggplant parm is delicious. The owner is always on hand and is pleasant and personable. If you go and you find you don't like what you ordered, tell the owner, he will be most happy to remedy the situation. Good food, nice atmosphere.
