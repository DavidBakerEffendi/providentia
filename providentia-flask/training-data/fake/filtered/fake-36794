Overpriced. Bland. Overrated.   These three words describe PJ's Pancake House best in my opinion.  You can experience much better waffles and pancakes for a fraction of the price that is charged at this store.  Furthermore, they thrive off extorting exorbitant amounts of money from Princeton students for bland food.  Save your money and your taste buds; avoid PJ's Pancake House.
