Wow, really amazing chicken and waffles! I have been craving chicken and waffles and came across this place over the weekend. There was a line out the door but it moves along quickly. I was by myself and ended up sharing a table with a very nice German family. I got the regular Al Sharpton with a chicken leg and waffle and it was the best chicken and waffles I have ever had. The waffle was firm and slightly crispy on the outside and not too sweet. The fried chicken was also nice and crispy on the outside, not too oily, and super moist inside. Drizzle some syrup over top and that salty sweet combo is oh so good. Wow. The German family got the chicken and waffles as well and loved it too. The younger one drizzled hot sauce on top but I didnt mess with perfection. The staff was also very nice and attentive. I have to go back!
