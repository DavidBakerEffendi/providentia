The food was just okay.  I expected better after waiting an hour in 23 degree weather (the place was so crowded, we were not allowed to wait inside).  I also made the mistake of reading the narrative on the menu detailing how innovative the food would be.  I have been to Mexico and the American Southwest several times and the most basic family restaurant prepared better meals than this place.  The staff was just going through the motions, like they had better things to do than working there and we were keeping them from their fun.  The manager was snippy and officious; she made no effort to be accommodating.  Summing up, the food was not BAD, but it lacked the zest and flavor one would expect from this cuisine.  There are MANY better places for me to spend my money; I won't be back here.
