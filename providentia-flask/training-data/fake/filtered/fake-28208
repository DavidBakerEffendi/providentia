This place is awesome!  I used an Amazon Local deal and went with three friends.  We absolutely loved the food.  We tried the truffle parmesan mac & cheese, the carbonara mac & cheese and the smoked gouda mac & cheese and all were out of this world.  This is not a fancy place, just a very casual order at the counter place, but you will love it too!  They also cater parties.  While we were there, the general manager gave us a free dessert of a nutella and mascarpone cheese grilled cheese sandwich - pure heaven!  The look of the place is not much to be desired, but please take a chance and try it out.  You will definitely be back!
