The food is great here. And I love the theme of different Greek food served on a stick. It's a modern take on some traditional Greek dishes (try the chef's chicken special STIX). The staff is super friendly. And they also have great coffee and yogurt bars. If you haven't been before, try their weekend brunches and order the pancake lollipops (I think that's what they're called). Pancakes on a stick... How fun! Definitely worth checking out for breakfast or dinner.
