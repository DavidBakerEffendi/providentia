Excellent food. We are very particular of Indian food and have visited most of the Indian places in NJ. We came to know of this place through our colleagues and this is already 2nd time we visited this place this week, both times for lunch. We had Chicken Karahi and tandoori mix grill which was cooked to perfection. Staff also was very friendly. Will definitely visit this place atleast once a week :)
