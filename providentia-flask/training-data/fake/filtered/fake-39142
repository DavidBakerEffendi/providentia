This place SUCKS.  Honestly, I don't understand the hype this hole is getting.  The burgers are bite-size, the fries over-seasoned, and the service sucks--plus, it's overpriced.  I've been 3 times already, and the pimple-faced douche bag behind the counter has screwed up my order twice, as well of the orders of many others.  He can barely operate a cash register.  Also, who the f-ck doesn't put lettuce and tomato on a burger? Even when you ask for it, they don't give it you b/c the customer service is an abomination.
