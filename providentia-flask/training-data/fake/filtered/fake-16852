I have been to this restaurant at least a dozen times and I think the food is amazing.  Vegetarians will find many options, as well as carnivores and pescaterians.  It is a bit loud but can be romantic at the small tables, and has several larger round tables for big groups. Eat at the bar and make a meal of the appetizers as they are the highlight of the menu and can be shared.  In the summer the Watermelon gazpacho is truly divine.  Any of the toasts (peeky toe crab, Kabochka Squash in the winter, Mushroom toast in the summer) are a great way to start the meal. The mains do not change much but are very good.  There are usually specials, but the waiter/waitress almost always will forget to tell you about these!! The wine list is great as well, featuring many wines that cannot be bought in a retail store but come directly from the winery.   The desserts I have not found to be as impressive, and I think a seasonal macaron or something would REALLY add to the meal. I  think the food here is excellent, but my biggest complaint is the staff and the reservations.  I find that even if you try and book a table at midnight exactly one month out, the tables are booked, however at 11:59 pm you cannot book the tables because this has "exceeded the restaurants date limit for reservations."   And another big complaint- i have NEVER not waited for my table, however, every time I walk into the dining room, half the tables are empty!  So basically, expect to wait at least 15 minutes for your table, although I do not know why!? In my several visits to this restaurant I have only ever had one memorable and gracious waitress- and she is now at a different Jean Georges restaurant (she was from San Francisco originally).  Besides that, every waiter has been rushed and pretty rude and I have had to ask about any specials. I would recommend this restaurant, but it is not a full 5 star experience.
