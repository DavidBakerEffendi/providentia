I've been a satisfied customer here for years at this gem in the Ironbound. Even after I have moved somewhat significantly far away, I still make numerous efforts to come back. The bartenders are friendly, attentive, and quick. The energy inside is always fun and exciting, which always makes for a much better experience; with good vibes all around and always great music to match. Depending on the time and day you show up, you're going to have a good time, and the atmosphere can be anywhere from casual to wild, but definitely always in a very good way. Regardless of whether you go on Thursdays for Burlesque night or Saturdays for an alternative dance party, or any night at all, you will truly have, as they say, a hell of a time. The decor inside is awesome; even inside the bathrooms, yes, both. The food is very good. It's not called Hell's Kitchen for nothing. The drinks are always on point and the service is always great. This is always a fun spot and even if you come alone for the first time, you certainly won't leave friendless. You'll always leave happy from this place.
