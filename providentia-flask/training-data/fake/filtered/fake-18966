Yay!  I'm a fan.   Well, the food was awesome.  So many funky options--and they all tasted terrific.  There's also non-funky items for the less adventurous.   4 stars again for the non-food related aspects.  Our server was slightly less than a jerk.  I mean, by the end I was giving exaggerated 'thank yous' every time he brought a new dish, just to see if I could get a 'you're welcome'...or even a nod.  I was not successful.
