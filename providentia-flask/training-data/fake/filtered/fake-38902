I'm originally from Mexico City and I have to say that the flavor of the the tacos in this restaurant are the closest match to eating food in Mexico City, specially my favorite Tacos al Pastor, which in an average Mexican restaurant taste like Carne Enchilada. Not to mention that they are served on freshly handmade tortillas, something that is very unique and hard to find giving a very authentic flavor to the food. A relative of mine told me about how good the tacos were at this restaurant, so I had Â to try them out. I was so surprised with the taste of the tacos that I decided to place a big order enough to feed 20 people for a holiday party at my workplace. My coworkers, predominantly Caucasian, were very impressed and happy with the food, most of them claiming that they had never tasted Mexican food like it before.
