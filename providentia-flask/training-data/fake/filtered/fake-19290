I loved the sushi. Excellent taste and presentation and well priced. We went on a Friday night and it was half full, so the ambience was nice, not too loud. Went back twice already for more sushi. The breakfast however, the service is very slow. Not the place to stop by to get yourself a cup of coffee on your way to work, as you can easily wait 20 minutes before even putting in your order. Seriously, they need more people in the am to get better service, and they need to have whomever is already there to make the orders faster.
