Haughty service in the heart of old-school cop and fireman Brooklyn. Really? Do I need to spend my hard-earned money on sometimes crispy but sometimes soggy pizza crust? In Greenwood Heights, Brooklyn, do I need to be made to feel sub-standard because I'm not so clear about which province the hops that went into my beer were grown in? Do I need to watch some people get smiles and welcomes while I wait ten minutes to order my pint? This is the type of place that makes one reconsider the one dollar per drink NYC tip. Why? For what reason? Look, I'm from New Haven, I know pizza. Good pizza takes more than a few bricks and expensive mozzarella. It takes heart and love and attitude--pleasant, positive attitude. Head somewhere else. There are so many other options.
