Zahav has a festive atmosphere, a little loud but fun.  It is a great place to go with a group but I wouldn't choose it for a romantic dinner.  My husband and I went with another couple and we decided on the tasting menu since this was our first time. It ended up being a ton of food for a reasonable price. The Turkish hummus was awesome, a total must- have. The standouts in Mezze were the fried cauliflower and Brussels sprouts.  In the Shipudim course the best dish was by far the beef cheeks, with the eggplant and braised chicken also being very good. We tried four of the desserts, all were good but my favorite was the caramelized banana.  We ordered two pitchers of the Lemonanna to go with the meal, very refreshing and not too sweet.  We all had a great time and can't wait to go back.
