My girlfriend and I just stopped by this place not expecting much but we were blown away by how good it was.  The service was spectacular but the food was even better.  I live in SF and my girlfriend lives around the corner from the restaurant in the Union Square East Village area. I love Thai and eat it all the time in SF, but my girlfriend has never been much of a fan of Thai cuisine, but she is now.  We had the pork belly, the royal trumpet mushroom coconut soup, the spring rolls, and the chicken wings.  Everything was fabulous.  The fuji apple spicy sauce that comes with wings is to die for.  Also, the Thai cocktails were delicious. My girlfriend had the lychee one and it was so yummy I kissed her more than usual just so I could get a taste.  The atmosphere is really terrific as well.
