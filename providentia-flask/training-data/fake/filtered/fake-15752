We've ordered from this place a few times and their food is hit or miss (usually hit).  Their pizza is ok but the cheese has an overwhelmingly strong taste (don't know if they just add too much Parmesan or what).  Their margherita pizza is not a true margherita pizza --- it just looked like a thinner version of their regular pizza.   We decided to dine in at their place and the restaurant, though small, is inviting.  The wait staff was great and our meals were pretty good. I especially enjoyed the coconut custard pie.  My husband and I will continue to go here or order out but we'll just stay away from their pizza.
