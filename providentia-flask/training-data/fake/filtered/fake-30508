Had the Milano Grandma slice for lunch today; 1. This was the best slice of pizza that I have ever eaten in my life. 2. was worth the wait. I travel all over the state of NJ for work and that has allowed me to eat a lot of pizza, but after the reading the list on NJ.com of the best pizza joints in NJ I made a point to stop at Tony D's Pizza for lunch on Monday...not knowing that they are closed on Monday, however, I found myself back in the area today and decided to give it a try.  I have not stopped thinking of how special that slice was, and how hard it will be for me to wait until I am back in the area.  It really made my day.  Thank You Tony for taking such pride in your food, I appreciate it.
