Well, the lemonade was good.  Other than that, you'd get better seafood out of the frozen foods aisle of your grocery store.  The prices were outrageous for rubbery shrimp and rancid cocktail sauce.  The crowning touch was the food poisoning my husband ended up with from the stone clams.  This restaurant provided us one of the worst dining experiences we've had in a long, long time.  Run screaming from this joint!
