Ok. So the server says hi (unenthusiastically). We sit, she SLAMS the utensils and napkin down on the 80's style table, we then proceed to order our appetizer, and she tells us that the kitchens closing so we need to order both right away. Â Mind you it's 9pm, they close at 10. Her attitude was awful and then clearly starts cursing us out in her Asian language. She brings these nasty uncooked dumplings, I couldn't eat it, gross, paid for the appetizer and we leave. This place SUCKS!
