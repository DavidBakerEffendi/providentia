I went to Beyoglu recently with a friend for dinner.  Neither of us were familiar with Turkish cuisine and were very happy with our meal.  We each ordered the falafel and then shared the large meze platter.  We particularly loved the hummus and the cacik and the bread was so great that we ordered more.  We finished with baklava, which was a great ending to our meal.  Beyoglu was relatively inexpensive.  I would definitely recommend it to a friend.
