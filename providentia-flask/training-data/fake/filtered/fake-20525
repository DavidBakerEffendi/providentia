The food is great, the meat were well seasoned and tender. The service was quick, the minute I sat down, someone came and helped me with putting my jacket on the back of my chair, explained to us how the restaurant works and got our order of drinks. The waiters were also quick to come by and fill our drinks and make sure that our plates weren't too full of bones. I like the fact that the chefs were coming with different kind of meats and how the spotted our green disk so quickly. Also, if we preferred something and wanted more, we can always tell someone and the person holding that certain kind of meat will come by. The salad bar had a lot of stuff but I was clueless as to what most of the dishes were, they should put up tags to inform us of what they were. It was a bit pricey but I think it was worth it. This is a great restaurant for all the meat lovers out there.
