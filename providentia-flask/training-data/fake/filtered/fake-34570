We went there after a funeral and had about 20 buffet items.....the food was below average.  The ziti sauce was the color of spaghettios and had less taste.  The boneless pork was so dry i used it to pickup spilled water on the table.  The Lamb was ok, and the chicken francaise was average but their sole, i think it was, and a bunch of catering dishes full of "stuff' were unidentifiable, and not good.  I did host so i dont know how much it was but all of my family sitting at my table will never go back.  Sorry.
