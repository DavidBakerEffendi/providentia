I am beginning to think all restaurants in Bayonne, NJ aren't good at all. There are true Italian restaurants and this is definitely not one of the them. Don't let the name fool you. I've ordered twice and both times the food was bland, and tasteless. I ordered the "Lobster Ravioli". I was told everything was home made and fresh from scratch. The lobster ravioli was nothing but a prepackaged meal. Looking at the dish, it was plated rather sloppy-ish. Cutting into the ravioli, drenched in vodka sauce that tasted like it came from a can, there was no sign of any lobster pieces. It was more of a dry mixture of bread crumbs, and some type of old bay crab seasoning. The second time I thought maybe I'll give them a another chance. I tried their "home made" signature meatball sandwich. I was told it was their best seller, so why not. I don't know what it is with their sauces but this time it tasted like spaghetti-O's. I asked to get my money back and all I was told was to not order again. Save yourself a meal and order from a true Italian restaurant. This is not the place for any pasta, or sandwiches.
