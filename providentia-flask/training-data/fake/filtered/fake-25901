I have been coming here since I was in a baby stroller. Located in South Philly's famed Little Italy  Family run since the 60's this place haven't changed. Rocky signed photos behind the bar. Sothern Italian pack the bar and wait for their name to be called by the older grandmother who's running the list. Once seated your handed a no thrills menu covered in red sauce stains.  House red wine with mussels, clams casino spicy sea food pasta and chicken Sicilian. Best Italian in the states in my Italians families opinion.
