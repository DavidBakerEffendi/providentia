This is a great spot for someone that has unconventional work hours who can only grab a bite to eat during the day time or late into the evening. The establishment is open until 4am which is a great spot to go to after bar hopping or whatever you like to do in the late evenings. The menu is great I tried the Chipotle burger and the Black bean dip which was really great. Another dish I tried that is phenomenal was the Death by Mushroom stuffed ravioli, pair that up with a nice Pinot Noir and you're set for the night. The brunch is a great bargain, one of the best I've been to. For $16 you get your choice off the brunch menu complete with 2 alcoholic drinks of your choice complete with coffee or tea. I tried the Steak Skillet and It hit the spot, I was then able to compliment my mean with some Chambord mixed with Champagne, and what's great about the drinks is that you can switch them out when you're done with your first. If you're in Astoria at anytime during the day give this place a shot, with it's modern theme, atmospheric music, friendly servers this is a place in Astoria that you need to try.
