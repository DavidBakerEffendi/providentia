I hate to be a Debbie-downer, but.... 1. 2 hour wait for soup and noodles? Ok, this is NY. 2. $12 Ramen Mango Salad the size of a small side salad? Yes it was delicious, but was expecting a little bigger portion. 3. $8 Chicken with a secret hot sauce? HOT! Absolutely amazing, but again, something more than like 6 nugget sized pieces makes it almost an appetizer 4. Not vegetarian or Rob-allergy friendly.  Leave your vegan friends out of this dining dash Is it really worth the hype? I didn't think so.  Sure we all survived on Ramen at least in one point of our lives.  But I survived just nicely making my own concoctions. The decor was a worthy attribute.  I so wanted to start climbing the pressure treated wood facade in front while waiting the 1-hour, then 15-minutes, then 30-minutes, then another 15-minutes, then another hour....be realistic with your seating times for godsakes! And another note, skip the dessert.  Obviously not their forte.
