Great Latino inspired restaurant Yerba Buena captivated me with its amazing Poquito picante cocktail then I switched to yerba Mate both excellente! As we waited for our appetizers that  the waiter suggested ceviche and then the guacamole tasty! We noticed this place getting packed quickly thank goodness the charming Enrique Iglesias looking mgr gave us a table! I loved the fact that service was numero uno we truly felt special.The maincourse arrived blackcod  and ribs order amazing! The other manager came by charming as well to make sure all is well.The bathrooms were small but stylish regardless we will return.
