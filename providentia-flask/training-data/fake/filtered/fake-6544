Felt like a big amusement park in Orlando (in a bad way..) Food was somewhat flavorful, drinks were way too small and overpriced as previously stated. But the servers were all horrible, all 25 of them, no smiles, robots, just enough eye contact to walk straight ahead so as to not get your attention, we waited 15 minutes for water refills and beer/cocktail re-orders. I waitered for many years during college years, but we never saw such a morose, pouty, self-loathing staff of servers, albeit all dressed with the same mail order catalog look. Overall, we won't go back and on the way home my wife and daughter were still hungry from the small portions so we stopped at a drive thru.
