This place used to be awesome. Then the only manager that took pride in his work left. Pay attention to your receipts because they can be "forgetfull". Honestly I am not a tough customer. I gave them a hundred chances to get it right. The last time they tried to add extra stuff to my bill. I get that everyone can have a bad day, but that just really made me mad.
