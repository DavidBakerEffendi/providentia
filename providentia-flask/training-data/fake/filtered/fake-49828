it possible to give no stars? This was the worst restaurant experience I ever had. I can't say anything for the food because we never got to eat. It was my birthday, and I recommended the restaurant thinking it would be good. For starters, we had to wait a half hour beyond our reservation time. Then, when we were seated next to an extremely loud table--think screech level--and ask the waiter if we could move, even though there was a roomful of empty tables at this point, he told us no. I then went to talk to the "person in charge" and respectfully requested that we be seated elsewhere. He said there was adequate seating in another room, which there clearly was. It was almost nine on a Sunday evening, and there were five or six empty tables. However, our waiter came over, and said the people at the next table were being "Happy" and that they were leaving soon. We told him we had decided to leave and he tried to convice us to stay because our meals were on the way. (Of course, they had completely forgotten to serve the appetizer.) We left anyway, although the chef came out and in a kind of surreal scene tried to intervene between us and the other party. I have no problem with someone being loud; I just wanted my table changed. It was very uncomfortable. I think the chef clearly cared, but it was just too late at that Â point. So for my birthday dinner I ate bread! In fairness, people at the next table who were also having a problem with the loudness of the other table, said the food was very good. I would say, if you are in a rowdy mood, you might want to try it. Otherwise, New Haven is Isfilled with wonderful Italian restaurants. Opt elsewhere.
