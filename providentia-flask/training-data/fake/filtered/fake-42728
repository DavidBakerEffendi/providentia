This 5-yr-old restaurant is a true find in delightfully quaint and funky White River Junction.  Don't be put off by its out-of-the-way strange location in an old brick freight-house on the railroad tracks.  Use your GPS.  Ignore the exterior; the interior is most attractive and pleasantly vibrant on weekend evenings. Skip, the friendly owner, welcomes you at the entrance.  He is a wine connoisseur, who has assembled an extensive and ecletic list with very good value for money.  We consulted with him on selection and were glad we did.   Drinks--before and after dinner--are excellent.  Weekend nights have an active bar scene.     The cuisine is inventive new American: unusually fine dining in these parts.   The staff is very pleasant and knowledgeable.  Unless the chef is very busy, Elixir is quite happy to adjust their menu to your desires.  Service is uniformly excellent.   Dress is 50+% jeans through country elegant, particularly on weekends.   Reservations are a good idea, even though so many people who should know about Exilir don't.   Probably 4.5*.  We shall return often.
