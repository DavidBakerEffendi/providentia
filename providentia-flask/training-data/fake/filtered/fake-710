So surprised royal got such bad reviews!!! Guess the good ones never made it... I for one LOVE the bagels!! You can tell they are fresh when you eat them. The multigrain is nice and soft which is great since most places get them a little too hard. The different cream cheese flavors are my favorite part. They're delicious!! My personal favorite? Strawberry cream cheese. Not too sweet so it's perfect. I've also had their sandwiches for lunch and they're fantastic as well. The best one is probably the royal chicken sandwich Â it has chicken, melted motz, sundries tomatos, roasted red peppers, and balsamic. I've honestly had a handful of their sandwiches and they're all great so there's no going wrong with this place. Oh and don't forget the fries!!! They're perfectly fried... Crispy on the outside soft on the inside. I'm never disappointed when I come here. They're fast so it's perfect when you're on the run. If you have time, the new owners are very friendly and would love to chat. Oh and if you're worried about the cleanliness of the place, it's been very appealing since they got there. They have also added on iced coffee, iced tea, fresh fruit, and bubble tea to the menu so try those too.
