The food itself was not bad, however, the service was not up to par. The drink menu was taken away and server left after the first drink order even though we had 2 other drink orders to make. Coffee was not even made so I didn't get mine until I was half done with my dessert. The only issue with my food was that the lamb was overcooked slightly. The rest was good. I had the lamb loin chop and I would recommend the dish if you go there.
