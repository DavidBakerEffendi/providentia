WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT - We were 4 people - 2 ordered zuppe de pesce and what they had was pasta and mussels (for $28) - 1 ordered ravioli and there were about 6 ravioli on the plate (for about $20).  When these absurdly small portions were brought to the owner's attention - he ran away from the table never to be seen again.  Seems as if he was hiding in the kitchen.  No apologies were given, no accommodation was given, and definitely, no please come back again soon.  For a new restaurant that should be looking to accommodate their new customers, this was a great disappointment and we strongly suggest that you pass on this one.   Gloria & Howard
