My girlfriend and I had heard some good things, and some not so great things, but at $55 for a tasting menu, we were optimistic. The restaurant is very industrial (in a good way) and spacious -- the latter especially hard to find on the LES. We opted for an extra course at $16 (we split one) of pork collar and sunchokes three ways, only to be able to discern sunchokes two ways. The food overall was inventive but missed the mark and unimpressive. Particuarly because whoever is cooking has a shot palate -- everything was way oversalted. We love salt with the best of them, but this was to the point that some dishes were difficult to eat (e.g. the beef and the pork were cooked really nicely and rare, but the salt made it for naught.) Also, you're going to be there for a while. The service is very slow, to the point that you notice it. It's wasn't leisurely, it was irritatingly slow. We were done with our bottle of wine by the second course. At the end of the day, we were glad we tried it. Also, note that the price will sneak up you, especially if you do wine and/or cocktails. They're doing some neat things that need a little/lot of tweaking. We always ask each other at the end of the meal if we would come back, and both our answers were a clear "no."
