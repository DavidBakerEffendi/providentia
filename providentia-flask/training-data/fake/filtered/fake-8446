Fantastic comfort food.  The mac n cheese is incredible as an appetizer!  The Thanksgiving Dinner is probably my favorite entrée but the others I have had are very well done.  The atmosphere is 70s shabby chic and very inviting.  My only criticism would be that some dining areas are a little crammed but overall this facility is a fun Center City restaurant.  Very enjoyable.
