They blonde untrained liar at the front and her manager said it was a 45-60 minute wait. After 75 minutes they said we were next. After 90 minutes they said there were 4 tables ahead of us. My kids were crying. The blonde at the front and the manager did not understand that lying to customers about the number of diners ahead of them and misjudging the wait by more than an hour was grossly unprofessional. The guests leaving who had dined said the kitchen mixed up the food, and that even after sending back the wrong dishes once the food was cold and poor. Mario, you should be embarrassed as your other restaurants are magnificent.
