I was ecstatic to learn that Honest Tom's delivers! I'm always looking for new ways to get tasty food brought to the doorstep of my West Philly home. So far, their delivery service has been fast and dependable. I've only had the tacos, but I've had all of them: The fish tacos are the best - flavorful and succulent - but they don't have them every day. Unlike the other tacos, they come with pineapple chunks and a delicious, creamy sauce. My second favorite is the chicken - I often find chicken tacos dry, but these were not. The sweet potato tacos are incredibly delicious, but not very filling. The beef tacos have been uneven - sometimes they are tough, but they are always flavorful. The black bean tacos were a bit bland to me, but I imagine a vegetarian might appreciate them more. I also have to mention their hot sauce: it is fantastic! The price a bit high, but not exorbitant. I'm a small person, but two tacos leaves me hungry. I generally need 3-4 to get the job done!
