Everybody said pizza here was good, should have stuck with that ! Was there for dinner on a saturday evening and ordered one of their pasta dishes. Worst ever ! The pasta was overcooked, served in a pool of water with meat on top. One star is for wife's dish which was tolerable, but has seen better.
