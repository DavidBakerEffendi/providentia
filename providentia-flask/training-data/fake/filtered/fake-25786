I discovered this place purely by accident -- I'd intended to dine at one of the pubs in the area, forgetting how crowded and noisy they'd be on a Saturday evening -- and I was delighted. The ambience is old-fashioned, like a 1960s diner, with fluorescent lighting and wide, roomy booths. The hot open turkey platter, while arranged a little oddly -- the two slices of bread overlapped, leaving some of the turkey by itself -- was fine, with a good gravy; and they accommodated me when I asked for whole-wheat instead of white. It came with a salad and a side order (I chose the kasha varnishkas, which was first-rate). There's also a "pickle bar" with which to start the meal! And the prices are quite reasonable.
