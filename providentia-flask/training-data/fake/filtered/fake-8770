WORST SERVICE EVER. FALSE ADVERTISING SAYING THEY ARE "KID FRIENDLY" - MY WAITER THIS EVENING (WHO WAS COKED OUT AND SO HYPER MY 7 YEAR OLD SON EVEN ASKED WHAT WAS WRONG WITH HIM) SAID TO ME, "YEAH, I WILL GIVE THE KID ANY SIDES THAT JUST KEEP THEM QUIET AND NOT RUN AROUND!" nice comment. then he proceeds to never bring our entree out, forgot my sons sushi, gave ME my kids drinks to bring back to our table once i asked to revise our order. horrible horrible + the food was not as good as it was years ago. the manager - who was even more rude - ended up comping our bill after i addressed him ever so aggressively - right fully so but still i will NEVER GO BACK and as a 22+ year publicist, will make it my business to let EVERYONE I KNOW about this place and the phoney people are eating and paying crazy money for.
