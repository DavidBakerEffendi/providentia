I like food. I like to save money. I like to eat food and save money at the same time. See where I'm going with this? Â Vanessa's is my go-to place for a cheap lunch in downtown Manhattan. Like so cheap you could pay with the spare change in your pockets or the money you made selling your spit. I usually get the #1 which is your typical dumpling cooked pretty satisfactorily. I usually supplement with a #20 which is the onion pancake with roast pork in it. Delicious. Or maybe its just the taste of money being saved. This stuff is fried though so I wouldn't eat it everyday (or I would, but I don't recommend it). Also the seating here is VERY limited so expect to eat with a stranger sitting next to you....or on you?
