Dear Patrick M. I am the asian woman sitting at the bar as a CUSTOMER. I do not work at Post Office and never have. I am friends with the owners and I was helping out as a good friend. I myself have been in the restaurant and bar buisiness for a very long time. So please make sure next time before you post you know what you are talking about.
