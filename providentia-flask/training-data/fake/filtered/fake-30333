How does my girlfriend's  neighborhood fave go from three stars to two?  Terrible service.  If it's not the audacity of not being credit card convenient in the 21st century then it was definitely last night's I don't care attitude from our waitress.  Service was erratic and sloppy.  How do the tables to my left and right receive their entrees before us if they entered the restaurant afterwards?   What restaurant delivers one entree and not the other.  If we entered as a couple chances are we wanted to eat together.  This should not be lost on you.  Ever. Finally I left a .70 tip.  I thought you deserved less, but I was so furious that I left the change for my convenience.
