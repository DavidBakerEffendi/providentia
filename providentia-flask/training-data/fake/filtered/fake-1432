The service was so horrible that I had to open a Yelp account! I ordered chaufa, 1/2 of a chicken, sweet plantains, and yuca frita; everything lacked flavor, it was disgusting. The shrimp chaufa had no flavor, no color, and the shrimps were tiny and dry! The 1/2 of  chicken had a bad odor, I went back and told them is an old chicken and that it stinks! The 2nd chicken I got was the same, they need to get fresh meat! The yuca frita tasted like the Goya frozen ones you get at the frozen section in a supermarket and on top of that  no salt not even a pinch, and the sweet plantains tasted more like old re-used oil than a sweet taste. Everything went to the garbage! This place changed so much throughout the years, they went from a nice open booklet menu to a paper brochure menu, from a full house to an empty place. Everything makes sense now! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY! You're better off going to Hiro's across the street or Cheveres in Passaic. Worst $25 spent in Santa Barbara!
