Anyone who has previously eaten here...I'm Sorry....First off, the seafood looks like something found when cleaning out the bottom of your trash can and tastes like a rubber garden hose. The rest of the food barely deserves the one star. Most Important!!!! As I was standing up to leave....I shit you not...a GD MF cockroach fell off the light above my table and ran off the side to the floor. Do not eat this food....my girlfriend is puking it up as we speak and I am about to follow suit.
