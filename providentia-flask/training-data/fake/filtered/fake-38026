Without a doubt this is one of my favorite places for Brunch.  You can pretty much get the brunch menu 7 days per week, and at all hours.   Best items on the menu?   Mac and cheese, but be sure to order it with the mushrooms... the smaller side dish is not nearly as flavorful.   Even if you don't care for mushrooms, they are large enough that you can easily take them out.   It's also a huge portion, so order, eat, and take the rest home.  Another favorite is the French Toast Biscuits.... I mean, WOW!!! great buttermilk biscuits prepared like french toast and strawberries piled sky high.   If there are 4 of you dining, get one order and share. Another reason to love this place is the owner.  Jacob is ALWAYS there and he takes care of his guests.  Because the place is so popular you can sometimes wait a good long time for a table.  They use a texting system to let you know when your table is ready so you don't have to stand there waiting.  One time when the estimated wait time was way off, Jacob bought my friends and I a round of drinks for the inconvenience.  He earned our loyalty for life with that gesture.  We had a chance to talk with him for a bit as well... He's super nice and listened intently as we are not big fans of the Tap sparkling wine they serve (in all honesty, this place is not a place to enjoy fine wines).   We aren't big beer or pickle eaters, but trust me this place has all the right stuff to keep us coming back again and again. Tip:  Go before 11:30am on weekends if you want to avoid a 1-2 hour wait for your table.
