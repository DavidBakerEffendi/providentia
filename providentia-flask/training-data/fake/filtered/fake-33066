My company ordered a dozen bagels from them and two small containers of cream cheese.  I used to go to this place over a year ago but stopped because the service was so horrible.  Everybody is so rude, always frowning.  You have to ask for a paper bag or a couple of napkins.  When I went to pick up the order, nothing had changed.  Still the same rude people.  When I got back to the office, we called and asked how come there was no utensils in the bag.  They said they don't provide anything, only the bagels.  Not sure what we were supposed to use to cut the bagels and spread the cream cheese.  The worst part though was when one of the employees found a rubber band in the cream cheese....scallion to be precise.  It's a shame because they do make decent bagels but the horrible service and the dirty environment is too much.  I was always against this place but now the whole building where I work is also staying away from it.  Go across the highway.....same food but much better service and cleaner.
