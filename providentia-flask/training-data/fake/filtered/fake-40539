they are definitely still working out the kinks at this place. i went on a thursday at 8 pm with my wife and a friend. while it wasn't too crowded, it still took 1 hr for them to sit our party of 3. we were ok with this but then it took 1.5 hrs just to get our food. the burgetrs definitely good and the staff was very apologetic (offered us a free round and a desert) but i still would not recommend anyone go on a busy night. they dont take reservations and you can't put your name on the list until your entire party has arrived.
