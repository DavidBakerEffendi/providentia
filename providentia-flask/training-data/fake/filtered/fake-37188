I think it shld get 3.5 stars. Â Ambience is 4 stars, but the food is just ok, about 3 stars. I ate there twice, most recently this week. The spinach dip was great, but my main dish was bland, as it was the 1st time I went. Also the pomegranate martini tasted like it was from a mix & not from actual pomegranate juice. It got me tipsy, but I'd expect more for the price.
