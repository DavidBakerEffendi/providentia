By far the BEST pizza I have ever had in my life. The hype is true, it's amazing pizza. Its obvious the Dom loves to make pizza, he is sweet and so careful in his pizza preparation. He drizzles the most delicious olive oil over every pie topped with shreds of freshly cut basil. Perfection! The round pizzas are super thin, crispy, but the center is so soft and cheesy. The square pizza is awesome too, but a little too thick for me. It's up to what you prefer. Whatever you order, you can't go wrong at Di Fara. Be sure to bring a book or magazine to read while you wait the 1-2 hours for your food. And be sure you're waiting in the right line. I got there and assumed I was in a line to order but I was actually just standing behind people who already ordered but were lingering around to watch Dom make pizza. No joke, I seriously think about this pizza at least once a week. So damn good.
