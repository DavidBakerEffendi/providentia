You can't go wrong at CM's.  The food is great in both the restaurant and the bar, as are the drinks.  You cannot go wrong with their Caesar Salad or Nachos (or a burger or chicken sandwich) followed by a fresh Espresso Martini for desert!  The staff will always do their best to make sure you have an enjoyable visit, and are shockingly good at remembering people's names.   CM's is a community place, where people are like family and they care about their patrons.  This shows through in the big hello you get when you walk in, in the locally sourced food and drink, and especially at their Thanksgiving and Christmas events.
