The daily special is always something to look forward to. Each meal is delicious consistently. The service provided is exceptional and the faces there are friendly and inviting, as is the atmosphere of the store and you always feel welcomed.  A pleasure to dine in and I recommend that others reading this pay a visit.  It's fantastic.  Also on a side note, they do cater.
