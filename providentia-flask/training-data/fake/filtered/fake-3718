If you are a KofiLuvr like myself, you will love this place and their incredible prices. The coffee and espresso drinks are outstanding and the pastries are great as well. They have the most amazing and delicious 3 leches. The other cake flavors I do not recommend as they are not as good, but I believe they are getting better. Always clean, friendly, and with a decent crowd. Try it, you will love it...
