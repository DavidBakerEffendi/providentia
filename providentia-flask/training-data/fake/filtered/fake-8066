Odeon is authentically good: food is seriously good; great wines by the glass; ambiance is Paris were it  between the Hudson and East rivers.  Odeon serves one of the best French onion soups you can find here (we have tried many) ....rivals La luncheonette on 10th Ave.  Hangar steak is memorable ....and try the pudding.  Most fun: eat at the bar to sample various wines to pair with your meal.
