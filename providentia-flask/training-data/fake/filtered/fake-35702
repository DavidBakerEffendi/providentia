Mama Rosa is a real neighborhood restaurant where you can eat comfort food in a relaxed, family atmosphere. You will actually find neighbors talking here like in a neighborhood bar. Â Their pasta dishes are very good--like your mother would have made if she was Italian. I recommend the Chicken Soprano. Like most of their pasta dishes it is big enough to share with a friend and have leftovers. We have ordered a lot of takeout from them and have never been disappointed. My only complaint is that the pizza is good, but not great. Anyone going here for a gourmet experience may be disappointed but if you are looking for huge portions of comfort food, this is the place to go
