How I love Eataly! I visited for my first time this past week. Although, you would need several days to truly experience all that is Eataly. This place is huge and has anything and everything that is Italian. I was there with my niece who introduced me to the concept of yelp so this is my first review. I am from the Philadelphia area and it reminds me of a Di Bruno Bros but 20 times bigger.
