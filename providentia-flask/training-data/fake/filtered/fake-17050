I love Latin American cuisine so when I saw a GroupOn for dinner for 2 for this place I had to buy it. I came here with my boyfriend and may I say I was very disappointed with this place. We were greeted and showed to our table, the waiter was very friendly and attentive at all times. We sat down and ordered a drink and our food. I ordered a piña colada and got a thin glass of this watery alcoholic mess that tasted like pineapple juice with cheap rum...automatic star deduction. Sorry but I have to question your roots if you can't make a piña colada being a Latin American restaurant. My boyfriend ordered a Mojito, which he described as "Meh. ok". While sipping our so called "drinks" and waiting for our food,  a fly started flying around us, my boyfriend killed it because it just wouldn't leave our side. After that one was killed, another fly came around, so annoying and gross!...there goes another star out the window. Finally the food came out after about 20 minutes (which is not bad). I ordered "Bistec de Palomilla" which is grilled Sirloin Steak with caramelized onions accompanied with white rice and black beans. The meat was Delicious! I really loved it, very nicely seasoned and cooked to perfection! However, the white rice was wet, mushy and sticky (kinda like sushi rice) and the black beans were very  bland and watery which didn't help the wet rice...there goes the third star. My boyfriend also loved his Salmon but he disliked his yellow rice which I tried and was absolutely awful!  So the 2 stars I gave are one for the waiter and the other for my steak.  No, I would not recommend this place nor will I come back. Very disappointing.
