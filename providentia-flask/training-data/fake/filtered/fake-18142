I brought friends to Tony Da Caneca to experience Portuguese cuisine. I had not been to the restaurant in a few years. Unfortunately it has changed but not for the better. The dining room was extremely loud. The food was so-so and the service was not what it used to be. I will not be recommending Tony Da Caneca and will not be going back.
