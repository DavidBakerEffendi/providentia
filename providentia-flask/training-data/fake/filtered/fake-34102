Disappointed with the service... I have been to this restaurant around 5 times, & on the 2 occasions I had the server Claudio I was very disappointed with his service & attitude. He rushed us to order & was no help with recommendations. His reply was "Everything is good." Then when it came time for our bill we had to wait more than a half an hour. We went on a Monday night, they weren't that busy. Not sure I will be returning
