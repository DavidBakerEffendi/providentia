Possibly the worst customer service in South Orange. Waited over an hour for a table; after we finally got a table it took almost two hours to get our food order to our table. Two of the three dishes ordered were delivered wrong! In that time, we only received one round of drinks at our table. When we complained to the owners they told us "if we want you to wait 2 hours, you will." There was no apology whatsoever. One of the ladies at our table was harassed by the daughter of the owner for complaining. Even if her complaint was full of swears directed at the horribly underpar service, it was not necessary to kick her out. I would never recommend this place.
