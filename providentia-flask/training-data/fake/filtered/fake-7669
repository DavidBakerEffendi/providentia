What a catastrophe this place is. I read all these reviews and wonder to myself if they dined at the same establishment I did. For starters, the restaurant is poorly designed for comfort, even the cramped places in NYC don't allow for waiters and guest to constantly be bumping into you. The food is a concoction of bad creativity, lack of focus, with a garnish of un-originality. Its almost like Steven Gonzalez Â just copied and pasted what he learned at Osteria, and then ruined it. The ingredients are not fresh, and everything seems to be over or under seasoned. I found the service to be rushed, and had a SEVERE lack of knowledge about cheese and charcuterie presentations, in addition to a horrible understanding of wine and food pairing ( considering they call them selves a "food and wine bar") Every pizza we got came out a little burnt because this is what they THINK is the proper way to serve it, although in Italy, this pizza would be laughed at. My advice, go to Osteria for good, well priced, fresh Italian food. Day 1
