The best restaurant in bklyn!!! The food and service were  above and beyond my expectations! Warm and cozy atmosphere, amazing food, and the staff goes above and beyond for you! As relaxed as the atmosphere is, the staff makes sure u are entertained,& feel at home! Friendly and attentive  as as can be.I frequent restaurants,& i am itaian, so i am a bit of a critic.Giovannis gets 5 stars from me. Cant wait to go back and have my parmesian fritters. They are nothing u have ever experienced!!! Very affordable as well. Must try Giovannis  your next night out!
