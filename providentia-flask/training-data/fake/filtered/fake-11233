Im definitely mixed about this place.  There's some wonderful food and wine, great shopping to be had, but it is generally uncomfortably crowded, and totally overpriced.  A friend of mine is from Italy, and was excited to see this open, but once he went to shop, he felt he was being gouged.  I thought it was just me.
