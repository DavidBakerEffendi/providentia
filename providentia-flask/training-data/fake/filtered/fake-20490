Went with a couple friends at 9:15 in the middle of the week. It was still lively until we left after 11 - great lively atmosphere. They have a lot of variety on their menu we chose to split among us and they also serve great drinks (alcoholic and non). Good place to go for a fun vibe and good food. Do get hummus for your table - delicious.
