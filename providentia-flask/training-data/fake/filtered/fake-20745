I was looking forward to try authentic french food. Since French are known for being snob in eating, I expected to be blown away by 4.5 stars average from more than 500 yelper. However, the food is good but not as amazing as I expected from 4.5 star. 4/5 for overall experience and nice service. Food is good but not excellent. I was expected to be blown away by flavor and aroma by French cusine. My first French dining experience, my gf said it is better than others French restaurant she've been to. I guess I have to try other French restaurant to calibrate my expectation to the taste of French cusine to see if it is true 4.5. Order: pear w/ cheese for appertizer, lamb chop for main course.
