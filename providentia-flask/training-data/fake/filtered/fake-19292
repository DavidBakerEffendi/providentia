I really wanted to love this place!  its a block from me and its a byob!  i do love their sashimi salad but their specialty rolls are too expensive for what you get.  $8 for dougie style...only 6 pieces and doesnt look any bigger or better than the regular spicy tuna...except for the apple bits.  i spent almost $20 for a salad and a 6 piece roll...i was still hungry after and thought about ordering a pizza.  i was in a week earlier and tried their $15 specialty roll and again...not much for the price.  i wonder if they compared their portion/price to other sushi places in the city.  i really hope they stick around but with so many great sushi byos in the city they really need to make a good impression from the beginning...and so far im not too impressed...and i really really want them to stay!!  hope dasiwa reads these comments and make a few changes.  would be greatly appreciated!  one last thing...the wait staff is very friendly and attentive.
