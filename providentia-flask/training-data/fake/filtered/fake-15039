We went here on a weekend evening.  made reservations ahead of time for 2 via Open Table and were seated easily when we arrived.  The service was fine, nothing bad nothing great.  It is a bit annoying when the server feels they have to go through every section of the menu but then again I can only assume this is what they have been trained to do with guests.  Our server also seemed a bit dejected when we decided not to have oysters.  Alas we ordered a crab soup and a wasabi tuna app to start.  The soup was nothing beyond Campbell's veggie soup with a chunk of crab added on top.  The tuna was good but needed a bit of salt or something.  For the main dishes I ordered the grilled scallops and my partner order the seafood bouillon.  My scallops were pure salt.  I am not sure if it was the tapenade on the scallops or if the chef just forgot how many times they had been salted but they were SALTY. The cauliflower gratin was lovely.  My partner's seafood soup was less than exciting and she kept asking for flavor or something.  Overall the restaurant it quite nice inside and could be a good place to go back for happy hour and an app perhaps.  Dinner however was overpriced and not so great.  I thought about those salty scallops for days and not in a good way.
