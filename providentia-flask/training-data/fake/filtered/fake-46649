Ignore the overall good rating for this restaurant. I'm sure most of the glowing reviews were written before the new staff arrived. This used to be one of my favorite restaurants; however, after my experience last Sunday evening I will NEVER return to this place. Perhaps there is new 'management'. The hostess was, at best, indifferent. It was the manager who really took the cake though. Outright rude and hostile in response to some very minor seating requests. Keep in mind, it was a Sunday evening crowd  -- not really the busiest night of the week. It was so terrible we just left. The whole incident had such a negative impact on our evening. I would advise anyone else to go to any of the thousands of other restaurants where the staff actually want you there. I have never been so disgusted with a restaurant experience in my life  -- and I mean that. There are many other highly rated restaurants to choose from in this area: GOBO, Shalezeh, Tiramisu, Toloache to name a few. Happy dining!
