The only reason it gets a single star is cause the delivery was quick- 2 tiny pies (there large), tasted like store bought dough, prego sauce with chease slapped on it - for almost 30 bucks plus tip.... even my wouldn't smell it. if they are reall italian, someone is rolling over in there grave, absolutely worst pizza for taste and value I have ever had.... in addition if you wanted to cancel your delivery on a plain pie they tell you the can't- why because they don't deliver same pie as they serve out the resteraunt.
