OK....I have read every review and only ONE mentions the Margherita Pizza.  Incredible.  I have been trying to find THE BEST PIZZA EVER for 25 years.  I have been all over Boston, NYC, SF, FL, you name it.  I even went to Osteria down the street, which was ranked the #1 pizzza in the US by a Food Network guy.  Just OK.  But NOTHING compares to the perfection that can be found at Cafe Lift.  It is the perfect pizza.  Perfect size (for one hungry dude), perfect texture (crispy, thin crust), perfect sauce (an incredibly mild and delicious tomato sauce combined with -literally- "the secret sauce" sauce---PESTO).  And the cheese is the buffalo type.  Not too much cheese, not too little.  The result is EXACTLY what I have been looking for during the last 25 painful years.  I now come here for lunch EVERY time I'm in Philly and don't even bother looking at the specials or the rest of the menu.  I'm re-reading some of my post and what is funny is that words can't describe just how good this pizza is.  It is the Jessica Alba of pizza. You know you are in love when you can't stop thinking about the object of your affection- even when you are apart for long lengths of time!   I wish I felt this way about my wife.
