Can only ive this place 2/5 because of how bad it sucks on Mondays. The bartender (who only works on mondays, thank god) is an insufferable c*nt- and I have only used that word to describe about five women ever. I'm amazed that she has a bartending career at all. She's very friendly to men but is extremely nasty to most girls that come in there- I've seen her ignore some, give an attitude to others and give others dirty looks. I've heard that she also bartends at the new Kennett, and other bars in the city. I don't get it, I've been going to bars for ten years and never met a more unpleasant bartender. Thank goodness the last two weeks either the nice, pleasant blonde was on, or the bar manager, so her horrible attitude didn't ruin the whole night. I really don't understand how she has a job there, she's absolutely miserable.
