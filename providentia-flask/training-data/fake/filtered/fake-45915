We have eaten here many times. The wait staff are all family and very helpful and friendly. Service is prompt. Food is always delicious, my husband has tried almost all the lamb dishes. Â Ignore the reviews from people who tend to review an ethnic restaurant then admit they are not fans or even knowledgeable about the food. Go to Ouzo's! You will love it! Good for both meat eaters and vegetarians.
