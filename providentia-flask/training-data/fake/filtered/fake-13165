Ok.... people need to understand that Louis' Lunch is truly one of a kind.  I have been eating here since I was 6.  There is nowhere else where you can order a burger that has been cooked on the same equipment that is a 100 years old.  You can taste caramelized goodness from 1912 on your burger!!  People are just heated because they had to wait so long and because of all the hype.  Its all about the meat!!- no avocado, no aioli, no mushrooms, bacon, creme fraiche, kimchi, blue cheese, goat cheese, or bbq sauce OR ANY of that ridiculous crap.  Just beautiful ground beef with tomatoes and onions.  Amazing in it simplicity!  If you didnt like it than go back to Red Robin or whatever and shut up!
