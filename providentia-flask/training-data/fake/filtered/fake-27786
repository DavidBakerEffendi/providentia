What can i say about this Restaurant. There is too much. Â The food is amazing especially the curry puffs for appetizers. It's unique to this restaurant. You won't find it anywhere. The Penang curry is a regular order for me. The staff is very kind and the chefs have been cooking for 20 plus years. Lots of experience equates to tasty food. They have cooked in NYC union city and now bringing their talent to clifton Thai. Too bad I'm moving away. I'll definitely go out of my way to stop by here and there.
