Our pizza was floppy and wet instead of crispy the way I like it.  One pizza I can excuse due to the fresh tomato toppings, but the other pizza had no such excuse.   Staff was friendly, but the way they presented the bill was tacky. There was no check folder or tray or anything...just a tiny register receipt with a clothespin clamped on it.
