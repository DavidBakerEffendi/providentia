For me, the best ramen in the city.  My favorite is the classic.  Akamaru modern (spicy version in red bowl) is great as well.  The other nice thing is that a lot of the other menu items are delish too. if you want something besides noodles or, if like me, your boyfriend says, Ippudo noodles again???  And then he gets chicken wings and ribs while you have your second (fourth?) bowl of noodles in 10 days...
