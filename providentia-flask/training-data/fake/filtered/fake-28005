Please save yourself the trouble and don't eat at this restaurant. The services was horrible, food bland, and worst of all it made me sick the next day. Also, if you go at night bring a flashlight or use your cell phone to view the menu. It is impossible to read otherwise. Â It was absurd how poorly lit the place is at night. I guess that is one way of covering up bad food.
