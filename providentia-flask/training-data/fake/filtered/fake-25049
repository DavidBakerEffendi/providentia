We hosted my sister's bridal shower on September 21st, WOW was it a great time! The staff is absolutely amazing! Zach (The manager) & Sam (our awesome waitress) truly went above & beyond what was ever expected! The ambiance is amazing & food was delicious! We had so much fun with our fake mustaches & sombreros...if you are looking to do a fiesta, this is the spot!! We can't wait to visit Philly again & chow down at La Calaca Feliz!!!!
