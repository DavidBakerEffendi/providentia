I used to like this store and shopped there for years.  I purchased an item that i barely used because it had a negative effect on me.  The store REFUSED to refund me, not even trying to make any compensation at all.  There goes $20 down the drain.  I WILL NEVER SHOP AT THIS STORE AGAIN!!!!!! Is this their idea of customer service?  The company who makes the product said I had to take it back from where I purchased it.  This was the 1st time that I ever returned an item back to that store.  I'd rather go to Whole Foods even though they are pricey.  I once used to refer this store to friends........NEVER AGAIN!!!!!
