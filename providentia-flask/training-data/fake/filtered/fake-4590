If you are human, you will recognize it as some of the best pizza in the state (and by extension the world). When I tasted this pizza, it literally brought tears to my eyes, because it was so good and reminiscent of Old World Pizza in Princeton before they shut.  I have tried in vain for two years to find a tomato pie that was even close to Old World, but I think this might have it beaten.   This newly opened pizzeria is an undiscovered jewel.  If this place were Zagat rated, I would be surprised if  it didn't receive at least 26/30.  I think I will go back tomorrow and have some more. Yes, it is that good.
