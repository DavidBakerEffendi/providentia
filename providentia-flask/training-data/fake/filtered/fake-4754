This is not Indian food at all. Wether this is Vermont Â or NY it dosen't matter. If you can't cook then don't open for business. The owner is very racists. He dosen't like anyone who is not Indian. And he talks about other families, etc, behind their backs. We are in America not India. Stop being racists.
