We took some out of town guests here for the weekend lunch buffet after reading all the positive reviews here on yelp but were underwhelmed by the experience. There was very little variety and items on the buffet were just average. There was no sambhar on the buffet line for over 20 minutes so we ended up eating most of our meals with just the chutneys. On a positive note the chutneys and the dessert (kheer) were pretty good. Their redeeming quality is definitely the variety of dosas they make available with the buffet and their rava dosa was actually melt in your mouth delicious. However, given the wide array of restaurants in the area that offer south indian food we will likely not return.
