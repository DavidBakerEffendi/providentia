VERY OVER-RATED is all I can say. The service was exceptionally slow, the tables and chairs tiny tiny, the overall clenliness of the place was average to poor, and the most important part, the food mediocre at best. the toast was a soggy, what they call potato hash browns were mushy and runny. The best part of the meal is the corn they serve with mayonaise that is delicious. Figures the most delicious thing they serve will put your cholesteral levels through the roof and kill you. Â OVERALL, NOTHING SPECIAL, IF THIS PLACE WAS ON YOUR LIST, TAKE IT OFF.. You won't be missing anything.
