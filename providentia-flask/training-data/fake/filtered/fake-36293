Yakitori Boy gets my vote as an excellent dining establishment, and also my vote as a unique and impressive place to entertain clients for an evening of casual dining . Being in close proximity to the PA Convention Center, and other points of interest in Center City Philadelphia, it is conveniently tucked behind the busier streets and would classify as a "hidden gem." With its exquisite cuisine of perfectly portioned tapas and well-stocked bar, it wasn't long before I started to bring a few business casual meetings to this great little restaurant. The bar is staffed by very friendly and very capable men and women. On Â one occasion, Ruben, our very personable and very entertaining bartender, delivered a wonderful experience which helped me completely win over my clients and close a few important deals. Yakitori Boy offers private party rooms where I had entertained my clients. The private setting and ambiance, along with the perfectly portioned tapas and various Japanese menu items that encourage sharing and sampling, all had a great impact on the goal I had set out to meet with my clients that evening. Each private room has different rates and different capacities (from 6 to 20 people), but during the week from Sunday to Thursday the rooms are half-priced. Along with the great bar, great food, and excellent service (praises to Ruben and the staff), I am able to mix business with pleasure, and perhaps next time even indulge in some karaoke to celebrate my little victories.
