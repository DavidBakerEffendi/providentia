My fiance grew up riding his bike to Pete's for a sandwich in the summer, so he's been a fan for years.  I later moved to Nutley and after hearing much about it finally got to give it a try- we got sandwiches to go and ate them on the train on the way to a Yankees game along with our beers in a bag :)   Cajun turkey for us both, on fresh baked Portuguese rolls (that in and of themselves are simply perfection), with provolone - we differ on the peppers... roasted red for me and hot peppers for him.  The sandwich was indeed all it was cracked up to be.  For fresh simple ingredients, great taste, and friendly service it can't be beat.
