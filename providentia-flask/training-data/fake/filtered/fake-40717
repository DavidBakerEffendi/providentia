Went with family for breakfast dinner.  Felt like pork roll egg cheese on English muffin.  It was smothered in cheese which made it difficult to eat.  This place has always been a favorite of mine since my teenage years.  Now with many other diners in the area this is not my first choice but definitely still convenient.
