This place is cool because it is a slice of history; they found portions of the Underground Railroad in it.  It's typically very busy around dinner hours (which speaks for itself, I suppose) and has a nice, warm, cozy environment.  There is also a bar, which is for some people a plus.  I've gotten the chicken fajitas, which are yummy, but they don't knock my socks off.  Everyone else I dine with there have the same feelings about their food.  I'd go another time, but it's not my first choice.
