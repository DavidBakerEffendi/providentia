The ribs are fantastic and the collard greens are amazing! I wish they did offer sauce on the side for those who want it (I'm very familiar with the Texas style of BBQ and know they frown upon that, but us Yanks like our sauce) but aside from that, no complaints. It's BYOB, so come prepared with a six pack.
