I'm an Iris "regular" and I love this place but lately the food has just gotten much worse. The old menu was much better, especially for dinner but brunch as well. My favorite eggs and toast has even gotten worse if that's even possible. The dinner use to be amazing and incredible tasty and worth the hike to the restaurant and the hike in the price. However, the new menu (not sure if they also have a new chef and owner) but the food has sadly been a let down. The portion sizes are also small and the meal is overpriced. Please bring back the old menu or the old chef !! Â It will be worth the hike. Signed. Old regular
