This place rocks.  All the food is fresh and delicious!  You really can't beat the prices either...especially in Park Slope! Servers are fast, friendly and attentive! Only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that I always leave smelling like Thai food because of the open kitchen.  It's kind of a bummer if you're heading out after...if not ...no big deal.  It doesn't stop me from coming here.
