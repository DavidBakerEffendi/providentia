Went on Monday night, busy with a good crowd, but not too crowded.  Reminds me of a want to be Harrods Food Hall.  Food delicious, building beautiful,  presentation lovely, staff needs training. Staff did not seem particularly able to communicate the process of getting a table or a seat at the bar.  One person told us to sit anywhere, other said we had to wait 30 minutes, only to have space open up in 2 minutes.  Once seated it took the waitress 13 minutes to greet us with no apology.  We order at the fish station and food quickly arrived.  Delicious!  Chef behind the counter was eating continuously.  Grilling meat and other items and then eating with his fingers, then going back to cooking.  I don't think Mario would be very happy.
