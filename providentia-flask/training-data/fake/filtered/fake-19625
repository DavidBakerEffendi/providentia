While not the most enticing establishment aesthetically, Sakura has character (from the decorations in its bathroom, to its head sushi chef), and most definitely does not disappoint the taste buds! Go for the lunch special (two rolls and a salad). Choose the spicy tuna roll, spicy salmon hand roll with avocado, and throw the ginger dressing on your salad!
