i go to this place frequently with my 4 year old child we happily wait our alloted time (usually around 30 mins) last sunday we go around 4.30pm, wait our alloted time, about 25 mins, and i start to realize a bunch of people who came in after us are being seated.  i ask the hostess and she says, oh yea, we seat people with kids in the back so you have to wait for that to open up. uh, excuse me? i am calling bullshit in any place that doesnt take reservations, and then makes you wait even longer than they specify because they hate kids.  no thanks, that is incredibly rude and short sighted.  i hate kids too but for real, that place is a zoo, so are we disrupting the fining quiet dining experience?  they shout out everytime anyone walks anywhere in the place.  puhlease.
