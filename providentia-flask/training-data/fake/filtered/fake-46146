NYC Harley Davidson is the worst experience I ever had while buying a vehicle,they didn't call me that bike is ready ,then when I picked it up after I called them ,the engine light went on half way home and no break lights this is after they said they inspected the bike ,it was picked up Monday I received no calls all week so I called on Friday and they found more trouble with bike so its a bike that I own but I can't ride for the 2nd week now
