I live in the neighborhood and I have been here now four times.  3 out of the 4 I got major attitude.  The place has zero neighborly warmth, I guess because they get such a steady stream of one time visiting tourists.  The coffee is mediocre, the baked eggs are a ridiculous excuse for breakfast eggs.  Avocado on bread is delicious, but that's because...avocado on bread is delicious.  Cute uniforms for the waitresses is about the only positive thing here, but they aren't even that cute.  And the manager is always tense and unpleasant--clearly there is some kind of negative vibe here emanating from the owner.  There are tons of great places in the area--go to those!  I certainly will.
