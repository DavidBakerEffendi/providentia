Absolutely amazing!!!!!! While visiting in the area with my friends we went to La Coste√±ita. This is an example of simple, fresh, Mexican dining. The extremely polite staff took our orders and made several suggestions, then the cook got right to work making our food exactly to order. When complete, the meal was brought to our table. Extremely large portions were brought to us very hot and fresh. An incredible value if looking for informal and causal Mexican dining experience. Great Food, Service, Atmosphere, Value
