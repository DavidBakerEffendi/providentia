We ordered delivery from this restaurant last night and it was some of the worst food I've ever ordered.  We got Tom Yum Soup, Roti Canai, Thai Chicken Curry, Beef & Broccoli and Singapore Rice Noodles with Shrimp.  The Tom Yum Sup was tasteless, the Roti was super greasy and the sauce was sticky and sweet and clearly contained corn starch, the Beef and Broccoli was in a light brown tasteless sauce, the Chicken Curry was spicy but not tasty and the noodles and shrimp were totally dry.  The food was so awful we threw it all in the trash.  It was seriously that bad.  I can't remember the last time I had such a bad dinner.
