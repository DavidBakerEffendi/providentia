every time i come back to vermont to visit my family, we always take a stop at leunigs bistro. i love the resteraunt for its decor, and attractive waiters and waitresses. Just kidding - but this is one of many observations most can't help but notice. the food is almost always excellent, but occasionally i'll hear a complaint from my father because of its smallish quantity. the food is almost always designed in art form, whether you're ordering breakfast, elk medallions, or a simple angus steak burger. as mentioned, the decor is absolutely fabulous. my favorite part of the resteraunt to sit is probably at the right just as you enter the resteraunt. usually this is the only spot that is not all too crowded. the only downside to leunigs is the amount of time it sometimes takes to have your appetizers, and entrees served. the resteraunt is almost always crowded. 5/5.
