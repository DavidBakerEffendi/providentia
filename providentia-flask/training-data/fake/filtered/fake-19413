Yes, it's good coffee, with a buy-10-get-1-free card.  Cute place, great location. BUT. There's a huge BUT, guys. Strawberry Blonde Pony Tail dude- talk about poor service.  I mean, you've just refinanced your mortgage so that you could afford those 10 coffees (but lykeomg you get a free one so it's worth it?...) and then Strawberry Blonde Pony Tail dude treats you like you're at the DMV.  With one sustained glare into the floor, he manages to make the whole bougie coffee-buying experience a purgatory where hopes and dreams go to die.  If you want some friendly service, or maybe just a vapid smile, try publicly executing a few small fluffy animals... The odds of experiencing smiles from a stranger will be resoundingly greater.
