I was NOT on board with the whole fancy pizza thing-- UNTIL I CAME TO PAULIE GEE'S! This place is the best. Amazing pizza, quality service. And Paulie himself is Â almost always there, talking to the guests, being friendly, funny and welcoming. My only complaint is that I wish I lived closer to it!
