BURGERS!!!! This may be the only place in New York where a Vegan and a carnivore can both be satisfied at the same restaurant. Living in Chelsea this is my go-to spot for just Lunch, Dinner, Dates, casual work meetings. Out of the four Westvilles, this is better than the West and East Village ones in terms of decor and space, but is a little less nice than the TriBeCa location. Keep the wait in mind! If you're planning to eat during peak hours, expect a long wait. They do not do reservations.
