Excellent presentation, though I was still hungry when we left. Everything was delicious, service lacked, but on a date, I would rather talk to her, than the waiter anyway.  However, when I did want something, everyone was busy doing something else.  Overall the food was delicious, and the presentation was quite impressive.  The overuse of the cilantro pesto as a plate garnish was noticed.
