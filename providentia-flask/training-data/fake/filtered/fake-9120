Ive become very interested in New York's Spanish food recently...I lived in Spain for a few years, and now that I am back, I miss the traditional Spanish food that I enjoyed there. That said, I cannot give Boqueria more than 3 stars because it doesnt really hit me as authentic. Its more of a hip place than a true tapas restuarant. I hope thats clear, and its not meant as a bad thing to Boqueria whose food is really good. Everything was great: service, food, atmosphere, it just seems too modern to really capture a Spanish tapas effect. Anyway, I would try this place again, but I don't think that its the best Spanish food in New York.
