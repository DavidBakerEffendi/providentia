I'm NOT vegan AND I LOVED this place!!! I've heard of the raw food and the vegan/vegetarian movement but I am not a 100% believer in the whole lifestyle. That being said, my wife wanted to try some of their stuff out because her friends couldn't stop talking about the place. The moment I walked into the cafe, I was BLOWN AWAY! Seriously, the whole environment is artistically beautiful and the energy was out of this world. On top of that, I tried their "I AM POWERFUL" blend and their BIG WAC and HOLY S**T...it was absolutely delicious. The truth is, I can't really describe how good everything was because you probably won't believe me UNTIL you experience everything for yourself. I hope they make this into a franchise one day. We need more positive businesses that are more health conscious. OVERALL I give this place a 10 out of 10. You should go see it for yourself and taste the experience :) My wife and I are loyal customers now. Hope to see you there one day! Pros: FRIENDLY Staff, EXCELLENT FOOD, GREAT atmosphere Cons: none that I can think of.
