Awesome. I have been interested since I heard this spot would be opening, so of course I took my husband there ASAP. It was just what I expected. Had some great root beer on tap, delicious pickles, and great food. I had the biscuit sandwich with fried chicken and mushroom gravy and cheese grits. Fabulous. Highly recommended. Nice servers and chill atmosphere.
