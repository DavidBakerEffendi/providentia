Amazing Coffee!  Everything is organic.  This place has an amazing juice & smoothie bar.  Hands down to these guys.  Finally, someone in Burlington is getting it right.  NO other coffee shop uses organic milk.  I had a wheat grass shot along with the coconut maple Latte!  Angela made me the best coconut latte I have ever had.  This was a first to me.   Who new having lattes without dairy could be so tasty?
