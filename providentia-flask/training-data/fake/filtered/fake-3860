What is there not to love about Buvette!!  Great wine, wonderful appetizers, and if you're in the mood some lovely small dishes for dinner (note: this isn't a full on restaurant as I normally think of it; more small plates for a light dinner).  The workers (and owner) are absolutely delightful - they must have been trained by someone at the four season - and always make my experience quite pleasant.   I'm happy that they've become so popular - they deserve to be successful, but that also means that I'll only show up now on odd nights when the crowds don't descend on the place.   PS - try breakfast...  Really yummy!
