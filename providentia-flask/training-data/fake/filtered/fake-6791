It was hard finding this place since it's located in a small alley just off South street, but don't give up looking because it's worth the travel. Stepping inside the restaurant is like  jumping right into Morocco. The decor is amazing and the wait staff is very friendly. My friends and I went here for a night out and were generally pleased with the experience. The food was fantastic and the music was enchanting. The belly dancing show in the middle of the meal was a welcome treat. They served us a traditional Moroccan dinner complete with the washing of hands before dinner and without utensils (though I think they're available on request).   My main criticism of Marrakesh is the way they handled the bill. We were not given much of a choice in terms of dinner--essentially either the chicken or lamb dishes. In other words, it was only prix fixe when we went and they did not let us know beforehand what the price was going to be or how they calculate the bill (ended up being about $32/person for a three course meal). Granted, we could've asked how much they would charge, I feel like they should have communicated the special limited menu and the cost better. Plus, they didn't take our credit cards! I can't remember if the waiter said the system was broken or that as a general policy they don' accept credit cards, but make sure you bring cash if you go.   Also, the volume of the music was sporadic--a whisper sometimes and at other times deafening which distracted a bit from the eating experience. Overall, I highly recommend going to this place. Great food and fun, but know what you're ordering and ask questions of your waiter.
