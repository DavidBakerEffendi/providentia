Love love love this place! My friends and I go here probably once a week. The happy hour specials are great (half price margaritas and nachos) and the food is always fantastic! My usual go to is a burrito, but I recently tried the enchiladas, and I have to say my usual might be changing! The tacos are great too (especially if you catch them on dollar taco night) I could eat the chorizo and potato tacos until I explode. The draft list is pretty reasonable too, and they have a nice selection of bottles. The recent expansion of the dining area, and the additional of take out bottles really solidifies Loco Pez as a place I recommend to everyone who hasn't been there before!
