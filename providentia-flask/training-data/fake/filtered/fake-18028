We have eaten at Devil's Alley in the past.  We did not expect much in the way of "atmosphere", but the service was sssssslow, REALLY slow.  The coffee, muffins, eggs and potatos were lukewarm or stone cold.  They did not know how to make a side-car, and when informed of the recipe, announced they had no brandy, nor cognac.  This place was so-so the last time we went ... we will not make the mistake again and return ... EVER!!!! If I could give it a negative five stars, I would!  This joint is HORRIBLE!!!!!
