We stopped here for a late lunch on our way to western NY based on the reviews on TripAdvisor and weren't disappointed. We both ate their Cream of Mushroom soup special. This was so good and filling, we were almost sorry we ordered sandwiches. Their cups are really bowls you get elsewhere. This soup was full of mushrooms and absolutely delicious! We had decided to each order a different sandwich and switch a half of each. So each had a half of a Reuben and a half of a BLT. Both were fantastic despite being full from the soup. What a perfect choice of a place to stop for lunch. Too bad we were too full for dessert.
