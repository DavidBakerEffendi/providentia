The only reason why i am even giving it 1 star is because of the wait staff and the entertainer that makes it worth the wait and overpriced meals. I waited for over an hour with reservations while the owner let in a table of 6 who just walked in. The man singing was nice enough to make someone aware that my friend and i were waiting way too long just to be seated. The food is good, but way too overpriced for the most part. The owner is unpleasant to most and just sits by the bar socializing with his "posse". if i were to ever give this place my business again, it would only be because the musical entertainment. I would rather just make my own meal at home.
