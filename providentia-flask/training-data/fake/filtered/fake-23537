I've become a regular visitor since this place opened in December 2013. The chef, Haegeen, makes healthy, delicate, yet very filling dishes. I love the bibimbap's with so many different vegetables, each fresh tasting, and prepared just for me! The rice is a kind of sticky wildrice that I've never had before. Dol sut style (stone bowl) is really hot, and a treat if you sit down there to eat. It's a warm spot of light, quirky decorations, and understated 60's jazz under the JMZ. I don't eat wheat and Haegeen always remembers this and bring out the gluten free soysauce when order mung bean pancakes with pork (which are not on the regular menu, but are fantastic). This place is reasonably priced enough to come often. Take-out is carefully prepared and presented in little white tote bags. Eating-in is somehow very un-brooklyn and refreshing. (Maybe it's the cheery-ness of the staff) Although they offer many meat options this place understand the value of vegetables and Ms. Kim's soup is so flavorful, warming, and healthy. I am not a vegetarian, but I often chose to skip the meat here, not because it's not delicious, but because the dishes are fabulous without. My favorite new place in the neighborhood.
