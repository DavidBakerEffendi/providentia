In terms of aesthetics, they did a fantastic job; bar looks great, tables, even the toilet had been decorated, which was a riot. Hooks on the underside of the bar for handbags would be a very welcome addition. As for their tacos- the flavours in the fillings were great, but the tortillas were very difficult to roll. Their texture seems as though they had been microwaved and unfortunately, in the time it took to consume one taco, the second tortilla was impossible to eat- very tough and chewy. I ended up jettisoning it in favor of making a kind of loaded nacho. If the tortilla issue is taken care of, I'd definitely go again, as the tongue and pork were both very good.
