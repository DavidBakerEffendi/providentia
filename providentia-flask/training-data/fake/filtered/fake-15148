Recommended through a friend who works nearby, had an excellent meal for a restaurant that opened just over a week ago. The carnitas tacos are beyond delicious, for a native californian to say such a thing is a rather big compliment. They are made with pork belly and bits of crunchy chicharron, not your typical street style taco, dressed up but they pull it off! We also tried the artichoke terrine, kale caesar salad and spicy honey chicken wings, all wonderful. Definitely recommended!!!!
