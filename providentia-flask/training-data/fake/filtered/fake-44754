Oh my gosh, the food and ambience was amazing!!! I had the lechon, my friend had some kind of ceviche, and oxtail, and a caramel dessert, I have never been to a restaurant where every single meal was consistently good, it was so delicious!!! I had lost my reservation because my cab was so slow due to some movie shooting in my hood and so we sat at the bar, actually it was more fun there, the drinks are flowing the clientele are nice and friendly, the nice bartender Ion gave me and my friend free drinks, the drinks are so good,I tasted my buddy's picante, she had a couple, it was nice and spicy, I also had dessert wine, muscabo? it was delicious and tasted  my friend's port, then the other bartender forgettng his name but he was nice too gave us these really  strong margaritas-it was good! Sure pays to be nice and friendly and to smile a lot, because we were treated so well. But to be fair they treat everyone with a lot of hospitality, they will even cut your food for you and help you with your jacket, its so nice, very hospitable touch you dont get in a lot of places that are high end. By the way I witnessed NYC men at their worst. My friend went to the bathroom and overheard this guy arranging a second dinner the same night while he was on a date!!! the guy beside us, was commenting on my friend's boots and lacy black stockings and exchanged cards with her before the girlfriend came back from the bathroom, wow, how horrible are the men, never saw it before my very own eyes, It was funny and horrendous at the same time. It is in a perfect location, there are numerous bars you can get to nearby to end the night, great food, great manager Gio, great host, great bartenders Ion and forgetting the otehr one's name, the bartenders are the best!!!!Will definitely com back it was amazing!!!
