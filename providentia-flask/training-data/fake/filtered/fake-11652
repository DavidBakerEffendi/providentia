Let me start off by saying this is a great edition to Center City  Philadelphia, located right on jewelers row. I stopped in here for lunch one day and was greeted by the waiter who was very warm and kind I was given the option to any open table to sit at. I ordered the lamb kabob very flavorful tender juicy with a side of salad and brown rice all a delicious package.  I was greeted by the chef herself straight from Afghanistan so you know the food is authentic, she asked how my food was and if I needed anything else. The entire layout is very nice and clean, offering pick up and delivery . And all menu items are no higher than $19. Which I find very affordable, if your in the area please give this restaurant a try, you won't be disappointed.  :)
