Seriously,  how am I reviewer #3 when almost everyone I know goes here? Two words:  Pizza Rustica.  Trenton style thin crust pizza with fresh garlic, sausage, mushrooms, tomatoes and cheese.  This is my kids' favorite pizza.  And this is the only way that they will eat mushrooms.  Other menu items are excellent as well, but we always get the large square rustica.
