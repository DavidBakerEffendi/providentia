We loved the decor at Porteño: clean and tasteful with lots of exposed (and recycled!) wooden beams and butchers block tables.  The food and service were both amazing.  A large selection of Argentinian wines (we opted for a beautiful Mendoza white on the hot day we visited), and a surprising variety of cuisine with really interesting Argentinian inspired flavor combinations.  Lamb ragout over spinach gnocchi! Fantastic!!
