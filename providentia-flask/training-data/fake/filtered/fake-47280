The chickens here are absolutely fantastic (crispy skin, tender, moist, flavorful meat) , but what's particularly worth noting is that I think these folks are doing some of the best sandwiches in the city right now.  Between their great bread, incredibly fresh ingredients and great construction, you just can't go wrong, but the BBQ chicken sandwich is masterpiece of tender chicken, tangy & spicy sauce and cool veggies to add some crunch. Collard greens, mac and cheese, and beet & feta salad are all fantastic sides.  Don't know where they get their ingredients from but they're always very very fresh.
