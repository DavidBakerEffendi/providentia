I really wanted to like this place but I left feeling very unimpressed. For a diner it was very slow and our food took a while- even though we ordered wraps. Not sure how much the kitchen could improve this but my wrap was very soggy and fell apart. It was a chicken pesto wrap. It tasted good but didn't blow me away.
