Went here with a friend who lives nearby, cute place, typical west village setup, tight to move around, with great seating out front.  Shared a bottle of montepulciano that was great.  Avocado bufalo salad to start, tasted great.  Had the special - osso bucco with pesto risotto and spinach, tasted great and was actually a great value too.  Only issue was waitress, who was very inattentive, we had to ask her to open our bottle of wine b/c she forgot, she never thought to pour the wine, and after getting served our meals we had to track her down to ask for silverware. If we had another waitress it would likely be a 5!
