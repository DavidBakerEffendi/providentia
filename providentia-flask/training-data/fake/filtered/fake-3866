I want to give a 3.5 rating.  Pretty great cupcakes, but I suppose I went in expecting something exceptional and they were just good (though very moist which I love).  I did try a new flavor (banana split) which felt a little unbalanced with everything they were trying to incorporate into the cupcake.  I also tried cookie dough which was pretty much just vanilla tasting with some cookie dough chunks on top.  Maybe next time I should stick with oreo or red velvet, two standards.
