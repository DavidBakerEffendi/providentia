The quality of the meat is really good in the pho.  I enjoyed the crudo I started with as well, but it was less exciting.  Location is not the easiest to get to - I suppose it's pretty "hipster" and adds to that vibe, but we had an enjoyable meal.  Love the BYOB vibe - very small and I can appreciate the we do a few things well sentiment - and they do.  The pho itself was a little on the bland side unless you add the herbs they give you and some sriracha, but the quality of ingredients was great.  They were out of bahn mi when we went, so we'd like to return to try that out next time, I'd go again, but not often - it's too far and I've been told there are other good pho places to check out.
