Went her for lunch and ordered a sandwich. I happily took it back to work to eat and I was completely disgusted by it. The sandwich was freezing cold and not to mention soggy enough that the bread melted off! I read the other reviews of this place and it doesn't sound too terrible but this is by far the worst sandwich experience I've had. No one wants a frozen soggy sandwich.
