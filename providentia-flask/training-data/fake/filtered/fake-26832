I like that I can get a very generously sized taco at a reasonable price here.  Sometimes I don't want an enormous ten dollar burrito a la Chipotle.  The lines can get long but the people working here are pretty quick so it's never too long a wait.  Honestly I'd say you get what you pay for, that is, it's not the best taco all around but it's the best bang for your buck taco that I've found so far in New York.  I usually get a chicken taco and it's almost like a small burrito minus the rice. It can get pretty crowded inside, and when I can't find a seat I've been tempted to take my food over to Union Square to eat.  However I haven't done so yet cause the tacos can get quuuiiite messy--but that's only because they pack it so full with all the ingredients. There's always a generous helping of tasty chicken in my taco.
