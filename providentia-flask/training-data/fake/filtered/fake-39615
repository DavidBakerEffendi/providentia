The Crispy Watercress Salad!! It's the only food item offered at any NYC restaurant that I will go wildly out of my way for. Rain, subway delays, freezing cold: doesn't matter. Every time I eat here when I leave the restaurant I am actively planning on when and how to return. Fantastically tasty and the rest of the menu is just as delicious.
