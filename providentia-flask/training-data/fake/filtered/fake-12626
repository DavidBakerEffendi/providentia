It's amazing that they can get away with calling this a restaurant. the "newark" is mostly chips and bread (mmmm, carbs) with some sausage hiding inside somewhere. There is some other "dish" that turns out to be fried spam with no accompaniment. chips were ok but on the soggy side, sausage sandwich came with ZERO on it -- just sausage and bread. The fancy list of offal shown online turned out, in person, to be reduced to only one or two non-inspiring items on the real, in-person menu. So they are doing a bait and switch. Fette Sau can require some waiting, and maneuvering for tables, but it is worth it. Although St Anselm's is just over the street, don't settle for it!
