I've been to this location at least 3 times...1st time it was a Monday around 4pm that is when you will probably get the best service not too busy but Wednesday through Sunday FORGET IT. EVERY time the service has been poor! The hostess or the group of them never friendly, let you know there is about a 2 hour wait minimally on a Wednesday (stay far away) and turns the other way as if take it or leave it. To order a drink at that bar is just a complete joke because it gets so packed you are trying to get their attention as you just cram yourself where ever you can fit standing around because there isn't a sit in the house. The decor is clean and very loungey feel which is ok but the staff is rigid, cold, and a bunch of snots! Not interested in bothering to come back since those who frequent the place believe they are in an upscale NY lounge.
