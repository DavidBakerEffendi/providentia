Tables are too small 2 adults and a small child and had to put the bread basket on the chair to make room for water. Ordered chicken milanese with angel hair pasta with vodka sauce, was served chicken francese with overcooked pasta and watered down flavorless vodka sauce, i returned the wrong chicken dish for the right one and was served a flavorless deep fried piece of chicken that should of been served at a wendys restaurant not an italian restaurant. If you have taste buds and want real italian food go to casa di napoli in union city, or if your looking for Â halfway decent italian food go to bensi on route 3 west. Wasting a cheat meal day on this place was a waste of my saturday.
