The food is overpriced and watered down to suit those that would live in the area or toward the hotel's clientele (needless to say, the Latin American food I grew up with had richer and more savory flavors, and I've had more authentic food in inexpensive areas).   Besides this, my party and I were having a good time until the staff decided to kick us out to serve a larger party that required combining two tables.  The place was not very busy by any means (another set of tables could have been used) and there wasn't a line outside when we left. Even before that incident, I felt rushed by a particular female waitstaff that tried to take our plates even before most of the party had finished eating.  One of my family members even felt that the waitstaff were giving us dirty looks to make us leave the table.  All in all, I felt very unappreciated as a customer and was given the vibe that I didn't belong there.  That said, I will take my service elsewhere.
