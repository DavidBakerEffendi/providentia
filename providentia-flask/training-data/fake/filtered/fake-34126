We went to the restaurant for the first time for our son's 21st birthday party.  What a wonderful restaurant!  We had about 20 people and all the food was excellent!  Everyone received the courses at the same time and every item was fresh, hot and delicious!  They have a great menu choice and prices were very reasonable.  The staff was excellent and very attentive to our needs.  They seemed to greet everyone when they arrived and thanked everyone when we were leaving for the night.  Thank you for a great night and a birthday that our son will remember.
