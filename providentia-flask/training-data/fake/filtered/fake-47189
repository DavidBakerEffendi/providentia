One of the best spots I found. The atmosphere here is real laid back. You could smoke hookah indoors (when it's too cold outside) or outside on a patio where they have a wide open space to enjoy a nights summer breeze. A great place to bring a date or chill with friends. You could spend hours here, and the staff is really friendly.
