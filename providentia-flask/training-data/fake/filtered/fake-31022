Fantastic place to have lunch for some great Gourmet Burgers and a nice cold glass of IPA. My favorite is the Half Bacon burger Which is my go to with some cajun Fries!! But today... I went with the Mushroom Caps which is an appetizer  for my meal which I promise you will not disappoint!! Steve, ERRR I mean, Jason( just kidding Jason!!)  our server was attentive without being intrusive and he just adds to the ambience of Prime 16 with its modern Rustic interior. So, whether your hanging with your boys for a couple of Beers or Out to a work Lunch .. You should definitely Check it out.
