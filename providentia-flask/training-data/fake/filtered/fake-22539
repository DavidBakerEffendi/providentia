Ordered a chicken cheesesteak, fries, and turkey sub for delivery. The cheesesteak was dry and they forgot some of the ingredients (lettuce, tomato, onion and mayo). The turkey sub was not good and the fries were cold and they didn't include ketchup. Definitely will not order via delivery ever again.
