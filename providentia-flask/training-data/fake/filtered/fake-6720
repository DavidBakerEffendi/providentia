One of the top three resteraunts in Forte Green. The food is consistantly good, the service is always extremely friendly, and the place is aways packed with local folks. What I love about Olea is it combines the best of Brooklyn with an authentic European ambience but never borders on kitchy. Â The Lentil Salad is a stand out item. I tend to think the appetizers are stronger than the entrees but the food has always been great. The drinks are really delicious and it doesn't hurt that the regular night-time bartender is a stone cold fox. It's a great place for a date or to round up the local brood for a laid back night of good wine, tastey food, great live music, and a comfortable never rushed experience.
