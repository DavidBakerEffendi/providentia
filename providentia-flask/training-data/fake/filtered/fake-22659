Highly recommended when it is nice out in the spring, summer & fall months. Sit outside- the patio has a great atmosphere! My friend and I went for dinner and drinks and got a pitcher of something fruity - I don't remember what it was called, but there was red wine, limoncello & blueberries in it. That was ok but very lemon-y. For dinner, I ordered the 3 meatballs, my friend ordered a side salad, and then we split a pasta with crab meat and spicy sauce (I believe there was chile in it). The meatballs were good, but there are raisins in them and I wasn't a huge fan of that. As for the pasta - SO GOOD. It was small though (especially for $19), so if you're going to split it with someone, make sure to get something else as well. But seriously.... that pasta was well worth the price.
