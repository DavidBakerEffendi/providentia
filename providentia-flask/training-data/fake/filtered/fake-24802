Abysmal service. Went here on a Saturday night. Hostess told us there'd be a 20-30 minute wait. After 60 minutes (though that's not all) we left. While waiting for a table, I ventured to the bar to order a drink. I ordered and it never came. The bartender simply went off and did other things. After checking with the hostess about the wait (at this point, we were all pretty unimpressed), we were told that there was just ONE party ahead of us. The straw that broke the camel's back was when she proceeded to seat TWO parties ahead of us. Very disorganized operation. Can say nothing about the food, but with service this poor, you may never get (or want) to taste it. Definitely not the old Ludwig's from a few year's ago. I live outside the city, so getting Â to South Street is quite a hike. I don't think I'll give Brauhaus Schmitz a second chance.
