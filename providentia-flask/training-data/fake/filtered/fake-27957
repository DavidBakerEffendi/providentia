Can't wait to go back to Meal because there are so many more things I want to try from the menu.  Outstanding selection for Starters and Salads. Enjoyed the delicious Mac and Cheese and Arugula salad. This alone could of been my meal but I was sharing. I decided for my main course on a small portion of Hangar Steak. Perfectly prepared. Great service and high quality food.  I must return.
