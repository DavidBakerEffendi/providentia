Seriously, I have never had such amazing lasagna in my life.  I dream about it.  Sure, there is always a wait, and they don't accept credit cards, but the bar next door is nice enough to wait at, and there is an ATM right across Bleeker.  Also the dishes are so reasonably priced, you almost feel silly putting it on your card. Definitely give it a try!
