We went for all-you-can-eat sushi ($25 for dinner), but we all very disappointed! Not really all-you-can-eat. They provide a different menu for all-you-can-eat. Anything looking good (picture) on the regular menu is not on the all-you-can-eat menu. For example, you cannot have softshell crab, or eel. Also, the sashimi pieces are really small, about 1/2 or 1/3 of the normal size. One can easily eat 20 pieces of sahimi. You may say it is all-you-can-eat, just order more. But with their slow service, you just want to finish, get up and leave. There is a much better option for sushi buffet place, Sushi Palace on Route 27. For a lower price, you can have softshell crab roll, eel sashimi, along with everything else. This is really a Partially-You-Can-Eat (the cheaper ones) place....
