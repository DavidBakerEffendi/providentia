One star for there food but the attitude in this place greatly outweighs the food by a long shot. I had to wait over 10 minutes just  to put my order in with the snotty people at the hot food area. They don't ask if you want small large or how much, they throw the food on your plate and then throw the serving utensil back in the dish like your annoying them.  As I was waiting i asked a worker if someone worked in that area and attitude said not today, person who works in the area not in today. Ok wouldn't you organize internally to have someone else work that spot? They don't give you your food at this point. You have to wait for it in line Till your name is called. Meantime your on a line, and if John or Joe in line calls out and says hey what about me and calls the staff by there nameyou will get taken care of but for the rest of the people who gets gauged with there attitude and pricing you will wait. My company of 120 people is new to this area of Manhattan. Never never again will I put up with there snotty attitude and with no apologies. This is certainly not the way I conduct my business.   Cipriani, you should really be ashamed.
