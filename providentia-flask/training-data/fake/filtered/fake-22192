WORST FOOD EVER!!! I ordered a pizza here and the cheese wasn't melted at all. The toppings were just laid on top of the pizza not cooked into it... I asked to have the pizza cooked longer and the younger people that worked there rolled their eyes, like it was going to kill them or something. I said please don't give me attitude I am just a customer who wants their food cooked. Then the man behind the counter spit onto my pizza and handed it back says okay I think its done!!!! I WILL NEVER RETURN AGAIN!! People in this resturant and in the city of Bayonne have an attitude problem.
