Although the selection is not as large as the new Calandras Bakery in Caldwell. Sorrentos is fairly priced with a great staff and excellent food. The deli is amazing, and the pastries are always fresh and tasty! Try the chocolate donuts everyone should know what a real donut is suppose to taste like not the crap at dunkin donuts
