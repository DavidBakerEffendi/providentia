I first saw this place on the food network and enjoyed the quirky approach to food. Our daughter lives around the corner, so we went for dinner last night, after during our visit from the Philadelphia suburbs. The prelims were amazing, the deviled eggs were like nothing I had ever had before; Fois Gras donut- words fail me. The crunch of the fresh dough filled with a surprisingly complex mix of both texture and flavor and a sprinkle of powdered sugar does not begin to do justice to this brain child of a demented imagination. I LOVE IT! And then the Nachos. Nacho expectation of what you ordered, more like a chinese dumpling or pot sticker with the cheese and other flavors cascading around your mouth, again words do not do justice to the preparation or presentation. Main course: fish and chips. I'm sorry, anyone who would label this dish as fish and chips would tell that the Cossacks were horsemen. The skate with a mohawk of roe and shoulder wrap of spiced onion served on a bed of pomme frits with a sauce extrordinaire was a delight to the eye and the palate. The Chinese Chop took a moment to warm up to, but the taste with the rice puffs and black beans and chinese sausage did not disappoint. For dessert we did the shot of Irish Whiskey with pickle brine chaser. Do not knock until you have tried it. As with everything else on the menu it requires an act of faith. I wish it was closer to home so i could take more friends there for the food and the ambiance. It was warm, so we ate inside, but there is al fresco dining in the backyard. With this exotic take on food and a wonderful wait staff, I plan to return. I heard that Brooklyn Rocks and Do or Dine is one of the many reasons why! I shall return, and it will take a lot less time that it did for MacArthur.
