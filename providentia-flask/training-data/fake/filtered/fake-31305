The price for lunch and dinner are comparable to other Chinese buffet restaurants, but I find the food at some of the other restaurants better.  They didn't have snow crab legs on the buffet which I thought was usual Chinese buffet fare but not here.  The wait to get in on a Saturday night was horrific!  Granted I expected a wait, but not the chaotic experience I had.  The doorway was completely blocked, and many people didn't know to get a number from the hostess first so they just waited thinking it was a line until some other customer informed them of the process.  Bottom line, I've had better.
