Place was trendy and waiter was nice. We ordered lobster sandwich and halfway through we found a dead fly between the bread n lobster. We showed the waiter and her brought the slice back to the kitchen. When we got the bill they still charged us for that sandwich! Disappointed at our first visit and will never return.
