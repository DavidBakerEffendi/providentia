Bishop's Collar is a great, lively bar with cool employees.  I have had countless conversations with the bartenders there, and the waitresses are both attentive and HOT!! The service is always top-notch, and the food is satisfying (some items moreso than others.  I love the flank steak, chicken quesadillas, and the thanksgiving sandwich.)
