What a mistake.... I was curious about this restaurant and booked a reservation a month in advance for Valentine's Day.   I was told that they were going to be serving their regular menu.  Three weeks prior to Valentine's Day I was told that they were going to do a $125/per person set menu but would not have the menu set until 1 week prior to Valentine's Day.  At this point all great places were booked so we decided to roll with it and give it a shot...what a mistake.  The first course stated oysters and beets.  I was served the beets (a few shaved pieces with cream and some crushed pistachios - the size of an amuse bouche) and my wife was served a plate with two oysters on it.  We were told these plates were to be shared..in other words, I was to eat a miniscule taste of the beets and she was to eat the rest and then we were to have an oyster each.  The next course was a plate with 2 roasted sunchokes with parsnip, pomegranate seeds and wild arugula. The next course was gnocchi with egg yolk and spinach. We we each given a serving.  This was tasty.  The main course was chicken for two (really...chicken...low cost food item).  A big cooked chicken was shown to us table side and then taken to the back to be divided.  We each ended up with a breast and a drumstick along with two small potatoes....what a joke..where was the rest of the chicken (wings, thighs).  The chicken was tasty but nothing special.  It does not take much to make a chicken tasty.   The dessert was some chocolate with blood orange and passion fruit...forgettable.  Anyway, we told our waiter (he was super nice) we were unhappy with the dinner and he told the owner, Simon Kim.  Simon came to our table to chat and we expressed our disappointment in the meal.  Simon took 20% off our bill which was a nice gesture.  Even with this gesture, I feel completely ripped off and will never return.
