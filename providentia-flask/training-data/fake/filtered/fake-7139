This is hands-down THE BEST Thai in NJ! I love, love, love this restaurant and the staff. Mama is a sweet and amazing cook. You've got to try the Pan Seared Dumplings, Mushroom Puffs, Spring Rolls, the peanut dressing on the salad, Spicy Basil Fried Rice, Crispy Chili Fish, and the Volcano Chicken! This is a family-style restaurant, and you will feel like family when you dine here!
