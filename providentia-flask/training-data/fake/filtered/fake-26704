Amazing food!!!!!!!! The feta cheese is to die for. My favorite is the swordfish and the rice. The only reason I would give it 4 out if 5 stars is because sometimes the service is not the best. That's not to say that this place is not incredible because it is. The lemon potatoes are incredible and we come to Astoria only for this restaurant. Although I'm sure there are others.
