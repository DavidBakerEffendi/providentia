WOW! This place is amazing! I moved from CT to NJ and being from CT and having access to one of the best pizza places on earth, Frank Pepe's, I was afraid I would never find good pizza again...I was wrong. Vesta's Pizza is the best Pizza I have ever had! Plus the rest of the food on the menu is delicious! The place is beautiful, the staff is friendly and the owner is fantastic! I am recommending Vesta to everyone i know. This place will be a HUGE success!!!
