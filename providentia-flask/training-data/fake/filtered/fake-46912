My family and I have been coming to this bakery for years and we have never had a problem with any of the employees , everyone has been very nice and attentive , especially the owners!!  Their cakes and cookies are the best we have ever tasted!  If you want something good you have to expect to pay for it! Obviously some people are hard to please and just like to complain.
