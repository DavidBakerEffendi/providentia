Ugh, where to start?  The food is WAAAAY too greasy and definitely not worth the price, although that wouldn't be the end of the world, but the staff are all the rudest people on the planet.  They don't greet you, they don't have uniforms, so you can't even tell them from the customers, and they serve with you a lot of attitude.  Then they turn around and talk to their friends at another table for 15 minutes.  I don't work hard all week to spend my money on greasy food and to get served my breakfast from a rude waitress at a crummy diner.   Oh did I mention that they don't take credit cards?
