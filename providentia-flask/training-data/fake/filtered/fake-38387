this is a popular local bar, clean and friendly staff, however the food was mediocre. i ordered the grilled vegetable appetizer. It included one small mushroom, sliced grilled carrots and a few Â thinly sliced zucchini. They charged $11 for this small plate. It looked like they just pulled together anything left in the refrigerator and threw it on the grill... next time i'll order a burger.
