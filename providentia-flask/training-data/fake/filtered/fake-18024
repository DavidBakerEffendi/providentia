I am completely enamored with this restaurant. Its trademark open faced sandwiches are a real culinary treat but what gets less attention is the awesome sides and out-of-this-world brunch. The chef(s) present innovative, healthy, and absolutely delicious versions of comfort foods. Buttermilk Biscuit Sandwich Of Smoked Eggplant, Avocado, Aioli, and Tomato is but one example. I swear, everything I've eaten there (and I'm slowly making my way through the whole menu) has blown me away. Aside from the food, here's a top five list of things I like about the place: 1. gorgeous patio out back 2. really good musicians playing in the corner on weekend nights. (ok, sometimes they do get a bit loud for dinner conversation to continue) 3. wait staff that seem genuinely psyched to be working there and sharing this culinary adventure with you. 4. the fact that Maimonide is located in the hub--if not the heart--of Brooklyn. 5. Dessert. (sorry, i realize that also falls in the food category but i really can't leave it out.) My advice: go and go often. If you're not vegan and don't care about animal cruelty or the environment, go anyway. Your selfish mouth will be rewarded many times over.
