I cannot say enough about Ofrenda!!! I recommend it to anyone that will listen. I have celebrated birthdays there along with random days in the Village and it NEVER disappoints. Jorge and the crew there make every dining experience fabulous. The drinks are insanely good and the food is delicious! Service is always top notch as well. The creativity they show always leave us saying WOW. Highly recommend to all!! Can't way to go again over the holidays! Great location and if there's a line - just order one of there awesome cocktails while you wait - always worth it! The ambiance and decor is also perfect - candlelight, cozy and warm!!
