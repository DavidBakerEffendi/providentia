This is my favorite restaurant in NYC!!!!!  I always go there around my Birthday 12/16/1952.  I was there on 12/14/2012 to celebrate my 60th Birthday.  I wish I could afford to live in NYC.  I know if I am able to I would eat here all the time.  Food as well as service is excellent!!!  Thank You once again for another year of excellent dining experience.  Kathleen Arruda  Fall River Mass.  See you soon in 2013!!
