Brother's is a great place to go for pizza or sandwiches. The food is consistently good and the atmosphere is very comfortable. They don't deliver, but their conveniently in the heart of Hamilton, so picking it up yourself isn't much of a problem. The service is okay, and the prices are great. I can't stress enough how much I love their pies and subs. I highly recommend Brother's for lunch or dinner.
