Yakitori Boy has always hit the spot.  As a weekly regular, my favorite dishes include the Magic Roll, Takoyaki, and the Ramen. In response to Julie A., review, it's quite coincidental I was on my way out, having a conversation with some of the employees, when I saw the incident happen at the front entrance.  Quite frankly, I have never seen a man pull another man's hair before, but considering seeing as though this were the case, I don't blame the doorman for responding to your friend the way he did.  Unfortunately for me, I can no longer have my pleasant conversation with the Cornell graduate. And also, as a regular, I can quite clearly let you know that on Thursday's, the Karaoke room has a $5 cover charge due to their Singing Contest that they hold. For all those that feel they can be rude and act inappropriately... that feel employees are not human beings, please follow Julia A. and go to a different restaurant.  The employees provide a pleasant experience, especially the kitchen, as the food is absolutely delightful.
