I can't give this more than 1 star because from start to finish the experience was a disaster. Ran out of rose, spaghetti and lobster came out with lobster covered in sauce in the shell and when I asked to have the kitchen remove the shell it was returned with part of the tail- none of the claw. That's when confusion in the kitchen began- saying their was no more lobster meat- I've never seen a lobster without claw meat- have you? Dishes were removed before everyone was done. And then they couldn't process credit cards. The overall confusion was unlike any I've seen in NY. I give it 1 star because the waitress was giving it her all and the food tasted good. The headache in the middle of the night from 1 glass of wine and the upset stomach along with the experience prevent a second star.
