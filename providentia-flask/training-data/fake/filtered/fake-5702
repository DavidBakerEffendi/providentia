I went to this place with some friends on a Saturday night for some drinks, and I was really impressed. We sat at the back bar, and the bartender was extremely friendly and made us feel very welcome. The drinks were also well made. I had a perfectly mixed gin martini (made with Bombay Sapphire), and my girlfriend had some sort of vodka martini that was mixed and rimmed with Tang. I tried some of this odd Tang concoction, and it was actually very good. The drinks may seem a little pricey at first glance (mine was $12), but they give you the shaker after they fill your glass. I got at least one additional drink out of the shaker. We didn't have dinner at the Continental, but we did have the shoestring fries as a snack The portion was very large and they were really tasty. I would highly recommend the Continental for drinks as well as the food (if the rest of the food is as good as the fries). We had a great time!
