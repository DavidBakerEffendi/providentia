I was little skeptical after reading some of the reviews but was pleasantly surprised.  We enjoyed the house salad, Scallops dish, wasabi potatoes and chicken dumplings.  My husband chicken dish was average.  Just wish there were more vegetarian dishes. Also, I recommend their cocktail drink "Solid" - this is not a fruity drink.
