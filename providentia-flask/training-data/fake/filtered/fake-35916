Robertas is one of my favorite places in Bushwick.  I've lived in this area for the past year and a half and go to Robertas at least once a month, especially when I have an out of town guest I like to show around.  Food is fantastic, ethos and mission are excellant and its always a nice vibe. But for fuck sake learn how to deal with people, front of house.  I walk in today for lunch (a reasonable six buck lunch of their HUGE "Working Man" Sicilian slice and an Iced Tea) and am greeted to a room of almost entirely empty tables.  Great, I thought, lunch is chill, I can sit wherever I want.  I ask the server to be seated outside and just got a cold "I don't have any tables outside"  Fuck you, yes you did.  I saw them.  Let me sit there.  She then told me that I could sit anywhere I wanted in this apathetic, unenthused couldn't care attitude.   I picked a small table next to a window and sat down with a magazine waiting to order.  The waitress then told me I couldn't sit there just yet because she hadn't wiped it down and set it.  You know what?  i'm sitting here now, waiting to order.  There's an empty cup, a few single for your tip from the last customer and a couple crumbs.  I can sit down yet?  I let her know I didn't mind and she can wipe it down while I sit and she gave me this incredibly smug look and proceeded to wait another 10 minutes for my order. My actual waiter for lunch was fine but honestly the most courtesy I got was a thank you from the pizza chefs on the walk out.  And usually I get a cool, friendly, excited server.  I dont need to be pampered, I don't need you to bend over backwards.  But Jesus act like you care and my business isn't a waste of your time.
