My wife and I pass by this place every day and we stopped in for our anniversary this year. It is a very cozy place, with not much room to get around, but the food makes up for what is lacking in space. The Brussel Sprout slaw and the escargot were fantastic The Crisp Duck with Turnips and fingerling potatoes was delicious. We have found a restaurant for many special occasions to come!
