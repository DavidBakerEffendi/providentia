My sister-in-law and I decided to meet for dinner and we were not sure where to go.  We were going to meet at the Tick tock diner and then I started looking for reviews on Thai resturants in Montclair and Belleville.  Out of about 5 or 6 reviews Topaz had the most consistent 4 star reviews.  We decided to try it and we were not disappointed in the least.  Wanda, the owner was a sweetheart and  recommened a few dishes and she knew her food!  Everything we had was delicious.  The taco appetizer was excellent and different.  Even though parking was nearly impossible, I think we will be going back.
