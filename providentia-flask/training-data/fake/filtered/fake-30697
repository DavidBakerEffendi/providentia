I have to agree with the 6/2011 review that the person complained about the roaches. I sware no joke. Last night I had ordered a dinner and the second I put salad dressing on the salad, a bug jumped out of the salad and ran across the table. No Joke! Looked under the table and saw garbage all over the floor. They said it was the first time it ever happened, but I searly doubt it. In addition, there's another post about how they nickle and dime you for everything, its true. State Street Grill had the gawl to (1) charge me for the meal despite having bugs fly out of the food and (2) asked me repeatedly if I wanted the food to go! If it wasnt for my company to get one of their employees to work for us, Id steer clear away from place and have the health dept in that place today! Looks like Im going back to La Strada for Dinner!
