I used to love this place so much.  It was my absolute favorite for interesting use of high quality ingredients.   Unfortunately, my most recent visit was a total disappointment.  The bold flavors I've come to expect were nowhere to be found.  The specials were rich, but bland.  The scallop handroll was unbalanced and greasy (?); it was only spicy, and I could not taste the scallop (i love spicy when properly applied).   Worst of all, the pork belly did not actually seem to be pork.  It tasted and looked distinctly beefy.  If it was pork, all but two pieces were ridiculously lean.  Also, the sauce that I remember to be incredible was unbalanced and indelicate.   I am unlikely to go back.  It is possible that eating there on a Monday (when the owner isn't around) was the problem, but its too pricey to be that disappointing.
