Went to this restaurant tonight and I think the food is ok. But as some of the reviewers pointed out, there are two issues with this restaurant. 1. The price of this place is on the high side compared to places like Viet Ai in Florham Park. 2. The biggest issue with this place is the service. Not that the waiters are rude or anything, but I think it is very disorganized. They actually missed some of my orders, and actually messed up the order of the table next to me. And then I saw empty tables and a bunch of people waiting at the door with no one seating them. If they want to stay in business, they really need to work on this. Next time may be I should try ordering take-out, although I haven't seen anyone ordering out.
