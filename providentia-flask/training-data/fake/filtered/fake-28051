The ONLY good thing about this gastropub is the food. The service on the otherhand, left much to be desired. I came here on a Firday night with my boyfriend and our friend for a few drinks and grub. From the second we sat at the bar, the bartender was extremely rude to my boyfriend. He has been to this bar before and has always asked for extra mustard for his sardine sliders and the first thing out of this Pseudo-Hipster's mouth was "No. I can't do that for you. You're not getting extra mustard." Throughout the night she grew increasingly more rude, tossing napkins at our friend and tossing a pen at me. All the while serving her friends that came in with a smile and great service. She ignored us for half of the time we were there. If you go to this bar, avoid the slack faced bar wench with the bad attitude. How will you know it's her? From the terribly cut black bangs, the brown crocs and the generally nasty disposition. You've been warned!
