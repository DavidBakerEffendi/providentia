...the worst, expensive restaurant experience I have ever had; From the bad service to 0 out of 4 entree's were not finished, this was the worst insult for a NYC eating establishment  I ever ever incurred. We had the yellowtail as an appetizer, gnochi and hallowed tomato sauce as 1st and 2nd's both standard fare.  Enjoying below decent food with lousy service as best as possible when the crap of the main course came out.     noone finished their's ...noone Sorry Conant...it simply sucked worse than any ripoff Ive ever beheld
