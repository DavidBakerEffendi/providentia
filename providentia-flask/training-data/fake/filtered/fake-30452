Very exciting - my first yelp review.  Decided John's has to be my first review.  Yes, you should try the roast pork but I'm telling you the cheesteak is King here.   Nice serving of steak on a sesame-seeded bread.   I like Tony Luke's, even Rick's back when it was at RTM but John's cheesteak...holy canoli, Batman.   Try it, and you'll see.   Downside: only open til 3 Monday-Friday (I don't work in the area, so I've made special trips to South Philly on my off days for this sweet goodness)  and no steak orders after 2:30.   Line starts early  around 11-11:30.  If you go during lunch, expect a 20 minute wait in line.
