June 02, 2013 Our first mom and daughters day ever spent in the theatre districts and wanting Italian....this is the MUST place to go!!!! The wait staff went above and beyond to ensure the MOST ENJOYABLE MEAL EVER....from drinks (the Pellegrino Lemonade), to appetizer (the Classico Antipasto) to gnocchi made special for my sister with one of the most amazing pests EVER, to veal that melted in your mouth, and then DESSERT....the most incredible Tiramisu we have EVER had, poached pears that were heaven on earth and my favorite and the most DELICIOUS Affogato I have ever experienced! Soooo reasonably priced for the area! We will definitely be regulars! Thank you for making our special day one to remember!
