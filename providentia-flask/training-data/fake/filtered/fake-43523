This was the worst dining experience I have had in a long time.  After placing our order we waited an hour and a half before someone came around to apologize for the delay.  This place is not ready for prime time, which sucks because the food was really good at the other location.  After the pathetic attempt to convince us that they would eventually bring our food, we just decided to leave.  What an epic fail.
