This place doesn't even deserve a star. Worst service I have ever had in my entire life. I would send someone I hate there. Hopefully they read this and fix it. Let's start from when I walk in..... They greet me and tell me to sit anywhere.-perfect I order drinks for me and my girl- seems to be going well 10 mins pass and I don't have a drink -FYI fishmarket owner this is important. Drinks are to come way before the meal. The girl asks me if I want the lobster because there was one left I say yes. -Not bad I then order some oysters and my meal. -(still no drinks?) The girl then comes over and asked me "how mad would I be if She said we don't have anymore lobster?"- (WTF?) this is where a smart business owner would come to the table and say sorry and offer something else at a discount or do something for the customer. It's called customer service. So I just suck it up because I'm thinking maybe the service will pick up and we will get everything fast. I order the ribs instead Finally I get my drink but no oysters. -Now I don't have a degree in resteruant managent but I think the oysters and the drinks come way before the meal right? My meal comes out with no sign of any oysters coming out. At this point I'm so hungry I didn't even care. Me and my gf finally finshed our meals which was ok but still no sign of oysters coming out.- at this point I want to tell the world this place sucks. I asked for the check and found that they charged me for the oysters.? -Was the sever on something? The sever did take the oysters and one drink off the bill but it was not enough. Btw it was not busy at all. There were a hand full of people there and most of the people was sitting at the bar. One would think the service would be amazing but as you can see it SUCKED I will never come to this place again and I will tell my friends, family members and my customers to never ever come here. Hopefully people will read this and do the same.
