Beware the bar hygiene. We sat the the bar for brunch - food is good and the service nice. BUT we spent our meal shocked at the terrible hygiene standard we witnessed. Bar staff handled money, credit cards and even touching their hair only then to begin preparing olive garnishes and popping them into to unsuspecting customers drinks. I could list other observations but frankly in this day and age of hygiene awareness this alone is enough to give cause for concern. Eat at this restaurant but avoid the olives!!!
