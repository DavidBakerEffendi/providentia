This is the most phenomenal-tasting frozen yogurt I have ever  had!!  They have a great selection of flavors, and mixing those flavors gives limitless possibilities.  The place was exceptionally clean, and all the toppings were fresh and well-prepared.  The staff was friendly, courteous and helpful.   They have free Wi-Fi, lots of room and comfortable seating, so you can kick back and study or just chill.  I don't know how they could improve on this store -- this is yogurt done right!   I will be back!!
