Ok, so in response to my buddy Jim (above) I'm not sure that you understand the reason for the fall tasting....Menu tastings are typically set up FOR regular customers. The people love the already perfected menu and are given a chance to taste some new dishes and respond on your comment card about whether or not you would like to see these items added to the menu. Things were hectic and not as personal as usual because they were serving a full restaurant a 10 course meal! ((for only $30.00 i might add)) There were one or two items i personally didn't care for including the brisket and chicken and shrimp dish (mainly because i don't like shrimp OR lime) but overall the price for the amount of food was astounding!!! Those taking part in a menu tasting should understand that YOU did not choose the dishes being served to you. I know I do not like shrimp and thats why I did not care for that particular dish. All I'm saying is I strongly suggest visiting Lucas in Somerset on a night where you can choose something off the menu that you know you will enjoy. I can GUARANTEE you will have a new review to write :) :)
