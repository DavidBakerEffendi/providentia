It's quite perplexing how this restaurant is receiving anything more than 2 stars. Of course these fries are better than the average McDonalds/Wendy's fries, but the value is certainly far reaching. For example, a regular cup of fries cost $4.50 (roughly the same size as a XL McDonalds) which comes with an assortment of sauces - which are an additional cost. Anyways to the fries. Belgian fries are special that they are fried twice, making the outside extra crisp while the inside just perfectly soft. However, Pommes Frites seemed to have missed the mark. Within a bag of fries, less than 1/4 were cooked correctly while the rest were a clump of soggy mush. Not even the sauces (which do taste good) could redeem the fries. As a previous user stated, "if you like thick, bland, soggy fries then you'll love this place..." If you really want to try the best fries in the city, I would recommend Les Halles. They are perfect.
