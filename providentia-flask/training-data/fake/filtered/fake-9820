Based on the overwhelmingly favorable reviews here and on other sites, my partner and I went for a quiet birthday dinner at 6:30 last Sunday. Â We loved the decor (comfy rustic) and were treated warmly and professionally. We had a wonderful meal and experience - no question. But, let me voice some criticisms. Some dishes, while VG were very overpriced. We ordered the Lobster Chili appetizer based on several raves on Yelp. It was $34, more than some of the entrees. What came was a cut-up broiled lobster in a chili-spiced broth. The lobster was delicious - cooked perfectly. But, the total meat in the dish was probably half what you'd get in a small broiled lobster. We enjoyed it but considered the price a real gouge for what we got. We also ordered the brick chicken based on reviews. This dish did not disappoint. Tender and juicy meaty sections with a crisp, salty skin. If this wasn't the best chicken I've had in many years, it was pretty close. But at $56 for two, this also rates a mention in the "poor value" dept. Desserts (marscapone cheesecake and dis-assembled s'mores) were delicious. I repeat, we had a sumptuous dinner and experience. But, ouch! BTW, dinner for us with two appetizers, the chicken entree for two, a $50 red, dessert and coffee came to $260 with tip.
