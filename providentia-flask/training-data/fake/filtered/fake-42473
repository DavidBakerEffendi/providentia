Be careful, you might drive by this place because it's in a little strip mall and miss a pretty cool little bar.  It says it's a sports bar, but anytime I go they have a DJ, good drink specials and people dancing.  I'm not complaining!   The crowd is usually a little guido, and MSU students, sometimes it's a tight squeeze because the place is kind of small.  One time we waited on line for a long time, which was a big no-no so we just went somewhere else.  You can't hate on a place for that though, a lot of people want to go there.   I recommend this place for people who live in the area and want to have a good time on a weeknight.
