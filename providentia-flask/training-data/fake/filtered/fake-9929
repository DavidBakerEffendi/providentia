We love Ola, it is our "go to" restaurant.  We've been here about 5-6 times and have never had a bad meal.  Very unassuming from the outside.  Once you enter you really feel like you are somewhere else. I love the atmosphere.  My husband usually gets the black paella and I love the bahia (shrimp dish) or one of the steaks.  I can't go there without having a coconut mojito (with real sugar cane!!).  The last time we went there was some type of college class which took up both sides of the bar and it got noisy since we were right next to them.  The portions seemed slightly smaller but we will be back again and again!
