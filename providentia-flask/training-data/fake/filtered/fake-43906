Our family was in from out of town.  We decided to try Llama Tooth because it was centrally located to many family members.  This included family from young to not so old.  Well, this was a great time and a hit with all.   We had a large group so we chose outside.  The evening was perfect.  The weather was blissful. We took up the back part of the outside patio.  The staff was accomodating and never became frustrated, unusual when you have a big group (25).  We ordered a variety of appetizers and main dishes.  We shared alot of food.  Everything was delicious.  Favorites included eggplant fries, mac and cheese and crab cakes.  Salad was fresh as a  daisy. Great location to meet friends before a show or concert.
