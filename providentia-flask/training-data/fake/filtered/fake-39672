Oh well, my friend recommended me good taste. I went there one Thursday and it was closed, which was cool. I tried it again today. It was pretty bad experience. When I walked in, a girl told me they were closed in Malaysia language. I don't speak that language. So I complained about their uncertain open hours. A guy asked what I wanted but no one actually gave a crap. Then I found out that there were inspection guys there. They told the owner and workers: DO NOT STORE FOOD IN FRIDGE UNTIL IT STARTS TO WORK AGAIN. Based on the truth that they didn't treat me well and what inspection guys told them, I wouldn't recommend this restaurant.
