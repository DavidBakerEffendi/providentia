TERRIBLE SERVICE!! I am an Asian living in California. I made a trip to NY and had lunch here. The female server was rude and provided terrible service. First, The server wore a straight face from the beginning.  And there was a number before each menu item. I thought giving number would help to order instead of saying it incorrectly and said the menu number. Then the server sniffed at me and said that most people say the name of the item with irritated voice. During the whole dining she didn't come and check on me. I asked for more water, she didn't  come back and I had to call her again.  I think she wouldn't have treated me like that if I were a white person. She seemed kind to white people.  I really regretted choosing there to eat.  Don't dine there if you are non-chinese Asian in Chinatown, NY.
