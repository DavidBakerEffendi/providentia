Godshall's Poultry  is the best I had ever tried at Reading terminal they get five stars from me. I have a Christmas breakfast every year for my friends and family.  The only place I go is Reading terminal to Godshall's poultry. My family would have a fit if I didn't go there to get the breakfast meats. I get the turkey bacon, turkey apple sausages, turkey links, Maple sausages and the ground sage. This has been a request for over 20 years. Thank you guys for your consistency.  It makes my Christmas the best.
