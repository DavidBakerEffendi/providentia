I have eaten at Andrews Project since the past 5 years and every meal that I eat is healthy and delicious.   I am reading a comment about some guy here who I met when I was eating.  This crazy made lots of problems in the Cafe even had the nerve to bring his girlfriend and running around like crazys. I believe they were trying to take over this mans business and chase him out.  | As far as the food. all of its organic I myself have seen the man in New York and also He buys other equipment for the restaurant at Restaurant Depot in Secaucus. Ask any of his customers who have been eating at this Cafe for along time, and they all agree that he serves no MSG Salt or Sugar. This Rich D. Writes bad because the owner of the cafe chased him out because he  was asking to pay him and his girlfriend $1000 a week for their help. Nuts!!!!! \ I\was astonished when I saw this Mr. R. D, carrying on and trying to make a fool out of the poor owner. Look for the future and stop trying to bring bad on this cafe. I heard them talkin g about starting a food truck. by the way go and do it. They were eating for free and still owe the balance of $37. Shame on you Rich D. Remember what goes around comes around. You must believe in  Karma ! So Watch Out!!!
