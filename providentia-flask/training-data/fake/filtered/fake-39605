Sripraphai's food is sooooo good!  For those unfamiliar with Thai food their menus have pictures and the waitstaff is usually pretty helpful if you have questions about the food.  They will also alter dishes slightly.  For example, they offer crispy pork with chinese broccoli but will gladly make you chicken with chinese broccoli instead.  They will also ask how spicy you want certain dishes. They do welcome groups but they don't take reservations.  Cash only.  This is a large restaurant with a large outdoor seating area in the nice weather.  Even still, if you come here on a weekend evening you will most likely have to take a number and wait outside to be seated.  Come an hour before or after the usual 7-8 pm crowd  on the weekends or on any weekday and you'll usually get seated right away. Dress is very casusal and the place can get pretty noisy when full.  Bring quarters for the parking meters!
