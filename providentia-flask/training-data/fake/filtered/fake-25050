This is one of my favorite Mexican restaurants in Philadelphia. The food is really great especial the guacamole. I am not a fan of guacamole at all and never eat it if I can avoid it but I love it here. It is so good that you will ask for more and more and more and fight over the last of it with your friends or family. The design of the place is really cool and interesting. The wait staff is good at their job and kind. I recommend taking a tour of the nearby Eastern State Penitentiary because it's a really interesting and then coming to this place for a post tour meal. My only complaint is that it has this weird happy hour thing on Monday's where it only serves alcohol for an hour after it opens. I like to eat my dinners kind of early and therefore had to leave once because they couldn't serve me. My thought is this "Isn't the definition of an alcoholic someone who drinks before five on weekdays." But that's a tiny complaint and the food is well worth the wait.
