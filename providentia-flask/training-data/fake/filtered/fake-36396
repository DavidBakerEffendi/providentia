I love reading other peoples' reviews who think they are food critics.  Posted by "Ken R." .. --It was good, but not that good. --Fresh and very flavorful. Now, he also said "the atmosphere can't be beat" and the "tile floor is fantastic" but he still gives it 3/5?  That's pretty aggressive.  Emeril Live over here.  I guess "It was good but not that good, but it was fresh and flavorful" = Hi, I'm Ken, I really like tiles, and this was fresh and flavorful, with great tiles, and great atmosphere that can't be beat ... but it's not that good. Lame. This is an UNBELIEVABLE fresh pasta spot with really reasonable prices.  My mother (lives in Florida) has to come here every time she visits me in NYC (mostly because she likes good deals, but more because she loves their arribiata pasta). Do yourself a favor, listen to 95% of the rest of the reviews, and not Ken.  Hey Ken, go take a trip to negative town!!
