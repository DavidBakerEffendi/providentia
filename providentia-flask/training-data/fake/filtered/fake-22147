My husband and I wanted more of a nontraditional wedding venue, with amazing food, and room to dance the night away.  That is exactly what we got at Reading Terminal Market.  Planning with Stormy was easy and laid back.  She was a treat to work with, and was always available to answer my questions.   No words can describe the experience that my husband and I had on our wedding day!!! The staff was so incredibly kind and helpful, and everyone from vendors to waitstaff seemed happy to be there.  It was amazing to see the market transform into the wedding of our dreams in just an hour!  Every detail that I asked for was perfectly executed.  It was amazing to see my vision come to life. Our guests had an amazing time too.  I really think they appreciated a change from the normal wedding venue.  They were in awe of the markets transformation and everyone raved about the food!!! My only complaint is that my husband and I didn't eat a thing!  We were too busy celebrating!  Luckily Stormy sent us home with a doggie bag! Cheers to RTM!!
