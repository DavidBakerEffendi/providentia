If you want to have great food, festive music, and fun drinks than Calle Ocho is the perfect place for you. I ate dinner here on a recent Thursday night with a few friends after work and was really impressed. It was my 3rd or 4Th visit to Calle Ocho and there are many reasons why I have returned and have brought friends and work associates to dine with me. First of all the paella is one of my favorite dishes on the menu and nothing compliments it more than a refreshing mojito. The music is great, the wait staff is very attentive and helpful, and the food is unique and delicious. Calle ocho is a great place for a date or group meal. Calle Ocho is a reliable and fun restaurant and that is why I continue to dine there.
