I Love going to Mama Mary Soul Food. I have been going there every since they opened. I am a vegetarian and they totally accommodate my diet with their Veggie plates. The Peach Cobbler and Bananna are to die for. The enviornment is clean, the food is always fresh. I give them 5 Stars and a Thumbs up! I am greated by great staff, seated and given an appetizer while I wait for my food and did I say the service is fast. Mama mary's Soul Food is where I go when i need to take my business clients to lunch to discuss business. Only thing is, I wish there was one on every block. Once you go to Mama Mary's Soul Food, I can honestly tell you, you will be a customer for life! Dr. Joyce A. Bellamy
