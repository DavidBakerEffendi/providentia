My fianc√© and I went for our first visit this past weekend. We started off with an order of Gyoza and a Dinosaur Egg, both were delicious. For our main course we ordered Rock Shrimp with Avocado roll, Mingo Mango Roll and the weekly(?) special The Sweetheart roll. I was floored by the taste and presentation on everything. We finished off with Banana Tempura with Ice Cream dessert. Oh man, words can't describe how amazing it was. I honestly wasn't expecting much since most of the Sushi places in Central Jersey are only so-so IMHO but this place is on my my must visit NOW list. I can't speak for how the food is delivered but I would recommend just going in and eating there. I'm sure the freshness and presentation are lost during the trip. Again if you remotely like Sushi, you owe it to yourself to make a trip there.
