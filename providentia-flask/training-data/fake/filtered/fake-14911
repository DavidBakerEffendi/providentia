Last night, 9 of us had an expensive dinner at Metro North.  They placed our table in the bar area and the noise was so loud, we literally had to shout to talk to the persons on either side of us.  Then, they would not give us separate checks.  I told the manager that, considering the discomfort of all the VERY loud noise, they should accommodate us with the checks, but he walked away from me.  The food was very good, but the venue was like a sports bar in full swing!  I would never recommend this restaurant to anyone that wanted to carry on a quiet, intelligent conversation and in normal tones.  There are plenty of restaurants with excellent food and a quiet environment.  Why they did not give us a table in the actual dining room, which is separate from the bar, is beyond me.
