Hit San Vito's last night. Clams orgenanata - delish Grilled Octopus (Not on the menu) - Delish Lentil Soup - Delish My husband had the gnocchi bolognese, he's had it before and will always opt for this when they have it as it's home made and not available often. I had the veal chop - breaded and fried, with arugula, tomatoes and onion on top - delish All in alla nice evening!
