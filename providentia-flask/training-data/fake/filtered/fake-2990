I was taken here for my birthday and I enjoyed every minute of it. It was really tucked away so you would really miss it if you didn't know what you were looking for. We were greeted with waiters in the old style Cuban attire. They look very cute and was very attentive. They were also very attractive. The atmosphere was very cool and laid back. The food they also serve is a lot, you may have to ask for a "doggy bag" They do not serve alcohol so you are entitled to bring your own bottle. They do serve sangria without the alcohol and then you can add your alcohol to it. I would go back again. The experience was very different and nice. It's great for a date, for taking your mom to brunch or just friends hanging out or celebrating. It is kid friendly, however in my opinion it is best suited for grown ups. While there, it seemed that someone was having either a baby shower or something else, so there is room to have a small event or gathering. There isn't private parking but there is street metered parking. Totally recommend this place.
