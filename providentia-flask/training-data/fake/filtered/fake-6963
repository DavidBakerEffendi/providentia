Unfortunate to say but if they had a new management staff this place would be a gold mine.  I have been there twice and would not go back again. The first time I was there a "manager" almost made a waitress cry. He cursed at her about four times in a thirty second conversation in the middle of the bar and threatened her job all in front of a dining room full of customers. The second time I was there (only because my boss wanted to see the place) the same "manager" dropped the f bomb about four times while yelling at one of the ladies from his wait staff again in the middle of the day in front of a dining room full of customers. The unfortunate part was this time the young lady being chewed out was our waitress. Despite his behavior towards her she gave us great service. I was embarrassed for her but she shrugged it off and when I asked her what his problem was she laughed and asked for our order.  I would never go back there again but I would like to be a fly on the wall when this so called "manager" which I asked and his name is Pete decides to do this to someone who would not hesitate to put him in his place or file a lawsuit against the steakhouse for harassment.
