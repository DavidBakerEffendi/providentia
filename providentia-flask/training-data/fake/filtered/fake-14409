New to the area, and missing my regular spots in NYC, I was excited to discover Lena's.  Fresh ingredients and a helpful staff are what makes this place special.  I'm in nearly everyday now for their soup.  They even recognize me as soon as I walk in the door to let me know which soup's they have.   Looking forward to summer salad's!
