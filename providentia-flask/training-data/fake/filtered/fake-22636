This rating is based on their karma, not their food.  My wife is six months pregnant and was supposed to meet her friends at Frankie's for dinner.  There was a two hour wait so her friends needed to go to another establishment to wait.  My wife was late to the party and her cell phone was dead so her friends asked Samantha and Brett at Frankie's if they could write down my wife's name and tell her where to meet them when she showed up at Frankie's.  Samantha and Brett said they were "too busy" to do that... which probably would have taken all of 10 seconds, as a courtesy to a pregnant woman and her group of friends who were hoping to patronize their restaurant.  Instead, my wife who is six months pregnant had to wander around Brooklyn looking for her friends for 30 minutes... in the rain.  They have good food, but those two particular employees were rude beyond my comprehension.  If they treat everyone that way when they get "too busy", they won't be too busy for long.  I hope people extend more courtesy to Samantha and Brett next time they ask for a favor, and I hope Frank has a talk with them about how to treat his customers.
