Don Pepe II is my mom's and my favorite restaurant! When we crave Spanish food, this is the only place we go to. No other Spanish restaurants can compare. You will get so much food, that you'll be rolling out the door. The prices aren't cheap, but it's definitely worth it for the quality. It is a restaurant for everyone; and we usually wind up ordering one of their delicious specials of the day. The service is out of this world. Â They cater to your every need.
