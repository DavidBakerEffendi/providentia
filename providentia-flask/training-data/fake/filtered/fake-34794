A place with something for everyone! From Korean comfort foods like ramen to authentic dishes like namul (Korean soft-cooked veggies) and pork belly; they really have a variety that is not overwhelming! A younger person may enjoy the crispy wings, which I really enjoyed and others may go for other dishes as well! As a Korean, it was really hard to decide what to choose because they really chose essential Korean dishes that everyone loves but not every American knows! I really recommend this place for people going out for a nice, casual dinner with some cool options for food. The service was also impressive! Overall, nice feel to the restaurant, great food, great options, and a fun dinner! Asian foodies, check this place out!
