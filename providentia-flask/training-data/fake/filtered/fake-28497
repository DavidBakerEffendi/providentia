It's a beautiful restaurant, with fantastic food, killer $25 a bottle wine list and great ambiance. However, on the last visit the service was off. Our waiter barely spoke English. We had to waive and flag other servers to order, and never ending pasta course came only once. I had to get up and summon a waiter to bring it one more time. I still think it's the best place to take out-of-towners to. Hopefully our next visit will give us a reason to bump the review up to 5 stars.
