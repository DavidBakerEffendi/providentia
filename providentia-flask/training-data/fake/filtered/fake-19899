Shout out to Mohammed and Ahab. Two great members of the team that bring me my favorite falafel, consistent and delicious every time. Can't beat the price, under $4, and right next to the train. Line moves quick, we all get served, and I can usually get a seat. Great place, happy they finally came to Greenpoint. I haven't been to that one yet but I am looking forward to it. I have been to this place like a hundred times and never have I had a bad experience. Â Thanks guys and keep it up
