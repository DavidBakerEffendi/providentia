I get takeout from here weekly and love this Restaurant. Only issue I have is it is a bit pricy. I usually end up getting a pannini Â since it is the cheapest item on the menu an is good. I will also get the Sienna salad which is excellent, though it says it has caramelized pistachios on the menu but has come with walnuts instead recently. Last comment is that they must hold a beauty contest when hiring waitresses. Almost all are really hot, and one has to be the most beautiful girl I've ever seen; super model material.
