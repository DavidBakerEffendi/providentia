I love el camino! the food is great. I highly recommend the brisket sandwich and the fried pickles as well as their guacamole! They have great burritos too! oh and their fake chicken with buffalo sauce is really good! and i hate vegans and vegan food and i really liked it! the wait staff is also great. great in the way that they are fast and concise. I can't remember my waitress' name, i think it was Gina or Regina or something...black bob hair cut. anyways, she was quick with our food and she was hilarious when interacting with me and my family, but at the same time left us alone so we could eat and enjoy ourselves. it was the perfect balance of being diligent to make sure we were happy with our meals and didn't need anything, as well as being courteous enough to not bother us too much. Â  seriously eat their brisket its so amazing!
