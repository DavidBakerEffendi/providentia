I will be honest.  I love the idea of a small place with homemade food. However this place has a long way to go until it becomes what is could be.  The fundamental problem seems to be the quality of the ingredients used.  (olive oil, honey,etc) Some comments: Greek salad =. Not good.   Roasted vegetables=  Not good.  They have cut corers by not using olive oil. Fig Yogurt - inedible.  Not good.   This has to do with the amount and quality of honey being put in.  It probably should have very little honey - it was inedible when i got it. Spinach pie = this is good. Beet salad  =  this is good. I am crossing fingers they radically improve their food.   This may happen. Stay tuned.
