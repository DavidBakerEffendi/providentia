We have dined here many times in the past.  Today is my anniversary so we decided to dine here again.  Things have changed.  You no longer have your choice of pasta if you order the Pollo Parm. It comes with ziti and that's it. I asked if there was any way I can get linguine and she said no.   I asked her why and she said because that's the way the chef wants it.  She seemed irritated that I asked.  When we got the bill the price for the Pollo Martino was higher than the menu price.  Server said it was because I got pasta instead of the potato and vegetable.  That wasn't mentioned on the menu.  She didn't seem happy that I questioned her on that too.  I work in customer service so I am nice because i know how difficult it can be to handle customers some times so I don't see why I got a little attitude.  The food is good but if I can't get something as simple as my choice of pasta then I will spend my money else where.  There are many different Italian restaurants I can dine at.
