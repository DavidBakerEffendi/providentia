Food is usually good but staff are not! It's surprising to me how nothing ever goes right when I go there and the customer service sucks! I went in to order a latte and they couldn't tell me how many shots of espresso were in it so I told them to give me an extra shot. They couldn't seem to customize anything for me and acted like they were doing me a favor. The owner told the kid behind counter not to charge me for extra shot but she still did. I don't even kniw if he gave me an extra shot or not. I ended up paying over $2 for a shot of espresso I don't even thknk I got. The total for a latte and small roll was over $7 dollors. Then i went to pick up a lobster tail dessert the other day and they were half the normal size!! It was like a mini version for the same damn price, although it tasted delicious. For the price of everything there, the quality should be much better and service should be impeccable or at least average. I tell myself I need to,stop going there once and for all because I'm never truly happy and always feel ripped off. The desserts always bring me back....
