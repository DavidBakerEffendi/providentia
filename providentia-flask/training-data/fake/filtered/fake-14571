Well ive been there before and i knew the food was good so i wernt back. It was nice out so i decided to sit outside(BAD MISTAKE!) It took the waitress 10-15 mins to come over to me! After recieving my menu it took her almost a half hr to take my order! I had to ask other employees that were outside on break to get her.. WTF?! She admitted to forgetting about me and said she was sorry but it didnt matter at that point.. i placed my Simple order for a burger and onion rings and it took them almost a half hr to get it out to me.. The food is great but i was pretty p'd off with the service.. Thank you Aurora for making my visit a crappy one.. I might go back but i think i'll sit at the bar next time
