Would be 5* but the prices are quite high & even if you have a reservation it can be a bit of a wait to get seated. Do not walk in without a reservation unless you are OK sitting at the bar. Top class food, you are safe trying anything with the ricotta because it is all mouth wateringly good. Great wine list.
