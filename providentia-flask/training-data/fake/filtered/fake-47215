We had seafood on a Monday night, what a mistake!  The Risotto seafood was watery and tasteless.  The Zuppa do Pesia was equally awful, the squid was mushy and tasteless, it must have  been at least 3 days old, absolutely disgusting.   I would not recommend this place under any circumstances, I can't understand how anyone would give this place any rating above 1.
