Glasserie is no doubt a very special place. My experience was an education in eclectic wines, Mediterranean spices, and beautifully crafted desserts. The space itself is enough to intrigue you. I cannot wait for those huge french doors to open during the summer months. I am especially impressed by the wine list. Come here an adventurer because there will no doubt be something you don't recognize...and my motto is then TRY IT. I remember a lovely Croatian white wine that took my breath away...And please have an aperitif before you dive into a few bottles. The cocktail program is refreshing and thoughtfully-crafted. The large plates are FANTASTIC. We had a whole roasted fish and it was such an enticing presentation. I left feeling light and pleasant. None of the food is really meant to weigh you down...unless you eat a lot...which happens because the food is so damn good. The servers are relaxed and knowledgable. Highly recommended. I live in Boston and cannot wait to go back.
