BEWARE: The manager will raise the price of your orders intentionally. I took my friend to Shiao Lan Kung after reading the good reviews on yelp. We ordered Pa-Chien Tofu In Hot Pot and Seafood platter with a large bowl of rice. The food was average at best. Once we got our receipt, we noticed that the Tofu Hot Pot price was raised from $11.50 to $12.50 and our large bowl of rice was raised from $2.00 to $3.50. I also noticed that other people's receipts that had ordered a large bowl of rice was charged $2.00. We were completely shocked and outraged. We will NOT come here again because of the shady business with average food; not worth being treated unfairly. If you're new to this restaurant, take down the price as the manager will mark up prices for new customers as they do not know the prices. I would give this a 0 star if I could. Shady business and will intentionally cheat you out of your money.
