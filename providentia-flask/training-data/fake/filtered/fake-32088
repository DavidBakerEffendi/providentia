I do not know what every had been raving about but this restaurant is horrible.  The first time I went  was for a friend's birthday.  I had somewhere else in mind but his gf wanted to go here so that was it.  Atmosphere was just like any other large restaurant.  There were lots of people there and thus lots of noise.  What made me give this only one star was the fact that everything we ordered was just disgusting.  All the food was very Americanized and extremely salty.  I don't think I tasted one good dish there that night.  If you like Americanized food and want to have kidney failure real soon then go eat there, but if you want real authentic food then go elsewhere.  You have been warned!
