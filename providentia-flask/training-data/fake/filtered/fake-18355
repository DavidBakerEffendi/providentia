I just bought myself a treat:  a tiramisu macaroon.  Sounds heavenly right?  What a disappointment.  It tasted like it had been in the refrigerator overnight.  The decorative icing in the center definitely tasted like it had freezer burn.  Total disappointment. . . and get this.  A 3" round macaroon . . . ONE 3" round macaroon was $6.42.  Never again.
