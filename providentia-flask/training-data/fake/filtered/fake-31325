The service here has always been spotty but the food  good, this  weekend, the service was abrupt and  the  food was bad.Clearly pre made and sitting under heat lamps, the french fires were basically inedible and the burger had some weird seasoning, like sugar on it, over  all bad! Bubbys is  off my list of places to eat in Tribeca
