I have been going to Blue RIbbon Brooklyn for years. I cannot say more for the food, the late hours and the staff there. I love their sommelier/manager so much, as he never hesitates to pour us flights to try in order to find us the perfect bottle. He and the thoroughly Midwestern, all-male staff (the deal is, all Blue Ribboners start out as busboys, a hard job, and female servers can make an easier salary at a place with less heavy plates, so it's all guys) treat us like gold. We love you guys!!!
