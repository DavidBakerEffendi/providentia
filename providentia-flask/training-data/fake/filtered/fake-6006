We've had some great meals here! The special are always amazing and the portions are way more than any person can eat. It's BYOB so bring your favorite bottle with you! Their homemade pasta is perfect, meats are cooked properly, appetizers are certainly large enough to share as are salads. The desserts are delicious as well so make sure you save room!
