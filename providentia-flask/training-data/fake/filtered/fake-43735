I went to Alta for my birthday with a group of friends and it was NOT a good experience.  I will say the food is good, but it was completely ruined by the service.  The waitress gave us the wrong wine, which I understand happens so I was not upset, but I did want the wine I ordered.  Since she already opened up our bottle, she said she would have to ask the manager before she gives us a new bottle.  For some reason, the manager refused to give us what we had asked for.  We were stuck with red wine instead of white.   This wasn't all.  The bad service continued throughout our meal.  Servers were continuously bringing out our food and practically throwing the dishes on the table.  It would have been great if they would have told us what dishes they were bringing out instead of just throwing them in the middle of the table, but I guess that's just not how they do things.
