Came here by chance as I was walking around and starving, and fancied a nice meal. The service was impeccable, the food was perfect and the atmosphere inside the restaurant was relaxing. Went to a similarly priced restaurant the next evening and was gutted that I didn't come back to Ai Fiori instead, as it was a hundred times better. Â Can't fault it.
