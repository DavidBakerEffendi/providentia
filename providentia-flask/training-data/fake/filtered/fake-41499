Came here with couple of friends. My favorite was the starting dish of miso soup. The miso soup had shrimp and scallops, very fresh seafood. This was original and I've never had miso soup like this before, it was amazing. The sushi tasted like they just fished out the fish just moments ago. The quality of food was fantastic!
