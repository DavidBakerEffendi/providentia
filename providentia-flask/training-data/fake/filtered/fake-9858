i really don't get all the buzz and reviews for this restaurant. all the food I had was not any better than all the cheap trattoria bordering the east side at twice the price. the staff seems robotic and unease about the menu and wine list. My salad and pasta had this kind of off the rack quality. I didn't order dessert, they looked dull.
