Pizza Brain is a high quality pizza shop behind a vintage veil.  The setting is simple and mellow.  Bar stools and memorabilia face the oven and a few tables are set up on the Little Baby's side.  The service is free spirited and seem like they enjoy making pizza.  No use spoiling the experience, it's worth it for the pizza. The pizza is good.  One of the best plain pies I've had in the area, affectionately named "Jane" by the creators.  The specialty and white pies are high quality and worth the buy, but I constantly find my self coming back for a slice of the plain Jane.  It's a combination of its parts: the crust is crunchy with black pepper polishing the bottom, the sauce is sweet and slightly spicy and the cheese brings it all together.  The addition of fresh basil on top is both aesthetic and tasty.  Cowabunga dude.  *****
