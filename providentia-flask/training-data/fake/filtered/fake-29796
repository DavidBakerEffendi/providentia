Pretty good. Had the New England Lobter roll with fries. They also serve a full lobster dinner for $35. Space is small but you can sit by the window which is nice on a hot summer day. Tables are first come first serve so expect to share your space with strangers. You also have the option of sitting in the garden out back which is pretty awesome. All in all a nice neighborhood joint.
