The waiters tip is added directly to your bill. So they very much snub you from the start if your not buying a drink at the buffet. I was very turned off by that. Also myself, wife and 10 yr old son ate there and was wrongfully charged as 3 adults instead of 2 adults and 1 child.that's a $40 difference when it's all said and done. They made the corrections but still. The waiter was almost rude and that was a big turn off..the food however was amazing and the atmosphere is breathtaking.
