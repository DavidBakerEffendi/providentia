Got the chicken platter and it's worth dying for! So yummy... And the quantity for one can feed two!! But I made sure I ate it all up to the last bit... Well flavored rice, excellent and juicy chicken, fresh salad and bread, with dippings all neatly packed up Â ... I am definitely going to be more regular here... Great find and very hygienic and spacious...
