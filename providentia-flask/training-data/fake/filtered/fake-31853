Why ,oh why, calle ocho did you move across the street??  :( My review is based strictly on the comparison of their old location.  Having been to brunch at their previous location across the street on several occasions I was so excited to try brunch out at the the new one.  Sadly to be quite disappointed... First of all the "wow" factor of walking into a brightly lit festive latin restaurant is gone.  Now you are in a typical stuffy dark room.   Second, where's my unlimited sangria bar???  They eliminated the self serve sangria bar which i used to rave about, only to be replaced by your not so attentive waiter bringing you sangria.  The waiters did a great job of avoiding eye contact with you at all cost in order not to refill your sangria glass.  Boo! And lastly, moving into a bigger space that accomodates more people but having only one ladies' room and one men's room that causes very long lines is a bad bad move. Quiality of the food was the same but in the past it didnt matter because every few minutes you got to get up and serve yourself a new flavorful fresh glass of sangria.  Now you get to sit there and ponder over the quality of the food while you wonder if your waiter will ever come back to pour you a new glass.  PS: make sure you memorize all the sangria flavors bc the waiter will just ask you which one you want without you having the list there! Sadly won't be running back to Calle Ocho as frequently as I used to...
