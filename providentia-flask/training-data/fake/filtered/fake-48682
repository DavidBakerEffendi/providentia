Just thinking about this place makes my mouth drool. Anytime I have a guest visiting, a stop to empanada mama is always planned. its the most delicious and economical place. i am always surprised at how cheap my bill is at the end of every visit. the food! everything is amazing. the green salsa is to die for. i really wish they sold bottles of it because i would put it on everything. EVERYTHING. the place is clean, the customer service is only okay, but none of that matters because the empanadas will fill you with so much happiness. this place is almost always packed, so be prepared for a wait, but it will totally be worth it.
