Osteria is a great Italian restaraunt perfect for that "date night" atmosphere.  It's busy whilst still keeping some intimacy in tact.  The menu is a little pricey and their portions aren't huge, but the food is fantastic.  I tried rabbit for the first time at Osteria and absolutely loved it.  They seemed to be out of some menu items the night I went, but overall it was a great experience, and I would go again!
