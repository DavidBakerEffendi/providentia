I had a late lunch here and wow! The food was absolutely delicious and satisfying. However, what stood out for me was the tasty Red Sangria. I could have ordered another pitcher but I did not want to stand out in that way with my mother at the table! I am definitely going back. Worth the journey coming from anywhere in the tri state area.
