Overpriced for the quality and quantity.   Bartender was very friendly and professional.  The proscuitto appetizer was the best part, but beware the "course 1" con... these plates, while masquerading as entrees, are really large appetizers.  Two of us ordered three rounds of drinks, the bill was $150, and the quality of the food did not live up to the "Mario" hype.   We ordered trout special and ricotta gnoche for main courses.  Espresso was nothing special, we skipped desert.  We know a lot of places where you'll get a much better deal for the same or less money.
