Wow, where to begin? I understand that people make mistakes, places can be busy, etc., etc., but I am literally flabbergasted by tonight's experience. The short version is this: do not ever order the vegetable tamales and be okay with poor service. After placing our orders, we waited an hour for food with no one noticing until we stood up to leave. We also had to ask for drink refills, napkins and silverware, and the food (when it finally did arrive) was bad. If I could give zero stars I would. I will never come here again.
