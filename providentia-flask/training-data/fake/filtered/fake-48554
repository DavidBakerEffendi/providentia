We tried Afghani food for the first time. We liked it a lot. It is quite similar to Indian food but different in its own ways. The food was priced well and the restaurant was very well decorated. We liked the sit-down set up they had by the window, that was really cool. They don't serve alcohol and the service can be slow at times.
