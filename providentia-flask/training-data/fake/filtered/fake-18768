The Ramen and the pork buns was absolutely delicious , the waiter was supper efficient with his service. Â  Ippudo never make me disappoints. This is the one of my favorite restaurant. If you like Asian small plate dishes and noodle soup,you must go to here. Which is the reason why there is a long wait to seated !
