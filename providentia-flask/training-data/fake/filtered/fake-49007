Three friends and I finally got a reservation for 6:30 - perfectly early for a holiday Monday night. We arrived on time, but the hostess was rude and only seated us after three prompts (the table was ready). 2.25 hours later, we had received an amuse bouche and bread. The appetizers came after that but portions were miniscule. Entrees never emerged. We asked politely three times for waitstaff to give us realistic expectations of timing, but every promise of "2 minutes" was met by another 10-15 of waiting. Ultimately we had the entrees bagged to take home, only to find them half the size an entree of that price should be. To be fair, the restaurant comp'ed our mains and reduced the final check by half, but I wouldn't recommend the dining experience to anyone.
