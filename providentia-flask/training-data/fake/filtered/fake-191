This place is HORRIBLE!!  Terrible cheesesteaks with a racist attitude.  I wish I could give them a zero but the system wont allow it.  Way to make the tourists and immigrants feel welcomed Genos!!  It is a shame that they are so bitter and hateful that they would post that racist nonsense.  As far as the food goes the cheesesteaks stink!!   Don't waste your time and money on this place.  In all honesty you can get a better cheesesteak at Apple bees or one of those chain restaurants. Johns Roast Pork and Jim's Steaks are both MUCH better and from what I have seen ALL are welcomed.
