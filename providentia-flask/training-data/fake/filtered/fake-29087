Pretty cool spot. Very pretty view, it's usually kinda crowded so you gotta fight for a seat. But when you get one, it's amazing to just sit and relax and take in the view. The food isn't great, but it's ok, way overpriced though. Only beer and wine, but the sangria is good. It's better than the boat basin, and i prefer it over the frying pan as well, only b.c the view is better and less touristy.
