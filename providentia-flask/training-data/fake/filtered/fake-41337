I've been to LuLu & Me several times and have enjoyed it immensely each and every time. The staff is warm and efficient, and the food is incredible. My favorites are the Polpettine, rollatini, and the ribeye steak. This place is a hidden treasure, and has made me venture above 14th street more than usual!
