Variety choice of food! This restaurant is famous for its brunch. I went there last Saturday and ordered a stuffed French toast. It was amazing! Portions are pretty big,( one order comes with four slices of french toasts) which I think is too much for a female customer. I felt a little bi greasy after finished two slices. I also ordered a cup of green tea, and it coupled well with french toast.
