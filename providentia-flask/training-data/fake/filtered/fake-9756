I was so impressed with the staff, the atmosphere, the food, the presentation. Francesco- our Italian waiter. The best! He was new & it was his second day! But he was the best. I actually had a real Italian waiter who spoke Italian. The owner was friendly came over & talk to us! The food- appetizers: complimentary bruschetta & lots of fresh bread. Tried 3 appetizers: fried mozzarella,meat ball salad, chicken Cesar salad. Very good & fresh! main course: Steak with mushrooms & onions & the best mash potatoes I ever had. The steak was juicy and perfectly cooked. dessert: cappuccino was amazing & the tartufo to die for! I am in love with this restaurant!
