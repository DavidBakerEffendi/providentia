Amazing how one bartender can ruin an entire night.  We were having a great time until J.J. came on service. (if that's his real name)  He was insulting and rude to a friend who was "over-served", in JJ's opinion, as he tried to pay for his tab - HOW terrible of him.  I spoke to the supposed head-bartender who was drinking at the same bar we were and he just backed JJ's opinion without question. I was told a manager was not available. Will be telling all of my legal and financial clients/friends to stay away.
