I brought visiting family here last month. Food was ok. The list of specials had us all trying (and eventually failing) to not laugh in the guy's face. Enough with the specials. It's annoying and embarrassing and they're always the same. Yeesh. The over the top service was actually distracting and interrupted us a few times. Dial it down.
