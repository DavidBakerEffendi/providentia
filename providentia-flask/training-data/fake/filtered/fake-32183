I went to bokhara recently and did not like the service what so ever, it took way to long. After waiting for about an hour the food was not good at all, the rice was very dry and the lamb wasn't cooked all the way. And also the prices are VERY VERY high. Do yourself and your wallet a favor and do not eat there.
