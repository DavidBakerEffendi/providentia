Where should I begin...being foreign in the United States it's hard find food that reminds you of home and its even more difficult to find the perfect ambiance to accompany the food. I went to Vonda Kitchen because of all the fabulous reviews and also after searching on Google for soul food in Newark. I don't care about any bad reviews by any mindless and confused customers. From the minute I stepped into the restaurant I felt home...for starters I had the ginger lemonade,goodness me it tasted just like my mother's homemade ginger ale I nearly wept. I met a wonderful woman named Gail she's from Trinidad we spoke for hours like we've known each other for years...she was friendly and so warm hearted. The customers around me were so welcoming and inviting talking to me...please note I have an accent and it's difficult for a lot of people to understand me. This restaurant is something really special...from the way they prepare their food to the way they treat their customers it's absolutely worth while. I never wanted to leave...I had the shrimp and grits and blueberry pancakes. Where I come from we don't have grits and pancakes...so when I had that I was instantly drawn to southern food...I wish I could never get full I would have tried everything thing on the menu. Whoever the owner is I must tell you that you're Â doing a fanstastical job...from your restaurant's decor,to how your employees dress,to your amazingly delicious food and to all the wonderful lovely customers you attract. I'm honored to be a customer in your restaurant. May the Lord give you the strength to keep on keeping on.
