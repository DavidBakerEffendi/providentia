Tough to beat for busy Times Square area on a Saturday night - Reasonable prices, good food and good service. We wanted a 6:00 time to allow cushion for our 8:00 show, but it was either 6:30 or 4:30 so we took the later time even though we were concerned about making the show.  There was no reason for worry - we were done by 7:30 thanks to a supportive waiter.  We skipped the app, but had Caesar salad and a main course plus wine.  Food arrived quickly, but we never felt rushed.   The salad plus vodka mushroom sauce pasta and chicken parm was more than the four of us (big eaters) could finish.  Chicken parm was the highlight for us.  People next to us ordered some sort of seafood medley with calamari, shrimp and a bunch of other seafood - we were lusting over that and they raved about it. As other reviews state, it is a bit loud.  We were seated in the basement which wasn't as loud as upstairs.  Plus, at 7:00 it started to empty so other than the beginning of the meal it was quite pleasant.   Lastly, we came back post-show for desert.  We had to wait about 20 minutes because it was very busy, but it was also worth the wait.
