My (now, husband) took me to Buddakan the evening after he proposed. It was an awesome place! The ambiance was very cool - the clientele as well as the staff were very friendly.  The decor is well laid-out & beautiful.  I love the seating!  The long table confuses me a little bit, however. So, the menu had a bunch of delicious-sounding options.  We had a long wait before we were seated, even though we had reservations, so we were starving! I ordered lobster.. it was a while back so I can't remember the name of it exactly, but I think it was butter poached lobster.  I'm typically very health-conscious, but I let loose this evening! Our appetizers were SO good.  My entree was unbelievable!! I couldn't even stand how delicious it was! We spent so much money there, but... wow. It was good. They have valet parking for $10, which is less than you end up having to pay to park in most of the parking garages, so it was well-worth it! I highly recommend going.  I love it!! However... I recommend THIS ONE and not the one in Atlantic City.  I had a very different experience there.
