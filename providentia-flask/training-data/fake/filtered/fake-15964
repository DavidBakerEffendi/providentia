Went to the Continental for a baby shower. Service during the shower was terrible--the single server disappeared for 15 minutes at one point.  Arrived at the shower a little early and decide to sit at the bar for a glass of wine. It took 10 minutes for the bartender to acknowledge us and when I asked to see the wine list the bartender informed me that most of the wines on the list we unavailable.  We both eventually ordered 2 glasses of wine, but the bartender disappeared for 15 minutes--this seemed to be a pattern with the wait staff/bartenders at this restaurant.  Took forever to get our check from the bartender and when she did give us the check it was thrown on the bar counter and we were not sure it was our check or the person sitting two chairs away from us.  The bartender seemed annoyed to have customers--which is fine with  me as I will never go back to this restaurant.
