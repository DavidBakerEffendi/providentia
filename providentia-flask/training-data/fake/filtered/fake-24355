Never again will i  go here!!!!!!   Come  here for dinner on a Monday night with my husband , there were about 3 tables  being served . Sat at a small table near the door but decided to move since it was cold to a table further in. Some guy who i guess is the owner tells us to move back to the small table. When i refused, he made rude comments and kept Insisting for us to move back. I guess he didn't want 2 ppl sitting in a table of 4 even though the place was empty. We simply put on our coats and left. The place has good food but nothing out of the ordinary  from other Portuguese bbq's.  I will never go back to this place to eat  !! And will sure tell everyone i know of how disgusting and unwelcoming this place is. The owner is a jack*** who doesn't deserve a single dime from any ones pocket.  If u want great food for the same price and a welcoming environment  McWhorter BBQ on McWhorter st & Green st.
