Wish I could give a 3.5. Â We did the pre-fix brunch, and everyone liked their food. However, there was an extremely long wait time between courses, and we had to wait over 20 minutes for coffee... Which had grounds in it. We ordered our meal when they took our drink order and asked for our bill when they brought out desserts, and we were still there for over two hours because of the long wait between courses. Also, while the libations are listed on the pre-fix menu indicating no additional price... We later found out that you are charged for them... Seems like that should be made more clear either on the menu or by the waiter.
