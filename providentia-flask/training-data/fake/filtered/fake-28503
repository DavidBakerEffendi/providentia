Been back here three or four times since the last review and the food seems to have gotten better. Easily the best Tom Yum Goong I have had stateside. It has that sour peppery taste that is difficult to get right, but these guys seem to have the perfect balance. Best cure for a Sunday afternoon hangover. Their fish ball curry is also pretty amazing and well prepared. The service is prompt even when they are busy. For some reason the consistency of the food seems better on the weekends for whatever reason. Definitely coming back again. The prices are right and the menu is so expanse that I will never get bored of this place. Do yourself a favor though. Do not come here and order pad thai like I see so many average people doing. Explore the menu and you will really enjoy this place.
