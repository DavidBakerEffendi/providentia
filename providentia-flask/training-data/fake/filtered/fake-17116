I am a huge foodie and always love to try all the latest hot spots every time I travel to NYC.  Although I hadn't heard much about The Sea Fire Grill, it came highly recommended from my hotel, so I decided to try it out.  I AM SO GLAD I DID!!!  This place is amazing!  Most memorable dishes were the oysters (some of the best I have ever had), lobster mac and cheese (incredible!) and the swordfish! The scene was vibrant, the managers were all genuinely friendly, and my waiter was fun, attentive, and provided great recommendations!  I can't wait to come back to NYC and have the same meal all over again!  Definitely recommend!
