WOW!! We just finished a weekend trip to Princeton complete w/ dinner at Ajihei. Â While we were looking for a good sushi place, we had almost missed this place due to the high number of negative reviews about the poor service people had there. Our servers were terrific and the sushi was absolutely perfect!! Prices for a couple of the specialty roles were high, but they sounded so good we tried them anyways. The quality and freshness were amazing, and the number of pieces in our Rainbow Roll made it worth the high price. I'm so glad we took the chance here - hands-down the best sushi I've ever had!
