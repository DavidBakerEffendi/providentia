So here's the tip fellow lovers of great little hidden cafe's - You only go in daylight hours that's when the Aussies come out to play. We found this little gem 6 months ago,only a short lunch time stroll from work and I'm in Australia, the servers are a mix of guys that look like they  left their skateboards and surfboards at the door and the cutest little Aussie gals you'll ever encounter.Tip no 2 the girls have guys names -must be an Aussie thing , The food is always spot on, I think  we've had just about every thing on the menu twice and the atmosphere    Busy  - Yes    Fun  -  Always!! So  now to the loss of those two stars guys...... over the past couple of weeks we've dropped by for dinner, and low and behold its a whole different cafe (maybe new owners?) both nights we had a tall surly blonde (in all fairness to the Aussies, I think she's one of ours) Talk about sullen, that's two unpleasant Bronte's now Ruby's. We'll definitely get back in  and check out if they kept the old servers on for the lunch rush, I'm not giving up on my little piece of paradise that easy XXX Yelp you've been no help, you wouldn't let me post an update I had to re post the original again as well, so lets make it worth my while     ---                                                                             So it's been about a month since I posted my less then favourable experience,  since then I've made the trip back twice, yes the first time I was on the edge of my seat ,half expecting a wanted poster of me to be up  on the wall ,waiting for my day to go downhill fast, but low and behold she did not appear,Instead I was treated to Ruby's the way it should be, the server was really rushed but he still kept the atmosphere fun  a  familiar face from Ruby's days gone by, so back we went the very next day  to be greeted by Johnny, by now we had smiles from ear to ear, it really is nice to have staff that not only dont mind turning up to work but really do enjoy it, it really does show.So lets just say I'm back and maybe a little training wouldn't go astray to get that smile happening on ALL the Ruby's faces and then all will be forgiven.
