This restaurant is in a weird outdoor garage-like space.  The food was excellent.  The ambiance....  I think I'm not cool enough to enjoy sitting in a garage parking lot, where it's cold and noisy.  It does feel very 'west village' so if this is your scene, you will love it.  Either way, worth checking out.
