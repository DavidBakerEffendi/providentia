I believe that with Stella 34 Trattoria, I have now found the perfect lunch experience in midtown Manhattan.  Top notch service is matched by a contemporary menu, fresh and well prepared food, and unbelievable views!  even better, my office is just a few blocks away, so I am truly blessed to have the wonderful option so convenient to me. I particularly like their branzino, but everything I have ever ordered was spot on! how cool to have such a great lunch experience in the middle of the Macy's bedding/lines department.  Unbeatable option.  I really recommend this place for anything - salads, fish, sandwiches, you name it.
