We have been going to August for many years, and it is our favorite restaurant.  From the front door, we are greeted warmly by Maria and the servers.  Once inside, we see familiar faces of regular customers who have become friends.  Everyone is like family, and that is how customers (old and new) are treated in this South Philly restaurant.  And the food is superb!  Maryann is passionate about preparing and presenting tasty food of favorite dishes and daily specials.  And Maria's homemade desserts are the perfect ending to a delicious meal.  Try the warm roasted peppers and/or artichokes as appetizers and the shrimp over penne or bolognese as entrees.  And don't miss the banana bread pudding--a real treat!  We know that you will be hooked after your first visit, and then, you will be family, too!       Bill & Christopher
