I went to High Street for Restaurant Week, hoping to try a few different dishes for a bit cheaper than usual. If I had come across this restaurant in another city, it might have gained a 5 in my book. But in Philly, with its incredible growing food scene, I'm holding High Street to a higher standard - and I just can't say it's one of my new favorites (and to be clear, I would have granted it a 3.5 if I could've). I thought the ambiance was cool (not just an open kitchen "concept" - there were no walls enclosing the small corner kitchen, making it completely open to the tiny restaurant). I thought the service was perfectly fine. I had a yummy cocktail (I believe it was called the Vodka Garden). Most of the food was very good - it was simple, flavorful, and well-executed. My favorites were the Rigatoni with Pastrami Ragu and the Arctic Char. There were a few dishes that I didn't love; like many other reviewers, I found the Potted Shrimps to be a bit too salty and the Country Peach dessert to be kind of odd (large piece of somewhat dry corn bread with a VERY small bit of peaches on the side). I thought the portions were fine - maybe a tad smaller than your typical small plates restaurant. Would I go back? Sure - especially to try breakfast or lunch - but I'm not dying to get back there. It just wasn't a very memorable dining experience. I've been to so many great restaurants in Philly lately that have me leaving saying WOW. I was expecting that wow-factor from Bon Appetit's Top 2 New Restaurant in the country...and I'm sorry to say I just didn't find it there!
