I am so happy to see New Orleans come to Philadelphia. I have been there for afternoon snacking, dinner and Sunday brunch. All have been enjoyable in both atmosphere and amazing food ! I look forward to every bit of food coming out of that kitchen. What a great addition to the city. I have been eating in Philly for years and it takes something special to make it a place I return to again and again. This place has it !!! and I agree with the other review...part of me wants to keep it a secret so I always have a place at the bar. Enjoy !!!
