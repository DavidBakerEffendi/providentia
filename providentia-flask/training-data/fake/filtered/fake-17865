Ok I tried this place twice. The first time I ordered two platters and was disappointed w. The portion size & was lacking flavour both lamb and chicken. The 2nd time I got lamb schwarmas which I'm sure was beef since the guy taking my order had a hard time listening esp when I was trying to tell him my address for delivery several times until I finally said I would just pick it up. Anyways the meat was overdone and the sauce was bitter and plain weird tasting.
