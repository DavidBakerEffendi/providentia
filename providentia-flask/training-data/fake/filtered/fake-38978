Tartine is a great place to have a bite to eat.  It is a small restaurant and you feel like you're sitting at a sidewalk cafe in Paris.  I tried the French Onion Soup and Croque Monsieur.  Both were delicious.  The service was also very good.  It was a busy lunch day for them and yet they were very attentive.  I will go back for sure.
