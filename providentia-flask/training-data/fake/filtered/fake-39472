Loco Pez is quite the Fishtown gem. The first time I found myself there, I was a little caught off guard and did not know what to expect; it was busy, it was loud, and I really wasn't sure where I was. At the time, I found it mediocre and wasn't impressed, but I thought that might also be a reflection to my mood and decided I'd like to give it a second chance another time. Last week, I gave it that chance, and let me say that I am glad that I did. I posted up at the end of the bar and ordered a few tacos: cochinita, al pastor, and mahi. All were great, especially the mahi and cochinita. However, just by chance, I overheard the cook telling the bartender about this mahi mahi sandwich that he concocted a few nights before. I was intrigued and so I asked if I could have one (it couldn't hurt to ask, right?). The cook obliged, and several minutes later I was staring the beast in the face. It was honestly perfect, so much so that I felt compelled to start a Yelp account just to say this. Grilled mahi mahi on a bun, topped with escabeche (pickled jalape√±os), and slathered in a habanero and bleu cheese sauce that sent my tongue into an inferno. Plain and simple: this needs to be on the menu, because I cannot go on living life without the opportunity to have this again. EDIT: Whoa! So I went back and this sandwich is now on the menu (albeit "secret" menu)! Ask for the "El Jimmy!"
