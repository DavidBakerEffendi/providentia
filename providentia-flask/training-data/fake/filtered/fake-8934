Best burgers for the price, I'd rather eat here than the Counter.  My office usually calls in orders for lunch and they've never gotten in wrong.  The sweet potato fries are lengendary and the goldburger sause lights my life up, especially with the onion rings.  Lots of creative options for burgers as well as classic toppings.  The pickles are always super crispy and fresh.  I heard the dogs were good too.
