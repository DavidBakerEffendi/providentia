One of the best restaurants I have ever eaten in! The staff was absolutely outstanding . The food was authentic homemade.The prices were very resonable. I can't wait to go there again! There should be a line all the way down the street to get in . Also, the atmosphere is absolutely gorgeous. What a gem! Don't miss out!
