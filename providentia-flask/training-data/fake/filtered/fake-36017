Roberta's had the unfortunate luck this past weekend of having a tempermental drain situation which led to their tough decision to shut down the kitchen for the night. One can imagine how disappointing this would be after waiting for a table for an hour and a half, sipping Modelos on their patio (ok guys, NOT THAT BAD, a fun patio to wait and drink on? Pfff great!) One can also imagine how disappointing it would be to be shutting down your restaurant (the resulting hit to the night's sales) and having to tell everyone there they were leaving hungry... However, Jess, one of the restaurant's managers was very gracious in insisting we contact her and come back to a reservation (they don't do resos). Correction, Jess was a rockstar. Hey, this stuff happens, so you shrug it off and take her up on her offer right? RIGHT! So we did, the next night. They resolved their plumbing troubles and as promised, had a wonderful table waiting for us. Not only that, Jess and the rest of the team were incredible the whole night, bringings us (deadly good) treats from the kitchen to thank us for coming back. The food was insane. Grapefruit infused cocktails? Roasted Lettuce? Meat Plate? Perfect Margherita pie? Cilantro ice cream? AMAZING. It would be an understatement to say they went above and beyond, really. You just have to go here. They do food and the experience of eating it right. Full stop. They deserve all their accolades food wise. I only hope everyone who was in the same boat as us on Saturday appreciated that when you're running a restaurant that is doing the volume they are, that sometimes things are beyond their control. Two fat thumbs way up Roberta's. I'll be coming back and recommending you (!!!!) fo sho.
