I am not nearly as impressed with the quality of food in the Burlington location as I am in the Waterbury location.  Feel Eric has messed with the soup so to speak.  The ham thing at the bar is a little gimmicky for me. The ambiance is nice, especially by the fire or overlooking the kitchen.  Love the cooler with the window in it.  Overall the food is good by Burlington standards, average by standards of a larger city. Still love his original restaurant, but this attempt is a miss for me.
