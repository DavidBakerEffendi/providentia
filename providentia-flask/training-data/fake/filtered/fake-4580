I'm not much of a sandwich guy, because most of the time you end up eating more bread than fillings, but that's certainly not the case at Provence. Their sandwiches are not fast-food or even line-style-made (like Chipotle or Potbelly), and they make sure there's plenty of filling to compensate for the delicious bread. It's midtown, so you're looking at $10/sandwich, which is ok I guess. Will definitely come back.
