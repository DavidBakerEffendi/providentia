i've never tried a vietnamese banh mi before, but my NY friend said i HAD to try one at Hanco's. O.M.G.!!!  it was the yummiest thing ever!!  i had the chicken with mild sauce.  it was to die for. i especially loved the pickled radish and carrots; they went so well with the sandwich.  and the bread was awesome - perfectly toasted!  definitely will go there again if i'm ever in NY!
