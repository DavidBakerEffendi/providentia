I would give this 3.5 stars. I had the goat cheese/eggplant dish for appetizer which was not very good at all, but had the pasta rusticana for a main dish which was outstanding. Lots of flavor!! We hadn't sat down for 5 seconds before a waiter came by and opened our wine. It is small, but I did not feel cramped. Its cash only which we did not know so had to run to the ATM.
