My husband and I had Valentines dinner there last night and it was the worst dining experience we have ever had (we're in our 50's). The service was excellent and the food was good (although overpriced for what we received).We dressed appropriately for a "fine dining" restaurant, shirt, tie, and jacket, nice slacks and blouse. We had reservations and sat in the small dining room. About 15 minutes later a family of 5 sat next to us. There were 2 teenagers and a boy about 10. They were in jeans and tee shirts and had been skiing earlier. Their conversation was so loud we heard everything they had done earlier.  They were loud and obnoxious and we could barely hear ourselves talk. Then shortly after they were seated a couple sat down at the next table. They were in jeans too along with giant Michelin tire jackets hung on the backs of their chairs and a baseball cap. Our waiter was excellent, but was so busy running around tending to this large demanding family that we were not of much concern.  At one point the boy was laying half on the table with his feet on the chair. We had planned this dinner and were anticipating a romantic quiet meal. Instead we paid almost $300 dollars and felt like we had just been to The Olive Garden. I guess we should have stayed in our sweat pants and ordered Chinese take out. We won't go back.
