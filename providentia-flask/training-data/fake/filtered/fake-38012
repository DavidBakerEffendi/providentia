JP's is one of the most exalted versions of a gastropub that NYC has to offer. Thier pickled foods are fresh and really tasty and the biscuits are uncommonly delicious, especially wit the house made maple butter or heaps of mouthwatering mushroom gravy. It can get a bit noisy but that's nothing new for NY. Â This is a wonderful spot for true comfort food.
