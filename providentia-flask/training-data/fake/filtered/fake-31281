For a place that's called salt and fat, it did not have very much salt or fat.  That being said, this place is very good.  It's american/asian fusion inspired tapas.  I went with 2 friends and my boyfriend and got 6 dishes.  I really recommend the duck breast and the spring rolls.  Each dish we had was very flavorful, well put together and pretty well priced.  Our only mistake was that for 3 guys and 1 girl, 6 dishes were not enough and we ended up going to the CVS next door and buying other, less expensive and classy, food.  The experience was enjoyable and overall a food adventure success for us.  Next time, I will go back with just the boyfriend and order the same number of dishes.  That should be better.
