Went here yesterday with my sister in hopes of finding some good latin food. Took the subway from manhattan and walked a few blocks to find this (I searched latin on yelp and this place came up so we tried it.) IT WAS THE BEST FOOD I'VE EVER HAD, I'm contemplating going back today haha. We ordered chicken quesedillas, an empanada sampler ]2 chicken, 2 steak], a order of guacamole &chips, and an arepa. The chicken quesedillas were the most outstanding food I've ever had before in my life and the empananadas were to die for. You MUST get both of these if you go there. The guacamole was great too and I just got a plain white arepa but it was delishhh. The service is great too. We had a nice bubbly waitress who had really cool africa earrings on haha. She was so nice and explained to us what everything was. The best part was how quickly all the food came out. It was so fast I was shocked. Deff go here if you want good latin food.
