Came here to try out our local diner for dinner, and it was alright. I had a burger that was a bit more rare than I had wanted, and quite greasy leaving me a bit ill. My fiance's meal was 'alright' too, nothing special, and certainly nothing compared to the other NJ diner's I have been to which is sad. Though the wait staff was friendly and pleasant, pretty sure I won't be stopping here again, there are better places to go within a mile radius of this place on route 1.
