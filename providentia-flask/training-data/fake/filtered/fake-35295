We visited Nolita on July 19th for late afternoon dinner and thoroughly enjoyed the food and service. We had chicken picata and my partner tried a burger. The waiter was very friendly and warm and checked in with us regularly to make sure we thoroughly enjoyed the experience and we did. We enjoyed it so much we decided to book dinner for our small wedding reception of 7 people for the following Friday. Well, everyone raved -- from the pasta dishes to shrimp, scallops, appetizers and OMG the desserts. Just awesome. The manager came over and introduced herself as well to give us some history on how the restaurant started. The presentation of all dishes were amazing -- as the waiter put it very nicely when he said "you taste with eyes before you taste with your mouth" and how true it was. This was a wonderful experience....you will not be disappointed. Did I say the atmosphere is very pleasing to the eyes as well, if not, it is. This is a must try. You will definitely be back again and again.
