I do not go into the city too often but Geno's is a nice treat when I do!  The steak is delicious, the American Cheese sauce is to die for, the cheese fries are amazing.  Just make sure you know what you want prior to ordering!  The lines get long but it moves quickly - don't be the one that holds it up!
