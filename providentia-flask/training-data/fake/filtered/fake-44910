First I have to start by saying that I'm a vegetarian.  I often have issues finding a "foodie" type place that can cater to my needs.  I went to Ela with my friend for dinner and everything was above and beyond.  There are vegetarian options on the menu, but I wanted more so I just simply asked and the kitchen staff was able to wip something up.  My and my omnivorous friend's food came out fast and the dishes were beautiful.  I almost didn't want to eat my food because of the plating.  I obviously did and will most definitely be returning.   Both the decor and host were extremely inviting.  I think it's very interesting (in a good way) that I felt completely comfortable in jeans all the while the waiters and bartenders are insanely professional, the kitchen is impecable, and the kitchen staff is hard at work in their creativity.  I also subconsciously tend to judge restuarants on their bathrooms, but Ela's was nice and clean and when I came back to the table, my napkin was refolded and my water filled.  It was also nice on a winter's day to come in out of the cold, relax, listen to good music, and sip on my warm Me vs Madonna vs Elvis ( a delicious cocktail ) while awaiting our meal.   Highly recommended.
