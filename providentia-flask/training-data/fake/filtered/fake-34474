The Country Girl is a hip and delicious gem in the middle of Chester's small town wilderness. They have classic diner food and some fun, somewhat experimental meals (like the huge Magic Monster sandwich-- it's really more of an event than a meal). I will forever crave the CGD's hand cut fries, something fun from the specials board, a ginger ale, and some homemade pie. recommended for: early breakfast, breakfast, second breakfast, brunch, lunch, and late lunch. yes all in one day, and yes, every day. Also it's BYOB.
