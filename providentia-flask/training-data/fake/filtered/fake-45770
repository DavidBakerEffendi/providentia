HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT My boyfriend and I had a Sunday brunch at Aksum. We were very excited and pleasantly impressed with the classiness of the place. SERVICE: The waitress was nice, but immediately forgot our drink order (coffee and an iced tea) and had to come back to check. Once I got my coffee, it was dropped off quickly and I had no time to ask for cream (it wasn't left on the table). The only time the waitress asked us how our food was, we had nearly finished. FOOD: Ok. So when I enter a place that all fancied up and has a pricier(but not outrageous) menu, I'd figure the food to be fresh and tasty. I'm not really a stickler about this, but the menu was mismarked left and right. Vegan Options came with eggs, Vegetarian options came with turkey sausage. After much indecision, I decided to go with 3 poaches eggs, pita & hummus, grape leaf wraps, and a tomato and avocado salad. Sounds delicious! I was very excited. What I got was a HORRIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT. The eggs were kinda iffy. The hummus & pita were OK, but not the best. The grape leaf wraps, I MUST SAY, were very good and I would totally eat them again. but... the one thing I was very excited about- the tomato and avocado salad... it was nothing but slices of browning,bruised avocado and a really really under-ripe and gross tomato that had anything but flavor. To make it an even bigger disappointment, I had a stomach ache immediately following the meal. Further into the day it lead into digestive issues.... YIKES So, moral of this longwinded story is that I do not recommend this place, based on my experience. Others hopefully have had more pleasant experiences, but I'm not ever going back.
