Food is okay.  Not bad, but not so good either.  Service and everything else was great.  Make sure you sit toward the center of the restaurant, otherwise you are staring at the big white curtain all night long. It's a nice restaurant with mediocre food. I suggest to go there for drinks and desserts.  Not food.
