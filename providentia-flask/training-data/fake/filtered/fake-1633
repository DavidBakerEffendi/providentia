Love it love it love it.  The food is great, but what really sets it apart is the amazing, personal service.  I hadn't been there in a couple months and the servers still remembered my name.  They ask after my friends who come in with me sometimes, and they always bring me roti with no butter, just like I like it.  :-)  A wonderful, friendly place.  If you're friendly and nice, this place will become your new favorite neighborhood hangout.
