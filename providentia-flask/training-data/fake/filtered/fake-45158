I have been going there for years and aside from that one staff member who Lisa M. is talking about who Im not even sure if they are still there...I must say everything is exceptional.  I have never had a bad meal there and all of the other staff members have been nothing but nice and given great service.  I would recommend LoMonacos to anyone!
