This is my favorite Indian restaurant in New Haven, hands down. The service is always incredible.  The staff always remember my name and the variety of things that I usually order. I've been in for the buffet at lunch- love the variety and appreciate that it forces me to try new things I wouldn't otherwise order.  I often order take-out, delivery, or go in for dinner as well and am never disappointed. Highly recommend and love this place!
