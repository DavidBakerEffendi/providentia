Went there with my wife last night (first week of opening). This is a very contemporary take at a Japanese restaurant: old favorites with a Korean/ fusion tang. We had sushi, basil fried rice, beet salad, mussel soup, and cod. Â Except for the sushi (which was good), each dish was a surprise. All very flavorful, interesting and delicious.Chef Jeff was hanging out and he is a very charismatic guy. He is extremely knowledgable of food and alcohol. I'm looking forward to my education in sake and shochu!
