First off, want some authentic Vietnamese food? Go to Chinatown. 1) I went in with my boyfriend and two other friends, and waited half an hour for a table. The lady who served us actually allowed her family friends to go ahead of us. Terrible. When we sat down, she didn't say, "How may I help you?" Instead, she said, "What do you want?" Talk about rude. 2) After we got our food, I realized that mine had a hair in it, and I asked for a new bowl, but the lady said no. Talk about rude. I mean, come on. There was a long strand of black hair in it! After she said no, I just sat there and didn't eat. No way was I going to eat that. My friends told me their soup was bland and cold. Their food was disgusting. 3) After, we left. The lady who served us spoke in Vietnamese something the line of, "Oh, she thinks she's all that? Not eating something with hair? Don't come back, bitch." I didn't say anything because I did not want to cause any trouble. When she realized I didn't leave a tip, she ran out and screamed at us requesting for a $5 tip. I walked away and ignored her. The food is disgusting. The customer service is beyond horrible. The place smells so badly. It's loud. Seriously, the worst Vietnamese food I've ever had. If you come here, good luck with trying to find decent tables, food, servers because I'll bet you that you won't!
