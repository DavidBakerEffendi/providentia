Loved, loved, loved this place.  Went there with a bunch of ladies for a night out and we all kept thinking of excuses to eat more food, drink more drinks - anything we could to stay longer.   Great atmosphere - very friendly staff and I wish I lived closer so I could have the orecchiette with sausage & pesto and the bread pudding at least once a week.  I thought the prices were very reasonable also.
