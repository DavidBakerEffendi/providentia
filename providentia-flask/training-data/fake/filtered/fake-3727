Do not get take out!!! I have a severe allergy and I ordered take out and made it clear that I have an allergy. They still sent the food with the allergen in it!!! The could have killed me. I hadn't ordered from them for about 2 years because the first time I ordered from them they sent the food with the allergen in it and it took them two hours to send corrected food. AND IT STILL WASN'T CORRECT!!! So I tried again today and they did the same thing. They just don't care. Do not trust them to take care of you. They haven't taken care of me.
