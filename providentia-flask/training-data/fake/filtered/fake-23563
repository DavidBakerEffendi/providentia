We order from Jamie's regularly and always get the sausage, It's fantastic. I know there are some more exotic toppings offered, but we really just enjoy the perfected simple pie with a tasty crust, not too thin, not too thick. The customer service is impeccable. Very clean atmosphere, friendly staff, and awesome prices. We're from California and for us, pizza isn't a staple. In NY/NJ pizza/"PIE" restaurants are on every corner. We are slowly but surly fitting in to this community of PIZZA lovers and starting to distinguish between OK/GOOD/GREAT pies.... We rate this place as one of the best around.... Reviews Yelp!!!!
