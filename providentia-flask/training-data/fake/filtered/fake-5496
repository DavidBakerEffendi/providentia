Another great night at Posto. Service was quick and friendly. I shared a Brie crostini and a large Fafandone with my partner, sausage was sweet & spicy, sun dried tomatoes juicy & sweet. I tried a glass of their Chablis, nice & crisp, my partner had a glass of the Frappato, which was different. Overall, if waiters aren't slammed expect to have food out fast and your service speedy. Word on the streets is that the same owner of Posto is opening a restaurant across the street, Mexican Tapas! bring it!!!
