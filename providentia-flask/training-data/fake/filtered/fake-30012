Today, we had been here for dinner. Food did not live up to our expectations. The place was crowded and there was big queue. We had to wait for more than 1/2 hr for our order. Poor service. We got our entree first and then naan after 10 mins, appetizer in the last. We had order chicken 65 which was not authentic, it looked and tasted like manchurian. Salt was less in all the dishes. Biryani had strong pungent flavor of garam masala. I would never visit this place again.
