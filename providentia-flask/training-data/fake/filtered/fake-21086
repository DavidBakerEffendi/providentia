We went to this restaurant and expecting for a wonderful dinner but never get the chance to be seated and eat -- the manager was rude and impatient to welcome us.  We went for an early mid-week dinner and noted that there were only 5 cars parked outside.   This is not the first time that I used the mobile version for Groupon, however, this manager treated us in an unfriendly way, as if we have never ever been to a 'fancy' restaurant. We ended up leaving the place as the manager says that we came at the busy time of the night for dinner (note that we went early and there were only 5 cars parked in the parkking lot).  He did not apologize with his mean behavior, he was actually not saying something nice in Mandarin (Chinese) and I speak and fully understand Mandarin fluently. Sad to say that we were not able to taste any of the food that they serve.  Groupon was MORE helpful and accommodating than Chengdu. If you are going to Chengdu and have a Groupon, please be aware when using Groupon at this place, to expect a hard time with the manager.
