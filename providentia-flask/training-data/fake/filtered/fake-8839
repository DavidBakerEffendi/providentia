Not a bad lunch spot. Â I've been here a few times now, the Po Boy, Prosciutto & Melon and Chicken are all pretty good. The Orzo salad is good too, different, which is nice. It's something other than couscous salad. It's good lunch spot as I said. I tend to use them as a 3rd choice as they are a chain. Typically I prefer to eat at none-chains, but when I want something light, despite being a chain they deliver. It seems like one aspect they should consider is lunching a food truck to get down to the campuses and expand the consumer base.
