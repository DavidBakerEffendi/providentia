A Very Bad Experience!  The food was at best OK, but they kept pushing the sangria mix for our wine, which turned out  be ridiculously expensive.  Also, we witnessed on multiple occasions the owner verbally abusing customers.  We have talked with some friends about this place, and many have had similar experiences. AVOID AT ALL COSTS!
