I hosted a Birthday party for 32 people at my house last week.  I must say, that a lot of guests thought that the food served in the get-together from Punjabi Rasoi is from an expensive place like Tabla in New York :-).  They were pleasantly surprised how economical the pricing was, and pretty much everything tasted super delicious !  We ordered Chicken Biryani, Kababs, Chicken Tikka Masala, Paneer Curry, Saag, Chole and Rasmalai.  The guests also loved the tray of assorted breads.  One of my friend's husband who rarely eats Indian food, really enjoyed the mild but flavorful taste, and said he would be visiting this eatery soon !
