I really love Peruvian food, and I've loved the Upper West Side Pio Pio for years.  I loved it so much that I've had numerous graduation, birthday, and "gosh I NEED green sauce" dinners there over the past 5 years. I decided to branch out and head to the 10th Avenue location for my birthday dinner.  Sadly, shortly after eating there with my family last week, 3 out of 4 of us (the ill includes me, the birthday girl) woke up violently ill and vomiting. The next 36 hours were spent shivering, vomiting, and dehydrated with body aches and headaches.  It not only ruined my birthday weekend, but it ruined the my loved ones' weekends too.  I'm well at aware that we're all eating at our own risk when we eat at restaurants, but I came to really love and trust the food at Pio Pio. I didn't even want to write this review, but I see I'm not the only one who has had this issue there. This meal was the only common denominator between the 3 of us, and as for our 4th dining companion, I suppose that person has a tough stomach. The food is delicious- I'll never deny that, but they have a habit of doing something wrong that makes people ill.
