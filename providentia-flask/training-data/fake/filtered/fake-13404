For the Hanover area, this is probably as upscale and nice as it gets. Relative to what is available in the area, it's 5 stars but compared to the rest of the country, it's 4 stars. Food was very good but not the hands down best restaurant food I have ever had. Ambiance in the renovated restaurant is beautiful. I just hope that they don't decline in quality just because all the other restaurants in the valley are not so great. Without competition, quality tends to slide. Hopefully Pine wont' suffer from that.
