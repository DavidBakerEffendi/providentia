Normally I like eating at the Princetonian, but after today I will not be returning.  Today was a busy day at the diner and it took over 30 minutes to get my food.  When the food came it was cold.  The waitress gave the food to the manager and said it was cold.  On the way to the kitchen I saw the manager touch the food to check how cold it was.  This by itself is not a problem, but when the same food came back to me after being microwaved I was sick to my stomach.  The manager who touches menus all day and shakes hands with countless numbers of people touched my food and then tried to serve it .  This make me question how clean this restaurant really is.  I would think twice before eating here again!
