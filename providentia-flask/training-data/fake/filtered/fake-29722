In the spot of the long-lamented Pif, a new country French BYO has emerged. The decor has not changed much, the addition of a few Ikea curtains and a fresh layer of paint, but that is part of the charm of this tiny eatery, and its forlorn location at 8th and Washington, just outside the Italian Market. The food is impeccable, although it may strain the patience of the red-gravy crowd in Philly. With head cheese, pigs feet, and such offerings on the menu, it is a very traditional french joint, which is a rarity in this town.
