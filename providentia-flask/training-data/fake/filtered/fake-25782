This was the worst dining experience I have had in Philadelphia. Having failed to secure a last minute reservation on Valentines weekend at 5 other restaurants, four of us decided to try LaScala. Absolutely never again. The watery drinks at the bar should have been a clue to run out of that place but the only option was a 7 eleven on Walnut street. The food is awful and the service mediocre. It took 3 request to finally get some rather ordinary bread sent to our table. The entrees: yuck. The 'special" halibut was covered in a toxic-colored orange glop that quickly congealed and added a frosty covering to a tepid piece of fish, the "special" porterhouse was thin and chewy, the calamari appetizer was rubbery. The "special" cavetelli was ok. And that was just the food. Our initial table was below an unlit light fixture that whose wiring was "faulty". Our second booth was cold and drafty. Finally, a 3rd table was good. There is nothing Italian about this place other than the name.
