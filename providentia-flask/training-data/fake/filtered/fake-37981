I live in the neighborhood and I go to Milkcrate as often as possible. Awesome coffee , always good music. I especially like that this place is a record store and cafe ... Genius ! Â I heard a really good record one day while eating here and I immediately went home and downloaded the album. Needless to say I wanted it for sampling purposes as I am a producer so this place actually helped me out a bit in some artistic sense. Lol. Anyway whatever this place is the shiznit. Do yourself a favor and stop in here whenever u can. U won't regret it.
