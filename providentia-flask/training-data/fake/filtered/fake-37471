This place has some crackness sandwiches. I haven't tried the headcheese because ti just sounds plain weird, but the bulgogi bahn mi is amazing. Sometimes, it could taste a little too sweet tho but I am somebody who doesn't like sweet. I do like spice, so I always ask for the spicy mayo and put extra Sriracha on afterward. The lemongrass chicken is also good too. The decor is nice. It's very casual and they also got some funky looking drinks ( I forget what exactly.) You can't go wrong with one of these sandwiches paired with a bubble tea from Quickly's right across the street.
