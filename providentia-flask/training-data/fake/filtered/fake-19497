The establishment, as represented by its edible and potable offerings, is fine; however, the establishment, as represented by its staff, is a hive of boorish slatterns who maintain an unaccountably high level of self-regard.  I once belayed an order of shots immediately after I'd made the request, but was nevertheless presented with the shots and forced to pay; moreover, I called one night and after having dispatched a pleasant formality found that I had unwittingly stumbled into the jealously guarded emotional territory of an especially brusque harpy named Carolyn, or Carol, or Carlie, or something like that (see, I couldn't understand because white trash like to swallow their vowels and choke on their consonants).  Philly servants need to be vigilant: the New York hordes are coming, and they will bring with them a standard that far exceeds that of this particular tap.
