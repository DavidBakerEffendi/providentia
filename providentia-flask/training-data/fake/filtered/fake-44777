I don't even want to rate this place the customer service is horrible, I just had voice experience because I couldn't even believe what was going on, and I'm from SE WASHINGTON DC. I have had better service from a hole in the wall. Last week I was in Hartford on a CHRUCH convention staying at the Hilton. The service let out late and we were serving so the front desk recommend this awful place where the man over the phone taking my order was so rude and on top of that my came up to $44.95. And man got my order all wrong. I ask for cheese on the steak and cheese No cheese. I asked for a Tuna Club and I got a Turkey Club and the Pizza was soggy just nasty!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! So when i called back to speak with a manager it the same guy who by the way kept calling baby and I told him to stop don't! posed as the Â manager but he wasn't. Still with the same crappy attitude want me to give the turkey in exchange for the tuna!!! I told the front desk and throw away all the circulars. Oh after all that they did sent d the Tuna like I but who want to eat food from such NASTY, RUDE and DISAGREEABLE PEOPLE. Unbelievable I'm going to better business bureau on them.
