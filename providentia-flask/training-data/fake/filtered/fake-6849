Not only is this the best food in Brooklyn but the service and management go out of their way to make you feel welcome. Last week, my partner and I had a lovely dinner. After getting back home I noticed I had a Facebook message from the manager Eric telling me I had left my wallet. He had found my name from my ID, sent me a friend request and message. Needless to say, my wallet was safe and sound, not a dollar missing. This is Brooklyn at its best.
