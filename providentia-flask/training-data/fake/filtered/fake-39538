I have been here a few times and it is amazing!!! I always get the chicken gyro platter w salad extra spicy and use a lot of the delicious white sauce!! They recently expanded their dining area which is exciting because you would always have to fish for a table .... The employees are very nice and friendly ... As good as 53rd and 6th ... They are too far so kabab paradise is just as amazing ... Mmm my mouth is salvating righting this review :)
