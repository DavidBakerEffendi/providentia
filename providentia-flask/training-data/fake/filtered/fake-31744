This is NJ.A state full of good Indian cuisine restaurants.The kind of service and food we experienced at Spice grill was beyond belief. We have been living in montville for 4 years and always been going to Chand Palace /Amiya in the neighborhood.Spice grill was the only Indian restaurant we were staying away from due to friends' comments.As we are moving to a different city in Jersey, thought of trying it once as it is somehow always full. As soon as we entered, the waiter turned his face away (to avoid greeting and to show he doesn't care about the clients and he is frustrated of his job!). We chose the table ourselves and nobody comes for 15 min to take our order or ask us if we are ready (normal in all restaurants). As soon as we tell him that we have a groupon, he makes a face and dissapears for 30 min after taking the order. Anyways, food comes in.We ordered simple veg manchurian, hakka noodles, kadhai paneer, naans etc.Everything was so pathetic and bad that I hardly could believe I was eating in Jersey. Stay Away!!!Go to Chand Palace/Amiya and get the worth for your money(just that Chand Palace is veg)
