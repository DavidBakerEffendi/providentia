Better avoid this place.  My guess is that the only reason there hasn't  been more reviews is that people are too nice to tell the truth.  Flavors are muddy, many of the foods are overcooked, service is terrible, I.e., bringing the wrong food to your table, slow to serve simple dishes that ought to be ready more quickly.  I don't have a gluten issue but was out with a friend who does and I'm sorry there's not a better choice for those who need gluten free.  Reminded me of the worst days of "hippie restaurants" in the 70s.
