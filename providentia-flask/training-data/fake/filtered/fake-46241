I am foreigner. Before i came here i knew in NY i could taste different countries' food. but.. I did not expect ramens... it was really shock to me. so these days I am going around to eat famous ramen shop. My friends recommended setaga-ya but on my way to that place, I found Ippudo. The exterior of the restaurant was really unique. l just went to there. staffs were really kind . The interior was cool and you can see the kitchen. I ordered akamaru. To me , the ramen is just good. I know the ramen in japan has different flavor upon the area. I do not enjoy deep flavored pork soup , but if my friend come with me , surely I can say she will love ippudo's ramen. To me the noodle soup was little bit greasy. later I want to try rice food.
