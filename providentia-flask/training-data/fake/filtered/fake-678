I was excited to check out my new local bar as I recently moved to the area, so I stopped by on a Friday around 9PM. I was NOT impressed. The "famous" wings were only OK and weren't nearly saucy enough. The bartenders were very inattentive and it seemed to take forever to get our check paid (even though there were 2 bartenders and neither seemed busy at all). The only thing I really enjoyed about this place was the cheese fries, which were pretty good. Maybe a good bar for the locals who frequent here, but not for me.
