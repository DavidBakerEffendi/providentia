This is one of the most medicore tacos I've ever had. It is a cross between SF style and Tex Mex, but fails to deliver. First of all, sliced cheese on the tortilla? Then the tortilla, which is actually good, sticks to the paper wrapper, making the whole thing fall apart. The hot sauce is weak, the meat underseasoned, the salsa flavorless. Basically, cheap tacos for the student set.
