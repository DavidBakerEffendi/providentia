Mozzicato's just opened in my town (Wallingford, CT), and i decided to check it out.  The service was wonderful and i believe the girls behind the counter handled themselves very well despite the large flow of customers consistently coming through the doors.  On top of great service, the pastries, in my opinion, spoke for themselves.  The cannolis were incredible and the rum cake i ordered was to die for.  Looking forward to trying more pastries and cakes in the future. Great Bakery.
