I've been to this restaurant a number of times. Each time was a great experience! I have yet to experience all the dishes but my favorite so far is the molasses braised short ribs with a side of mashed potatoes, broccoli and cornbread. This dish has tons of flavor and very fulfilling in terms of portion size. All the waiters and staff are amazing but my favorite is Lawrence. He did a fantastic job with giving me the full SoCo experience!
