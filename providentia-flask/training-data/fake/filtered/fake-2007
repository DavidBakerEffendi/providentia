Let's start with the good. The location is perfect. Northern Liberties is an up-and-coming area of Philly filled with young people, their children and pets. It's an absolute pleasure to sit outside and people watch, especially when it's a nice day. The atmosphere is cool. Hipster with some really interesting artwork. I've been to North Third for dinner a couple of times now, and while I was not so impressed with my first meal (southern fried chicken), I absolutely LOVED the appetizers and burger I got the second time. We got the clams, wings, and a beet salad. Everything was delicious. I will be the first one to tell you that I am a burger snob. The North Third burger was amazing. You know it's good when the grease slowly creeps down your arm, and thats exactly what happened. I got it with bacon and blue cheese. The bacon was delicious and the blue cheese crumbles were perfect. Now for some things I can do without. The french fries. They are those weird texture, shoestring-ish fries. However, they come with a spicy mustard type dip that I really enjoyed. I can also do without the wait staff, most of them were rude, irreverent and just plain mean. Also on a Friday or Saturday night it can get pretty loud in there, so I wouldn't recommend this spot for a date, or if you're catching up with an old friend. While the entrees are good. I would suggest just getting a bunch of appetizers to share.
