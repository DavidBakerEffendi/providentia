This place is amazing!!! The food is home made and when you are there you feel like part of the family!! The vegetarian selection is extensive and has plenty of meat options so my husband can both eat...a lot!!! I get the falafel with babaganoush, its fantastic!!! If you haven't tried it yet, you are definitely missing out! Namaste!
