Unique tastes and really welcoming server.  This is a family run operation and you can taste the pride they have in their creations.  We got the second salad listed on the menu (didn't write the name) and the server instructed us how to eat and then drink so that the flavors would develop as we made our way through the dish.  The soup we ordered was totally delicious as left overs.  For something you can't get just anywhere try this place out.  BTW we went at 2pm on a Saturday and there was no wait.
