i'm feeling very conflicted about red cat at the moment.  a friend was visiting on business, and i suggested the restaurant - i'd been before, and the food is fantastic.  and it was again this time - the burrata, the skate, the apple beignets - all of it was perfect.  that was until we went to pay...and the waitress lost my friend's credit card.  not just any card - her corporate card that she was using to pay for some huge expenses while she was visiting.  we immediately checked the table, under it, our seats, our bags - gone.  instead of helping us look, the wait staff mainly stood to the side and watched.  they kept insinuating that it was our fault, that we lost the card.  i asked to look through the small books that the checks come in, thinking that maybe it got slipped into another book by accident and was told no, i could not do that.  the manager finally came over and took my friend's info to call her if the card turned up later.  my friend was clearly distressed, and the tone they took was "well, sucks to be you!"  there was no offer to comp our drinks, our dessert, nothing.  instead they acted like we were a huge inconvenience.   so yes, the food at red cat is amazing.  you won't go wrong there.  i just can't go back, at least not for awhile.  it was just so disappointing to be treated so poorly when we did nothing wrong.
