Ok, I've been living in Glastonbury for nearly 3 years now and I only JUST visited this place - oh, regrets! This place is such a gem! The atmosphere was excellent. Cute little tables with nice paintings on the wall - just a lovely place. Then the menu... it is very creative but everything sounds delicious! Then the taste - wow! The food is AWESOME! I can't wait to return over and over to try everything on that menu. What excellent and creative foods.
