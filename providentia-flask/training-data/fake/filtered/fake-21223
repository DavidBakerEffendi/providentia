We've gone three weeks in a row for dinner and have not been disappointed at all. Their margaritas are tasty and strong (rare combination) and their food is great and cheap! We did have to wait a while each time for a table, but we waited at the bar and enjoyed some drinks which passed the time quickly. The homemade hot sauces are a nice touch. The green one is especially spicy and great on their chips. The tacos themselves are small but there is plenty of meat and tons of flavor. Everyone is nice and they work to get you a table as fast as they can. It is cash only, but there's an ATM in the restaurant for those that don't plan ahead. This is a great new neighborhood spot.
