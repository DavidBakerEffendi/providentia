In a word- AMAZING! I've eaten here a few times since moving to Burlington this summer and have yet to eat something I am not an instant fan of! My fave is the Pasta Carbonara, although there is a LOT of bacon on it for me. Â Not only that, it's WICKEDLY inexpensive for homecooked, huge portions of great Italian food!
