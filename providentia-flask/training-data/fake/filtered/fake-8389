I live and work in Bloomfield, and I tell you this the greatest place to go for lunch. Their Quiche is great, all their food is prepared right there. Their daily menu is good, sometimes it's tough to choose what you want, I like it because it's very healthy. They prepare everything fresh. I've had their sugar-free cheesecake and it is delicious. The prices are good too, very affordable. The owner is very nice and accommodating. I highly recommend this restaurant.
