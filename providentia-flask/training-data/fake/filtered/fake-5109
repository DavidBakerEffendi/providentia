The phnom penh noodle is mediocre. The broth is flavorful enough to satisfy your craving of ku tiew. The downside is the stingy little amount of noodle, meat and old scrawny shrimps. I guess the broth make up for a lot of its cons. The other food on the menu is as common as street cart food. The establishment is tiny and out dated. The owners are truly immoral. At a few of my visits they will charge additional fees for no apparent reason. They ask thousands of questions and service is quite awful at times. I can truly say that I have visited this eatery enough time to know that it is time for me to find a better more suitable noodle house to spend my hard earn money at.
