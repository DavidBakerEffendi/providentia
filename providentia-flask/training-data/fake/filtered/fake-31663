Had a fantastic meal here. The steak for two was excellent and great value. They did a great job renovating, feels like its been around forever, in a good way. Decor, ambiance, music and scene were great. Really great Â place to have dinner with friends. A welcome addition to the neighborhood. Can't wait to go back.
