People here were amazing. Linda rocks. I got the pad kee mao and my co-diners got the pad thai, see ew, and another noodle dish that is slipping my mind. All of them were presented very well and tasted amazing. This was one of the best thai meals I've had the pleasure of enjoying and will most certainly be coming back soon!
