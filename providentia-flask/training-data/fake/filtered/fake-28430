We go here often and always leave satisfied. There aren't many places in Philadelphia where, top to bottom regarding the staff, are so polite, recognize us by name and make sure to enhance our visit. Thanks La Fourno for being so classy and such a great affordable place close to home on South Street which is otherwise the NJ boardwalk west.
