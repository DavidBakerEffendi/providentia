I used to eat at Amy Ruth's back in the day all the time. I used to bring out of town guests as well as NYC folks there quite often. I believe strongly in supporting Black businesses. After I moved out of NYC, I would also stop in periodically. I was really looking forward to some really good soul food after being out of the country for a long while. To say the least, this was a horrible experience. I could not eat the food because it was served practically cold. The food took a very long time to be served and the place was not crowed. The sweet tea was awful. The place was FILTHY. The service was suboptimal. I pointed out the uncleanliness of the restaurant in addition to the other concerns to the wait staff and they provided poor excuses for these experiences. The wait staff seemed uninvolved and rude. What happened to all the African American employees? Â I used to be a loyal customer but not anymore. I am thankful that I did not bring guests this time because I would have been extremely embarrassed. Amy Ruth's has to do harlem better. Dr. Wilton.
