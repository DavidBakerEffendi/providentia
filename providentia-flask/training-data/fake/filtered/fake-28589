After a long day at work, I was craving for a great slice of pizza.  I searched on my yelp app looking for good spot and alas, found Giuseppina's  Knowing it was "related" to Lucali I came with very high expectations And they didn't disappoint.  Very crowded, but the wait was worthwhile, ok decor, and service is good.  But the mos important thing, the pizza was almost perfection.  Thin, crusty, flavorful and full of ingredients.  Loved the fresh tomato paste and cheese.   I will definitely be back.  Note, the price is on the high end.
