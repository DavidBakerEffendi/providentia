I don't know if it was the pushy service or the fact that I am just not used to being stared at by a waitress while I eat but I did not find this place  amazing.  There are some highlights of my lunch with 25 people; -the tea provided was very good -the food presentation was good overall -the decor was cool -my fried rice was great. -prices were very reasonable On the down side, do not expect them to change anything on the menu for you if you want to take something out of a dish or add, they are not accomodating.   My friend was sick and came here because she had to. We were with a huge group of 25 and they did not change any food for her. She stuck with white rice and water. They also did not seat us all together.  Most places we went to that day were very accomodating.  I may come here again if I had to, but being from Brooklyn, I would much rather a dish from one of my local  chinese places.  Overall, it was something to check out if you are in the neighborhood just if you don't mind a waitress watching and stalking you from time to time.
