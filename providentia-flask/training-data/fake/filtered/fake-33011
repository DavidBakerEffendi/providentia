Me and a friend decided to check out Ratchada while we were in town. When we walked in we were pleasantly surprised to see a beautiful dining area lined with different pieces of art set off by low, recessed lighting. The tables were beautifully decorated and soft music played quietly in the background. We started with the sampler, a delicious combination of steamed and fried dumpling. Next, the house duck. Soft and moist on the inside and crispy melt-in-your-mouth skin, all over a smoky sweet and spicy sauce. Amazing! Easily the best duck I've ever had. For dessert, we had Thai tea ice cream with fried bananas and the Thai tea cheese cake. The ice cream was delicious, light and refreshing! The bananas were piping hot and serve with chocolate, a nice compliment to the cool ice cream. The cheesecake was also extremely good! I was so full, but I did not want to stop eating the cheesecake. With our dessert we drank iced thai tea, the perfect beverage to end our meal. Who knew there were so many uses for Thai tea? Overall, the food was fantastic and service was fast and friendly. My suggestion is to get here before the crowds come! I can't wait to go back and try more items off the menu!
