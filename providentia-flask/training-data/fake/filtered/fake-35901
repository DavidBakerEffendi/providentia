This place has to be the biggest Pizza Fraud ever! They should pay you to eat the so called food called pizza & pasta ! Our pizza came to the table BURNED- not charred...The Calzone was BURNED! The arrogance of the staff was terrible, I mentioned to our waiter the food was burned... his comment ....no just a little charred....really! A party of 4 & $121.00 later ....visiting our son in Williamsburg and being from LA ,we know pizza & pasta ....he was embarrassed on the recommendation Â of Roberta's. Left starving...bought a couple of Deli sandwich on the way home!!! Wrote the waiter a note when paying the bill and he mentioned to the floor manager about the complaint,who apologized and wanted to buy us some cheap looking dessert ....really! Did I mention the 4oz of pasta for $15.00 and was told enough to share...no one had time count out the pasta to share..,,joke! The good thing about a bad restaurant is you never have to go back!!! Forget this pizza fraud called Roberta's TI ...Woodland Hills,CA
