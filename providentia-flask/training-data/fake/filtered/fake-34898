This place has good food and hipster scene, but the attitude of the staff, especially the host/hostesses BLOWS!!!! Â So, if you like having to kiss a lot of slacker, Trustafarian ass in order to enjoy good food in a cool place, this the place for you. If, however, you are not a tourist or recent NYC transplant, then you will probably prefer the many other places in the area that are just as good without any attitude.
