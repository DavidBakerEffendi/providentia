Food is good, different and fresh. The best thing I liked about this place is friendliness, Courtesy and the ambiance. The dessert list is different and quite tempting. The only neutral side is that price is towards higher side with respect to the Â food variety and choices of dish. Overall, I loved the dinner and would recommend if you are looking for a peaceful and light environment and ready to spend little more than expected.
