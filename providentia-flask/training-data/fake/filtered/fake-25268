Amazing! The staff is incredibly friendly.  Definitely has a neighborhood feel.  The food was fantastic.  Since moving to BK from the city, we haven't been able to find a good sushi spot.  Our search is officially over. We were not huge fans of the close seating proximity to others with the communal seating. But it wont deter us from going back.
