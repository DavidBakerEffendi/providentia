It looks closed from the outside then you go in - WHAM - loud music, good times. The wings were AWESOME and the price is right.  3 Adults and 4 kids ate for $85 -- and left FULL.  Where does that happen anymore? My only drawback was the blasting music -- they should point the speakers away from the table as it was annoying. I'll deal with it for $12 a person!
