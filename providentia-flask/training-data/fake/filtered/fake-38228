The manegment cant controll their either staff. On a few different visits i saw the bouncers man handle women while the management sat and smiled. Recently i was there for a birthday party and while dancing a customer bumped into a employee. The employee had the customer thrown to the ground by the bouncers. The customers hands were bleeding. The bouncers were yelling tha they dont give a f about their job and would punch anyone in the face. The cops were called and multiple customers said this is not the first time they saw this happen. If your looking to be abused by bouncers who could careless about anything besides realeasing their testosterone on customers dont go here. They are over priced and over bearing. They assault their customers.
