Café Mulino is one of our favorite restaurants in the area. I've lived in Ewing for 12 years and I was very glad when Café Mulino came onto the restaurant scene. The food is consistently good, consisting of wonderful combinations of fresh and delicious ingredients. We are always warmly welcomed and I appreciate that the owner who graciously stops by to make sure we are enjoying our meal.   As a vegetarian I've always been pleased with my selection and special requests have always been accommodated.  They serve the best pasta prima vera I've ever had.  My carnivorous friends and family have always been pleased as well!  The service is usually top-rate with friendly waiters who are attentive without being invasive. If I could change any aspect it would be that as with many restaurants, as numbers of people enjoy their dinners, sound-absorbing furnishings would be in order. That being said, I've taken clients, family and friends to Café Mulino and they're always eager to return.
