Great place.  Great food.  Really worth while trip. I am a fattie that loves food and the only reason I don't score it perfect is because the price is not $$.  For one drink and a dish for two it was  a little over $50.  That to me is a $$$ restaurant.  Lots of good dishes but the Lamb sausage in particular will change your world!
