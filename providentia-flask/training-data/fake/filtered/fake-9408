I got take out, so I can comment only on the food.   I got the veggie platter (assortment of mezze), the meat special (it was lamb kebab), and falafel.  It cost $46. The kebab was not very good.  It needed more spices and the pilaf and potatoes were pretty tasteless as well.  The mezze were excellent (quite authentic) and the bread was very tasty.  The falafel was good, but at $7 was too pricey. All in all, the food is pretty good, but not extraordinary.  Don't regret eating from there, but won't go back.
