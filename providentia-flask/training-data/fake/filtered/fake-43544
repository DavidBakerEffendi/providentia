I received a recommendation from a gal i just bought a lamp from in philly on the best chinese food I have ever had. She went on and on about it, and it was exceptional! If you like spicy food as I do, you will be in heaven. I had Dan Dan noodles, the cold cucumbers and salt and pepper shrimp. Excellent!
