I came here with a group of friends for dinner and was very disappointed. We didn't have a reservation but were told that a table was finishing up and that we would be seated in 30 min. In the meantime, we went to the bar and got drinks and appetizers. One hour later, we still hadn't been seated, and were again told that the table is still "wrapping up." Finally, after over 1.5 hours of waiting, we realized that the hostesses had given away the table to another party a long time ago without bothering to tell us. My guess is that they were hoping to keep us around, but it was very dishonest. I understand the need to respect prior reservations, but I was very disappointed by the lack of transparency. Moreover, the manager's attitude towards us was fairly rude when we pointed out her mistake. I know that Salinas is supposed to have great food, but it's a pity that their service isn't up to par. I'm not sure I would want to go there again when I'm in town.
