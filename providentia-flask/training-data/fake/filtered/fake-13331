I dug this place. Super-friendly staff were very attentive to me in a non-intrusive way. Also, the seat-yourself-at-any-table style allowed me to meet someone and make conversation while I ate. How often does that happen to white people in New York? I'd go here again, if I lived in NYC, but I don't, so you should go there for me.
