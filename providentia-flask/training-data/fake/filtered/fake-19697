I went underage assumption of It being a southern cuisine restaurant only to find out it wasn't.. I grew up in the south and there is nothing southern about succotash having soy beans as substitution for lima beans, The salmon was delicious a little salty though, my problem with that is why if 2 people order the same dish, you might want to have their portions similar for mine was twice larger than a friends.. The waitress service sucks for the same person handled everyone.. The drinks were ok. Overall Â not someplace I would frequent. I've had better.. If you're looking for southern, you need to seek elsewhere for this is no where near close..
