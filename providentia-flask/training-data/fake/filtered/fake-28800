Here's why I gave it a five star rating.  First, the people who work here are very friendly, accommodating, and honest.  Second, the seat we had was outside on the sidewalk on a beautiful early summer day, and it couldn't have been more pleasant.  Third, the food was delicious at that price, which was extremely reasonable.  Fourth, we had tickets and had to get in and out in a certain amount of time, and our waitress kept us stricly on schedule without appearing pushy or intrusive.  She simply did her job on time and as appropriate.  Finally, the other patrons were as happy with their meal and experience as we were.  So even though this isn't Le Cirque, it's certainly got a much better tasting food for your dollar, and couldn't be a more pleasant experience.
