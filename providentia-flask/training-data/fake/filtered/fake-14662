After watching construction for the last few weeks. I finally stopped by this cute and cozy new burger spot not far too far from my job for takeout this afternoon.  I was surprised at how nice and modern it was inside. There was barley anyone there and upon entering I was greeted by what seemed a swarm of staff who directed me to the cutest little chocolate bartender who placed my takeout order. The menu was a bit confusing and somewhat overwhelming with all the choices just for lunch. Maybe I was a bit distracted by that handsome guy behind the bar who kept smiling at me with such confidence while I was tryna figure out what I wanted! I did eventually get my self together and chose one of burgers already put together on the menu. I was surprised to see they had a full bar with a bunch of different beers on draft. Not much of a cocktail list tho. But the bartender who I think said his name was Eric, made me some drink that absolutely was to DIE FOR!  In literally the blink of an eye. I was enjoying waiting so much I was almost tempted to eat lunch there.  But unfortunately I had to get back to work and was actually a little sad when some girl brought my burger out to me and ended what was turning out to be the best part of my day. :-(  The Burger was cooked perfectly and nice and juicy, just the way I like it. The sweet potato fries were a little soggy and way too salty. But Im think I'm gonna come back again with my girls this weekend. Not so much for the food but definitely for the eye candy!!
