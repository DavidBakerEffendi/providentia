Memorable for mediocre food, poor service, and extremely high noise level.  Food was literally dropped on the table (nothing like a plate being slammed down), dishes stacked to clear.  I have had better service at diners!   Reservations are meaningless. We had one for a party of 5, and waited 45 minutes.  Enjoy screaming as conversing?  This is your place. Arugula salad was nicely presented but the dressing was too acidic, arugula was soggy and wilted before I finished.  Tomato porcini soup was tasteless except for the salt. Risotto must have prepared earlier in the day and reheated.  It was served lukewarm with over-grilled shrimp.  Veal was also overcooked.  We waited 30 minutes between appetizers and dinner.  Pastas are good here;  the three who got pastas were pleased.  Maybe the veal and risotto sat under the heat lamp while the pasta cooked. Whatever.... Definitely a "no"  for romance, intimate conversation and refined well prepared Italian food.  And a "double no" for service.
