I love to go to Tria's on Sunday nights.  That is the only way I can afford the beer or wine.  The food is great.  The cheese platters always have a nice accompaniment with them.  The salads are out of this world.  The only problem is after you go there a couple times you've tried everything.  And it gets boring.
