To be fair, I had DiFara's last weekend- so that pie of perfection is still fresh in my mind.  This pizza was definitely satisfying and is a nice addition to the neighborhood.  BUT, one of the investors must not be a fan of pork.  They had no sausage and only beef pepperoni.  Also, we ordered hot peppers on our pizza and they put jalapenos on it!  In my pizza snob world, it needs to be an Italian Hot Pepper.  The crust can be very, very crispy like a cracker.  All this being said, I did like the place and will be back.
