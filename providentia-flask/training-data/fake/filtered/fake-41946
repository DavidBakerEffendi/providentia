Had drinks and food at the bar for happy hour.  Don't get me wrong the happy hour specials were a great deal, but you get what you pay for.   My sangria was nothing special and my husbands margarita tasted like a mix even though the bartender  said that they were fresh made.  When I asked about the brand of their house tequila he didn't disclose the name, only told me that they only use 100% agave tequila.  When someone else ordered a happy hour special Margarita I noticed the tequila used and also know that it is a 50% mix of Agave.  We had bland guacamole with overcooked, not so tasty chips.  The empanada's were soggy and too bready  and the taquitos also lacked crunch and flavor.  Once our food was served the bartender (who didn't ask how are food was and didn't offer water) left a check in a glass next to our food.  Without even attempting to up sell us another drink.  Seems to be an identity crises with decor and menu.  The waitstaff were wearing button downs, tables were covered in white linens and the music was upscale mexican, while the menu was nothing more than bar food.  Nothing enticing me to return here.
