I thought the staff was rude and the owner was extremely unfriendly. Not a smile on his face the entire night he was there. The food is blah, sort of tasteless.  Also, i love dark bars but this place is just too dark, its silly !   We could barely read the menus and we are 25 years old and it was only 6 at night. Back to the cloverleaf for us and our friends ! I will say as a bar to hang out and drink in it's fine but that's about it. Still i'd rather go else where.
