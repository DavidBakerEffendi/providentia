Having visited family in North New Jersey this past August, they wished to take my wife and me to a nice dinner.  As I have been to Peru, they chose this location, the Costanera. I ordered their Parihuela Costanera.  I found that it had a good taste, but as it came with shellfish, in the shell, there was a problem, broken shells of various sized pieces.  When I brought this to the attention of the staff, no one really seemed to care.  The chef even came to the table, and olny said "this happens".  Well, it will NEVER happen to me again at this restaurant again, NEVER! I would NOT recommend this restaurant because of the staff and their attitude towards their patrons.  It is totally unacceptable.
