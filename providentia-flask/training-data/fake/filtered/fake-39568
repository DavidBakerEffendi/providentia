I honestly do not understand the hype about this place.. I live down the block from this restaurant and would always see tons of people lined up to get inside and I decided to give it a try. The food took a long time to come and was mediocre at best. Most of it was just salty and lacked any unique taste that makes it deserving of five stars. Maybe it depends on what you order, but the only I ordered that actually tasted good to me was the watercress salad. If you're thinking about coming here to experience some mindblowing experience, I wouldn't really suggest it. You may or may not like it but I honestly do not think it lives up to its hype. Waiting super long for food that isn't even worth the wait? No thanks.
