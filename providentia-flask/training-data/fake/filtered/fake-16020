The waiters are nice and the atmosphere pleasant but can't say much about the food because they did not have most of the things we wanted to order. Came here for a Mother's Day lunch and wanted to order piroshki, they did not have any. This was at 12 in the afternoon, so they did not have them made yet! We then asked for vareniki, they only had one variety available, the ones with potato and cherries were not made! This was very disapointing as vareniki are what they are known for. How do you open a restaurant and not have items on the menu! I don't think I'll be coming back.
