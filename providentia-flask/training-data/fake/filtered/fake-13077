My husband and I have ordered in, and dined at Mirchi on several occasions since they opened about 2 yrs ago. We LOVED the place: food was delicious, and reasonably priced, plus close to our home. We ordered in a few weeks ago, and the food just wasn't the same - chicken in the butter chicken dish tasted like it was cooked several times, and each time far too long, and the Chicken Biryani was the greasiest thing I've ever tasted. We were very disappointed. However, we hoped it was a one-off, so we went back today for lunch - boy, NOT a good call! Restaurant was empty, and we were sited by the manager quickly. He recommended their Buffet. We decided to give it a try. The manager also asked us about drinks - I ordered a chai. In the meantime, another couple walked in (so the total was now 2 tables/4 people). We waited about 15 minutes, Â but no tea. The Buffet - ONE Palak Kofta dumpling, ONE piece of dried out chicken tikka, a bit of way-over-cooked butter chicken, lots of rice, 1 naan, bit of iceberg lettuce with a few slices of carrots covered with kraft-like bottled dressing, and my wife "favourite:" a few tiny pieces of honeydew melon - all for $ 20! Was it worth it - HECK NO! We'll we go back - DOUBLE-HECK NO! I am sad to say - I would not recommend this place :(
