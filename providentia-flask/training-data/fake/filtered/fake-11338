I am rating this place based upon the viewing and perusing experience.  It is definitely a unique venue that food snobs and those with chubby wallets would enjoy.  However, that is not to say the average person can enjoy such an experience.  The restaurants reminded me of my time in Rome where a friend and I enjoyed a glass of red wine enjoying fresh sliced meats and cheese.   Moreover, they do carry unique and rare food items that more-or-less be difficult to be obtained.  I appreciate this place more so as a museum of Italian cuisine than a supermarket perse.  I subtracted a star because of how overly crowded it was.  I'm surprised that the fire department did not intervene with the amount of people there.
