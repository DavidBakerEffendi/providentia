The food has been very good in the past but the last time we were there it was disappointing.  Worse than that, they demanded a $25 deposit for a reservation.  I hesitated but figured it was because they were small.  But after we ate they charged my card for $25 plus the meal.  When I called to get the charge reversed they said they would but 2 days later, still no offsetting charge.  I disputed it and I'm sure I won't have to pay it but what a poor way to treat customers.
