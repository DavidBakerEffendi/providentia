From the outside it doesnt look like much.  Once inside you are in a piece of Irish NY.  And not a want to be or a place that is trying to be an Irish pub.  This place is a real NYC haven.   The Scene:  Dark, sawdust on the floor, Wood burning fire in the winter.  all wood Tables and booths with names carved in.   The Drinks:  Strong, Classic (A place you can get Murphy's and a good rusty nail) The Food:  Pub grub done right, Great pub burger, perfect potato skins and the rest of the food is super solid.   The bartender actually buys you back if you have a few and sit at the bar and are not an idiot.   How many places in Manhattan can you say that about.   I have come in here with my father, my friends and have taken people from out of town here.  It's a winner,  all the way!
