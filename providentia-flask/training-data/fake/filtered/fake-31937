My Gorgeous Girlfrend and I had an early dinner this evening at Becco. Â We arrived at 5:30 PM and the place was almost packed...It was teeming outside and that could account for all the people inside, but this being our 1st visit we were seated with in 2 minutes of arriving w/o a reservation in the dining room accross from the bar...A little noisy but not a bad table for 2...My GGF decided to order 2 appitizers...Antipasto Misto and Gamberi 'al 'Forno, and I ordered the Hangersteak medium rare with soft melt in your mouth Polenta & vegitables and a we had a side of of the most incredible sauteed whole mushrooms...The bottom line every thing was Magnifico! 5 thumbs up for this place...Service was excellanti also!!...Make a beeline for Becco!!...
