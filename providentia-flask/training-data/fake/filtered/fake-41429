Parallel 40 wasn't as great as the magazines say. The magazines say its healthy but in my daughters dish you could see the butter floating in the sauce. The fact they said that they "Superfood" was bogus. For my wife's dish the salad dressing was was extremely heavy and creamy. Also the service was horrible. It took about 30-45 minutes just to get the food. It wasn't inpressive.
