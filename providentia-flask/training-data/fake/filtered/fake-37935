Ugh! This place has some nice things going for it, like a lovely back garden, but they really blow it in several ways. They apparently don't pay attention to Yelp because I have seen others complain about the loud, obnoxious music blaring for brunch and the bizarre hamburger served on oily pieces of toast. They just seem to want to be a loud scene-y place and that's about it.
