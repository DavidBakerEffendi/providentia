This is the second time I come to this location and I have to say that it left a lot to wish for! I have been to several locations (paterson, clifton, union city, and north Bergen) this location does not compare to the others. The food is cold, everything taste the same even though on the menu they are described differently. The taste of the dishes is not the way it should be and even the "avena" does not taste like avena it taste like water with a bit of oatmeal.
