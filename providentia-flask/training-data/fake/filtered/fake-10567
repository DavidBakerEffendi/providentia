It's such a pleasure to step back into "old" Williamsburg to dine at Marlow.  The food is earnest, well-prepared and they don't skimp.  The scene has not changed much at all over the years.  Yes, there are hip people in the mix but there are also many blowouts and prepsters to be seen.  The wonderful thing about Marlow is how happy everyone seems to be there. It's just a down-home, no attitude, good time with straight-forward, dependably good food. update: not sure what the hell happened, maybe they were having a salt fight in the kitchen but the food certainly was not the winner.  Still trying to get my blood pressure to a normal range.
