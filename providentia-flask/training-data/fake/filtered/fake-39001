This restaurant is amazing! We used yelp to find this place and could not have been happier. The service was so great; super friendly and nice. The food was amazing. We had the papperdelle with sweet ragout which was phenomenal. Also the cavatelli with shrimp and pesto was really good. We had the vegetable tower as an appetizer which was delicious. The house wine was an acceptable red. We had gelatto and cookies for dessert and both were great. I would recommend this restaurant in a heart beat!
