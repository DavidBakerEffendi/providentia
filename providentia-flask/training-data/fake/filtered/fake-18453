I'm sort of familiar with Philly and have visisted quite a few times but not enought to break out of "tourist" status. I was googling top restaurants in Philly and Alma De Cuba kept coming up on every list so off we went. I would sum up my experience in one word WHAAAAAAT??!!! This was absolutely one of the most if not the most amazing restaurant experience i have ever had to date and i have gone to a gazillion restaurants that ranged from yummers to eh to never again . Â  First the atmosphere...it is exquisite, highly stylish, and yet so soothing. Then the service from the hostess, to the serves, to the waiters, to the bartenders you get the star treatment with zero and i mean zero attitude. I was not dressed up and felt a little intimidated when i walked in but that quickly went away due to the staff's warm and genuine attitude. Instead of plain bread you get these yuca flour cheese thingys that had my eyes rolling back in ecstasy. Dayumm they were good. And the appetizers...amazing scrumptous inventive different amazing..oh i already said that. Definitely have the ceviche its bangin'! Then the entrees came and we were like woot woot! It was like the hits kept coming. I have the Lechon Asado and it was deeeelicious! We topped it all off with dessert cause um yeah we had to have the full experience. My cuban coffee arrived with a sugar cane stirrer (an actual sugar cane stick). Oh the smell of espresso...i was in heaven. I want to thank Alma De Cuba for the giving me my best restaurant experience ever. I've been from New York to California and everywhere in between and have had great experiences but rarely do you find a place that has it all. The bill was a little up there about 70 per person for the full experience but worth every cent. You may want to get reservations first though it was fully crowded no surprise. If your on the fence jump the hell off and go!
