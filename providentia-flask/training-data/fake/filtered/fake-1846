I had dinner at the bar with a couple of girlfriends here last night.  The food was delicious and the bartender was fabulous!  We had the chicken with red chili curry, pad thai and fried calamari and various martinis.  The food was cooked and seasoned perfectly and the drinks were excellent and made exactly as ordered (extra cold).
