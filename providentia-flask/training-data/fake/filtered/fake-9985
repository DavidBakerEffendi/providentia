I really enjoyed this place. I went for brunch today. I am new to Philly and I really enjoyed the feel and location. It felt like I was really getting a feel for something very Philly. The food here was really fresh and the portion size of my salad was huge! Which i loved! The decor is quaint and the staff are dedicated and fun. Despite the wait...which it was well worth it...I will be returning...that is if I can get a seat!
