Absolutely horrible!  We made reservations online and showed up to a private party. The hostess assured us it was ending so we decided to stick it out. They couldn't figure out how to turn the dinner music back on so I ended up using my iTunes for music. My husbands gin and tonic had no gin in it and they were out of red wine. We ordered the risotto balls and duck nachos for the appetizer. The cheese in the center of the risotto balls was not melted and the risotto was raw. The nachos were a joke, the duck was cold and all they did was melt some cheddar cheese on some chips and threw handfuls of raw tomato and onion ontop. Really?  Lastly the salsa was from a jar. We were really hoping for so much more. On to the joke of a dinner, I got the scallop risotto, the scallops were over cooked the risotto was under cooked. Absolutely gross. My husband got the skirt steak which was ok but it was so marinated you couldn't taste the meat. We couldn't get out of there fast enough. It was a huge waste if a Saturday night and our money.
