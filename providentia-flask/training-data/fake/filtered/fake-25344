I would Never recommend this place to Anyone! Â I ordered a Entrana Steak well done with rice and beans to go & They gave me a burnt on outside raw on inside RUBBERY steak that I couldn't even chew! & The rice was Very Soggy... & on top of thst, For $20 they gave me 1/2 of a Half of steak! In a small tiny box? Not a plate, a Cardboard box...I went back to in the hopes of getting my cash back &; Luckily I did! Staff was Friendly tho, Only good thing I can say, Wish i had better experience like the rest of the reviews here...
