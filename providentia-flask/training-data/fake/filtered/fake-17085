Went for girls night out. We met at the bar before our dinner reservation.  Bar waitress was less than enthusiastic and payed more attention to the table of gentlemen behind us.  Homemade potatoes chips were amazing!! Atmosphere is clean and well lit. Large window to street for people watching.  Great cocktail list but no pomergranate juice which was big disappointment. Dinner was excellent.  Oysters were fresh, well presented, and accuaratley described by waiter in relation to size region and taste.  Ordered scallops as appetizer, over priced, 3 small scallops for $20, but amazing taste.  Everyone enjoyed their meals, waiters and service were very professional.  Restaurant decor is well thought out.
