Absolutely wonderful experience. About a 25 minute wait for Sunday brunch, totally reasonable. We were constantly checked-in with as we waited so we knew that we "weren't forgotten about." The staff from the moment we arrived was incredibly welcoming and warm. When we were seated, we noticed how much work has truly been done to the existing structure. The mix-matched, bright and eclectic feel of the silverware, plates, and decor was charming and gave you the feeling of home. With immense sunlight and the soft, yet striking combination of exposed drywall and steel beams balanced by and fresh, red Gerber daisies, you feel as if you've stumbled upon a true diamond in the rough. Food service was very efficient. With such a busy brunch service, it is to be expected that you may wait for your food. After waiting just a little bit, our server apologized for the longer wait and brought a friend and I quite possibly the most delicious brownie we have ever had. It is attention to your guests that make such an enjoyable dining experience. I treated myself to the malted chocolate pancakes. Light and flavorful, it hit just the spot. I wish I had taken a picture prior to diving in, but with food THIS GOOD, I would advise you to skip the Instagramming and enjoy it firsthand. Whether it was something savory or sweet, Little Spoon masters the art of providing a comfortable dining experience that packs a lot of flavor in each bite. Erin was an amazing hostess, and the rest of the staff was very cognizant of customer needs. You feel like this is your neighborhood even if, like me, you have traveled far from home. Invite yourself to a taste of Little Spoon, and they will welcome you with open arms.
