Forno's of Spain is one of the best restaurants in Newark, NJ.  The food is fresh, but I still consider this place to be expensive for dinner and the food quality.  You can get a good deal from the lunch menu  - $20 for appetizers along with many other menu selections.  I recommend any seafood selection con salsa verde.  I love the ambiance  and classy vibe of this place. It's a good establishment to take a first date or high-end business client.
