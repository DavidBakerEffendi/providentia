I really wanted to appreciate the hype...sorry! I absolutely did not! The Southern Cuisine tasted reminisced of Cafeteria Food ! The Mac and Cheese is not good at all and the chicken tasted cheap and uncooked! The sugar donuts was okay ;/! I did like the creative design of the small little shop...be prepared to wait though we went on a Sunday evening and the wait was about a hour. Maye it was a bad day!
