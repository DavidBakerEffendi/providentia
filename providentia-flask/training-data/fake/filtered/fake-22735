This place is absolutely amazing, in every single aspect from the decor to the service and especially the food.This past monday i was there and had the sea bass (which was to die for) and i loved it so much i decided to bring my family today for dinner,they all loved it as I expected.The service was so great that i would eat there just because of that fact alone not even considering the food.Long story short i will most definitely be back for the sea bass as it is what really knocked the ball out of the park .
