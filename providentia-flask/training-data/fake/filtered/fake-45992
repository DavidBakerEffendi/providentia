I have eaten at Tops for over 20 years now and not sure how it is possible but it gets better each time I go.  I eat out very often and I know good food from top restaurants in the city to local greasy spoons.  Tops food is top quality and the price can't be beat. Portions are generous and the long list of daily specials make you feel like you are in a white table cloth establishment.  Service is always fast and friendly.  The owners are always on premises!! Whether it is a quick lunch a weekend breakfast of Friday night dinner out you won't be disappointed.
