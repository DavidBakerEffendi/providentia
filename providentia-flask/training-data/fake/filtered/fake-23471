I stopped here for a meal on my way up to northern VT. In short, the portions are tremendous, and the main courses were overloaded with cheese and salt. The waitress asked us right away if we had any food allergies, and reminded us that people do die, which was a bit awkward. I would hope that if you have an allergy to food you would let them know. Otherwise the service is polite. The menu is quite large and poorly designed. I had trouble finding a meal to choose. The soft bread and olive oil was very nice. The half salads are big enough to fill you up, but if you decide to eat here, make room--the entrees are enormous. I had the eggplant rolettes which were overloaded with cheese--wrapped in a thin layer of eggplant. The flatbread pizza was way too salty to eat. I get the idea that this is a 'family style' restaurant, but I think if they were to simplify the menu, cut down on the portions and focus on taste, it would be an improvement. I cant imagine how much money they are losing with all the 'boxed' food at the end of the night.
