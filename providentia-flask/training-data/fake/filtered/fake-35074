This place is the best in Ridgewood and Bushwick.  I would recommend it to anyone.  I am convinced that any serious foodie will give the thumbs up.  All the food is prepared meticulously by the chef who obviously has a high level of culinary experience. Very detailed layering of flavors and the combination of different ingredients and the textures are superb.  Ive been here four times since the discovery but each time I was wowed by what they offer. I love how they have their specials in appetizer portions too.  The seared scallops over mushroom risotto was heavenly. Their $10 burger is hands down the best tasting and the best bargain in all of NYC. I can not wait for them to get a liquor license so I can enjoy a drink with their fantastic food  at the bar. Love the service and how clean the place is. Amazing quality and cuisine at a diner price , makes this restaurant my recent favorite.
