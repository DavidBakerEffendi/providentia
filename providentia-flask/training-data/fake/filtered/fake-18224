I only gave 1 star because I had to. Liked the atmosphere and but that was all. Appetizers, while tasty came out cold. Party of 5, but only 2 dishes came out. 20 minutes later the other dishes came out and they were cold. Was told there was some confusion in the kitchen. I guess they meant there forgot the other orders. It was not busy either. We were given dessert menus but not told they were on the house till we said no dessert. But the worst part was the management's indifference. Â Skip it!
