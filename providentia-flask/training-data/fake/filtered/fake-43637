So tonight we decided to give the place a second chance.  We live in the neighborhood and were coming home from a movie.  The place we though would have a lively "bar" or "nightcap" scene.  We entered the door and walked up to the bar to be greeted by an awestruck bartender with a hipster mustache who had to ask the hostess if the restaurant was still open or not.  Clearly it must not have been as two tables were sat, and 6 other people were having drinks at the bar.  It must have been closed.  So the two of us as well as the three behind us left in a embarassed fury and happened to walk right past the owner.  Maybe hipsters should stick to EMO and Music and stop opening restaurants.  Who TRAINS these people. Terrible Terrible Terrible.  We are going to give it one more shot, after all, they did just opened....and it is Greenpoint.
