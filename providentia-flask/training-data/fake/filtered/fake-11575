I was incredibly disappointed. I went for dinner last night with my boyfriend after wanting to go for a couple of months. We started with chips and guac ($10...seriously?!?) which was good, but not amazing, and certainly not worth the price. I had the Nopales salad for my meal and it was extremely salty. Not to mention drenched in dressing. My boyfriend ordered Sopa de Hongos and Camarones. His soup was overly seasoned.. not terrible, but not great. And for his Camarone they gave him 4 shrimp. In shell. With nothing else. I also ordered their Blanco Sangria, which was very tasty. Probably my favorite part. So it ended up being a good thing that we ordered $10 chips and guac, otherwise we both would have left there hungry. I will also say that our server was very nice and attentive. Unfortunately good service and a good cocktail can not save a meal. Definitely will not be going back.
