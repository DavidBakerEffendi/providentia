Sunday breakfast at  Sangkee inside the Sheraton near Drexel - If you're looking for someplace to have breakfast early on a Sunday morning in Philadelphia near the campuses of UPenn and Drexel, this is the place to go.  At night the venue becomes an Asian restaurant, in the morning it serves omelettes and waffles.  We looked everywhere for a place to go and this was the only place open before 11:00am.  The food was decent.  Service was good, considering the whole place was being run by a bunch of young kids.  They did their best and were very sweet trying to be helpful.
