I met some friends here on my last visit to New York and I was pleasantly surprised.  I can be a bit picky when it comes to Italian food but this place was amazing.  The decor was beautiful in a warm and elegant way without being stark or pretentious.  The server was friendly and professional and helped me pick out the perfect wine to go with my meal.  The food was delicious and it was an all around great experience.  The hotel it's in,The Greenwich, looks lovely as well.  Can't wait for my next visit.  Still thinking about my meal.
