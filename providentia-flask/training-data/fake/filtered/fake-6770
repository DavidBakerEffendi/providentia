This is the first review I have ever written online. My wife and I eat out all the time in NYC and I have never bothered to write anything about any of the places we have gone. Jack the Horse is worth the five minutes to sign up for yelp. The Mac & Cheese app. is one of the most delicious things I have ever tasted. The rest of the meal (Halibut, burger, watermelon soup) was excellent. A great meal in Brooklyn Heights! You must have the Mac & Cheese. I am serious. It is amazing.
