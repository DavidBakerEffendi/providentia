I went to this restaurant with my baby last Wednesday around 5 pm. I asked for a table for 2 and a baby, told them I was waiting for my husband. There were only two busy tables in the restaurant. When waiter sat us next to the restroom and never came back. I went to the bar where he was texting, and asked him if we could switch to another table, and so we did. When we moved to the other table, no one came to greet us, there were 4 waitress at the bar talking to each other and using their cell phone, and no one even bother to even look at us. After waiting 20 minutes, I saw one of the waitress taking off her sneaker and rubbing her foot, then she put her sneaker back and went back to the bar, without even washing her hands. Â  That's when I grabbed my baby and left. Absolutely no costumer service! Never coming back.
