DO NOT GO HERE. Got food poisining. My husband got the Black Label Burger, Medium Rare, and was vomiting all night from food poisoning. And it was his birthday! He had been looking forward to this dinner for a month. When we called, ARNOLD, the manager, was completely unhelpful. Not to mention he never called back when he said he would. He didn't even offer to refund our burger. We had  a very large bill for the night, it was my husband's birthday, and Minetta Tavern didn't even have the decency to refund the price of the burger which made him vomit all night.  They didn't offer anything. In fact, they weren't even that apologetic, because "they serve 40 of these burgers a night." The place is waaaay over rated. Both of us will never go back again. We love going out in NYC for dinner and have never once posted a negative review on a website since we know restaurants have their good and bad nights. This is our first negative review because we feel so strongly people need to know how over rated this place is and unhelpful the management is.
