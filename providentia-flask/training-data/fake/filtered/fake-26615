I've been to Stone Park Cafe a couple of times, and each time it's been great. That is, until the last time I went. I experienced a rude, tastes less, and crass waiter. I've never felt so uneasy and upset by a waiter and it's huge disservice. He was the most brusque waiter I had ever dealt with. Now I won't discredited the cafe altogether, however I strongly urge the manager to oversee closely his employees and the job they are doing. A disgusting waiter like this guy could seriously ruin a business and it's reputation. As a consumer, who you deal with directly and the experience they brought to you, can strongly persuade your feelings and perception's) in how you view the restaurant as a whole. Legendary customer service is EVERYTHING in my book. Like really, who wants to spend money and deal with a rude and crass waiter. Not I.
