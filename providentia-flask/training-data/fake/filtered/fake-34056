I don't get some of the bad reviews. This place was great. It has a parking lot, which in Montclair is huge. If its full at 8:00, well that's how it goes. Being an ex restaurant server, I know that sometimes you have to wait, even if you have a reservation. It happens. I waited 10 min for a table when I had an 8:30 reservation and thought that was perfectly fine. The food is authentic and amazing, and anyone on here who compares it to diner food should never be allowed to review a restaurant again. The whole grilled fish is awesome, and if you don't like bones in your fish, don't order it. No one will ever get all of them out. And its a whole fish. If you order a 2-3 lb. fish on a Fri or Sat, be prepared to wait, but it is so worth it. The service is impeccable. Tho, again here I may biased, as I used to serve. I understand when they're busy that they're only human. The atmosphere is great, but the place does get terribly loud. That's the only reason why I didn't give them 5 stars. We go there once a week (my wife is Greek) and order delivery from them once a week. Management is wonderful, continually making sure you're having a good time...we really feel like family. We even had our daughter's Christening party there, in their small private room. It was an amazing day, and they definitely helped with that. We've even had them cater 3 of our parties at home. Once, I picked up the trays and they were ready at the appropriate time. The second time they delivered them for us, and the third time not only did they deliver the trays, but I was able to hire one of their servers for the night to help set up, serve, explain to our guests what the dishes were, and clean up. This place, and its staff are wonderful.
