Went to meet friends for drinks... in the beer garden really cool! Didn't eat just drinks... my friends had some food but I got there late :( I am looking forward to eating there ... saw some yummy dishes coming out Now remember people its a DINER I'm not expecting to be wowed! If I want to be wowed I would go to a 6 Star restaurant ... Again Yelpers are HATERS when it comes to dining out ... they go to a 3 Star place looking to be pampered not for $35 a person COME ON ! Give the small business owner a break Don't be high maintenance! Singing OFF the REAL AMERICAN PS KATE M. REVIEWED THIS PLACE...NOTICE THE DATES OF HER REVIEWS ALWAYS AROUND THE SAME TIME OF THE MONTH :) hahah!
