While this restaurant does offer a wide range of gluten-free dishes, it's truly a pity that they don't actually know how to make risotto (you know, given the name they chose for their restaurant and all). I had dinner here with a group of 5 close friends, each of whom ordered a different risotto, and all of which I tasted.  Every last dish was bland and would have also been forgettable had it not been for the fact that the risotto was also grossly undercooked and salty. Those two things I will not soon forget.  There is strictly nothing delicious about eating grains of any kind of rice that are chalky and hard in the middle, nothing delicious about eating something where the only "flavor" is salt.  Yuck.  Also the gluten free bread sticks that I was told to be excited about (since they are apparently complimentary while you wait for your table) tasted like medicine and had a gummy consistency.  I think you could only like those things if you were so gluten-starved that you would accept anything that came even remotely close to bread, or if you had been gluten-free your whole life and NEVER tasted bread.  Either way, the bad food combined with the truly horrible service makes it such that I will never return to this establishment, and would not recommend it to anyone at all.
