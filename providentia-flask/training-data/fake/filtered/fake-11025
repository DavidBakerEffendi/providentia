My friends and I call this place the "yak". Found this joint on accident when it first opened a few years ago. I try to go back as much as I can, but I noticed that they changed a few things on the menu recently (maybe to cater to more western customers now). What happened to the onion salad?!?! Really good food if you are an adventurous eater. Not a good place for big groups or a first date with someone that is not willing to try "new" things. Be prepared to wait as well. Alcohol selection is very good and the wait staff is not bad to look at as well! My advice...Just order everything. Everything is good and has an authentic yakitori taste. Just don't be afraid to try something if it sounds weird or looks funny.
