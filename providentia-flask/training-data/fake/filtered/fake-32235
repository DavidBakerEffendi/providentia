As out of towners, we were looking for someplace with a nice atmosphere and good food.  Not too much to request right? Apparently at The Russell they're ok with their servers being rude and slow as sloths while serving mediocre reheated food. The server who sat us rolled her eyes at us and took her time to seat us.  Once we were seated we didn't see her again for a good 20 minutes just to get our waters. Had it been busy in there I would have excused her absence, but we were one of 3 tables.  By the time we were done eating she hadn't even checked on us, and I couldn't wait to just leave. Once the food came the penne was cold and stuck together like it had only been partially reheated in a microwave.  And the coconut shrimp are a joke.  The flavor is great but don't bother paying $8 for 5 shrimp the size of quarters. Definitely don't recommend this place to anyone.
