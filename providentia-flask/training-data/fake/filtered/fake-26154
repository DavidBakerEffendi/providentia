Best Mexican food I've had in a long time.  The prices are reasonable, the decor is nice and the service was very good.  The steak and pork soft tacos were excellent, the cheese enchilada standard.  The rice and beans were above average.  Chips were good but the salsa, while flavorful had too many onions.  Overall a good experience, we'll be back.  Easy to get to right off the GSP and near the NJT train station.
