I got the turkey bacon, egg, and cheese flat bread and it was like the size of a medium pizza folded in half for only $5.50. It was so flavorful and warm, and the flat bread is kind of chewy giving it the perfect texture. Very clean, spacious, well decorated, and friendly. The staff was very helpful when I clearly couldn't understand some of the dishes (because the names are Lebanese). You order at a counter but can then sit down and have it brought out to you or take it to go. They have a very nice patio with plenty of seating in addition to the spacious interior. The patio is shaded and has hanging plants giving it a really relaxing vibe. And there's an ice cream and smoothie shop that seem to be run by the same people attached. They also offer many authentic middle eastern brands of food if you want ingredients for cooking at home. Definitely coming back soon! To sum up my opinion: I was planning to go to the grocery store today and I don't want to anymore because I just want to eat every meal here from now on.
