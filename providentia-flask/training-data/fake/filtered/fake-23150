A good steakhouse should offer quality and service. Thie Alexus Steakhouse offers neither. I came with my gusets for a Sunday dinner. We oredered onion soups. The soup was delivered lukewarm not hot. We had to send the soup back. When the soup was returned the server did not know the basics for serving. We oredered Porterhouse steaks. The waitress delivered the steaks but literally disappeard. We wanted to have steak sauce but the waitress was nowhere to be found. At a steakhoiuse you would expect to have have glasses of glass not plastic glasses that would be served at a diner. Â The tableclothes were not ironed but wrinkled with stain marks. The clothe napkins were old with holes in them. It They apepared to be like rewashed rags. Perhaps this is more of a restaurant for hamburgers and beer. This should not be called a Steak House. I CANNOT RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT FOR A STEAK LOIVER..
