I've had a good and bad experience with Juniper.  I am a visitor in Brooklyn for a month and last week went to Juniper for the first time, had the Jambalaya - was delicious and the service was excellent.  Tonight I had a completely different experience, when I arrived I did not feel welcome, different staff and then overheard a bit of an argument in the kitchen.  Not offered water, which was in copious amounts a few days ago.  When the food came out (fish and chips) the fish was sort of watery and spongy inside the batter - really awful and made me feel nauseous.  The chef is really nice and both times came out to ask if the food was okay, I didn't have the heart to tell him the fish wasn't nice.  But the fries rock  So perhaps tonight was just a bad night.
