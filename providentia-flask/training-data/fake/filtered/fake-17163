YaHOO! Texas Roadhouse! We let the host know it was our first time at Texas Roadhouse! We were seated immediately this Sunday night around 6:00 p.m. and welcomed by the owner, "Mike." He put an American Flag in our pail of peanuts (which we loved!) and then, "Joe" our waiter welcomed us, too! Wow! Warm, friendly staff! The peanuts are great, although it's not in our genetic code to toss the shells on the floor! The bread, fresh baked steaming wonderful rolls served with maple butter were superb! "Joe" recommended the New York strip steaks, and we both had house salads with bleu cheese dressing, he had the baked sweet potato, I had the steak fries! The steaks were cooked to perfection, "rare" and seasoned so well we never had to add anything! He had the 22 ounce frosted mug of Blue Moon beer, I had a wine spritzer and the total tab was under $55.00! Wow! It was a great experience, fun, family atmosphere, country music, rustic, wood "Texas style" interior and we came HUNGRY and left HAPPY!
