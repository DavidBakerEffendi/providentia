One star for the atmosphere, one for the huge wine menu. And that's it. It seems I disagree everybody but I didn't really enjoyed it. The food is good, but not great, and the portions are really mini-mini, when you look at the prices. We waited 45 minutes to be seated (the waitress said 20 minutes), and then more than one hour after we ordered ! I know Italian food is overrated, but still...
