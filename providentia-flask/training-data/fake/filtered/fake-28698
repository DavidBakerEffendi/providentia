I came here three times and I'm never coming back here again. I ordered the chicken bento box the first time. Salmon the second time, and Chinese food the third time. None of them reached my expectation. The chicken was over cooked, the salmion was black one side, and the chinese food had no taste. The teriyaki sauce in the bento box was so watery. The stir-fry chinese food was very bland and the meats were dry. None of the dishes had the wok-seared taste. Several of my friends went there and they said this place is not good. I don't know why I always see so many people seating there. Is it becuase thye posted the 100 top restaurant poster on their window? I guess the non-Asain people can't tell what real Chinese food taste like. Just like I can't tell if I'm eating good Italian pasta.
