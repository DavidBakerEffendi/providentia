I must say that this is the only instance where yelp reviews have seriously let me down. Given this and my love for Batali's other restaurants, I went in with high expectations. The antipasti I tried (beets with pisatchios and prosciutto) were uninteresting, but I was willing to overlook this if the pastas and desserts proved to be good. Not so; my carbonara would have been greatly enhanced with the addition of more bacon and my sister's gnocchi with sausage and fennel was lackluster. To top this off, my desset, the tartuffo, was essentially an ice cream version of a Ferrero Rocher (hint: not a compliment). Conclusion: skip this place and head over to Babbo or Del Posto (if you can afford it!).
