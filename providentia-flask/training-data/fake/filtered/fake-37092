I was staying in Newark Hilton and happened on to this Barbeque - the place I visited didn't seem to have any seating which was fine because I was looking for carry out.  AWESOME bbq.  We ordered the combo platter for less than $14 which was enough food to feed 2 to 4 people.    Amazing flavor, quality and value.  A definite go back when I'm in the area.
