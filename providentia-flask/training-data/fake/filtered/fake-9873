Wonderful dinner!  We walked in Monday evening and although it was busy, got a table after waiting a few minutes.  Offered us a great Barolo that was not on the menu.  ordered the sheep's milk ricotta, which was good, but not amazing.  The lamb sliders were great.  Scallops were absolutely delicious- pancetta and zucchini on top, on a bed of sweet corn 'polenta' - perfect.  The pesto pasta was also good.  Great service, great food!
