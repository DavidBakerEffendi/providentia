Two words: mice infested. U have been warned. Husband and I were there for a late lunch as i was craving brazilian food. What a big mistake. Its clearly low end, the rodizio is inexpensive and it comes with a large selection of dishes from the buffet. As soon as i saw the mouse under the buffet table i couldnt eat what was on my plate. I brought it to the attention of the waiter and he said: "I know, i saw him and have been trying to catch it". Just like that, as it was no big deal. Never again. Gross.
