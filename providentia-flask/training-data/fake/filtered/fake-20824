We travel from upstate NY to CT. quite often to see family.  My sister turned us on to this place and we absolutely love it!  We are always met at the door by either a waitress or the owners and seated promptly.  The young ladies who work here are super friendly and very attentive to your needs.  We have never been disappointed.  The side salads are always fresh and tasty and they even change the fresh vegetables in them through out the week. I have had the lobster roll-YUMMY.  One of the waitress's suggested whole wheat bananna nut pancakes which were wonderful!  We make the trip from Milford Ct to West Haven just to go here.  We laugh that we could eat all our meals here!  Please go, sit back and enjoy.  Great prices, great food, great people!!
