I have been a repeat customer of the orange squirrel since it has opened and really love this place.  Im sick of nj restaurants and the OS is a breath of fresh air.  Many people complain it is in a " not so great area" which is a complete ignorant statement, made by close minded individuals.  The atmosphere, music and movies are great and the servers are mainly kind and knowledgeable.  The food is simple, and delish ( which is hard to pull off) and the weekend specials are vibrant and interesting.  Try the mussels, ravioli, rib eye, whole fish and lamb chops!  Love all the sides ( fontina mac/chz and polenta!) and the old mans whisky sour.  Friendly staff, yummy food and a sexy dim lit atmosphere, check it out!
