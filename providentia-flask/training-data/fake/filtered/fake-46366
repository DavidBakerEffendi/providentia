This was my first time there with a friend. I ordered the Kakuni (pork belly) and the Akamaru ramen. Decor - The place was pretty nice. Didn't at all feel like a ramen place (but I guess in a good way). We were seated at this bench which strangely enough was in front of a mirror so from time to time my friend and I would be staring into a mirror (which was a little odd while eating). 4/5 stars Service - Waiter/waitresses were great. Filled up my water without asking. Food came promptly and they always greeted us with a smile. 5/5 stars Food - I don't know about anyone else but does the food kind of remind you of Chinese food? The pork belly appetizer was very tasty. Came with 2 pieces of braised pork belly and 2 halved soy marinated hard boiled eggs. Honestly, if you served this was served to me in another restaurant my first thought would have been "oh...Chinese braised pork with soy eggs". Regardless though, it tasted pretty good. The Akamaru ramen was pretty good. Noodles actually is pretty similar to the ones they have at Minca. Noodles seem fresh and had good chewiness to them. Normally I don't associate these noodles with traditional ramen noodles but it was tasty. Amount of noodles was a tad on the light side. Didn't care too much for the slices of pork on the side (there were 2 thin slices). The saving grace as others have put it was the broth. It was flavorful yet it had this really light feel to it. I'm not completely sold on it yet but strangely I nearly drank most of it (which I NEVER do). The main reason is because I hate feeling super thirsty afterwards (which I am feeling now). 4/5 stars I'm not 100% sure I can rate this place over Setagaya (probably need to try it at least one more time) and honestly I haven't tried Mitsuwa so I don't have a great comparison for best ramen joint in NYC. At least this place in my opinion is better than Rai Rai Ken, Minca and Momofuku.
