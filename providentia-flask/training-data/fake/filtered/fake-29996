Very torn. On the one hand the Upstate deserves highest praise for the comfortably-priced, Â incredibly fresh oysters, beautifully presented entrees and intriguing craft beers and free (!!!!!) taste of a perfect dessert, all served with wit and a sense of friendship. On the other hand as much as the restaurant may compel such admiration, it really isn't very big and if too many people find out about Upstate and love it too, there probably won't be enough space for me when I return.
