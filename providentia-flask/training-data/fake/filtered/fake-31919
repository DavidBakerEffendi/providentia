I found this place on the internet... I'll try anything once. I walked in and thought... this place is small...I don't drink sangria... I'll give it a shot. Up the stairs around the bend... WOW... this place looks awesome, I hope the food is just as good as the place looks. They gave me these little breads and a small bowl with mashed black bean (I think that's what it was)... Delicous!!!!! I wanted more!!!! I ordered as an app Camarones, (I wish you can see the expression on my face) an onion ring, guacamole on the bottom with shrimp dripped in some kind of rum sauce... I wanted to lick the plate. For dinner... Bistec, made it exactly the way I wanted it!!!! Fried yuma sticks, the salad and let's not forget the rice and black beans (the reason I was in the mood for Cuban food to begin with). Desert... Cocos... coconut ice cream, chcolate shell, raspberry suace.... I will be back again soon. A little pricy but you get what you pay for. AWESOME!!!
