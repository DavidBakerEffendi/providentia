Where to begin. The first time I went here was after going to the NYC Chef Talk at the NY Times building. Almost immediately after walking in the door you forget that you are in New York city. We sat at this small table in the dining room area. It was hard to decide what to get as an appetizer but we decided on the Calamari. It was perfectly crisp and the fried lemon slices that come with it are also a bit yummy to nibble on. It was also perfectly seasoned, not to much salt just the right amount. For dinner I got the Pappardelle allo Spezzatino d'Agnello. It almost instantly brought me back to my childhood. It reminded me of a dish that my grandmother would make me. The meat is so moist it almost falls apart in your mouth. The little bit of olives are a perfect match with the meat in that it gives you a little "punch" of salt. The pasta is made in house and trust me you can tell, it was perfect. I have been back several times since this special night and I have recommended it to my boyfriends brother who also loved it. Oh and if you enjoy fennel, you must try the roasted fennel as a side.
