I had a wonderful experience at Lulu & Me Gastrobar last night.  The staff could not have been more charming, accommodating and attentive.  Every single dish that we ordered was delicious.  The shrimp and cod that we had were fresh, perfectly cooked and flavorful.  The way that the chef seasons her dishes is subtle yet spectacular and allows the ingredients to shine.  Everything we ordered tasted so fresh and light but had really complex flavor profiles.  This is definitely the way that I love my food!  I would give this place the very highest recommendation.  Prices are also extremely low for the high level of quality and great service.  Not one disappointing note from soup to nuts, as they say.  Bravo!!
