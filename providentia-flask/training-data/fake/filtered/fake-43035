This place is decorated perfectly, and includes a hidden bookshelf secret door. Their cocktails are amazing, the 'switchel backs' in particular are unique and addictive--sort of a ginger kombucha drink with whiskey in it or accompanying. The potatoes are cooked in duck fat and I'm now sure every potato should be. The staff is friendly, attentive, and you don't want to miss out on the $5 home made corn dogs on their late night menu.
