Went there last December as a group. This place is very cute, but also very small. If you like it cozy, you'll be fine. If you prefer a little elbow space DO NOT go there! We all shared a couple of different dishes. The food was good, but nothing special. I liked it, but I don't feel the need to go back there anytime soon.
