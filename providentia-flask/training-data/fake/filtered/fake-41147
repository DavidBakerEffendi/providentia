Went there for the first time yesterday. The food was ok, I think i had better ramens. We order the Char Siu Pork, it was so good ( for people who like fatty meats), the TOTTO SPICY RAMEN and also spicy tuna don. The soup base was a little salty, the ramens is ok ( the noodles are a little bit raw) and the meat was a little bit over cook. I think they are more famous for Char Siu Pork than their ramen (so this is like a must order item). The spicy tuna don was delicious, it is a little spicy, with hot rice on the bottom. Overall, the food was ok. What I don't like about this place is that it is really crowded, and they try to rush you out the minute you sit down. While you wait for your table, they will give you the menu and ask you to order first. (Tip: Look at their menu and figure out what you want to order before you get there) This is not a place where you can just sit for an hour and chit chat.
