Had the pleasure dining and exploring the brunch menu at Drunken Munkey NYC (DM) on the UES.  While this is far from my regular hood, I am definitely making this spot a regular pit stop for brunch and drinks.  I was with a group of friends, so we had the opportunity to sample almost all of their brunch menu along with some excellent libations to wash it all down.  We started with masala tea, infused with cardamom which was an excellent way to start the brunch.  We started with the classic chilli cheese toast which was excellent and instantly brought me back to my childhood when I used to look forward to this treat, now I get to have it in NYC!  We shared a bunch of entrees, the chilli cheese omlette, the lamb burger, the unda kaati roll, the pav bhaji burger and the butter chicken.  The sides of "Bombay Aaloo" and "Cripsy Okra" was a great change from the traditional brunch sides and we ended up ordering more of the crispy okra on the side.  We also ventured and got some desserts and the "cricket" rum ball and the carrot "halwa" were outstanding.  We got a second order of the Carrot "halwa".  In terms of taste and portion size, everything was top notch and I could not decide what I would get the next time I came to eat here!  The libation of choice for our table was an innovative take on the traditional Bloody Mary and an excellent multi ingredient and refreshing Punch.  The bar looks great and I look forward to being here to try their cocktail menu which was extensive and versatile.  The DM did not miss a beat despite their brand new brunch menu.  The staff was excellent with an attentive front of the house and a knowledgeable bar keep.  I could not recommend this place more and I wish them continued success and I expect to be back there very soon.
