I lived down the street from Bonnie's Grill for 5 years.  It is by far my favorite place to get a burger, wings, and a good pint in New York City.  It is one of my favorite restaurants in the city, period.  They have a rotating selection of draft beers that are always solid.  The music is always stellar (if you're into Bowie, The Clash, Ramones, Tom Waits, Hank Williams.. you know, the good stuff).  The burgers are as good as it gets.  The Catfish burgers are great too.  Always consistent.  I always bring my friends here when they come to visit from out of town.  Expect a line though.  Its usually busy but worth the wait!
