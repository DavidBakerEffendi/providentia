I was looking forward to dining at this restaurant and went there on a Friday night. We were greeted with indifference and seated at a table which was so close to each other that I felt that I was in a aeroplane rather than a restaurant. The waiters were literally touching me while serving the table next to me. I could hear everything from the next table . The food was good but very overpriced as were the drinks. The service was decent. I have dined at many good restaurants and enjoy fine dining. So, if you value some basic things such as comfortable seating, good service, personal space and your wallet , one 53 will disappoint you. As for me, I would rather spend my money at a real good restaurant and get what I have paid for.
