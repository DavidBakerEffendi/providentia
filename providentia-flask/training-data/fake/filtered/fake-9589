The drinks here were really good and reasonably priced for their quality.  The vibe was surprisingly chill considering how classy this place looks.  The bartenders were really friendly and my partner and I enjoyed the cheese plate we split.  We would definitely come back next time we are in the mood to treat ourselves and we are in the area!
