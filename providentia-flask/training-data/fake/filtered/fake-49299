If I need a quick and delicious meal, Hanco's is my go to. I couldn't care less that the space is small and not necessarily aesthetically pleasing. It gets the job done and thats all i need. I typically get the grilled chicken rice vermicelli and always get the peanut butter sauce instead of the one they typically provide--always amazing! The shredded chicken sandwich, a sure staple in my family, is also incredible. Be careful though because the medium hot is a little hotter than you might expect! It is delicious, no doubt about it, but fair warning. I've heard their bubble tea is good, but i'm not a huge BT fan to begin with. Also, get their spring rolls. It's a rice film wrapped around lettuce, shrimp, and rice noodles. You dip that in the peanut sauce and you are all good! The best Vietnamese sandwhich joint in the city...hands down!
