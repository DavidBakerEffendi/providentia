Great atmosphere, excellent service, and tremendous ceviche and appetizers, all complimented by a fantastic, simple drink menu (loved the Havana Old Fashioned).  The entrees had a hard act to follow, but they held up just fine.  The crispy pork was fantastic, the tuna just good.   This place works for just about any occasion.  M wife and I went on our anniversary, but we'll be back with friends.  Give it a try - you won't be disappointed.  If you are, you did it wrong.
