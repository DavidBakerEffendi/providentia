Although the food is decent, it's wildly overrated considering the price. $22 for three tiny pieces of chicken on a smear of mashed potatoes? No thanks. The atmosphere is nice and the staff was friendly, but I would never go back simply because it's too expensive. I'd be more willing if the food was really fantastic, but it's nothing special. I've had better for under $10.
