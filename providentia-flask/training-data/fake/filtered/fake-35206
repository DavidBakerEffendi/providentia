While I was walking I came across Gaia Italian cafe. I decided to go in and try it! I was glad I went in. I loved the small feel of it. It felt cozy. I tried the pesto lasagna. It was one of the greatest lasagnas I have ever tasted. The customer service was incredible and quick. I would highly recommend this restaurant to my friends and family!
