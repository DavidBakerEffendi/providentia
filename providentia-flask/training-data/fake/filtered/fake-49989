My wife had food poisoning associated with this restaurant on Sept 15.  She got ill there; they did not take to it so good.  She noticed that someone else had been ill in the toilet, too.  We're suspecting it's the meatballs or the side polenta, as the latency was only an hour. On the other hand, the food tasted great; the service was great; the atmosphere was great.  We ate the brioche french toast, duck hash, OJ, bacon, and ricotta meatballs.
