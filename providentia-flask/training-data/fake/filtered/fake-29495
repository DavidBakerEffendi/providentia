I was visiting from out of town and was in the area buying souveniers. My son (who lives in New York) and I wanted Italian food and checked several restaurants in the area. Trattoria Trecolori had the best prices by far, so we went there. It was a Friday night so it was busy and loud. In other words, typical NY restaurant. We had a little bit of a wait while some tables cleared and once we were seated, our waiter took too long in between visits to check on us. However, when he did, he was attentive and thorough.  Minor incoveniences, we felt. An exception to this was we did not notice the specials posted at the entrance and our waiter did not mention them until after we'd labored over our menus trying to make our selections.  Each of our dishes were great, Chicken Parmigiana and Fettucini Alfredo w/ chicken. The prices were quite reasonable and the food was excellent.  I will definitely return to Trattoria Trecolori whenever I visit New York!
