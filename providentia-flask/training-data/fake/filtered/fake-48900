It was stifling hot in the restaurant. The waiter said a few times they would turn up the AC but it never happened. My mom, in town for the night, was wiping sweat off her face the whole time. I saw a few other tables just leave. We got a medium rare steak and macaroni and cheese and it took an hour and ten minutes to receive it. The waiter said that the kitchen got backed up but only offered that up after we asked where the food was. The macaroni and cheese was so hard on top when we got it because it had been sitting under the food lamp for at least 15 minutes. Not impressed.
