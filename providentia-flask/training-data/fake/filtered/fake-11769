For Â a quick casual meal out here and there I guess it's okay. The menu isbasic, only a handful of options. My only criticism is that the food could be spicier. I ordered the extra spicy curry pan and while very good, it was probably closer to mild. Similarly, I ordered the hot curry and it tasted prety mild as well. It was delicious though. I would honestly give this place closer to 2.5 stars, if I could do half does!
