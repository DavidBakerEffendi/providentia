This place was excellent.  It is fixed-priced but I have to say we ate like kings.  This place is perfect for a special night out -- we were surrounded by people on dates. I started off with cocktail that was very good -- I ended up ordering 2 more of the same. The menu was complicated but our server took the time to answer all of our questions.  Everything that came to the table was extraordinary looking and well presented.  Between the four of us, we tried everything and no one complained. I can't wait for another occasion to present itself so I can return for another fantastic meal.
