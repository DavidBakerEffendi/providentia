Yesterday I dined with my husband at Eno Terra - it was my birthday. It was not the first time that we ate there. We live on the corner - and go to your restaurant from time to time. This time - yesterday will be my last. The service that was provided was not that you advertise. We were seated in the row of small tables. You can't escape the flow of the energy from the tables around you. This is a given fact. And you can't expect that everyone will be willing to understand this. This is ok. However, After sitting at the table where I was and allowing a guy in the corner table overpowering a conversation, intruding into it the dining experience around, being loud and basically being rude - it got to me. What do you do? You are still eating you have to put up with this crap. Or maybe I should have asked to be reseated - but I did not. We left for the bar as soon as possible and as soon as we finished dining at that table. We talked to the manager. What really makes me not to go back is the answer we got from the manager. "The loud guy is our regular customer. We can't do anything about it." Well, if he is the regular customer, then - who am I? you do not want to loose a regular customer, but you definitely lost me, and those who participated in the experience, but did not speak out. But I will definitely make sure that the community and the ZAGAT environment ( if you are participating) are aware about how the Eno Terra treats the non-regular customers.
