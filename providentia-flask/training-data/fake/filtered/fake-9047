i worked in Princeton about 15 years ago at a pizza shop on Witherspoon street.  We ate HH sometimes and the food was decent and yes i know I worked at a place with steaks but you wanna eat out sometimes so don't inquire .  The cheesesteaks are steakums on big rolls with alot of condiments. I am a Philly boy and that's a no-no.  The food again is decent but now I hear they are trying to replicate Rutgers roach coaches with Fat sandwiches, why bother and mess with a  formula i.e. new coke.  George's next door was owner or is family etc and when he had it the food was better and his chicken shop had awesome roasted potatoes.  What my rant is saying is that ok food not great and  the students flock there cause nothing in Princeton is open late but Wawa and for kids of priviledge they are cheap with daddy's money so HH offers good prices and in my opinion people will sacrifice quality for quanity and cheaper prices.
