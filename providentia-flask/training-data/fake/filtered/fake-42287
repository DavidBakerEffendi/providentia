Tried this place based on recommendation from a friend. True the prices are dirt cheap... especially for food in NYC.. but flavor, cleanliness, and just overall taste is so overrated. I ordered the cabbage and pork steam dumplings (10 in one order) and the sesame sandwich with pecking duck. The dumpling skins were thick... which I didn't mind, but the flavor was lacking. Definitely needed seasoning and more cabbage.. it was loaded with meat and didn't have a nice balance. The sesame pecking duck wasn't too bad just that the duck meat was dry and had no flavor. Total rip off even though it was only 1.25. I've definitely tried better and would recommend that if you did go there..try not to have any high expectations. Also, it's a to-go kind of place so don't expect tables or chairs.. they have some but they are like bar style with stools.
