I can count on one finger the number of times in my life I have left at $0.00 tip. That one finger is my middle finger, Brooklyn Crab. No need to run through the litany of horrors; I experienced all of the indignities that my fellow yelpers have mentioned and more. I give them one star because there's no zero-star option, and because I did have one happy moment at Brooklyn Crab: as my husband and I were leaving, we stopped to offer the owner/manager our advice, because truly, I would love to see this place succeed but there is just so, so very much to fix! A line began to form behind us as we talked to her. Perhaps the 3 hours with no food and one lukewarm Pacifico had made me delirious, but it reminded me of the scene in Airplane when the passengers start lining up in the aisle to "calm down" the hysterical woman, waiting patiently with their clubs, baseball bats, tire irons... so that made me giggle. Otherwise there was absolutely nothing redeeming about the evening. Time subtracted from my life never to be regained.
