I thought that this place was great and have been there several times for both lunch and dinner.  The cuisine is Greek Cypriot.  I am half Greek and seek out Greek restaurants and Kanella is the best I have eaten at in Philadelphia or elsewhere.  One interesting note is that my Mother is first generation in America Greek and doesn't like to go out to eat anywhere because it's "never as good as home."  Somehow I convinced her to go to Kanella (I think she was really hungry and there was nothing at home).  She complained all the way there from Elkins Park, but she really loved it.  And she knows Greek food.  She also enjoyed talking with the chef/owner and staff.  Kanella is my favorite restaurant in Philly.
