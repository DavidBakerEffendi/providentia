I rarely give a 5* review but this new restaurant really blew me away. Had a fantastic meal there last week whilst in NYC for 36hr stopover on a Fri night when the place was buzzing. The menu is fantastic value for NY and the quality is high, great variety of food from seafood to steaks, the seafood tower offered a great starter & twists on the classic chilled seafood starters - best oysters I've tasted! We had a rib-eye main to share (the most expensive thing on the menu at $90 - but we were celebrating!) but it was worth every cent. Delicious bone-marrow Bearnaise to accompany it as well. The cocktails were unusual twists on classic styles that worked flawlessly on your palate - I loved the Almond Gin Fizz (like a lemon sherbet!) and my boyfriend raved about the refreshing celery one (!!) that lifted him right out of his flu-symptons! I think another reviewer mentioned that the celery gimlet was a top hit too! We met some friends after our meal for drinks in the upstairs bar and they also commented on the excellent and attentive service, not too over-bearing but perfectly balanced and always there with what you needed - toothpicks threw them but them appeared with some small skewers that worked even better than the real thing! Decor is atmospheric and cosy, it's a little warm downstairs (in a warm Sept) so you might want to opt for upstairs seating (although it's noisier as it's near the bar) A top top choice for NYC and definitely on my list of venues for my next visit!
