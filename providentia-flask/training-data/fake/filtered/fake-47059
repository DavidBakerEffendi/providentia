I have tried all the best Neapolitan pizza in the NY (Franny's, Roberta's, Keste etc..) Unfortunately, there is no real alternative to having that quality pizza lunchtime, without getting an entire pie. Enter Rubirosa. They offer about 3 of their varieties, by the slice, until 5pm. I had a slice of the classic, very reasonably priced at $2.50. The slice was excellent with a very crisp wafer crust and a proper blend of marinara sauce and cheese. A lot of the other spots tend to overwhelm the amazing sauce they have with a heavy does of cheese. While the pizza was delicious, it is not what earned a five star rating by this poster. I can unequivocally state that they have the best cheese calzone in NYC. Â Stuffed to the brim inside a crispy delicious dough, is a melody of cheese that deserves to make it onto my last meal menu.
