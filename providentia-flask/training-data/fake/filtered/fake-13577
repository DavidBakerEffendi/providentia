I really want to like this place. Cool looking room with a decent wine and beer list, and there is always a crowd here. But I just can't get behind the food. It's mediocre at best, overpriced and we all left hungry. I'd come here for a glass of wine maybe, but there are much better food options in the neighborhood.
