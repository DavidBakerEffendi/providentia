Cute restaurant and fish market in one without the smell. Waiters were mixed in service. One seemed quickly annoyed when my friend asked the differences between two beers. However, another recommended 2 bisques to share among three of us versus each ordering one considering all the other items we ordered, and he was spot on. Crab and lobster pumpkin bourbon bisque was delicious! Highly recommended. We didn't come for happy hour but it'd be worth it for the oysters. They were fresh and tasty. The other appetizers we had were good but the bisque and oysters were what stood out for us.
