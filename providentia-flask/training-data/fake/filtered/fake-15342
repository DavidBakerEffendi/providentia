Great food but crowded.  The meatball starter was good.  The spinach ravioli and steak dinners were both outstanding.  Our waitress was cool and we only had to wait a few minutes.  The downside is that the place is cramped, but otherwise the atmosphere was relaxed but fun.  I'll definitely be back.  Oh, and great negroni.
