Love, love, love! Adorable intimate cafe with great cocktails, mouthwatering food, charming character and a lovely staff. Recently went with friends for my second visit. The first time was in the winter when it was cozy. This trip all of the windows and the doors at the front of the establishment were open giving it a very European feel. I wish it were in my neighborhood, but it is worth the commute.
