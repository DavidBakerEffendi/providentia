Great for a late night drink and food. I live nearby and can rely on this place for a solid steak, mashed potatoes and green beens up to 2 am any day of the week. Also a great brunch spot as well. I love the fact that you can sit outside and enjoy the great weather (assuming its summer). They also have really good mussels on red or white sauce. Not amazing food but a solid reliable place.
