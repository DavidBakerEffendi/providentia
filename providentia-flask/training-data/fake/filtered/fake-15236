Whether for a date or a group dinner, this restaurant has consistently been great.  The serving staff was great fun and knew their menu (with delicately placed recommendations / highly appreciated guidance to specific dishes).  Also, this was my first time to ever send a bottle of wine back (cork had a streak, wine had gone bad).  Our server, Kate, warned me before I tried it about the cork and she was dead on--she could have just served it without thinking about that, but took the extra step for great service.  It seemed as if  she had a personal vested interest in the enjoyment in the meal and the view of the restaurant. Two benefits are that 1) if you either don't bring enough wine or do not want to hassle with picking it up yourself their wine list is only $10 over cost which you really see when you look at the list, and 2) the specials.  Don't be afraid to go off menu.
