we were impressed by the valet parking and the ambiance. But soon we realized that it was going to be a disaster when there were only two vegetarian dishes in the menu. The service was lousy, the waiters were not knowledgeable about the dishes and refused to check if they could serve few vegetarian dishes that were in the lunch menu. The appetizers were cold and soggy. They served the vegetarian dishes first and forgot to bring the naan. When the manager asked us how was everything, we told him it was bad and he did not even apologize, let alone offer to make up for the lousy service. He said, next experience will be better. Like we are going there again. By far the worst Indian food I have ever eaten. It was too dark, warm and stuffy....agree it was 95 F temp outside but turning the AC to a lower setting would have helped.
