we had not  been to Brigid's for years, but even though thei menu is much changed from the Belgin influenced cuisine we had previously enjoyed; both the food and the service were impeccable during our impromptu visit on May 4...we had no reservations, but as we were early for dinner....we were quickly accommodated and the meals our party of 5 was presented with were  of superior quality and showed creativity and imagination on behalf of the chef!  Bravo Brigid's, we will be back soon!
