This place is flat out the best slice you'll get in NYC other than Dom's (Difara).  And a much better dining experience, as the space is cozy and dimly lit.  I would rate the best 3 NY pies as: 1. Difara 2. Lucali 3. (and I'm gonna get killed for this)  L+B Spumoni gardens. I really have had them all, and I stand by my review.
