This is my favorite bar / restaurant in down town new haven. Every Thursday night they have karaoke night. Once in awhile they have local artist perform such as jimmy z and the broomstick bandits. They food is good and the drink prices aren't too bad at all. It's never overly crowded but never dead. The bartender genie is an absolute sweetheart. Go here. Now.
