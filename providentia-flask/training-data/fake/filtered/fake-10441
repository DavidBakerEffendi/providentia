I went to Tattooed Mom to hang out with friends. If you are a non drinker having a soda this may not be the place for you. This is based on having to ask for a refill or just being one and done. Don't order water unless you are prepared for it to arrive in a plastic cup. Â If you order from the menu unless clear ask what comes on it as I found jalapena peppers on chicken quesodilla. The menu ommited this important ingredient.
