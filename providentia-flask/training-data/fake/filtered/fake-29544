Food was great (what I had of it).  Service was lousy. Everyone at my table received their entrees, except me.  Busboy who delivered them mentions to the waiter that I don't have an entree. Waiter comes over and tells me he will check on my order with the kitchen.  He returns a few minutes later to ask what I ordered (turkey milanese). After 15 minutes, everyone finishes their entrees.  My entree finally arrives. I tell the waiter I don't want it.  We had to leave for a concert.  It is then that the waiter tells me my entree is on the house.  No explanation for the delay.   While the waiter later apologizes and took responsibility for never putting in the order, I never had dinner.  The waiter could have explained the situation at the outset and offered a replacement that could have been prepared quickly. The owner made no attempt to apologize or make the situation right.
