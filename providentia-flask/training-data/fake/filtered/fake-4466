I keep trying to like this place, I really do (outside seating, a close stumble home).. But every time I come here I'm reminded why I leave so angry!  Service is just awful... AWFUL!  The host always underestimates the wait time, servers take FOREVER to get orders/bring drinks so you're better off getting a pitcher, every meatless option I've tried on the menu has been bland at best, and I can't seem to get out of there without spending a ton of money on an awful experience.
