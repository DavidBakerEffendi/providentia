this is a restaurant that i had repeatedly visit. But their food is worse every time i go back!! last saturday, i ordered their famous Hainanese chicken over rice. I brought it home and SURPRISE!!! they cut me the worst chicken i had ever seen and it was so damn gross that i had to throw my dish away. i called the restaurant and no apology whatsoever. all they said was bring it back and we will exchange for you tomorrow?! bad service, bad food... dont ever go there, its overrated and there are plenty of good malaysian restaurant out there.
