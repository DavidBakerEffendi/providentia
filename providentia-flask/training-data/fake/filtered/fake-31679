The only reason I am giving this two stars is because I have been here many times before and the food is quite good. My experience last night, however, was anything but. May I preface this by saying, yes, it was New Years Eve, so yes, it was expected to be busy and service a bit slower than usual but NOTHING and I mean NOTHING excuses the service (or lack there of) we received. Upon being seated we were warned service would be slower than usual, so I expected a half hour to forty minutes to get food rather than the usual twenty. Okay, fine. After the first fifteen minutes we had to wave someone over just to pay attention to us and bring us a drink. After another fifteen minutes we had to wave over someone else to get us an order. No one showed up on their own volition. We had to request any attention at all. One hour later, we had still not been served. After an hour, we requested a check-in on our food and were told (with attitude) that "we are busy, can't you see that? it could be another hour until you get served!" Direct quote. At that, we walked out, never to return again. Never have I had an experience so poor in my life.
