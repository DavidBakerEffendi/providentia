I took a Spanish friend here last night.  Before we got our food I joked with him that he probably wouldn't be impressed, given how good Spanish food is.   We order the foie gras donut and the skate.  The former actually did impress him. Win.  The donut came out hot, golden and slightly crispy, the brightness of the berry sauce blended superbly with the rich, earthy foie.  So good. Eat it while it's hot. The skate dish LOOKS gorgeous.  The skate is fried, then fanned out beautifully and dressed with greens and a (mole?) sauce, mango dressing, rice and beans.  I found the dish appetizing but a bit too salty.   The menu will not overwhelm you.  There are only a handful of things listed under "small plates" and "large plates" so you're not going to have to deal with the paralyzing array of options some menus present. The wait staff were very nice. The atmosphere is that of a typical hip Brooklyn bar: dark wood, low lights a blend of classy and grungy hipster.
