I was in the mood for meatballs during a recent visit back to CT, and Salute was just to spot to satisfy my craving.  Who would have thought such a creation such as a meatball salad existed.  Well cooked, tender meatballs with a host of delicious accompaniments, served with great garlic bread.  When back to CT the next time, wil definitely try to make another visit.
