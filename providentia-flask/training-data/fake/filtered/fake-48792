My review of the Ramen Bar is EXTREMELY POOR!! After waiting for the ramen to come out for about 30 minutes, i asked my waitress if the food my wife and i ordered takes longer than usual, she told me she didn't know and then walked away. 5 minutes later, seeing 6 tables that have seated after us got their food, I asked her if she had forgotten to put my order in and she told me she had "forgotten" to put my order in and that she would put it in now.... and then walked away.     So about 40 minutes on waiting for an appetizer, a bowl of Ramen and other dish, our food was NEVER ordered and apparently no one at the restaurant thought someone should have appologized for what had happened. I called the waitress and asked if there is a manager on duty and she told me "there isn't anyone here you can talk to right now" and walked away. I WAS PRETTY MAD. When I insisted on talking to someone in charge, becasue the waitress was keep telling me "there isn't anything she could do or to call", she got me this asian lady and she wasn't even wearing a uniform and she was in hurry to go somewhere. So when I was "TRYING" to tell this asian lady what had just happened, she simply told me we will get the food out soon and they would give us 20% off on the tab... AT THIS POINT I WAS FURIOUS. She treated me like i was putting on this "show" to get the food cheap or something cause instead of listening to what I had to say, she just heard what she wanted to hear and just walked away like how waitress had treated us. When my wife and I got up to walk out, that's when our appetizer comes out... they are such a great establishment. I WOULD NEVER GO BACK TO THIS ESTABLISHMENT AS LONG AS THERE ARE OTHER RESTAURANTS AROUND... ANY RESTAURANT.
