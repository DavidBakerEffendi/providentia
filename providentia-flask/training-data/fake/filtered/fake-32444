Great ambience in a hotel with personality. The restaurant is great. The menu is excellent and the wine list, though over priced, has diverse choice. We started with the octopus special that was very tasty. For our entree, we ordered the cumin rubbed venison ($32). The special was exquisite, with exotic flavors. The wine we chose was Yolupa from Australia ($40) The service was fabulous. The bill, with appetizer, 2 entries and wine came to $135, not including tip. For the experience and taste, that's a bargain.
