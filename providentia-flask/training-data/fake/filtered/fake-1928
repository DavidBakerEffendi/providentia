This place has a California feel and looks out of place in Red Hook (Real Brooklynites-you know what I mean). It has by far the the nicest view of the city skyline, especially during the sunset. I went on a Friday evening with my hubby for an early dinner date. We had very high hopes that fell extremely flat when we finally recieved what we ordered (a very long wait) Surf & Turf and crab cakes. The steak was actually pretty good, well cooked and tasty. Ironically, the lobster was small and the crab cakes sucked..to put it nicely. To top it off, the bill was ridiculously high- seriously this is Red Hook, not midtown Manhattan!! Â I gave Brooklyn Crab two stars for the decor and the out-doorsy feel, otherwise it would have been 1 star for the steak. I wouldn't recommend.
