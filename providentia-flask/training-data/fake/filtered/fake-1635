Food is ok but customer service is HORRIBLE.  I just ordered a pizza and 2 sodas.  am approximately 1.5 miles away.  The delivery took over an hour to get here, it was ice cold and they brought the wrong sodas.  When I said something to the delivery guy he said he was busy.  I called the restaurant and the girl put me on hold twice and then told me next time I call I can have a $5 credit!  Really!?!  Do you honestly think there is going to be a "next time"
