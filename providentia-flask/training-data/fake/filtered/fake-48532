I love this place. I think the food here is great and given the many choices for a cheesesteak in Philly, I find myself always returning here. Geno's is directly across the street and I've eaten there too and I like their food as well, but I've always found Pat's steaks to have just a little more flavour. Often you will roll up and find a long line but even the longest lines move quickly and smoothly. I like a place with minimal menu items and options. I'm a picky eater so I know what I want well before I arrive. I like Pat's because it's a simple and expediant ordering process. I get a whiz without and cheese fries and it's a great meal. The history and atmosphere here is great too. There is no indoor seating but there are a few picnic style benches outside. Parking is usually the greatest challenge, you often have to drive around the block a couple times and find street parking. I'm usually here with a group of buddies so many times the group gets out and gets in line and orders for our driver if necessary. They are open 24/7 so waiting until late evening is worth it. Â They only accept cash payment.
