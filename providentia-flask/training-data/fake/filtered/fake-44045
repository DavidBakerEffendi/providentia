Came here with my boyfriend about a month ago and, having just gotten off the ferry, were looking for places to eat. I stopped in to use the bathroom before checking the menu and when I came out my boyfriend was smoking in front with another guy. I went outside to wait for him to finish his casual discussion about the restaurants around, since we were just visiting, when suddenly a guy comes out of the bar. I thought he was just coming for a smoke and a chat as well when he starts saying things like "Oh the food here is so awful," and being extremely sarcastic. Turns out he is one of the "owners" and he goes off on the guy my boyfriend was talking to for trying to push business away, when the guy was certainly not doing that at all. It was merely just a quick conversation and a few recommendations besides Pier 76 but it escalated into this "owner" calling the guy an asshole among other things. Finally we told him that we were highly considering eating there but were thankful that he had made our decision to find somewhere else to grab a bite after his horrible lack of professionalism and utter disrespect for his customers. He then proceeded to inform us that it was "our loss for missing out on the best Italian food in New York" and that "he didn't need our money." The sheer ego of this man amazed me. With an attitude like that towards his customers I don't think he'll have anything to brag about when his business is closed. He needs to rethink his priorities and realize that maybe he is the one turning the business away.
