Amazing food some of the best Italian I have had at a great price.  With tip I paid  $22 for dinner it came with choice of soup or salad, entree, and choice of sangria house red or white. For entree I had bow tie pasta in olive oil and sausage.  It was an amazing dish. The atmosphere was what you expect from a small little restaurant just warm and inviting had a good vibe.
