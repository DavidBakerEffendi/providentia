NOT VEGAN! If you are excited for their "vegan" pancakes or home-fries, think again. They have one hot plate and the chef cooks eggs and corn-beef hash on it too. It's small, the grease runs into everything, and he uses one spatula for everything. I watched him flip an omelet, the move some corn-beef hash, then flip some potato with a meaty egg dripping spatula. Very over priced and meh service
