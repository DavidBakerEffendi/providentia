Lots of folks rave about this place.  I'm luke warm.   Appearance:  I think the interior embodies cheaply-done extravagance...amateurish.  They would have been far better off keeping it simple and elegant, less plastic--and using capable contractors.   Layout:  The sushi bar is set off in a corner that makes you feel like you're in detention-not part of the overall scene. Worst layout I've ever seen in a sushi/japanese place.  There is a single step separating parts of the dining room---huge trip hazard -and breaks up the space so you feel like you're in a cheap buffet behind the rail. Service: OK so two weeks ago we had bad service.  Every place can have a bad night. Tonight we gave it another go.  Service was horrendous-20-25 minutes between apps and dinner.  UNFORGIVABLE.  Then we finally had to walk our check up to get rung up after waiting for 10 minutes..also UNFORGIVABLE.  I'm not looking for a speed dinner, but it was as if we were on a desert island.   Now for the food:  I actually like the food, sushi has always been good.  They are creative and I prefer their more modest creations, like their signature roll.  Its not the best, but we enjoy it. Unfortunately, I will probably avoid this place given the service and the decor.
