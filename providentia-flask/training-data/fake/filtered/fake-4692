Amazing spot.  The decor is just so warm and welcoming and everything is so clean!. The service was perfect.  The meal...salad perfect, bread AMAZING, gnocchi light and delicious, dessert YUM!  Such a great find and unbelievable prices.  I couldn't be happier with the place, I had a smile on my face the whole time.  I will definitely be a returning customer!
