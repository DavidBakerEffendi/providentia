Best Crepes EVER!!!! took my best friend there for his Birthday just to taste them.. and he loved it!!! Soon I'll be taking my mom when she comes to visit from the caribbean in Jan 2013. I refuse to make her leave again without having Shade's crepes. My favorite crepe is the smoked salmon, goat cheese with spinach or mushrooms. I am always fantasizing about Shade's CREPES. KEEP IT UP!!!!! :)
