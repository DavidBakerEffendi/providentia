what a hidden gem.  I really love this place from the service to the atmosphere and of course to the food.  I love the originality of the daily menu.  It has a trendy feel without being pretentious. It's always crowded and the servers are warm and helpful! Everything is delicious and if you're skeptical of trying new things you can't go wrong with burger! simply scrumptious!
