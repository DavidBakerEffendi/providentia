Such a great and amazing place!  Phil Gilmore, Chef Isamel Alvarez are the coolest people to hang with! Chef Isamel Alvarez way of cooking is extremely passionate, beautiful and like him handsome!  Master Sushi Chef William is a Sushi Veteran, like the guys knife skill looks like It's coming outta a samurai flick fighting giant tuna making their way to Bushwick and he's there to protect the civilians. Their veriety of beer, sake and fresh sushi is unbeatable. My favorite of course the Momo Salad, Agedashi Eggplant, Fried Chicken,  Shrimp Tempura, with a nice Pork Chop and washing all that down with Orions, Marlboro Lights and a nice vibe. . Sometimes don't want to leave because the veriety of music, people and its always a party... Even on a Tuesday
