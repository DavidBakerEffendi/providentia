Cafe Colombia is my to go place for lunch everyday. The daily specials are out of this world especially the chicken or tilapia in lemon sauce. I have also tried the arepa with chorizo and they are very tasty. At the bakery, which is next door, you can get empanadas, pandebonos, arepas de chocolo and bread. Everything is very good and the owner, Don Hector, is so friendly and accommodating. I would recommend this place to anyone who wants to try traditional Colombian food or just to have a great meal with family and friends.
