I discovered this place on a night where they had an awesome one-man band. He sang tons of great covers and the bar was packed and jumping. Was truly surprised. Thought this was more of a sports bar (they have TVs in the booths), but it seems like it's a hybrid. I imagine this bar will be great when football season is back, but for now it's a cool place to meet after work get good beers, steak tidbits and maybe hear the one-man band. I am going back this week.
