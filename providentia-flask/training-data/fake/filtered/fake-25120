I was very pleased when this restaurant first opened in Orange because I had heard very positive things about the Algarve restaurant in Elizabeth. The first few times I went I ordered the salmon Â to take out and was very pleased with the half salmon which they no longer have. I went back to this restaurant last night with a friend for dinner and was very disappointed. I ordered the half chicken and ribs combo with yellow rice and french fries and was not at all impressed with the food or the quality of service. They put all that food on one plate which made it impossible to eat, I had to ask for another plate so that I could dish out the food onto that plate so that I could eat it. My friend did not enjoy his red snapper either stating that it smelled fishy and it was unappetizing enough that he did not eat half of his meal. I asked the waitress to give me the rest of my food to go minus the french fries. When I decided to have the left overs the next day I realized she threw away some of the meat on my plate. If she had told me that she accidentally did this last night I would have understood as everything was so piled high on that plate. But to get home and realize that the chicken leg that I never ate and perhaps a rib is gone is totally unacceptable. It is a shame but I will not be returning to this restaurant. Nothing is more disappointing than to spend your money on a meal and still be hungry in the end.
