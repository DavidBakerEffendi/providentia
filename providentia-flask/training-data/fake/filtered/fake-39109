I came here with my husband last week and had a wonderful experience. We live in manhattan and are always looking for good, fresh, authentic, italian food and this is definatley it! I had the duck which was amazing and my husband had the lamb which was just as good. Since we heard the pasta was homemade, we ordered a blogonese to share and it was prepared perfectly! Dont skip dessert, the chocolate crepes are to die for!!!
