Something must have changed since these negative reviews were written. I was just there today, and it wasn't dirty at all. It's a nice place to sit and read the paper -- it's just small, and noisy. But what bagel place isnt? More importantly, they make the best bagels in totowa. Crispy on the outside, gooey on the inside, with a bunch of toppings to choose from. I've tried Brooklyn bagel, and it's ok. This place is just a little better.
