This place is my favorite sushi resteraunt. And let me tell you, I have been to places where i spent 1000$ on sushi for me and my guests, yet this place impresses me hands down everytime. There is something about the freshness, simplicity, and ingredients (especially the spicy mayo) that makes this place rise above all the others. Their tempura is also awesome, and pricing? well lets just say this will be the most economical sushi place you can go have lunch or dinner at. fillet mignon quality at cheeseburger pricing. And for the lady below me who made a comment about the cleanliness, I always sit at the bar and watch the chef make my food and it is a very clean kitchen. Try the spyder roll!
