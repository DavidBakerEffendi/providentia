I had an encounter with the original owner 15 years prior for taking ketchup packets from my take out bag because I used the ketchup bottle on the table for my fries. His statement was " well I guess you don't need these packets if your using my bottle " I was angered by it and shouted. He shouted back telling me to " take my black ass out of his diner " Â This happened 15 years prior when I was 18 , now 33 I took my wife and bi-racial kids to the diner after a viewing at the Peabody museum for lunch since its the nearest diner. I didn't forget my past experience but figured the older guy owner must be gone and things just have to be better. BIG NO. Upon entering the diner the older white haired lady greeted me but once she saw my wife and children it was nothing but frowns and stares in our direction. My wife asked me why did she look at her that way and I just brushed it off as nothing. As we ordered the white haired woman was speaking to a staff member " saying times have changed and she hasn't gotten use to the mixing of people" Now at this point I walked up and demanded the bill. I tipped our waiter 20% on top of the bill. My wife asked me to sit down at our table just so our daughter could finish her oatmeal. While sitting there the older woman asked a waiter if the table of 7 left her a tip. When the waiter replied no they didn't , this woman speaking loudly expressed that the people should have left a tip and it must be because of were they are from. all 7 were black. Now totally disgusted I asked the waiter what was the amount of there bill? while asking her this the white haired woman asked me what do I care what there bill was and if I knew them. The waiter replied to me and said about $40.00. I tipped for that table as well. Me and my family left and will never return there as long as it stands!
