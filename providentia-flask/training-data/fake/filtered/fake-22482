Just had a retirement party at Maggies Town Tavern and it was awesome. When I planned the party with the owner Maggie, she was so helpful and answered all my questions. We were on a budget and she made everything affordable. Penny and Nick were the best and helped us with anything we needed and the server Mary Jane was phenomenal would definitely have another party there again and would absolutely go have dinner their with my friends, in fact we have already planned to go there in September. If I could give this place 10 stars I would in a heart beat! Bravo Maggie's, job well done!
