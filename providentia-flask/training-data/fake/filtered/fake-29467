First, let me start by saying the food here is not all it's cracked up to be.  Lastly, I am a bit appalled by the service provided in the establishment.  Built on the legacy of who Amy Ruth was, the staff is not doing well in upkeeping her image.  They are rude and seem not to have a sense on who works in the establishment(s).  If this restaurant fails, I know why.
