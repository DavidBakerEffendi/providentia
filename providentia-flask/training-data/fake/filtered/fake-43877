Easily one of the top 5 pizza's I've had in my life. Maybe even the top one (tough to really rank). Try both the original (without mozzerella) and with mozzerella.   Load up the one without with their freshly grated cheese.   I was suprised at how good a pizza without cheese (or with a small amount of cheese with the grating) could taste Have only been to the original, so no clue if the other locations are as good
