Great atmosphere to have dinner and drinks, great playa for guys night oht and dinner with the wife. Food is great , I ordered the blackened salmon and loved every bite , shrimp app - also amazing prices are cheap for what it is !!! Only thing we did not like was the fact that we had to wait for almost a hour to be seated both times that we went there. Other than that, all and all we would recommend and def will be going back again!
