Great place for coffee.  The only down side is there are hoards of people sitting on their computers for hours on end, leaving little space for the rest of us who don't use coffee shops as personal offices.   The staff is nice, contrary to other reviews,  this is probably coming from people who don't know how to tip their servers.
