this one time i had this buffalo mozzarella encrusted ball with fig and prosciutto. i dream about this ball of cheese all the time. it was UNFKINGBELIEVABLE. oh my god. and they don't make it regularly - but they SHOULD!   cant wait til my lips meet this sweet queens balls again :)  (no pun intended)
