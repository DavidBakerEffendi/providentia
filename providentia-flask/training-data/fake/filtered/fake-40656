Tony S. from Beverly Hills wrote this review for Amy's Baking Company. I am wondering if what Tony is saying is true? Horrible, disgusting food. Stay away. I hear they are both under investigation by the IRS, and the Heath Department, not to mention he's in deportation hearings. They will not be open too much longer. I would bet money on it. I heard you tell a table they didn't know what good pizza tastes like. FYI, when you left the table I asked to try a small bite to see what they were talking about, and they gladly obliged. Listen up psychos... My family owns Lombardi's in NYC - the very first pizza shop in the USA and the most prestigious, world renowned, top-rated award winning pizza on the planet. Your pizza is D-I-S-G-U-T-I-N-G!! It's not pizza, it's what I'd imagine dog food would taste like, only if I had to choose, I'd choose dog food! You have absolutely no idea! Are you an Israeli trying to tell people YOU KNOW good pizza?! You're insane, and so is your she male looking wife! I've traveled to the middle east many times, including Israel... Don't think it's known for pizza you idiot. Have you even been to Italy? NYC? Chicago? Thought so. Shut up. Your restaurant will fail, period, end of story. My family's Lombardi's opened in 1897, so when I say your restaurant will fail -- I know what I'm talking about. Your 15 minutes are up ya freaks.
