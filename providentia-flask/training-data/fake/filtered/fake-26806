Dos Toros used to be my go-to for tacos. For several months after they opened they were consistently amazing. Then it started to go downhill. I continued to go long after I should have given up on them, still hoping that I might get one of those delicious tacos with the perfectly cooked meat and bright fresh guac on a warm toasty tortilla. But the size of the tacos seemed to shrink with each visit, and the flavor and texture of the meat was just not the same. By the time picked out all of the burnt, off tasting, gristle-y pieces I was just left with a smear of guac on a tortilla that I was paying way too much for. I hope I can find another taco joint that's as great as Dos Toros used to be.
