Although I've never had anything but the pizza, let me tell you, the pizza and all its varieties are amazing. From the plain to the grilled and buffalo chicken, everything is off the charts. Who thought that calamari on a pizza would be good? Trust me give it a try there. And for New Jersey pizzeria's it really isn't overpriced.
