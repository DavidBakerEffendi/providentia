Awesome neighborhood spot for a quick bite to eat. Went in on a Monday night and sat at the bar. Atmosphere and service were both exceptional, and the food was even better. I got the rigatoni with beef meatballs, which were some of the best I've ever had. And best of all, it was only $10. This will definitely be one of my go-to places for a quick meal or better yet, some awesome drunk food (they're open til 4am).
