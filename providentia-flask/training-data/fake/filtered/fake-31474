Great staff and very good food.  Hubby got the bulgogi and I had the spicy pork.  The bulgogi was wonderful-- he was very satisfied.  The spicy pork was very good-- I tend to make mine a bit sweeter, but that's just a personal preference.  We went with two of our friends who loved their food as well (the dumpling soup, chicken wings, and spicy pork).  I wish I lived closer because their lunch special bibimbap was a real steal-- especially if it is as delicious as the rest of their menu. The service was fantastic.  The staff was very attentive and friendly bringing us extra kimchi and complimentary mandoo.  The atmosphere was simple, but very inviting and clean.   I am looking forward to going back and trying their bibimbap!
