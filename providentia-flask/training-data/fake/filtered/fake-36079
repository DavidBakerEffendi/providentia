We are fans!  This was our third time at the restaurant and we were extremely pleased with the food and service.  Seamus was our attentive waiter, and his recommendations for wine and entrees were spot on.  The pizzas, Bianca Neva and Margherita, were the best we had since our trip to Italy this past May.   The Pollo  Valdostano was delicious as was the soup de jour.  Our friends had the lobster ravioli and the ravioli with veal and sage and they were very pleased with their dinner choices too.    Wish the restaurant was closer to where we live.  I know we would frequent it more often.
