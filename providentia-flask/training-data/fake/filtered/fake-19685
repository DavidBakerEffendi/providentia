As a new resident of BedStuy I was eager to try Peaches. Me and a friend went as a celebrating my apartment being finished dinner. At the start everything was great; got seated within mins of arriving : check, staff was kind and courteous: check (Anthony is great btw) check, food came quickly: check. After the food it went ALL downhill- I ordered the blackend catfish with BBQ fries: the fries- think of the frozen fries you by when you feel lazy and don't want to cook, then sprinkle a BBQ seasoing on top of them- thats EXACTLY what these were- after the seasoning was gone there was nothing, on to my catfish- BLAND- I had to drown the already dead fish with hot sauce just to get some life into the dish. I could go to a take out resturant on Fulton and get a catfish for $8 that would be full of flavor. My firend let me try his chicken- bland as well- it resembled a rotissere chicken, with no flavor. Both dishes were not worth the $15.00 each. I want to support the local business in BedStuy- I really do. By no means am I a cheapskate, but I can't spend $37.00 for food that dosent taste like anything. lIke I said for this I could've went to a fish spot, paid $8 and got several peices of fish, my friend could've got a rotissere from the local supermarket for like $7 and the meal couldve been done better for $20 give or take. I will try peaches again (maybe I went on an off night) but only because I live a few blocks down on Lewis and it's not out of my way. Sadly, I was dissapointed.
