Came in to try the famous Lombardi's pizza and found that it is all hype.  Perhaps a long time ago, this was a great place but they have definitely been riding on the pseudo reputation.  The pizza was horrible, nothing better than at any chain and the service was not better.  In fact, it felt and tasted like a tourist trap!
