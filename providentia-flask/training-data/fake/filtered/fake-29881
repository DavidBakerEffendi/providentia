Service was very friendly.  Our little daughter was impressed when they gave her a little drink umbrella to play with. They have a large choice of vegetarian and non-veg dishes. The  lunch special came with a two spring rolls and choice of soup. They served us spring rolls that were crisp and perfectly spiced with a sweet plum sauce served on the side. THe Tofu soup has simple flavors with a good mix of  mushrooms. tofu and transparent noodles. Coconut chicken soup was spicy with mushrooms and chicken bits that were very delicious. We ordered the lunch special Tofu basil with brown rice and chicken THe brown rice was cooked perfectly.Tofu basil was a bit dry but adequate to be a nice dish in it self ,not life changing. Portions were just right. Lunch special was priced  under 10 bucks. For desert we tried the coconut ice cream and it was a perfect end to the meal with the coconut flavor just right without being too over powering. THe place was not too noisy and we could actually hear ourselves !! Overall great place for a family lunch with good food that is not over priced.
