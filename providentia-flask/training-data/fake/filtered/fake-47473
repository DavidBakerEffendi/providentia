I've been a New York most of my life and have been hearing about Grimaldi's for years.  Last night after walking past and seeing there was no line my sister and I decided to give it a try and we definitely will never be back.  The pizza was just okay, but I've definitely had better.  Apparently they shut the oven's down for 30 minutes between 5-7 to "reboot" the oven but not sure why they wouldnt do it earlier.  They keep a line outside the restaurant almost to make Grimaldi's seem like a bigger deal then it was because there were plenty of available tables inside.  They only accept cash but both ATM's inside were down.  When I asked the manager for the nearest ATM, he sent me on a wild goose chase and after a solid walk turns out there was a small ATM right next door.  We were told when we went in that the ovens had gone down and it would be 20-30 mins.  About 30 minutes later we were told again that the ovens had just gone down and it would be another 20-30 minutes and that the earlier statement didn't factor in the pizzas they had left to make.  Trying to get change for our check at the end was also quite a process.  Crowds inside are loud and touristy, children screaming, bathrooms dirty.  All in all, definitely go somewhere else -NY is filled with good pizza, much better than Grimaldi's and for a lot less, and all without the hassle.
