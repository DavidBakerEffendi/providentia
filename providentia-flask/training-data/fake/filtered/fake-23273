lovely place.  Just my speed with someone spinning and lots of different lounging to be had.  I dig their menus and thought the place will only get better.  I love their drink selections.  Thought the communal hand wash area was cool.  Would love a few more spots to chill in and felt cramped at times, but overall a very rewarding lounge experience.  On the expensive side, but lots to offer
