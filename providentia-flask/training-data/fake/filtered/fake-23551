Awesome, authentic food -- especially the special guac, the corn, and all the tacos. Excellent margaritas (yum, blood orange). Sweet, cozy interior. Reasonable prices. Huge tequila list. And the best part, really, is the lovely service. The owners are there every evening and you feel like they care deeply about your dining experience. This place is a wonderful neighborhood spot. Try it; you'll be happy you did.
