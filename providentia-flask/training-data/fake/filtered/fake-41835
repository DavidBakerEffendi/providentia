This restaurant was a HUGE disappointment.  Huge.  Mediocre to the max.  My guest felt sick within hours though I did not.  Service was  lacking in basic manners.  I believe the other positive reviews here and other places are fakes - written by  the management of this restaurant,  just like the ones they placed on their website.   Their food and service is a fraud they commit against the customer.   Serving the "food" they do the way they do is the same as theft from my wallet; I got nothing for my money or my mood. Avoid this place like the plague.  My vote as most horrible place I have ever eaten in my 72 years of age in NY or anywhere !
