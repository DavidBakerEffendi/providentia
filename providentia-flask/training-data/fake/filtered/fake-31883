Been wanting to go here for a while now... Just went and I did enjoy! Super nice place! Great bar, and dining area... Service was fabulous! Never felt rushed once! And we were a walk-in on Sat. evening...  Drinks=Too die for! I'm crazy for anything coconut, and there was much of that on the drink menu and so many diff. kinds of sangria!!! Stuffed Dates=sooo yum! chicharones=I've had better, lacked flavor. The free bread that you get is orgasmicly dynamic! I cant even explain how amazing it is! you just need to go and try... order rib special= was pretty good... big big portions... didn't have room for desert... would definately go again!  Would have given 5 stars if the food was a little tastier
