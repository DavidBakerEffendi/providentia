I will never go back.  I have frequented this restaurant several times and have had many bad experiences.  My biggest complaint is that the owner, Paula, is incredibly rude.  If there is an error with you order or the food is not up to par, she doesn't care and will not compensate you.  You have to argue just to get your money back. In the most recent incident, I was sold a turkey wrap from her prepared food case, and it the lettuce was brown and the wrap was soggy.  She refused to replace it and told me if I wanted anything else I had to pay the difference.  In the end I took my money back and told them I would never return.  The customer service here is nonexistent.
