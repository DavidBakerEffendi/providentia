Walked into Stix with a few girlfriend and had a great time, this place is certainly different from the 20 restaurants in the few block radius! The food was yummy and super healthy! I especially loved the skewered lamb and tuna. Stix is also great for groups since you get to share everything. Desserts are great too, hands down best part was the chocolate cake! The service was great as well, the manager came up to us several times to make sure everything was great, it is definitely refreshing to enjoy such a friendly atmosphere. If you are looking for a fun atmosphere, with great food at reasonable prices, this is the place for you!
