I'm sad to see the low ratings here. I suppose I can't disagree completely with other reviewers. Their products do come with a higher pricetag, and they take some time to make, but personally, I don't see either of those things as dealbreakers. I don't mind spending $8 on a superfood smoothie (Nuts About Acai - so stinkin' good!), because it's basically a meal. I'll spend $8 on a delicious & nutritious dinner, and I don't mind waiting a few minutes for it, either. The service is casual, but friendly. Overall, I've never had any complaints, and I always look forward to getting my Eco-fix.
