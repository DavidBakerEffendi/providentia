Stopped in Wednesday night with some friends since I heard they had entertainment.  Anthony the bar tender was helpful  and knowledgeable.  Dave Mack Duo played great assortment of blues, r&b and rock.  Entertainment every other Wednesday.  I'll be back then, if not before.  Great addition to East Hartford!!!!
