The pizza was very, very good. However, a negative was that the most "exotic" beer they had was Heineken. The servers were there to take an order and bring your food; they barely spoke to us. We were yelled at and told to wait outside, in the rain, for a table (about 15 minutes). Did I mention that the pizza was very,very, good. It was also PRICEY! They charged extra for mozzarella cheese, when I asked what cheese normally came on the pizza: "shredded." I wouldn't make a special trip for this.
