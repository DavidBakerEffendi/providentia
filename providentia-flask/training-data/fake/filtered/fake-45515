"Fine" dining for those who have never been to a true fine dining restaurant. First, tables decorated for birthdays like something you'd see in a mall restaurant - complete with picture taking. Our server, Jason, while not rude was not very personable. Very pushy service and it all seemed scripted and rushed. The salads were good but all other items very very salty. Lobster Mac and Cheese was very salty and the sauce was thin and broken. The wine of course was good but at about $30 more than I pay for the same bottle elsewhere. Overall, the chain restaurant experience dressed up with linens. It takes far more than a tablecloth, a pushy server and higher prices to be true "fine dining".
