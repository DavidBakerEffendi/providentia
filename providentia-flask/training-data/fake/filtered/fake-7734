I have been coming to sushi california since i moved to Connecticut this past year. I gotta say it is the only sushi place i trust here!  I have not once tried something I did not enjoy. In fact chef Young introduced me to white tuna and for someone who used to only eat rolls I now eat regular pieces of sushi because of how fresh it is. The waitresses are sweethearts and know their customers.  They are very personable,  prompt,  and genuine.  Also the restaurant is so  clean and designed beautifully . Chef O the owner is on a roll (pun intended lol ) with this amazing restaurant and they have found a loyal customer: ) i recommend the avocado salad,  the spicy salmon maki and the crazy roll!  Oh  and don't forget to try the white tuna P.s it's a BYOB and conveniently located in walking distance to a liquor store!
