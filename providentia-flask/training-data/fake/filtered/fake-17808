My wife and I enjoyed dinner there for the second time tonight.  We are partners in a Doylestown Restaurant and are always trying out how the newer establishments are doing.  In the case of Charcoal, they are doing quite well! The menu was interesting and the small and large plates we had were great.   My wife had the Stone Fruit-tomato salad and I had the Barnegat Scallops to start and we shared both, which were very well prepared. This was followed by our large plate selection of Salmon for her and the Wild Halibut for me, both shared and both impressive! We had a nice Chardonnay along As it is a BYO and that complimented the offerings nicely. The wait staff was attentive and we never had to wait more than a few minutes to have our water refilled or questions answered. This place is worth the trip if you like a place that's more upscale like a sophisticated downtown Philly or NY Manhattan establishment but don't want to do the traveling.  We also enjoyed the tremendous view of the River that has to be one of the best in the region, since the owners raised the whole building after one of the recent floods. Overall, a Gem of Yardley in Bucks County. J & J
