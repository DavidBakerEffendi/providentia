Visited philly read the reviews and came to Stella rossa with high expectations and unfortunately ended up disappointed with the food. The calamari dish and cheese platter assortment were the only items with flavor. The pizza didn't flow it tasted like the vegetables were steamed in microwave placed in cheese and it was all melted on dry puffy flat bread. Beef carpaccio also had no taste. Although, the service was impeccable and ambiance was nice for a dressy casual relaxing atmosphere.
