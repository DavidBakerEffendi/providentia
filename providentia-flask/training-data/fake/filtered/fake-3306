Love this place.  Pheasant's Landing is the perfect balance between casual and formal dining.  You can show up in jeans or formal wear without feeling a bit out of place.  The bar upstairs is intimate enough to enjoy a couple drinks before or after the meal.  I recommend before because the desserts are delicious!   I have been to the restaurant, the upstairs bar and downstairs bar many times and have enjoyed them all for their individual character.  I have also held a party in the attached facility.  Our party guests still remark about the food and service.   If you do try Pheasant's Landing there are a few MUSTS... --you MUST have a drink with the elderly Irish? bartender upstairs --you MUST order the Greek salad, it's delicious! --you MUST enjoy one of the delicious, delicious entrees --you MUST save room for dessert I also recommend you try one of the after dinner coffees. It is so nice that Pheasant's Landing features seasonal specialties.  The menu never gets old! Bravo!!!
