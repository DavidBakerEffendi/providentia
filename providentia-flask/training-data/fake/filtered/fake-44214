The food is excellent, there staff is rude and just plain dumb. I just called an order food. When the guy was in my building, he didn't even come upstairs then the restaurant called asking me in Spanish if I want my food, I said yes. Then she said, that I didn't want my food and hung up on me. I called back, and she hung up on me. I called back again and she sent me straight to voicemail. I will never order from them again. They need to fired those idiots girls and hire people with a brain. No food is worth, what was did to me. I will post this on blogs and spread the word.
