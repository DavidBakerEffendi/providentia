OMG! THE best vegan diner anywhere!! This is loved my vegans, vegetarians and meat eaters!  The pancakes rock, the baked potato fries are a MUST and the shakes are amazeballs!!  They have great desserts and they also have $1 "day olds" at the counter that are great! Worth the trip if you don't live in Brooklyn, just off the L stop at Lorimer.
