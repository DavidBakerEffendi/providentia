Just threw my husband's surprise 30th at Pier 76 last week. To say that everything was perfect is an understatement! A week later I am still getting phone calls and texts about how good the food is. Guests even begged to take home doggy bags! Between buffalo chicken rolls, Pizzas (Mac and cheese was a fan favorite), pasta, salad, chicken franc, sausage and peppers and zeppoles, the food seemed endless and no one went home hungry!! The staff was excellent, attentive and friendly. Both the bartender and the waitresses made sure everyone was happy and enjoying themselves. The owner Joe made sure everything ran smoothly! I couldn't have been more happy with the outcome of the party. I would definitively recommend going to pier for your next celebration. Whether it be for dinner or for a party, Pier 76 is the place to go for great food and great drinks.
