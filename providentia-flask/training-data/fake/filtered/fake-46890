Came here for the first time .. First service was horrible and the food. Who cares if it's in Princeton. I can go to shop rite buy a nice steak make it better than this restaurant. Just because you work at this restaurant doesn't make you all that. Don't waste a penny coming here there are far better restaurants than this place.
