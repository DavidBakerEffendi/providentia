Have been to the Montville Inn numerous times in the past, it was always top-notch.  The food is pricy but worth it.  The service has always been amazing and the food is absolutely delicious.  I have been a big fan for years and dined there with many friends.   My recent visit, Monday night was absolutely disappointing, to the point of possibly never going back.  There are much better restaurants, food and value wise, not to mention service, in the area.  There were 5 tables at best and two waiters and 3 bus people and they could not handle the patrons.  The service was sub par.   Now the food.  The Fried Calamari and the marinara sauce  was outstanding!!  The PEI mussels melted in your mouth and the sauce was as good as the Gourmet Café in Parsippany.  However, you get three times the amount of PEI mussels at the GC for $10.   The Inn Burgers were awful!  They were dry, cheese was so melted it was barely noticeable and the rolls were god awful dry. The insides of the rolls were scooped, because they were so dry.  Not to mention the kitchen screwed up the order and one of the party of four waited for a remake, at that time we were almost done with dinner.   There was no offer made of a free soda, wine or desert.  It is not acceptable for three people to eat while one of us waits for the food. After having the PEI mussels I had a Tricolore Salad for dinner, as I was full and trying to not eat too much for the summer months.  The Tricolore Salad was $11, and it had about 30 cents worth of lettuce on it.  I have never seen such a small salad anywhere.  I will never order it again.   My dining experience was extremely disappointing.  The establishment needs to go back to the wait staff that was there previously, the salad portions need to be resized, and for $13 the burgers need to at least be moist and on a decent roll.  We need the Restaurant Make Over here.  :(
