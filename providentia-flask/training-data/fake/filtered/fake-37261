Been meaning to write this up for a while, but definitely worth looking into. Went not too long ago for a night out and had a craving for Peruvian food and it hit the spot! We had a awesome waiter, Gio (hope I spelled it right) and he took great care of us. Can honestly say, I didn't go hungry, and the glass was always filled. Â He was very knowledgeable and recommendations were on point. Food price was fair for the portions we received, you guys just need a liquor license!! However, everything was awesome, would go back and request him again.
