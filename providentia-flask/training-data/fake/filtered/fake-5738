Ive had their pizza a few times, its good, not great. Last week I ordered an eggplant parm w/ pasta to my office. It was ok, again not great, but not bad. It was a big portion so I took home half and the salad. The next day I opened up the salad and the sliced onions in it had a significant amount of mold on them... They must leave those out forever and not check. I will NOT be returning!!!!
