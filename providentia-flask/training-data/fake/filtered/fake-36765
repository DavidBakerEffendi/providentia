The staff was clueless. Had no idea what I was talking about when I asked the most basic question. Answer was "this is just what they told us to say". I hate that. Had a prok taco and a steak. The pork was ok, but greasy and not great seasoning. The steak was terrible. They cube it and it was chewy and dry. The bathroom had toiiet paper wads on it, old urine and was filthy.
