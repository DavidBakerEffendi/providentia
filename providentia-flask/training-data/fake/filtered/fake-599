Been eating Geno's Steaks for years, carried them home on flights to Atlanta, flown up with my family to have them for breakfast.  Even watched my son slip on the ice one winter when we were up there having stakes for breakfast and crashed to the ground, his steak held high in the air as he proudly declared "I saved the steak, at least I saved the steak."  Yep, that's how good they are.
