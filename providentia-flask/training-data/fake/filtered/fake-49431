this restaurant was truly fantastic and has one of the best guacs i've ever tasted.  offering a good selection of guacs from chipotle-infused to truffle-flavored versions, this place will leave you sated and cater to your taste buds.  the only downside would be the long wait required to get seated and the prices can be a bit high for mexican food.  I am be sure to go back and visit.
