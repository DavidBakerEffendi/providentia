Love the food and the atmosphere! Definitely the place to go for a night out, margaritas are huge, delicious, and strong.  Free chips and salsa, but order the ranch to dip your chips in as well. The wait here can be very long, especially on the weekends, so come early, or be prepared to wait awhile (on the plus side, you can always order margaritas while you wait!).  Since they are usually so busy, it can get quite loud, so I wouldn't recommend for an intimate dinner for two, or to bring young children very late. They don't serve dessert, however, they do serve delicious cornbread which is just as good.  If your meal doesn't already come with it, definitely order a side. Staff is all very friendly and helpful. Overall, great spot.  Too bad there aren't more Jose Tejas Restaurants in the area!
