I am a big fan of Cafeteria. I have been now probably at least 10 times. The food is excellent and always consistent. I am always pleased with my meal, particularly their signature mac n' cheese trio and their delicious cocktails. However, every time I have been, I am first directed to the bar to sit while the table is being prepared. EVERY SINGLE TIME I have sat at the bar, the bartenders NEVER greet me, offer me a menu or take a drink order. Ever. I have literally sat at the bar for upwards of 20 minutes and been completely ignored. Once, when I finally asked the bus boy for a menu the bartender seemed annoyed when I placed an order. I just went to brunch last week and sat at the bar for a good 10 minutes and failed to order a drink because the female bartender did not bother to acknowledge me. It's just bizarre. This is unacceptable for such a generally impressive restaurant. Management, please address this. I look forward to coming back soon for what I know will be a delicious meal. Hopefully I will be able to enjoy a lovely experience at the bar this time before I sit at my table.
