I really don't enjoy writing bad reviews as to be honest, life is more fun when experiences are great and positive. Unfortunately Bouley win a new lowest of the low review for me. Again if I could give a zero rating, you'd get it Bouley. Having specifically told the restaurant when I booked a table well in advance it was to celebrate my wedding anniversary. Â They cancelled my table the day before without a call to explain or even an email. It was only because I called to check my booking that I Found out. I made an official complaint and asked that the manager call me personally back. He/she deemed it not important enough. I'm sure the food is great, but this is the worst I have ever encountered in customer service and arrogance. Not even a token apology. Boyley is a disgrace and so ashamedly typical of today's supposed fine dining restauranteurs - if you want a nice dinner in NYC and it's a special occasion, please go elsewhere to avoid disappointment and being cancelled for clearly more important diners.
