A few days ago I was strolling down St. Paul Street and the enticing aroma of glorious honeysuckle grabbed hold of me. Before I knew it, I was purchasing a Cranberry Duff Cake from one of stunning waiters. If I hadn't been exhausted from working in the tobacco fields all week, I would have gotten on one knee in a jiffy. I proceeded to enjoy my moist piece of cake. Before long I was hovering above the ground with joy. Let me be clear: that previous sentence was not a figure of speech. From the moment I took my first bite, I literally started to grow tiny blue wings, weird enough, not unlike the wings of a bluebird. I am still fluttering my wings this very moment. I am not entirely sure if they are permanent, but score! Overall, a lovely tavern with desserts that are the bomb-diggity. Fair warning though: the Duff Cake may or may not grant you the gift of flight. So those of you with a fear of heights, proceed with caution. Bizz Twinkling Stars out of Bizz.
