Best pizza I've had in NYC and the one I got didn't even have cheese on it! We went on a Thursday night at around 9:30 pm. The place was busy but we didn't have to wait to be seated and once we were, the service was quick. I got a vegan pizza with kale (from the nearby rooftop garden!) and some kind of lemon olive oil. So good! My date loved his (non-vegan) pizza too. Everyone was really nice and while we were dining, Paulie Gee himself came by to see how everything was. We'll definitely be back.
