BEWARE I've eaten in this restaurant MINIMALLY 3-5 days a week for 5 years: The GOOD: The food is good, they do this GREAT.  No problem there at all in terms of flavor. The BAD:   HUGE, yes I said HUGE wait times.  I've waited as long as 35 minutes for lunch to be served.  Whatever the wait they quote, add 15 minutes. FLIES.  Yes, flies.  I've fought them many, many times during lunch throughout my entire meal. BAD MEAL:  I've had 2 major instances:  #1:  fly in the bottom of my lunch after I ate 90% of it, #2  a hair after I ate about 90%.  Manager refused to give me my $ back after I showed them the bug/hair.  They did not even apologise.  They did offer me a replacement meal (I assume hair/fly free). VEGETARIAN DISH ISSUES:  On 2 occasions I saw 2 EXTREMELY angry patrons complain about meat in their supposedly vegetarian dishes.  THEY NEVER EVEN APOLOGISED, however I did see them offer to refund their money (unlike the hair and fly situation in my lunch). HEALTH DEPT:  I was dining while they were cited for bugs, among other things. The inspector cited them for open front door/flies. RUDE OWNER:  EXTREMELY rude woman.  Likes to argue confront her customers.  This is mind-boggling. She was extremely rude to me last week after being a faithful, loyal customer for 5 years, therfore they lost my business.
