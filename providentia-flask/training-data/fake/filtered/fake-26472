Hot tea and red curry for lunch on a cold day was exactly what I needed.  The waitresses were quick to seat me and take my order.  My only complaints are that because it was so quiet the servers hovered near by and since I forgot to specify the spicy level I ended up with food that was borderline too spicy for me.  Will with out a doubt try again for a dinner.
