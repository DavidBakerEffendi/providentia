Small, quaint place in the theater district - so small we walked past it twice! Took a friend from out of town here on a weekday evening. Staff was friendly and accomodating. Our meal were great - I ordered the large shrimp salad and asked for the dressing on the side. The waiter bet me the cost of my meal that the salad should be served dressed...and he was right! Everything was delicious. Would definitely come back for a low key evening or date night.
