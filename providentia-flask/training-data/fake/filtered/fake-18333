As appealing as 1/2-priced burgers are, I am repeatedly disappointed by the service.  The food is great, but when requested add-ons are forgotten, the waitstaff never checks on a need for condiments or refills, and tips on cash payments are assumed, the positive can hardly outweigh the negative.  For some reason, we keep going back to give it another shot, but to no avail.  Incredibly unfortunate.
