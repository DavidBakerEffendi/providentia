I was here last weekend at this quaint and charming Italian wine bar.  The wine menu goes far beyond Italian, but the food menu is generally Italian.  Our server was both friendly and efficient.  The lighting is a bit on the dark side which may or may not be good.  I personally like it and it makes for a romantic setting.  We ordered a small pizza, bruschetta and pasta and all in all most of it was very good if not a bit generic.  Not excellent but definitely better than Olive Garden.  I'll be going back again.
