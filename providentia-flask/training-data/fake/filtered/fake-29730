This may be the friendliest of all the great BYOB restaurants we have in Philadelphia. Pierre Calmels may be the nicest French chef ever. The food is highly-refined French "country" cooking; duck hearts, escargot, bone marrow - just wonderful renditions of foods we'd otherwise have little contact with (unless one travels a good deal throughout the Roannaise or Burgundy). Two things to remember: CASH ONLY, and BYOB. I recommend rich reds from the Loire (Saint-Nicolas de Bourgueil, bigger Chinons), and a rich, vibrant white. Bring both - play with the pairings...it's a wonderful way to not only enjoy a great meal, but also to expand one's horizons. Bibou is a joy.
