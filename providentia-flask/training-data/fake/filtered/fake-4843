Came back to check out the new menu. Me and my friend were looking forward to trying out the menu items. Started off with the kobe beef sliders which were delicious! Also had to get the redstone lollipops since those were my favorite and I couldn't resist. Thank god they didn't take them off the menu! For my entree I had the seafood paella. I have to say for the price of 16 dollars I was amazed at the abundance of seafood and great quality of it. I give it two thumbs up. My friend had the veggie lovers pizza which she said was scrumptious and had just the right amount & variety of veggies. For dessert we shared the chocolate molten cake. It was AMAZING! The raspberry sauce added a great touch! Staff was friendly as always and the place was very clean. The atmosphere and ambiance is top notch. Would recommend this place to anyone!
