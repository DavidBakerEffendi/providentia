The greatest pizza place in new haven. I know that is saying a lot consider what's available- but I stand by my word. In addition to the amazing pizza, all the small dishes are out of this world. If you are looking for greasy Italian food, this is not the place for you. But if you are a foodie who loves different flavors and appreciates a good brick oven pizza- this is your spot. They also have a great happy hour with half priced bottles of wine until 6 Monday- Wednesday. I just moved to new haven last year and I take everyone here when they come to visit. It really is a hidden gem.
