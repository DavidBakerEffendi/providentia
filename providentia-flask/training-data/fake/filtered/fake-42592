Good stuff: I ate here with a party of 6.  We stayed late and felt no pressure to leave.  The servers were friendly and attentive.  The food here was good and the menu ok price-wise.  (I was surprised at the ample avocado salad portion.) My rib eye steak was tasty but I ordered rare and got medium well.  The air is slightly smoky adding to the grill atmosphere. Bad stuff: We got double tipped.  The tip was already added to the bill when presented and the server didn't mention it.  We tipped on top of the already fully loaded bill.  Shame on us but shame on them too.  It's a BYO, and we split appetizers and skipped desserts, and our double tipped bill cost us $270 for six people!  I can't revisit a place that lacks scruples...
