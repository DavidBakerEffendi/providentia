A zero for wait staff and management. Did not get a chance to dine although there were plenty of open tables when we arrived. Was told on the telephone that they take walk ins... Arrived at the restaurant and was told an hour and a half wait. Had a drink at the bar and after waiting for over 25 minutes... And still open tables...asked a manager (a clown) how long they hold tables and was told 20 minutes. I have been in the business for years and know what a real restaurant hour and half wait time is. Left and had a fabulous meal at Koi... Trump Soho... Without the BS.
