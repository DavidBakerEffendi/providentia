The restaurant is set on several acres of sculpter gardens. Work up an appetite as you stroll the grounds. The ambience is wonderful. the service great. the food eclectic. the restaurant is a bit hard to find, so get directions. It's also a tad pricey but well worth it. There are concerts on the grounds that add to a wnderful ambience. The grounds and the restaurant can make for a very pleasant day.
