Why do they charge a cover at all when there is no dancing?  What is the cover for??   Most bars give away soda water for free.  This place charged us $2.25 every time!  And the bartenders kept trying to up-sell us larger drinks!   This place seems to only be in it for the money, rather than caring about their clientele, a sure receipt for failure!   Oh, and the bathroom was gross dirty. Side Note: Glastonbury need an enema!  I was told that this place can't have a dance floor.  The town need to help biz to succeed, change the zoning code!
