This place just doesn't do it for me. I have beaten better ramen for cheaper, and this place is overhyped. For me, I can basically eat a small portion and not be full, or I can eat until I'm full, but I have to spend a ton of cash. The ramen is alright, I guess. It's good, but for $13-14 before tax and tip it is a huge dent in my wallet. I wouldn't go again :/
