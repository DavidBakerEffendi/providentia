This place has great date night ambiance (although there were groups of friends out too) and great music. We came with our two year old. They don't have kids chairs but were friendly. The appetizers were our favorites-the octopus dish was outstanding; empanadas were good (though not as good as empanadas cafe in Corona); blood sausage was great. My chicken entree was fair, but who orders chicken at restaurants? The steak with chimichurri, ravioli and steak sandwich were all good. Would definitely return. Plus I believe they have a woman chef !
