This is the worst Chinese food I have ever tasted. I would sooner risk my life and go to the hood in Trenton for Chinese food than eat this $#@t. The rice was old and microwaved the shrimp tasted like rubber pucks. The calamari felt and tasted like my granddads leather loafer shoe strings. Enough of the humor I will be calling Lab-Corps in the morning and sending this food in for analysis. They charge me a service fee and a delivery fee. When I gave the driver a dollar he got mad. I reminded him the other half of his tip is at the restaurant. When I called to complain they offered me credit on the calamari, they admitted it may have been overcooked. I decline the credit i would not drink bottled water from them. Who ever is reading this you have been warned do not eat at this place.
