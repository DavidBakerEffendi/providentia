Stopped by Friday night and the place was JAM packed (we thought we'd never get a table!) but the two guys working were so great that they pulled down a chair and moved a table from nowhere and created a table for the three of us! It had been a while since I was here but the service remained top notch. On top of that, they had a ton of special items that were so delicious. Started off with two flights of oysters from Canada and the West coast. I usually just let them pick my wine and it always works out great. Again, I was not let down. Had some wonderful popcorn rock shrimp and sardines, and enjoyed more wine and oysters until I was ready to burst. It's a no brainer that this is one of my go to places.
