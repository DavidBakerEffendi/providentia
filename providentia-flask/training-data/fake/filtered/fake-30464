Came here mid afternoon for a late lunch. Not really knowing what to order I asked the waitress but all she said was it's very good, all very good. I had the lunch special some beef dish which was good. What taints this review is the menu clearly stated lunch specials 10.95. When I got the check it was 11.95!!!! When I asked she said the price had changed, apparently not on the menu. I ended up paying the 10.95 after showing them several menus with the 10.95 price, but gracious they were not. Left me with a bad taste in my mouth, will not be returning.
