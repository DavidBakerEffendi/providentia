Went  to Shannon Rose for lunch the other day with my husband and 5yr old.  Seating through out the place is horrible.  Tables are set up one on top of the other and no space to move.  Live entertainment was ok but extremely loud to the point where my daughter was yelling that the noise was hurting her ears.  We got our seats changed to a table with those high stool seats.  The table was barely big enough to fit our drinks let alone our food and it kept constantly rocking back and forth.  Then our food came.  Ordered a BLT.  I guess the B stands for BURNT because it was black as it could be.  Complained to the waitress and she said they should not have sent it out like that and then the manager came over to see if I wanted something else.  All I wanted at this point was to get out of there.  Definitely would NOT go back.
