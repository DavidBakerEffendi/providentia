I went to El Almacen a couple of weeks ago with friends. I have to say that they were very service minded both the host and our waitress. She did get an order wrong, instead of the fish tacos we got biff tacos, but hell, who cares, she just gave us the tacos as well, free of charge. I have to say that to this day the best biff carpaccio I have ever eaten has been here, I truely do recommend it! The only "bad" thing with this place is that I do not know if I would call it argentine cuisine but who cares it was great anyways!
