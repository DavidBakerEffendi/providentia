It's really a half a star maybe. His place is an Italian wanna be place. Two workers there at the entrance cafe (same day) seem to be working so angrily maybe due to 12/13/13 day. I ordered a latte with skim milk and I happen to change my mind with regards to using soy milk instead. It was embarrassing when the employee looked at me and said loudly "well you know skim milk and soy are different, next time tell the cashier because soy milk is more expensive." How rude.. Did I care about paying .50 cents or what ever it was more for my already ridiculously expensive latte ($4.95.. Or so), well not really. Batali or managers TRAINING your employees to a good customer service might be worthwhile. Not sure I would go back or could speak/recommend this place.
