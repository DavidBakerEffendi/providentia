I was recently turned to this cute eatery serving up the most delectable variations of meatballs served over staples like carrot and pea rissoto, perfectly made eldente spaghetti,  whipped buttery mash potatos, or you can have then in forms of mini sliders at $3 a pop, or heros and several other options that I don't recall at the moment but equally as tasty.  I ordered  the special meatball which happens to be chorizo sausage today ($7) which includes a flat foccacia bread and your choice of sauce; I chose the parmasan creme and for $4 more you can choose your 4 huge meatballs over a bed of goodies. I chose the carrot and pea risotto.  Needless to say,  my bowl was demolished and and I even picked at a few of my friends side dishes like the whipped mash potatos..veggies..yumm!  To wash it down I tried two of their reds which worked well with the heaviness of the dishes..also tried their creme soda that I thought was not too sweet and very refreshing.  And finally picked at my friends dessert..i expected their mint icecream to have the peppermint flavor like the normal mint and chips icecreme from our supermarket aisle. Nope..you actually can see the actual mint leaves churned within the ice cream..it's like a creme mojito.  I know it may seem like..goodness how much can this girl eat?  Trust me..I felt stuffed halfway...but I'm a foodie..if it tastes good I can't stop!  The portions are pretty decent and the pricing is fantastic!  Between all of us we paid 27 each..this included quite a few sides, an entree for each of us (total of 5)and a round of drinks and ice cream. Def not bad and the service was superb!  The only negative is the wait...it's downright painful.  But if you are in the mood for a little comfort food and don't mind the wait, this place has the formula down!
