I was intrigued to see that the top 1 restaurants in VT was a cookie, I decided to try. It is very good indeed !!! Worth the commute to the 74th which is a little out of hand things. The site is well hidden, you have to look carefully, but access is not difficult. Take a red line 1, 2 or 3 and stop at 72 which is very close. The site is tight, but the cookie is warm and always done on time. It's amazing crunchy middle out, but when the bites pedagogues chocolate melt. Worth checking out
