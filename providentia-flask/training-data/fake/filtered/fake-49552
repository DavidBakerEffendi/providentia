It's hilarious how people think this place is good!  I always give a restaurant the benefit of the doubt thinking that my first visit they could have been having an off day?  Which is why i went back for a second chance.... Just for starters, the service is rude and overwhelming!  When you walk in there about 5 people behind one counter?  You ask for a booth and they say they are reserved.  Once you get seated, a server asks if you're ready to order.....REALLY?  I just sat down- 8pm.  Then you begin to wonder if the reserved booths are real since the whole time i'm there, over an hour, they've been empty.  When you ask if the reservation was cancelled the rude manager tells you that people are coming and they are only for four to a booth, never two.  Whwn I sat down, there were 3 booths with parties of two?  Then I see her seat another party of two in a booth and I ask, what about them, she replies, oh there party is on there way.  Their remaining party never showed.  Meean while the 815 and 830 reserved booths had long expired since it was now 845. LIERS! I then wondered why the AC was blasting down on me when it was cool outside......maybe to keep the sushi fresh? After being harassed by every single waitress every 2 minutes, we were pressured into giving our order.  By then we were completely fed up so we left after being there almost an hour and feeling like I had been lied to and harassed.  The cold and rude service, the cold sushi fridge atmosphere and fake reservations really put me over the edge. NEVER AGAIN WILL THEY SEE MY HARD EARNED MONEY! Want a great all around sushi experience, go to Yuki Hana, Madison, NJ and ask for Andy....tell him Ozzie sent you!  :)
