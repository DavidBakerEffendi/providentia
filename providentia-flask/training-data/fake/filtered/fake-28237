This place is awesome!! Menu is complete with all things cheese... from traditional mac n cheese to nutella grilled cheese. They have lactose and gluten free options so it's perfect for just about everyone. Staff is super friendly, answered all my questions and gave great recommendations. Anyone in the Montclair area should do themselves a favor and stop in!
