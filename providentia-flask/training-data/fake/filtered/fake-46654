We went there for lunch and I was disappointed. The taste was not really Turkish except the bread. We chose Iskandar Kebab and Donar Kabab, Did NOT ahve any of these for lunch. These were on menu for LUNCH that were given to us. "They are for dinner!" Waitress said. Surprisingly did not have Dough (Most famous Turkish Yogurt drink). Can't believe a restaurant can name itself Turkish and dose not serve Yogurt drink. and finally, my iPhone battery was dying. When I asked if I can plug that in the store. They did have an outlet but did not allow me to plug in! Because "it is not our policy, sorry".
