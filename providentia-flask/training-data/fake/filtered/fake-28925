Kind of an odd place - big space, with room for more tables. Seems a little disorganized. But a great breakfast value with decent coffee. Check the specials board outside because there is no evidence of them inside, in writing or from the server. Our waitress never smiled, but provided perfect service. Would definitely return. The doughnuts are pretty amazing.
