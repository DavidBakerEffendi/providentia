ABSO-FANTASTIC is how I describe their sandwiches. Full of exciting flavors that makes your mouth dance and your tummy happy. The place is very cute too.   They make sandwiches the way I make them, with cilantro!  Have introduced 5 people (so far) to this place and they all agree, this place is great.  Some have even gone back a few times already! If you are not near the area, it is worth making the trip to savor the goodness.  Seriously.  If you are in the area, go as many times as you can.
