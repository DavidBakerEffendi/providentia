This place is terrible.  My worst experience in Astoria. In fact, by far my worst experience in NYC.  There are little food options and the burger my friend ordered was raw.  The owner/manager is extremely rude and condescending and I cannot believe people would return to this place.  I'm sure once the luxury of having a new place to go has worn off it will simply be occupied by regulars who have no real standards of night life or dining.
