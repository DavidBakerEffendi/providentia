What a great addition to Nolita!  Being from Staten Island and an avid fan of Joe & Pat's (best pizza on the island!) I was excited to try Rubirosa when it first opened and it did not disappoint.  The restaurant is broken up into three rooms.  The front room with the bar is a great spot to enjoy the food as well as the crowd which always seems to be young, hip and good looking.  The music selection adds to the overall ambience and sets the mood for everyone to enjoy.  The middle room has family style tables with a great view of the kitchen staff working their magic. This room is perfect for bigger parties. The pizza room in the back is dimly lit and more intimate than the rest of the restaurant and has a big skylight adding to the overall feel of the room. The pizza is amazing...I esp like the pizza with vodka sauce, the arugala pizza, and the pizza on the specials menu was amazing.   I guess I'm hooked on this place b/c I've been back numerous times since my first experience.  It's the type of place that you think about coming back to as soon as you take your last bite. I also recommend the handmade pasta (esp the manicotti) as well as the bruschetta with mushrooms and brushetta with duck.  There are also numerous gluten free options which my girlfriend highly recommends.   Overall, a 5 star restaurant without a hint of pretentiousness.  Great food, great drinks, and great atmosphere to fit whatever mood you're in.
