I have eaten here, and at the location on Main St. in Hartford many times, and I've had many good sandwiches and some good soups.  However, today I was served a cold cut which was not fresh, and this is the second time.  I like hot capicola and genoa, and one or the other was not good.  Could be the cap, because it's a slow mover, but I don't care.  I won't be going back.
