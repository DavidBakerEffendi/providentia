The pizza was greasy, undercooked, and lacked flavor. The meatball app contained only 2 overcooked meatballs that tasted as if they were frozen and reheated. The girl that took our order was very friendly, however the rest of the staff was not. The place is very dirty and dated. My daughter and I will never go back and would recommend almost any other local pizzeria.
