I'm a little confused by all the comments about poor service with this place. I've been here a few times now and I've never had anyone be rude. In fact they're all quite friendly! Certainly no one is going to gush over you, but I personally don't like too much attention anyway. It's enough for me that they take my order, bring me my food, and then the bill in a timely and polite fashion-what more could you want? As for the food, I think it's fantastic! I haven't explored the other pizza joints in center city so I can't compare it. The crust is thin and crisp, the sauce is good, and the ingredients are fresh, plentiful, and inventive. I've only had the pizza on their menu, so I can't speak for the rest of it, but what I've had I've loved! In the way of expense, it's a little up there. I wouldn't say over-priced considering the quality and variety of ingredients, but I'm on a very limited budget, so to me, it's on the high end. It's good that it's a BYOB because their beer list prices are beyond me.
