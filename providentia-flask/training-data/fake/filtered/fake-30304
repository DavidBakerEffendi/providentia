Went here for Valentine's Day as I had read good things and is a mere 5 minute walk from home. There was a special Valentine's Day menu, but I called ahead specifically to ask if the regular menu would be available as we weren't interested in the couples deal; they said yes. When arriving, the service was immediately terrible. The hostess ignored us when we arrived, told us it would "be a while" despite having reservations, and after our 15 minute wait, pointed us to our table. Â After reaching our table, we were given the Valentine's Day menu and I asked for the regular menu; we were told it was unavailable--only the bar menu was available. We were stuck ordering off of it. The server did not seem knowledgeable about the menu and largely ignored us. We ordered a bottle of wine (our 2nd choice as the first we ordered was unavailable) and no one ever came by to offer to refill our glasses. Complimentary bread with a spread and a "house made" olive oil was bland. The french onion soup was actually very good. It took an hour for our entrees to arrive (a good 45 minutes after finishing our soup) and were just average (roast chicken and grilled tuna). I don't think they justified the high price (especially on the bar menu). We didn't stick around for dessert. I would not recommend bothering with this place, unless you're in the mood for french onion soup and care to try to grab a seat in the small bar area at the front of the restaurant.
