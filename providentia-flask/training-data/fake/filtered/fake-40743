I actually worked here for a few weeks when I first moved to NYC as a host.  Being on staff allowed for free pizza and other food items, so I got to try the basic margherita pizza as well as the meatball. Both were delicious!  The crust is a bit smokey and thin (just like I like it!) and the sauce is perfect.  I would have liked more basil, but I'm the Basil Bandit, so there is no such thing as too much basil for me!   On the down side,  I will admit I thought it was kinda crazy that the restaurant was CASH only (even for take out!). When I would work the delivery counter I would be flabbergasted at people who would call and order maybe 10 pies (each at $20.25 for just the standard cheese with no additional toppings)--how do they have that much cash???  The pies are a bit overpriced in my opinion, so, it was nice to get our pies free as employees, otherwise I wouldn't have been able to afford to eat the food. And I kind of think it's ridiculous that they charge $3-4 for each additional topping. But apparently that is standard practice in many "finer" pizzerias in the city.  And yes, the place gets crowded at certain times of the day (particularly around 1pm and 7pm) I would definitely recommend trying it at least once, whether you're a tourist or a native New Yorker.
