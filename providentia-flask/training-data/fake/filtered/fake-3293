I have been enjoying the food here for several years.  They have delivery but I usually go in because I enjoy chatting with the owner and his family who work alongside him.  I've no where near got to sample the whole menu...it's so vast combined with Egg Roll Express...which I also enjoy.  My daughter & I -- sushi; my son -- lo mein.  Yesterday, I had the Peppered Tuna Tataki appetizer.  It was 5 stars!  I hadn't ordered it before and was nervous with all the wasabi mustard it would be too spicy.  But it was perfect. And the other wonderful thing was while I waited a few minutes I got to meet the owner's 4 year old grandson.  What a charmer!  And it brought me back to my own childhood spending time in my grandfather's steak house restaurant.  Different cuisines, different décor....special memories across generations.  In fact all along Park Road West Hartford, are family run businesses.  And I like that.
