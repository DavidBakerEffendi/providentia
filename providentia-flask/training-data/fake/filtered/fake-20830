Prior to changing the menu I would have given this place 5 stars! Use to be one of my favorite places to drink and eat. Too many changes that take away from unique quality the Half Door used to have. Specialty brunch drinks are no more, amazing Curry sauce is gone, no seasonal specials. Overall the kitchen is much more generic and less creative. Love Shay and Elyse, best servers, they care but can't change things!
