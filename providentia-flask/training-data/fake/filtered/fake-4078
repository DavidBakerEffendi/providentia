Well this place is amazing, best said.  We dined in the really cool basement,  lending this sort of hidden French bistro feeling which we both liked alot.   Tried the grilled cheese,  it is in the top 4 i've ever had except for 1) my own 2) the ones me and Mom used to make in the 70's in that amazing Presto Sandwich maker & 3) this fontina, mozzarella & brie "sandwiche" I got on the Autostrada near Sorrento, Italia.   The cubano sandwich was average, can't hold a candle to its namesake I partook of in Key West at a real Cuban street cafe.    The pork slider was awesome, except  it was a bit lacking, as some French chefs will add a dollup of fresh mayo and some fresh herbs .    No time or room for dessert,  will be back to try out next time.
