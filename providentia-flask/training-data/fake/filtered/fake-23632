After a two hour wait: Limp French Fries, smallest piece of arctic char known to mankind, overly salted pork belly. Good friend zucchini and very good good burger, but one out of three dishes and some strips of fried veggies not enough to justify the long wait. This is pub grub that does not deserve the gastro.
