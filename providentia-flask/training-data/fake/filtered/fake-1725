Does anyone else think the Pork Buns taste like burger king original chicken sandwich, except spicy and with pork? Â Amazing. My first time here definitely wont be my last. Great to split the ramen with a date, do not order two. Had a cold tofu and avocado app that changed my life, also my underpants.
