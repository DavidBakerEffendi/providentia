Wonderful restaurant! The bar area is reminiscent of an old NYC tavern-great menu options and a phenomenal wine list. When friends and I go, we always sit by the bar because we love talking to the bartenders about what to drink. They're knowledgeable and will suggest the best concoction to go with your mood and your food. The other part of the restaurant is an unforgettable experience-impeccable service, fresh ingredients, and overall a creative menu that uses the best food of the season. I have never been disappointed. Gramercy Tavern should be reserved for special occasions because you need to take it all in to truly enjoy it. If it were up to me, I'd have a special occasion at least twice a month just so I have an excuse to visit this timeless and classy New York Institution.
