I'm not a huge hibachi fan but I thought the food was fantastic and plentiful.  I took more than half of my food home because I just couldn't finish it all as did my husband who almost never leaves anything on his plate.  As for the sushi, the roll selection is limited but what they do have is fairly good quality.  It's weird that they don't list the a la carte on the menu but anyone who eats sushi typically knows what they order on a regular basis so this doesn't bother me and we just ask for whatever we want although it would make it easier if they offered sushi slips.  I think the salads are great, love the avocado salad and the crab salad -- I always get one of the two.   I'm not crazy about the set up on the non-hibachi side of the restaurant.  I like everything except for that the booths are easily moved -- everytime I'm there the person in the booth behind me leans back or shifts and the whole booth (which is attached to my seat) moves.  I almost got shoved into my table face first when someone plopped down hard in their seat and practically spilled my tea into my lap.  Not fun when you're trying to have a relaxing and enjoyable dinner but overall I like the food very much.  The service has been spotty in the past but seems to be getting better.
