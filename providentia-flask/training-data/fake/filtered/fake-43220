Waffles are addicting and their coffee is the best I have had since my last visit to Europe. We stopped in this weekend and were delighted to see they have added a new weekend brunch menu. Saturday and Sunday! We normally go for the waffles and panini but couldn't resist the brunch menu. We had the Strawberry French Toast, the Raspberry Marscapone Stuffed French Toast, the Eggs Benedict and Blueberry pancakes.  Truly amazing...every bite was better than the next and all was reasonably priced. The pancakes were light and fluffy, from scratch is my guess and loaded with blueberries. The Strawberry French Toast was made with Challah Bread, tremendous in size and they didn't scimp on anything. The Stuffed French toast was oooey gooey tasty and the Eggs benedict was deliciously different. Instead of using an  English muffin they split a "savory waffle" and topped it with two perfectly cooked poached eggs, Canadian bacon and homemade Hollandaise. We were so impressed and will definitely be back! We noticed that they have added more panini's and wraps to their menu too.  Can't wait for next weekend! Thanks Bonte!
