It's a petite place but the atmosphere is warm and inviting. The place is very cute, small and intimate, perfect for a date. I really appreciate in a dessert, and it still had the right oomph and delicateness for a crepe. The service was also great. Our waitress was attentive, friendly and answered all of the questions we had for her and gave us recommendations.
