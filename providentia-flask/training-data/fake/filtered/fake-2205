I took my friend for breakfast here. I'd gone to Clinton St. Baking Company on many occasions before, and it was always on-the-go. This time around, my friend and I ordered enough for two and took our sweet time to enjoy ourselves. When we finished our food, we were told that we had to leave because others were waiting. Really?! I have to leave because I finished my food and cannot take my time to drink my cafe con leche with my friend and talk?! Is this a joke?! Well, this was THE last time I went to this diner. I am the one who pays the bill and I am the one who decides how long I want to enjoy myself. I found Balthazar for breakfast. Go to Balthazar in Soho if you want delicious food and the experience of not being rushed.
