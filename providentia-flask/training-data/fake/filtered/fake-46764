I have been to Matthew's Italian Restaurant for a lunch and a dinner.  During lunch, the service was surprisingly quick and a higher quality meal than what is available at other options in the area.  Their dinner was excellent.  I had the veal saltimbocca and it was delicious.  The veal was tender and flavorful.  I also tried the stuffed mushrooms appetizer and was more than pleased.  It was as good as what I have had at premier restaurants in NYC.  The staff was friendly and you can tell that they know many of their regular customers.  I have recommended this place to my friends and colleagues and they have all had similar experiences.  This is a nice spot for a date or for a business lunch.
