I almost hate writing a review, because this place is a real treasure that i would love to keep to myself. But that said, La Slowteria is a new gem in the neighborhood and is worthy of being known as the best in its kind.The food, the atmosphere, the service- everything felt as an extension of my own home, if only my cooking was anywhere close to Hugo's creations. I have celebrated my birthday there and i have to say, so far it is the most memorable experience i have ever had.
