The short: The food is awesome. Everything is farm fresh and organic. Portions are intriguing, creative, piquant and healthy sized! Prices are a bargin for the quality of the food. Waitstaff and cooks are incredibly friendly and knowledgable and the restaurant atmosphere is cozy, hip and welcoming. The long: I was in town from Boston and my friend had strongly recommended that I try Iris, I made the trip from Manhattan with a large party and was blown away. The restaurant has an open concept, the dining room and the kitchen are connected and separated only by the bar, which adds for a very charming and amicable feel. Upon entering you are greeted by extremely cordial employees, from the waitstaff to even the cooks (if you are lucky enough to sneak some eye contact when they're not prepping the food). The menu is very creative with daily original specials, the prices are extremely fair for the quality of the food you're receiving as most is from local farmers. My party started with oysters from long island, followed by the smoked trout pate, roasted vegetables and young greens. My partner and I followed with the fish in broth and the pasta of the day, which was a broccoli rabe pesto. We finished with the cheese plate, with local farm cheeses, the chocolate tarte, which was beautifully complemented with sea salt to add an invigorating contrast, and the posset of the day that was made with lavender and some how magically made without eggs and served with crunchy cookies which we were certain to use as spoons. I strongly recommend. Try to go with a large party so you can try a little bit of all the menu, there is so much ingenuity and such little stomachs! I really enjoyed my meals and my experience and it was not too hard on the wallet.
