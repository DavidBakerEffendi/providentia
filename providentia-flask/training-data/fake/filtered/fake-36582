My wife and I went to this place on our anniversary. It was our first time and we were greatly impressed. The owner or manager brought us out a slice of pecan pie a la mode after our dinner and did not charge us for it. The food and pie was was delicious. We highly recommend this place to eat and to be honest the ribs and their sauce was the best we ever had. Give this place a try and you will not be disapointed.
