My experience at this restaurant was absolutely awful. I will never ever go back here again. I made a reservation with La Sirene a week before hand and spoke to Didier himself. Perfectly pleasant. Called the day before to confirm and even got a confirmation call the day off. We all get to the restaurant 1/2 hr. I checked in with Dider and he said our table would be ready in 15 mins. We sat down, they opened our wine, it was fine until this moment -- when he realizes he can't find out reservation. Which is complete BS when I spoke to them at least 3 times over the past week. He doesn't even bother trying to solve the situation and rudely tells us to get out. Especially knowing our bottle of wine is open. After 5 minutes of working with the reservationist who says she remembers be calling her to confirm they find my reservation and he still kicks us out!! He handled this situation very very badly. We were even willing to wait for another table to be ready and he couldn't care less. Because he couldn't find our reservation that immediate second he chose to throw us out and accomodate the other reservation that he thought we were although we were the ones already sitting down with our bottles of wine open. Absolutely ridiculous. I've never experienced anything like this in my life and will never recommend this restaurant to anyone. Half of the dining experience is customer service and the way your treated. There are better ways Didier could have handled it. This place doesn't even deserve 1 star.
