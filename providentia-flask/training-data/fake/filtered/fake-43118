I was at Mehek on Saturday for dinner.  I noticed that it was packed and I learned my lesson that a packed/busy restaurant is the one you should try and not the restaurant that has empty tables.  Very cool ambiance...decor: simple yet elegant (gorgeous silk curtains...luv them).  The food was really good and the service was very friendly.  I wanted to try something different so I ordered lamb malabari, biryani and garlic naan.  The lamb malabari was so good...it was an unexpected delicious combination of sweet and curry spices mixed together.  The sauce (light in color) was like a thick curry with coconut milk (no dairy added).  The biryani rice was excellent (a bit spicy but went well with the sweetness of the lamb malabari).  The garlic naan...a must try when you're there!  The portions were a good size.  I definitely recommend this restaurant and will be going back.  The location is great too.
