Awesome place, sat outside and had a wonderful view of the sunset. Our waitress was the bartender so had some really great drinks, she also offered some cool recipes. I started with the Mojito which was deiish! We also ordered a bottle of their house wine, for $20 it was sweet but went really well with the fish!! Dinner and apps were really good and authentic. It was definately pricey but well worth it.. Everyone was really nice and even the owner came out and asked how everything was, etc. I would definately go back!
