Terrible food experience.  Schnitzel tasted like it had been fried in well-used oil. My wife's was at least cooked.  Mine was bright pink. Sides were underwhelming but ok. $77 for 2 including 1 glass of wine, 2 iced teas and no appetizers or desserts. Beer selections looked pretty good; however, we would not come back.
