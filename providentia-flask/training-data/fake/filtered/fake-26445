I was in town for the weekend with a girlfriend and Parc came highlighted recommended by some work friends.  We were not disappointed...the food was amazing and the service was excellent!  The atmosphere was hip and just what we were looking for.  We started with the warm shrimp salad and the onion soup...yum!  Then we both shared the steak frites and the moules frites...out of this world!  The frites were delicate and I was sad that I couldn't eat them all...I was just too full! I HIGHLY recommend Parc and am looking forward to my next visit :)
