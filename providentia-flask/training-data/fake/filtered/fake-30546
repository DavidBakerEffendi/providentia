I used to frequent this place about 7 to 9 years ago when I was in college in Center City, it was my favorite place for martini's, ambience, and food. Whenever people ask me where to go in Philly, that is one of the places that I send them. I went back recently (a few days ago, I've been busy) and I have to say that they are still consistent and I am very impressed. It used to be that the only draw back were stick thin waitresses and bartenders who seemed to be so angry at you because they hadn't eaten in weeks and were jealous of everything on your table... Not the case anymore. My husband and I enjoyed a wonderful time there without the kids (not kid friendly but that's a good thing for an adult night out on the town) and our service was great. Our waitress informed us that is was Tapas style and that our food would arrive as it was ready and that we should try to share everything to get the full experience. We took her advice and got a few small dishes and then Rad Na Thai Chicken and the filet for dinner and it was just as I remembered it... perfect. The Rad Na was my favorite dish back in the day and it still is. I get it without the lettuce cause I just want all the delicious noodles, sprouts, peanuts, and chicken. The wasabi mash was brilliant and the jus with the steak really complimented the entire dish. The drinks were great too, but they always are. My husband had the Dean Martin and I had an Old Fashioned. We're both all about oldies but goodies. I guess that might be why we like this place.
