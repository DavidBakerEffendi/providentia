This is one of my favorite places to go eat. they have really great chinese food it reminds me of when I went to China and it really blows me away. The soup dumplings are so great I can eat two orders of them. When ever I go here there is never anything to bring home. I'm not a big eater so I usually bring home food from a restaurant and eat it for lunch the next day but I love this place so much I never have any food left!! The best part about this place though is they are able to manage large groups. I've gone in with 8 maybe 9 people and they were able to sit and serve all of us in a timely manner it was grand! If your looking for a lovely place to get great quality chinese food and pay a great price this is it!
