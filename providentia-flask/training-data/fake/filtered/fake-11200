Very disorganized. I am extremely disappointed by the staff as well. Maybe they're not being paid enough, maybe they're not being appreciated by their management. Whatever it is - but customer service is terrible. The pastry lady was grumpy. The guy at the coffee station at the very entrance was plain obnoxious and self-involved. The ladies at the restaurant wait list don't seem to care you're there. The take-out pasta and pizza are overpriced and not good at all, especially for the price they're asking. Yes, Lavazza coffee is wonderful and the gelato is perfect, but the lack of organization and the lack of customer care are a deal breaker. Tourists are brought here on excursions and I honestly don't know why. The place is overrated.
