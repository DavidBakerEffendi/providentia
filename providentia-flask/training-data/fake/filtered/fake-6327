Normally 4 stars but we were very disappointed with the meal and the service. The male server with a very strong Italian accent was more interested in the woman in the next booth, flirting and BSing during our visit. We had to ask a number of time for water, took forever to get our check, food was cold and when we mentioned it , they took it back and they just heated the macaroni and seafood. Came back mushy and the seafood was never returned. Now I'm having second thoughts about returning, the other couple were also displeased.
