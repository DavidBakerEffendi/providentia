Our first time visit a few years back was extraordinary. Very friendly and have 4 shirts on the house. We devoured the entrees, appetizers, and 3 half pies and 1 for home. We live out in Long Island, 80 miles round trip but never think about the time and gas especially when we need to introduce people from out of state to the best Sicilian in NY. I subtracted two stars for my last two visits. On our next to last visit, the two half pies came out I e cold with hot sauce spread on top and before the appetizers. We sent them back and the people we brought there from California asked me what all the bragging was about. Just yesterday, I brought my family and two nephews from Florida 40 miles in traffic on a rainy day. This time we were fine until I asked nicely for a couple of shirts for my out of towners. Some older gentleman working there " drilled " them about " where in Florida". When the waiter came back he said, " our order for the new year didn't come in yet so we have none". I said I am paying for them and to double Â check and if not I'll buy two hats instead, he returned and said they are out of hats too. I called the next day and asked about this and I was told clearly that there are plenty of hats and shirts because she does the ordering. So, you lie to a regular customer that just travelled 80 miles round trip with guests again, spent $200.00 plus gas? On principle alone, I won't be back, I may miss the pizza, they probably won't miss my money but its a sad trend that they may be creating.
