This place is nothing special and the food is pretty weak. I was expecting so much more based on prior reviews. First of all - why do they put caramel on everything? We all look forward to ordering brussels sprouts from restaurants this time of year..well folks do not order them here. They come doused in a barrage of CARAMEL. Caramel, and/or sugar in general, should never be mixed with a green vegetable like brussel sprouts. It tasted like a slimy, bad dessert when I was hoping for some kind of crisp and savory brussel delight. It was just WRONG.   The hanger steak was mediocre, again, nothing special. The quinoa salad was your average run-of-the-mill quinoa dish (AKA bland and boring) and left me with a stomach ache. Apple tart dessert was lame. It was just apples, basically no crust. This was supposed to be a tart, I didn't order apple sauce. The ambiance and the food are similar to that of every other quaint west village restaurant except here there is nothing spectacular to set it apart. It's just a wannabe Waverley Inn or Spotted Pig. Considering it's on the corner of a relatively busy intersection (Hudson + Morton) and it's floor-to-ceiling windows are covered with tacky white curtains, the discreet sign-less façade and unmarked entrance through a courtyard are laughable, really. If you're going to be too-cool-for-school and pretend like you're some hidden gem of a restaurant, you need to offer amazing food and perhaps a unique dining atmosphere. Hudson Clearwater does neither.
