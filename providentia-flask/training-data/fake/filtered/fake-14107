Weekdays lunch... Omg, they were packed in there!!!! Had to wait a little bit but when I got the food it was hot and tasty... Had the chicken & shrimp combo w/ noodles "Awsome"... Plus Â I got a roll called Ahi-Tuna :-) amazing...fried crispy outside and original inside loved it... Staff there r so friendly too..
