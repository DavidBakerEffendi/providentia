I ordered $100 worth of sweets for a party and paid 2 day shipping. UPS screwed up and delivered the sweets to the wrong address. By the time the sweets came to my house in the evening, they were broken in pieces and full of ants. Had to throw it all away. UPS told me they were sorry and would refund the money to Sukhadia. Sukhadia in turn does not want to respond to my inquiry about refunding my money. At least they should refund my shipping cost that UPS is refunding to them. I made a mistake of ordering so much sweets without looking at the reviews about them. BUYERS BEWARE. Do not order anything from them unless you want to lose it!
