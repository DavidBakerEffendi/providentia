the owner here has to be one of the most thoughtless people I ve encountered..I m a working musician with a serious music duo that plays all throughout the tri state area...against my better judgement, we booked a gig at this establishment(for a discount hoping we could help him build his business and then he would reward us in time with more $$) and he cancelled us twice!!!!the second time he never even called..I found out by calling him...we passed up other gigs to be here and his remorse seemed phony...I would not go here if it was the last place on earth...completely wrong on his part...beware of any place that has no regard for there employees or hired labor Â in any capacity!!!!!
