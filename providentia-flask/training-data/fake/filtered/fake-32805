I absolutely LOVE this place. THE best empanadas I've had in New York. They have empanadas with different fillings. Though you may have to wait until your order is ready, the wait is worth it. They even sell frozen Empanadas for you to make at home. When I lived in the area, for Halloween I remember they included a complimentary empanada with chocolate filling .... How thoughtful of them. Also, I'm not sure if they still do this but if you take a look at the crust Â of the empanada, you will find the type of emapanada it is.
