hands down the best and freshest seafood in the city. i always come down here located in the Les a little small but i definitely un whine when i come here . i always get shrimp or king crab legs you name it the craw fish is ok also. the special boil sauce is the best sauce invented ever. the thing is its cash only and the atm cost almost 4 dollars to withdraw but the prices are cheap and bayou drink is delicious aw well.
