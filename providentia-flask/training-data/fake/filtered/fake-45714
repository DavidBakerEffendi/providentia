This was my third or fourth trip to Garces.  I was very happy the first few times.  We went on a Sunday a few weeks ago.  We had an app of radishes and butter and a salad with croutons, bacon and a soft boiled egg on top; both delicious. Then the pizza came.  It was a mushroom pizza.  The crust was limp and not fully cooked.  We ate it. For dinner we got a lamb meatball app which was heavenly and we ordered a grilled chicken dish.  I can deal with pink in my chicken but it was raw and cool in the center.  We sent it back.  When it came out again, it was still not fully cooked and the potatoes and the vegetables were cool.  I guess we got the same ones back.   I will go back, b/c I really like the place but I can't say it's my favorite anymore.   The service was very good.  One pet peave I have with almost all waitrons these days:  we always leave at least 20%; often more to cover BYOB stuff.  Only once in the past year have I had a waiter stop back and thank us for the tip.  Garces was not the place it happened. joe
