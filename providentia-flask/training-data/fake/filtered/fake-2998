Came here on Saturday night (one of the first great weather nights in a while) and expected a wait but the ambiance and town itself was alive with everyone else who has been cooped up all summer longing for a great night out. The wait was worth it. Flavor, flavor and more flavor. The staff is nice and accommodating and the food really is something you can't get anywhere else. Had the Chicharron de Pollo and it was to die for. We also had the empanada appetizer which I could have eaten a hundred of. Only downside is they do not have a liquor license which is sometimes a blessing as you don't have to deal with high 'up-pricing'...I just wish I could have tried some type of authentic Cuban drinks to add to the meal...but definitely not a deal breaker. BTW there is a bottle king right up the road. Overall great time and great experience. Highly recommend.
