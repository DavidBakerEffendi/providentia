Best pizza. Hands down. Anywhere. The crust is tender and delectable with the perfect char. The sauce is simple and delicious and the toppings are always fresh and of the highest quality. If you love pizza, and you have not eaten here, you have not lived. Add this place to your bucket list. Plus, Paulie is awesome!
