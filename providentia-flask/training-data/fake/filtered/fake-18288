We have ordered from Genteel's for over a year now and have never received a delivery order correctly or in good condition.  If we order pizza and you open the box all the cheese is stuck to the cardboard.  We ordered pasta in sauce the other night and the delivery guy actually tried to give us the meal in a plastic shopping bag dripping with sauce from a container bent and crushed.  The food is good at Genteel's BUT DO NOT REQUEST DELIVERY - either eat in or pickup your food.  The delivery guys are the worst...  We are going to stick to our favorite place D'Angelo's from now on.
