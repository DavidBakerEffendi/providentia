I had previously dined at their LES location and had enjoyed my meal there. This was not the case this time. Arrived at 10:45 and asked for a table. We were promptly seated and told that the kitchen was closing soon. Waitress came by and we ordered drinks (a beer and a negroni), antipasti and entrees. Antipasti arrived before the drinks, which were not delivered together. Antipasti were ok, nothing bad but nothing great either. Entrees fared better. However, when we were done, the waitress came by and asked if we'd like coffee. We said yes and dessert as well. She came back to inform us that they were no longer serving dessert?! what?! I couldn't believe it  and told the waitress we wanted the check.  She went over and was haggling with the manager/maitre'd  for a while and then came back to tell us that they could in fact serve dessert. No thanks. Paid our check and walked down the street to Buttermilk Channel and asked if they were still serving. The very kind owners said that the kitchen was closed but were happy to scoop some ice cream themselves and gave it to us on the house! Now that is hospitality. I will no longer patronize any of the Frankie's establishments.
