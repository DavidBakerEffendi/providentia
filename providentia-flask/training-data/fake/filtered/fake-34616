I have been to this restaurant several times now and not only was the food, service and staff great, but the entertainment was also great! The food was outstanding and Â chef Anthony came to our table to make sure everything was perfecto! I was so impressed, I just booked a party there for September. I never ordered a meatball at a restaurant my life. As an Italian woman you would understand that... but because I was with my brother the first time I went he ordered it. The inside out meatball was delicious with a litlle surprise inside :) Excellent! I have been sending friends and family there now and they never dissappoint. I would highly recommend this restaurant.
