This is a small chain restaurant in CT.  Great food, great specials, great service, and great atmosphere.  We went here on a whim and had drinks, the table guacamole, and a couple of the specials.  the food was tasty and hot and everything came out n the proper timing.  the servers all were pleasant and knowledgeable and our drinks were never empty.  We felt welcomed and would definitely come again. This gets four stars, not five, only because the prices are a bit higher than other, non-chain, authentic Mexican place around.  I highly recommend this place; we will be back.
