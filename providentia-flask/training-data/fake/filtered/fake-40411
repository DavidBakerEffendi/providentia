The food in this place is amazing.  The prices are reasonable, the portions very generous and most importantly, the food tastes great.  I'm very familiar with what thai dishes should taste like, and this is comparable to food you'd get in Thailand.  I would recommend any of the shrimp dish entrees as well as the pad thai, and any of the fried rice options. Regarding the service, I've seen the reviews about the bad service, but that's not at all what I've experienced.  Have been here twice and each time had very nice waitresses.  Even the hostess was not bothered when we wanted to move inside after having a table in their lovely outside garden area. This is my family's new favorite Thai restaurant.
