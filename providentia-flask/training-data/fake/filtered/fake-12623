Walked up to the front door, hostess walked outside from bar next door (that they own and ask waiting folks to sit at while wiaitng for a dinner table). She asked us for our name, told us it would be an hour - this was a monday night. I peeked inside and there were table seats open, and bar stools opens. Asked if we could sit at the bar to eat, the hostess quickly said those bar seats are also for the wait list. We put our name down, and gave our cell phone #. Never got a call from them.
