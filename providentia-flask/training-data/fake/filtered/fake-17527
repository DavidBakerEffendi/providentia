One of the best Japanese restaurants I have ever been in my life. I was amazed by the way how they serve dishes. I felt like I really ended up somewhere in Japan, Good asian design,the high quality of food, japanese looking servers - all these features show top level of this restaurant. I d mention their sushi in particular. Really fresh fish helped me to discern this place among a lot of other japanese restaurants that just serve a fresh looking fish while it is not so. The way the sushi are served is also worth to mention about. It is the whole art to make it like they did. Overall, i would strongly recommend real asian food lovers to visit this place
