What can I say? The joint is fabulous. Fresh, creative (while not necessarily traditional, but that's okay) sushi served in a comfortable, friendly dining room. Some of the best Miso soup EVER and their wine list is put together in a way that complements the menu. We will often go with the chef's choice and we've never been disappointed. Some of our other favorites are the Tuna Tataki, the seaweed salad, kimchee with tofu and Sake Don. Try it. You will not be disappointed.
