WE LOVE GAIA!!! We stopped in randomly on a Saturday when she first opened and we have been back multiple times a week ever since. It is by far the best sandwich place in the city and the CHEAPEST! $5 for a sandwich with fresh bread that she bakes there, are you serious?! It's less expensive than fast food and everything is fresh, imported, just amazing. I haven't gotten anything there that I haven't liked, and I have tried pretty much everything on the menu. I'm partial to the Elegante and the Delicioso, but both the meat and vegetable lasagna are delicious as well. I will say though, do not come here if you're in a rush. There's a small staff and the place is constantly crowded, and even if you're getting your food to go it can take upwards of 15 minutes for them to make it.
