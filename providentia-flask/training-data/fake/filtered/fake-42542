I went to the moshulu for a party on a Saturday night and it felt like I was at someones cookout. The place is a mess. They have wicker chairs, plastic cups, and BBQ grill going. They advertise as upscale but it was very down right ghetto. They do not inforce a dress code you can wear anything Â and anyone can go. Just a mess. Never again. Don't waste you time going.
