I have been here a few times though last night was by far the best experience. We arrived early as we had  an opening to attend. We were seated at a nice table in the dining room where the ambiance is warm and inviting if a little dark. We ordered, I guess, family style with the intent of sharing each dish. We had two crostini - ricotta and a crabmeat one - which were both fantastic. The ricotta was rich and creamy and the crabmeat was delicate though spiced with a razor thin slice of jalapeno that gave it a crunchy kick. Yum. We had baby kale green salad as well as a bitter green salad which were both tasty. Two pastas which I didn't try but my friends devoured them. Two sides - brussels sprouts with pancetta and cheese and broccoli rabe. Desserts included a chestnut (?) chocolate cake, a lemon tart with some ridiculously delicious gelato (buttermilk I think) and an apple tart-like thing. Wines by the glass and after dinner drinks were all carefully chosen and delish. Service was friendly and fantastic.  A very fun night and one of the bets mealsI have had in Manhattan in a long time. Andare!
