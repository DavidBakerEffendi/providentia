This was our second visit to Osteria Giotto. The first time (roughly 2 years ago), we fell in love with this place - great food, great atmosphere, great service. So when we ended up in Montclair, this was our first dinner choice. And it was a disappointment. Still great atmosphere, still great service and large portions but the food was... meh. Mussels and claims appetizer - great, specially the broth for dipping the delicious breads. But here comes the disappointment. My spinach salad - boring, just a pile of spinach with few walnuts and tomatoes. Our older son's pasta with lobster and shrimp was ... well... too much of seafood taste to a point of you could not taste the pasta. My husband's pasta dish with sausage and mushrooms - salty and under cooked.  The only dish i really liked was the lasagna - rich, smooth, delicious.  Sorry, Giotto, maybe better in another 2 years. :)
