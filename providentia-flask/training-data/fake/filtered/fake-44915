The cheese was like rubber and the crust was horrible and doughy. We hardly ate it, we had a few bites because we were hungry but I would never order/eat there again. Save your, time, money, and frustration, and go elsewhere, you'll thank me later. This place is so NOT worth the money they charge. Either for drinks or food.. They give you small glasses and the liquor as flowing like mud in that place and they charge you through the roof, even though the bartender is SO light on the pour.. not to mention the wait staff has a major bug up there... Totally rude! This place went really down hill after the new owners took over. Wait till they go bankrupt, and another person takes over before you try to go here.. Trust me.
