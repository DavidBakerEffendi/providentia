I waited to sit down for 15 minutes to be seated at a miniscule table at the back of the restaurant, 2 feet away from the restroom.  I was then bumped into several times by people trying to get into it.  That table shouldn't be placed there at all, as my friend had a view of the toilet for our entire lunch.  I overpaid for a small salad with little flavor and could barely find the chicken it it...  not too impressed.
