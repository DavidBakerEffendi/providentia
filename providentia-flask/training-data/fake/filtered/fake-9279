I have a feeling that when this spot gets more reviews, the real ones will balance out the friends' ones. It wasn't the worst. Had a burger and it was good, but does that make a place worthy of 4 or 5 stars? Absolutely not. The food was nowhere near gourmet level. Â I felt that the service could've been better. Our server was too busy speaking with friends to pay us much attention. Don't think I'll be back.
