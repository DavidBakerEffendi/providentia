This place is amazing!! Squash dumplings are ridiculous! This is a good spot to take a date, with romantic candlelit ambiance, small couple tables and a quiet atmosphere. Delicious food and the best drinks int he Union Square area make Ichabod's a great find. The atmosphere is quaint, and the service was great. Tucked into Irving Place, this place gets packed after work so be sure to make a reservation!
