WORST EXPERIENCE EVER!! This place is NOT BYOB !!! After looking at their website we saw it was BYOB and went and picked up a bottle of Sangria from the liquor store. My husband and I walked in Friday night and the place was packed (partly because it was raining and the outside seating was closed). We put our name on the list and the owner said "no more than 20 minutes wait."  35 minutes later we were still waiting and he was giving tables to other people he came AFTER us. After we complained he finally sat us 45 minutes after we arrived. The place was a zoo! Very noisy and chaotic. I had to scream across the table to even talk to my husband. 15 minutes later, a waiter approached us to finally take our order. We told him we had our own sangria and he said that we could purchase their NON-alcoholic sangria for $14.95 and mix our sangria into it. We asked to speak to the owner. The owner said the same thing and said he had been arrested for this and was on probation. My husband told him your website does not state this and why would I dilute my sangria with yours? The owner said that was the policy. An hour after arriving and still starving we walked out. Plus, they did not have any vegetarian choices. We went  another place that gladly accommodated us with great service and had a better time. I recommend the ironbound section in Newark for better and cheaper food. DO NOT GO TO CUBAN PETE'S!!! I never write reviews, but after being mislead, I did not want someone else to have the same bad experience I did.
