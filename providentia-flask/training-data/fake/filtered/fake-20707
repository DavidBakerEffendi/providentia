This place has a lot of potential.  The food was good, the wine on tap very drinkable, the service friendly.  It just doesn't seem to all come together yet - maybe that takes time with a new restaurant.  The booth at the back of the restaurant has a direct view of the kitchen and exposure to the bright light that is there, which kind of ruins the ambiance at those seats.  Once we were moved to another table (which they honored without complaint), I enjoyed the place a lot more.  Looking forward to seeing how they adapt the menu to the spring weather.
