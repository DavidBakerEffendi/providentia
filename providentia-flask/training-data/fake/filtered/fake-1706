Just went here last night for the first time. The service was great and our waitress was warm and attentive despite how busy she was. We had the lobster bisque and west coast oysters to start. The soup was so flavorful and the oysters were beautifully fresh. Â We split the cowboy steak with three sides for our main. Everything was delicious and cooked to perfection especially the creme fraiche mashed potatoes. Only downsize was the noise level but that's hard to avoid in a packed restaurant
