I have no idea what Flora is talking about! Can't be the real Ancora which is, on balance, very good to excellent. Fine Northern Italian food. Seafood and fish are always fresh and well prepared. Sauces are interesting and the pasta is always excellent. Have eaten there quite a few times and have never been disappointed. When they have it, the monkfish is outstanding. Meat and chicken dishes are consistently very good too. Decent wine selection. Prices are, by comparison to equivalent resturants, very reasonable. Â Waiters are fun and very helpful. Tony, the maitre'd is a trip!
