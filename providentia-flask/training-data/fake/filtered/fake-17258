Horrible customer service.  I'm vegan and have heard they have messed up orders before.  We stressed vegan on the phone, even the receipt said soy cheese, but in the burrito was real cheese.  Besides being vegan I've become lactose intolerant over the years.  Even though it made me sick it was refund or redo only.  For a situation like mine i think it merits both for physical and ethical reasons. they did not agree.  So here's the only way you can tell: the regular cheese is white mozeralla and the vegan cheese orange daiya pepper jack. Vegan buyers beware!!!
