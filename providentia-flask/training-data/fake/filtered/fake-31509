This turned out way better then what I expected it to; the night didn't begin very well. During the day I was called to confirm my reservations and was told I would only be given a 15 minute grace period and then my table would go to someone else. I rushed through traffic coming all the way from upper Manhattan and made it there just on time, to then be told they didn't know how long I would have to wait for my table. Apparently there was a large party that had been sitting there for about 2 hours and they could not rush them out as the hostess told me. We then asked to speak to the manager and Lance came to the rescue, he apologized for the wait and immediately set up a table for us. He put the first round of drinks on the house and a dessert platter since I was there celebrating my birthday. The food was amazing, the drinks were delicious and strong and the desserts were finger licking good. I would go back there in a heartbeat, and of course thanks to Lances amazing attention and service he made the experience even better.Great place, thank you for making my birthday celebration amazing, the only thing I missed was the little card at the table saying Happy Birthday with my name :-( other then that it was great.
