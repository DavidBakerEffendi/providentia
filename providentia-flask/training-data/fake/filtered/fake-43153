The hotpot food overall was mediocre and bland. If it weren't for the sauces, everything would taste the same to me. The service was atrocious!! We had a big party. Our waitress was a short, pony-tailed, bad skin person named "Chen."  She had a bad attitude from the very start, and kept reminding us that we would be "punished" if we shared our food.  When she was done reminding us, her assistant waitress took over the reminding process.  Also, every time someone from our table asked to get to get more food, she didn't even acknowledge us and just walked away. There also appeared to be several instances where both waitresses were discussing amongst themselves whether we were sharing.  This obviously affected their ability to serve us properly, and it showed.  Overall not a very comfortable experience.  When it came to tipping time, we returned the favor.
