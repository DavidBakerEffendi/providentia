By far THE WORST service I have ever had at a restaurant/bar. First it took at least 15 minutes to get our drink menu, then when the waitress finally brought out our drinks she spilled mine and didn't even bring me a napkin to clean it up or a replacement that wasn't half full. Then when we the baked macaroni and corn on the Cobb (as well as some other food that was delicious). When our food came out it was baked macaroni and a Cobb salad? When we questioned the Cobb salad the waitress said "well the corn on the Cobb is part of an entree... You ordered something that isn't on the menu" with attitude. WHY DIDNT SHE SAY THAY WHEN WE ORDERED IT? The last straw was when she brought out our check and it included our party of four and the party of 2 seated next to us (friends of ours that we met while there). We asked her if she would split the check bc we weren't together and she refused. Told us to just do the math and tell her who is paying for what. When we asked if we could just circle what was ours she said "NO you can do the math and tell me what you want on each card" and then she walked away. (Never even gave us a pen to write down totals) I've never been so disrespected by someone in the food industry. When we left I handed her the check all divided per table and told her to let me know if she needed me to do anything else for her before I left. Service was laughable. I can't believe that woman still has a job.
