Ok I am annoyed that they still will only take cash, but started to include the tax and tip.  I do understand though as they probably do get a lot of tourists who may not tip.  I have tried to find soup dumplings in different restaurants around the city.....I hate to admit it...in my opinion...Joe's Shanghai is the best.  I need frequent fixes....I can eat two orders by myself.  Yum!  I do have to say though...I've been to Joe's Ginger...I think it tastes the same.  So if the wait is too long just walk a couple of restaurants down.
