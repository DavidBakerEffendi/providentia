DO NOT EVER GO HERE! They completely discriminate against singles and non-Asian customers.  I tried to eat here alone, waited 30 minutes, watching as new customers came in and were sat immediately.  When I asked about it, I was told by the manager that it is their policy not to seat single parties at a table, because they get more money for two people.  I was only allowed to eat at the counter, even though no one was getting up anytime soon.  This is a disgusting policy and I will never ever go here again.  HORRIBLE SERVICE, HORRIBLE POLICY!
