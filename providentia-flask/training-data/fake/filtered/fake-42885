Solid all around. Friendly vibe and staff. Great food - mix of comfort, savory, and healthy. "Market Sides" are awesome (quinoa/avocado/tomatoes my fav). The Vegan Rancheros are awesome. As are the newly added vegan meatballs! Def my new go-to dish. Love the late delivery (until 11pm). 983 is a staple if you live in the neighborhood. Without a doubt.
