The only reason I didn't give Miya's one star is because I've had exceptional service on all visits. I've been going to Miya's since my freshman year, but the quality and safety of the food has gone downhill. My friends and I went in for dinner around late October. We each ordered the Blue Plate Special, the food came out and it looked beautiful. Later that night, we all came down with wicked food poisoning, my friend called the restaurant and told them and they agreed to refund our meals, the person on the phone was really sweet and very apologetic. A couple weeks ago, I went against all my intuitions and visited Miya's with some other friends. Granted,  I learned my lesson the last time so I only ordered a bottle of the Firecracker Sake. I glanced around the room and saw a huge DOG at a table, inside the restaurant. I love dogs, I have 3 back home, but in a restaurant, are you kidding me?!? To make matter worse, a gentleman who looked to be the owner was sitting at the sushi bar in dirty swamp clothes. He later grabbed a bucket of rotten food and walked right through the middle of the restaurant. I guess they don't own a back door. It was a smack in the face. I do not consider myself to be a snob, but I think there are certain things that should not be done in full view of patrons. I've also worked in restaurants before and I know the drill, nowhere is this acceptable. They really need to get their act together or they will make other people sick. I advise all you other guys out there to not be afraid to speak up or leave if you question a restaurant's cleanliness. If I did, I wouldn't have spent  the night puking my guts out in my dorm.
