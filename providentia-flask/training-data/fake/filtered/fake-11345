Eataly was everything I expected it to be.  I went with a friend for dinner around 8PM.  We decided to eat at the vegetable restaurant near the produce section since I'm a vegetarian.  I was overwhelmed with how fresh the food was and how friendly the staff were.    I got the spaghetti squash bruschetta and the roasted root vegetable salad.  Both were excellent.  After walking around the store for awhile, we ended up getting gelato.  I tried the hazelnut and the vanilla pear which were both phenomenal.  I would highly recommend Eataly to anyone.  Not only is the food excellent, but the overall atmosphere is very entertaining.
