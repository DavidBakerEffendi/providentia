The food was delicious. Our waiter was polite and attentive. Â We will definitely add Kochi to our rotation. My husband and I ate there Fri 10/25/13. I wanted chicken cashmere, which they don't offer, but was instead steered towards chicken korma. Oh my! There was a wonderful party in my mouth. My husband ate the chicken tikka marsala. Another delicious option. The naan was buttered and that made it even tastier. For our appetizer, we had a veggie samosa. To my delight, it had cashews inside. I had never eaten a samosa with cashews, but I found it to be yummy as well. (Our waiter stated that is the way it is made in southern India.) My husband and I spent 2 weeks traveling in India (New Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Agra) and this experience was on par w/any that we had then. Try this place, please. You won't regret it!
