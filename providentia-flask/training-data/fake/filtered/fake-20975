Banh Mi Saigon consistently serves the best Vietnamese sandwiches in the city. I've had sandwiches from Paris Bakery and Vietnam Banh Mi So 1 and this is easily my favorite. I always order the number 1, the pork sandwich for $3.75. I usually order it spicy by asking for the hot green peppers on the side. The crispy caramelized pork they use is really special. It's a savory seasoned basted pork that clings to the crevices of your teeth. Even though the sandwiches are pre-bagged and ready to sell, the bread is still crusty and the cucumber spears snap when you bite in. I personally like the heft and crunch of the crusty bread, but some people prefer a softer baguette like they serve at Paris Cafe. The roof of your mouth will probably get scraped up after finishing a sandwich, but that doesn't stop you from eating potato chips. They have a $15 minimum delivery and they're fast. I live walking distance 20 mins and I get my food within a half hour. If you're worried that they'll sell out, you can call ahead and pick up.
