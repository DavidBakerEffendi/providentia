Solar do Minho mingles two great food cuisines: Portuguese seafood and Brazilian style barbecue (rodizio). It won't be the best seafood you ever had nor the best barbecue rodizio however this place does a hard to find accomplishment, great barbecue and great seafood at the same place. The icing on the cake in the Spanish style sangria generously served on a larger than usual and nice looking porcelain pitcher. Food menu is extensive and should please many tastes. Make a reservation and be sure you are hungry enough before going there. Did I mention the courtesy Portuguese bread toasted to perfection so you can get your wheels spinning before the food rally? Last, I've ordered an orange juice for my kid and they didn't charge for it.
