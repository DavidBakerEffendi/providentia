Food is delicious. Yum Yum Yum. I had the Shrimp pho and shrimp and beef pho twice. It was excellent and consistent each time. The restaurant is a hole in the wall . The place was packed the day that I visited. The parking sucked!! But the service was prompt and courteous. I recommend purchasing a bowl, sticks and soup spoon . Your gonna need it. You will become a patron.
