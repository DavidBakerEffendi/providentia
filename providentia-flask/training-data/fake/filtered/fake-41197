I have been coming here for the last several months whenever I need a good ramen fix. I have brought a few of my friends here & they all love it. It's a small place but the waiting can take up to an hour just to get a seat. I don't mind it at all for as long as I can get good ramen in NYC. I usually would order the Chicken Paitan ramen with a little side of char siu mayo don. Its a perfect combination for me!
