One of the best oven baked pizzas, i've had in a long time. We had the side of Tomatoes with goat cheese, which was heavenly. We ate the mushroom pizza pie with ricotta and mozarella, which was out fo the world awesome. I can;t wait to go back there again. Very friendly superb staff, and cute cozy place, BYOB too although it could get a little too tight. But we absolutely LOVED it!
