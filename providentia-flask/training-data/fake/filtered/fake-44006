I've been to several different sushi places in NJ and Yamada sushi was by far the best one. The atmosphere was really nice...they told me they recently got new lighting, chairs and stuff. The service was great and quick. They were all really friendly..they gave me free appetizer and dessert! Most importantly, their sushi and sashimi were fresh and tasty. And the price was really reasonable too. If you're looking for a good sushi place in NJ you should definitely give Yamada sushi a try! You won't be disappointed:)
