This was one of the first dates I had with my wife 15 years ago. The pizza is still as fresh and tasty as it was back then. The lines have sure gotten longer, but if youre looking for some of the best pizza ever, you have to come here. I like the atmosphere and the closeness of the seating, it makes it feel like a legit Italian place.
