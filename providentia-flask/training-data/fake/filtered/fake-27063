This was my second trip to Oak Haven, and let me say my first time was much more pleasant. Great drinks, so well made and super tasty. However, the food was not what I expected. First off they were out of a ton of things, it's not that hard for a restaurant to stock up on what they need for a busy night especially one who has now been open long enough to know their volume. We got a couple small plates as well as a couple medium plates. The waiter told us as part as our groupon we got to choose one more item, so we did. This item came with out meal but we never got what we originally ordered. When we asked about it the waiter said we DIDNT get a choice of another item, then why did he come over in the first place to ask what we wanted? The pork belly was way over salted as well as the muscles. We couldn't even finish them which was an unfortunate waste. Everything is over garnished, you can't get to the food because of all the fluffy garish taking over the plate. Next thing was that my wine was disgusting, it tasted like the bottle was open for days. Dessert was not impressive either, I could find better things in my grocers freezer. The waiter rushed us and was inattentive. Â Another thing that rubbed me the wrong way was when an employee got off his shift he sat down at the bar with a woman who i over heard was a frequent flyer there. I don't know how considering this employee was a total tool! He bragged about himself constantly and was pompous. It was unprofessional and rude. Employees shouldn't be at the bar after their shift! It makes the bar look bad. All in all this was so disappointing, I would never go back there to eat again and I certainly wouldn't recommend it to anyone. I hope this restaurant eventually closes and turns into something better.
