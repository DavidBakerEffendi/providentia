I went there yesterday at 10.30-11.30 pm. There is only one waiter. I saw .It wan't busy anymore. There are just only 2 tables includes my table. The waiter doesn't have service mind . He didn't take care of the customer he  , didn't pour the water. Even the other table, He didn't take dishes out of the table. He pile the dishes on the table for longtimes. After i finished . I asked for check. i gave him. like just 10% tip and then I went out . He followed and asked me about the tips. I said : I know, I didn't really satisfy. I didn't appreciate. and He said; DONT COME BACK!  I'm alway a regular costomer but I won't go there anymore.   But another waitress was nice. EXcept him worked on 7/7/13 at night. Food was delicious. WAS TERRIBLE
