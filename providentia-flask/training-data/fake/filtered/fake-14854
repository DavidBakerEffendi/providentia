All though the drinks were a reasonable price the waitress asked if we needed anything else we said another round of drinks and she never came back at all. We started buying our own drinks at the bar. Also, they did allow some really rude and intoxicated people to scream at the top of their lungs "everyone get the F*** out" numerous of times. As a first time experience I will never go back to that hassle. I want to go to a place where civilized people go.
