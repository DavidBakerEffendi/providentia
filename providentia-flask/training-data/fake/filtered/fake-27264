I signed up for yelp specifically to discuss this restaurant.  Not because I want to see something bad happen to the place, but because I want to see it improve. The food here is wonderful, and the service is absolutely terrible. A few nights ago I went in with a party of five.  The hostess said we would be seated in twenty minutes.  An hour and a half later, we decided to leave, due to not being seated.  The hostess did nothing to make this situation right, and in fact seemed annoyed when we asked her 45min into our wait, what the situation with our table was.  This restaurant destroyed our night! This was not an isolated incident.  I once waited for ten minutes and never got a menu when my three friends and I were the only people in the restaurant (around 2 in the afternoon). Upon discussing this venue with other friends in the neighborhood, I have heard many similar stories. Too bad.  The food is truly delicious, the portions are ample, the beer is solid, and ultimately, it isn't too expensive. Get it together Le Barricou!
