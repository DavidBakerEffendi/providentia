What could i say,,,, The food is amazing, The Service is perfect The price Â is on point,,,, i order'd The past special, And it was so good, i could only say if you havent been to this nyc staple you are missing out! There is a reason lidia is so popular, she is a perfectionist, And it comes though in her food ! I cant wait to go again And again, i walked in with no reservations and i had no wait for a table, maybe i was lucky, but i cant wait to make a reservation so i could bring my Mom, The best chef i know!
