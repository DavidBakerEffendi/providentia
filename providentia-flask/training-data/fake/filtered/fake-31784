I love Bove's, I have waited in the line numerous times and it was well worth it.  Another thing, after having kids and they are too little to wait, you go right in the back door and get that delish takeout, not as glam as on the plate, but its all good.  I have even seen Bernie Sanders eating there.  What a wonderful Vermont tradition, I hail you Bove's.
