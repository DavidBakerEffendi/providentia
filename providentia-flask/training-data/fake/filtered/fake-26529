I went to Oaxaca on a Friday night with my boyfriend hoping for a fun, good meal--and Oaxaca delivered. We were seated right away, at a table by the window because we seemed unsure about whether to sit outside or inside and were provided with the "best of both worlds." The manager seated us and placed a sombrero on my head, which made me immediately realize the night would be a good one. Our waitress was very nice and attentive, and our drink and food orders were both taken as soon as we were ready, and arrived at a quick but appropriate pace. The food was delicious! For appetizers we had the table side guacamole, seafood salad and crab lump. The table side guacamole was a real treat, as I was allowed to assist in the making of our guac! The appetizers were extremely tasty, as were our drinks to accompany them (best margarita I've had in a while). Our main courses, upon the recommendation of both our waitress and the manager, were a steak dish and a scallop dish, both being absolutely perfect! The steak cut with just a fork, and was so flavorful. The scallops were in a fantastic sauce and cooked to perfection. At the end of the meal, we had 2 espresso's and a 3 leche dessert, which was wonderful and just light enough to satisfy us after a filling meal. Overall, the atmosphere and food at Oaxaca made for a great evening. The staff were great, especially the manager who consistently came to our table and talked to us, making sure everything was ok (which, of course, it was more than). Food was very, very good and even the DJ made the night memorable. I will definitely be returning to Oaxaca, happily, and am very glad to see such a fun, exciting new place in New Haven.
