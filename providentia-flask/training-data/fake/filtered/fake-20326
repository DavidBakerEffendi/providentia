This place is probably my favorite sushi spot! My wife and I have been to many places in the area which include Feng, Ginza, Oyama, Fuji and Sakura to just name a few.  Sake has been by far the best place for sushi! I have been here for parties at the hibachi table as well as just dinning in for dinner sitting at one of the booths. The hibachi entertainment is the same as all of the other places. I swear that they all must go to the same training to perform their little show! LOL!! The cool thing is that they shoot sake in your mouth around the table when they are cooking and you can pretty much get drunk off of that if you challenge them. That always makes for a good night but a rough morning following a drowning of sake. As far as the sushi goes, the quality and freshness is AMAZING!! We go almost every Sat night and we have never had an issue. The food has been amazingly consistent and it seems that everything we order tastes phenomenal. When we order, we tend to do the specialty rolls. They have a huge list of specialty rolls and they are all very creative and taste delicious. They do an awesome job with the plate presentation as well. We always leave with a full belly and wanting more. I could eat at this place everyday of the week! Service is decent here. If you are expecting 5 star service then don't bother. The manager/owner is very nice and he always gives us a free appetizer when we visit. The waitresses seem to do their job fine. I've never had an issue and they have all been pretty attentive. At times it takes a little longer then normal when we order a side of hibachi noodles for our son but it's really not a major issue. His food comes out either at the same time as our sushi or a few min afterwards. The decor is average, nothing overly fancy.  IMO the decor doesn't make the food taste any better. I'm giving this place 5 stars because of the great quality and freshness of the sushi that I get EVERY TIME.
