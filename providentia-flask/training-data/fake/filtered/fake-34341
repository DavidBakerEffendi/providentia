The Highlawn has a spectacular view of NYC.  The food was quite good.  The ambiance was definitely lacking.  They need to reinvent themselves.  It was a tired, blue haired crowd.  We were there are 7:00 on a Friday night.  We were the last one's to leave at about 10.  It is sad to see such a gorgeous old restaurant missing the boat on energy.  Our waiter was really bad - he was a grump and grumbled at all our decisions.  It was almost comical.  However I'm not thinking Highlawn wants Soup Nazi - esque staff!!!
