I have been going to this place for 5 year. I used to like it. But, the past 3 times have been terrible. The standard of food at this place has gone WAY WAY down! They used to have amazing dumplings...Now, they're barely average! I've been having their pan fried Buddha noodles for years. The last 3 times I've order this, they've been too salty or too spicy or too undercooked!! I don't know what's happened to this place. Did the management change or something? The service has also fallen apart. Why are all the waiters so RUDE here?? It's unfortunate, but I've given up on this place. This place has detriorated!Used to be good, now it's AWFUL! Sorry folks, but I would NOT recommend this place to anyone!
