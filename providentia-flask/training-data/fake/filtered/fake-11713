This is honestly one of my favorite places to go get sushi. It's also the best all you can eat sushi place I've been to. I usually come with large groups so we always end up getting so much sushi. Sometimes they forgot to give you everything but the best part of all you can eat sushi is you can always order more. Most times I've been here it's been crowded so the servers are a little slow but they're so nice so that makes up for it. If you're really into sushi and think you're up for the challenge of all you can eat this is the place to go. I feel I usually order way too much but thankfully going in a big group helps that.
