Great ambiance, great food/drinks and great service. Can't ask for more than that. Everyone was super nice, the Chef walked around the whole night introducing himself and explaining the dishes to the patrons. I had a group of 6 and everyone loved it. Highlights included - Brussels sprout salad, white bean duck confit, roast lamb, chicken and dessert (Fennel ice cream). Let's get this straight, everything was delish but those were my personal highlights! It's a must go place, you won't regret it!
