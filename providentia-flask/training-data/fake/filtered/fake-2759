I went there last night with a party of 12. They were very accommodating, and the service was great for our large party. Amongst our party of 12, we all have frequented this restaurant many times. We ordered a variety of dishes. For appetizers, we ordered the crispy honey squid and Roti Cani, and it didn't disappoint. Chicken Pad Thai and Penang Char Kew Teow were the noodles we devoured. Also, on our menu was the Volcano Pork chops, Rendang Chicken which was the sauce and chicken from the roti appetizer,  sea bass with Malaysian Belacan sauce (I would order the sauce on the side next time) Tofu Nyonya and Kangkong with garlic and oil. We were very happy with our food and only had 2 containers of leftovers to bring home for 12 of us to divide (J/K). Dessert consisted of the delicious Ice Kakang which is similar to our Filipino Halo Halo and we also ordered a few Mango Sticky Rice and Fried Ice cream. It was also a huge "thumbs up" when they allowed us to sit and talk well after our meal was over. We were able to  catch up with one another without feeling like we had to leave even after the restaurant was closed.
