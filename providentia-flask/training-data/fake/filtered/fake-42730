Not There Anymore! I loved this place when it was in W. Leb on the 12A strip, and was happy to see the sign when I drove through WRJ recently.  I returned last weekend (May 16, 2009) to eat and discovered that the hotel it was in had been foreclosed on and the whole thing (hotel and restaurant) was borded up.  So save yourself a trip!
