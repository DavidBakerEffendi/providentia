I love this place. Not only do they roast the most amazing chickens - I will never buy a grocery store rotisserie chicken again, but the daily rotating selection of food is awesome. And it's great that when I don't feel like cooking I can go there and get a whole dinner for my family and know that it's healthy and delicious. This is a great addition to the neighborhood and I hope they stay around for a long time. OH. And did I mention their sandwiches? Yum. Oh.
