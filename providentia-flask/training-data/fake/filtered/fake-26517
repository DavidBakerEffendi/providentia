We are out of towners who randomly picked this place. We were treated so well by the staff. Although we did not express a concern or even think much of it, our food took a few minutes getting to us. However, our bill was cut in half when we received it! The waitress handed it to us, explaining it that the nachos were on the house and the manager was "comping" them since we had to wait Â a few minutes longer than we should have. She said he is all about the customer and takes pride in his service...that much I will give him as he certainly walks the talk. When we make our annual visit to this area, we will return for this reason alone! And the mexican burger was delicious as well :-)
