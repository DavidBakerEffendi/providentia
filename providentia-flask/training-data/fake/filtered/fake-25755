Not a stranger to this great chain, I normally visit the SF location when I am in town located on the macy's building roof top, unfortunately unlike the amazing experience in the SF location this particular location really lacks in customer care and courtesy, other then the fact that I got the wrong drink twice (ordered a blue agave margarita I got a diet coke not even close how can you make this mistake and TWICE !!!) After the managed to get such a simple task s wrong they opted to let me know that they are out of this brand of liquor and that they apologize and I need to choose a different drink, I am easy going so I did even though this should have been handled much better on their end. So after all that I got the bill and my original drink is there as well as ZERO discount....... should I ever set foot in this place.... I think NOT !!!!!
