I am so surprised by the negative reviews for this place. My husband and I have been to Hon Sushi several times and have found it the best sushi we've had. We love the special rolls, which have always been something completely different than we've had anywhere else. The pieces all melt in your mouth, definitely no rubbery taste. The miso soup and salad are great as well. I can not speak for the Korean cuisine, but the sushi is superb. The staff are wonderful as well, and make an effort to make us feel welcome. I really like the decor as well, and have enjoyed eating both at the sushi bar and in one of the more private tables. Definitely give this place a try.
