Nolita was a very pleasant surprise.  everything from the appetizers to the entire meal was excellent. the mussels were cooked perfect, and very fresh.  Crispy wings, and onion soup were incredible. the fresh salmon special was cooked perfect, and seasoned quite well.  we will be visiting this restaurant very often!!!
