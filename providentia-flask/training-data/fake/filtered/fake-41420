This Friday I had my daughter's wedding. I cannot express my graditude enough to Franco and Danny for their extreme professionalism and their warmth in making the day so personnel. The food is to die for , the service is beyond believe and the attentiveness of Eva to my daughter and myself cannot be put into words. The bridal suite and groom's rooms were set-up with enough food and beverages. You did not need to ask for anything. Franco and Danny knew how to run the event for you and upmost the bride and groom as the most important factor of the evening. I cannot tell you how many people have called and said they were never to a wedding like this one. Please listen to Franco when he says there will be enough food. I cannot thank everyone at the Valley enough for making us feel like part of a family and not just another wedding.(which many places do).I will recommend the Valley in a second for any event. Thank-you for everything each ,and everyone one of you.Cali, lodi n.j.
