I'm a vegetarian so burrito box is one of the best places in the city that makes great food that anyone would love.However, recently the service has been really bad.Ive been a patron of this place for years and the simple things like chips and salsa while you wait seems to be a thing of the past..the food is still delicious, but the attitude of the workers behind the counter,service and little things that make this place what it is seem to be gone.
