This is a nice place to go for a fun group evening, when u crave for the Indian street food. I absolutely love their pani poori, chole bhature, chat. I have been there a couple of times and this place is so crowdy all the time. The best part about going here is the malai falooda kulfi & the paan that they have on the counter. Worth a try if u are in the neighborhood!!!
