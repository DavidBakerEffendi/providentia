Just Jake's is convenienty located off of Bloomfield ave. in Montclair. Â Jake's is a blend of college bar, pub and sports bar all rolled into one. Unfortunately, Jake's identity crisis causes it to fall short at all three. Jake's has a typical bar menu that will satisfy your pangs of hunger. However, if you are looking for a delicious gastro-pub experience this is not the place. Their cheeseburger sliders were undercooked and covered with grease. Jake's does have delicious french fries, and their chicken spring rolls with sweet chili sauce were pretty good. Just Jake's saving grace is their bar and outdoor seating (especially during the summer). Jake's bar specials makes this watering hole a good value; especially with their 3 domestic beers for $5 specials. Unfortunately, with good value comes the college crowd; and with the college crowd comes pounds of body glitter and obnoxious debauchery. If you value cheap drinks over loud noise and food, Jake's is the spot.
