The building itself is very neat. A very relaxed setting with plenty of seats. An interesting story behind the place too. Had apps, drinks and some entries. Waffle fries were very good, as was the southwestern chicken sandwich. Was pleasantly surprised which how much flavor it actually has. Not as impressed with the veggie burger unfortunately. Had a sampler of their beers. You get to try 5 of the house brewed beers. We ordered a range of types wanting to try as much of a variety as we could.. The stout and the white wedding were the best in out opinions, but there was not one that I did not like. Overall, with a part of five, we all walked away full and happy. Would definitely come back again.
