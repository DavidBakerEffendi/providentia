This place rocks! Excellent food, fabulous atmosphere, fantastic service and even live jazz! The ahi salad is perfect. The fresh ground hamburgers are so tasty you don't mind feeding them to your kids, and you can even get great sushi. Ambiance and fare is similar to Houston's and Bandera - just a different name.
