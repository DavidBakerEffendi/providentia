This place is fantastic. The food is delicious and the portions are big. The prices are cheap. We are so happy that this place opened in the area it makes getting lunch a lot cheaper and easier. Their bento box is a steal at $8 for chicken. They have a large selection of bubble teas and smoothies. The place is clean and the owner, Paul is very nice.
