I used to have an office in this building, and the Whiskey Cafe is absolutely disgusting. The place is a dive, everything's dirty, the utensils are rarely cleaned, and I've had a few meals that left me very queasy. The final straw was when I was putting ketchup on a burger, and realized that the ketchup bottle was filled with onions and other scraps. It looked like someone was scraping ketchup off of plates and putting it back into the bottle. Absolutely gross, avoid.
