I have had the carrot cake at a birthday party and it was amazing so I decided to order one for a holiday party and was terribly disappointed.  The cake was made with buttercream frosting not cream cheese and covered in peanuts instead of walnuts.  I would not call this a carrot cake, I think I will be going to Modern Pastry from now on.
