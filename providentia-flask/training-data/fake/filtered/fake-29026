I read a favorable article about this place when it opened eight months ago. I have driven past countless times but never made a point to stop until today. I'm glad I did. Started safe with their BBQ chicken sandwich and an order of herbed potato slices. It was fantastic, I was also offered a sampling of the barbacoa, chili and a crab bisque. Every single sample was great, even the bisque and I'm not much of a seafood fan. I will definitely return. Although the place has a "fast food" type of feel to it, the menu is anything but. If you are looking for something above the norm, you gotta stop by. Lunch of dinner, it's well worth the stop.
