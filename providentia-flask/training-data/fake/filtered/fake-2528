This little gem in Lennox Hill is incredible. The truffle gnocchi is the best I've had, meat ball veal (sorry for veal haters) takes it to the next level. It's our second time here, and both times it has been great. A bit pricey, but with the salt comes the sugar. Why the four and not the five? Open table time has about a one hour wait past reservation time and it's a tad balmy inside. If you're wiling to trudge through the adversity I suggest this little Italian Spot.
