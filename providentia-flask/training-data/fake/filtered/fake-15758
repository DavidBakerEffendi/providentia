I ordered a lasagne from Lorenzo's for a holiday dinner for my family. Upon ordering, whomever I spoke to (male) was pretty rude, but I decided to continue on with the order anyway. I ordered a meatless lasagne, and what we received was nothing but layers of pasta and sauce! Â Hello? Where's the ricotta? Mozzerella? NOT AN OUNCE OF CHEESE in a lasagne? My entire family was extremely disappointed in this "lasagne," and for the amount of money that we paid for this, it's unacceptable. My husband called to see if perhaps we picked up the wrong order, but the very rude manager simply said that's how they make it in Italy. Thanks, we're not in Italy, we're in America, and lasagne is made with ricotta and mozzarella thank you. Never will go there again.
