Great local lunch place. Order a #28, best panini :) I have been here for lunch and dinner over the past 8 years. They do constantly have new specials and new desserts to try and like anything else, some you may like and some you may not.  It is fairly priced and offers a unique setting.  I have been to many other cafes in the area and Fedora is on the top of my list.
