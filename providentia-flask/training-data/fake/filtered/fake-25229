Champs is like church. I go every Sunday and its' a spiritual experience. This place has line out the door almost every day, which speaks to their success. I only wish it were bigger. So happy with their new baker. Their waitstaff has tons of personality and are usually fun and friendly, and this is the kind of place you want to bring haters who need to be impressed with vegan food. Red velvet pancakes? Mushroom ham and cheese scramble? Blueberry streusel muffins? Chick'n n' waffles? Their menu is HUGE and everything on it is great. Plus they have specials, and are totally accommodating to modifications.
