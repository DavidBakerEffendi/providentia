Wasabi in Orange is hands-down the best sushi in the New Haven area. We have been going here since it opened several years ago, and the food and service has never waned in its excellence. Every time a friend says "you must got to X- they have the best sushi", I try it and ultimately go back to Wasabi. The fish here is amazingly fresh- it just melts in your mouth. I've never been disappointed with anything I've ordered. My husband and I usually share the sushi/sashimi platter for one (with 5 pcs sushi, 15 pcs sashimi & California roll. at $24) and leave it to the chef to delight us with different combinations each time (you never know exactly what you are going to get). The tuna and yellowtail are my favorites, but I've enjoyed everything they've put on the platter. I also highly recommend the seafood soup- brimming with scallops, shrimp, crab, seaweed and other veggie delights. The waitstaff is superb. I haven't seen Grace there in a while, but she knew us on sight and greeted us as old friends every time we came in (we come about once a month). The only issue I have is with parking- since there is a TGI Fridays next door, usually there is spillover into the parking lot, making it hard to find a space on a Friday or Saturday night.
