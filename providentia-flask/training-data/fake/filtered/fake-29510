I was introduced to this soul food eatery by a friend in New Jersey. We went to see MAMA I Wanta Sing show in April for my mother's 66th Birthday, It was a bash of greatness and I had so much good fun. The energy was good and the people was fun and safe, My food was good and it was not a long wait soul food at it's best. I would go back again. I've been around the world and been to different countries.All my times it was no better place than the state of Harlem, the vibe was good. And I liked the hot cornbread and the wings was good for the tummy.
