I am so upset to write this. I usaully highly recomend north third to EVERYONE. For years I can honestly say that the food and service have been consistently excellent... however I must say that the rudeness has consistently increased and I will never go back. I have tried a few times to go back and as the food is still good, the waitstaff are extremely rude. I havent recieved a thank you for a tip in about a year and our waitress seemed to think that we should put up with her attitude and when our dinner was done, we felt as though we were pushed out... sorry but you lost a great loyal customer.
