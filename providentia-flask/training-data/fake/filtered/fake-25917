I heard they got a new chef and was excited last time I went in to see that their fries aren't those little greasy strings they've always had, but were nice looking robust meaty fries.  But one bite and I knew they are frozen now.  $6 for a plate of frozen fries is a rip off guys.   Best beer menu in the city by far, but still really pretty awful food - especially considering the price.  Eat somewhere else but have happy hour here!
