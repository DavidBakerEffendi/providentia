While the food is great and the desserts are delicious, I have to give it a one star for the service.I was excited to take my nieces (6 and1 yr) and found out pretty quickly that this place is not kid friendly which does not make sense,... what kid does not like chocolate desserts? the server gave me attitude when we sat down and had the baby stroller next to the table. She told us " you have to do something about this because I feel I cannot walk freely around my serving areas" I kid you not, the stroller was small and it wasn't in the way! We all looked at each other surprised because she had plenty of room to walk around and the stroller was not blocking anyone's way. She had attitude and for that reason I am giving it a one star. I think customer service is everything and even if the food is great, I will not come back if we're treated this way. I don't know her name but she had long hair and one side of hair was shaved off. I wish I had complained to management about her.
