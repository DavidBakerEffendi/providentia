My husband and I were visiting family in East Haven and saw that a new restaurant had opened up. We decided to stop by and check it out.  We were greeted by the general manager Claudio who was extremely attentive and courteous. From the beginning he made us feel at home and we were delighted.  The appetizers we chose were the lentil soup with Chrorizo and Croquetas de Bacalao.  They were outstanding!  The entrees were beyond this world!  My husband had the grilled steak which came with scalloped sweet potatoes and a creamy sauce.  I had the grilled tilapia marinated in wine. It came with grilled vegetables and a delicious risotto!  For dessert we both got the puff balls with Coconut gelatto.  This is place is a keeper for us.  We love going there not only for the amazing food but for the patrons and staff!   We cannot wait to go again!
