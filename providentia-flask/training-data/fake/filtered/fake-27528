The best square slice in the city! L&B may not have the "glitz and glamor" of Grimaldi's, but it also doesn't have the crazy lines. The actual restaurant next door has surprisingly delicious grub, but this is mostly a summer square slice spot. Parking is always a pain because the lot is so small and the area gets full with hungry young Italian men ready to fight till death for a spot (I have been in 2 screaming arguments in that parking lot over the past 5 years), but it's all worth it in the end.
