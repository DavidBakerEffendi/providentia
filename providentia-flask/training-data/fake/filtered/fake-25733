Have been going to Katz's for years.  Just recently they closed to expand the restaurant.  Now the food is still good, but the service is just about the worst I have ever seen.  They have people waiting on you that don't know the difference between chopped liver and liverwurst, which is okay but don't take an attitude with me when I point out your mistake.  Something funny is going on with their cash register receipts.  Not saying they are doing anything wrong, just funny.... My family likes the food, but honestly they don't need the food.  After being a loyal customer since they opened the doors, I won't be back any time soon.
