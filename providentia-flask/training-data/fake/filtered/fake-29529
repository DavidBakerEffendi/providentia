BURRITOS ~ 10LBs LATER ~ BURRRIIITTTTOOOOSSSS I came to Habana outpost for the first time last week after a long day of service. My team and I were ready to eat something spicy then drink liquor so that our saliva can turn to flames!! It didn't work but we had some great and not semi okay food.  It was a semi warm day and they have a nice outdoor sitting area. We must have gotten there just in time for the lunch rush because the line was out the building. It took 25 minutes for us to order our food. FYI I am the type of person who offers my food in hopes that you will then offer some of yours so I can taste everyone's food. It usually works. Anyways, I ordered the chicken burrito but everything I tasted was as follows: Guacamole and Queso sandwich, Catfish burrito, cheese quesadilla, Grilled corn, Roscoe on a stick (chicken and waffles), and the frozen Margarita. Now I did not enjoy my chicken burrito. It was way too dry for my liking. The rice had no flavor and I hate the taste of charbroiled meat.  It is pretty much case closed on that chicken burrito. BUT that catfish burrito!!!! What... That burrito was delish. Idk what it was but it was filled with flavor. I mean I only had a bite (or two) but it gets a thumbs up. The cheese quesadilla and guacamole and queso chicken was tasty but that roscoe on a stick!!!!! I was in love. Now I might be pregnant because I was craving some chicken and waffles and Habana Outpost did Roscoe proud with that side dish. All in all I had a good experience at Habana and would definitely go back. Here's the menu if you want to see everything they have cafehabana.com/data/down…
