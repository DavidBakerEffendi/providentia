We were in Philly for the weekend and we decided to do a Cheese steak taste test competition. We stopped by the normal Ishkabibbles to try a steak, but the line was out the door and there was no seating, so we decided to go to the second location. It was very large, but the place was pretty empty. It looked like an old McDonalds and our food was not very good, in fact, we rated it last on our list of steaks. I really wouldn't go here, but I still think the original may be worth a try.
