We were in town for the UVM graduation.  Guild came with high reviews.  The lower dining section was somewhat charming. The upper section, where we were seated, lacked ambience. The waitstaff  was top notch.  The appetizers were very good.  However, the dinner was the big problem.  The steaks ran $40 for 8 oz filet, $48 for a 12 oz sirloin.  Very expensive in my book.  There were 5 in my part.  The Mahi Mahi was undercooked and "strange" in texture and taste and was sent back.  We had 2 salmon dinners very undercooked and sent back.  They appeared to have taken the fish off the plate and quick cooked it and put it back on the same plate.  The accompaniments were now cold.   I never mind spending money on a good dinner.  Guild just missed the mark on too many grades.
