Food is good but I do have a problem with the several children who were sleeping on a makeshift bed of chairs taken from a table not 10 feet from us. Also another child ( my guess is about 6 years old ) was cleaning tables. Spraying windex directly on the tables and cleaning them with what looked like a dirty rag. The whole area around us smelled like windex and honestly started to stink. Another child ( probably around 2 or 3 ) came out of the kitchen with a wooden spoon and tongs and started to play directly on the floor with them before getting back up and returning into the kitchen. No idea what happened to those utensils. A woman ( most likely the children's mother ) would come out of the kitchen to "check" on the kids but never did anything to remedy any of the situations. Again, food is good, but between the smell of windex and the constant chatter of the kids, and the ones sleeping on the "chair beds", I wouldn't go back. Maybe for takeout.
