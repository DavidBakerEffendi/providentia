I went there for 2 dozen cupcakes.  Because they have a sign out front that says "Yummy cupcakes".  These are the saddest looking cupcakes I have ever seen.  Literally.  They have like a quarter sized dollop of frosting on top.  They just look flat, dry and sad.  Don't go for the cupcakes if you need cupcakes for an event because they are truly embarassing.
