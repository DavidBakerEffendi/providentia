Staff is terrible.... We made a reservation days in advance... We get to the restaurant and they claim they have no reservation. Sigh. Ultimately they were able to accommodate the group in the outdoor patio area on a shared bench table with another party. Very uncomfortable. The waitstaff was mediocre at best. The food is good but not worth the money.
