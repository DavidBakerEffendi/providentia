By the time I finally booked this restaurant, there were already 800+ review. I would like to offer a small opinion to this great restaurant. Rotisserie chicken: it's tender, juicy and flavorful. The smell of the chicken bursts out when we cut it open. Sangria: it's very fruity. The fruits in the drink may seem a bit less diverse (I only remember eating green apple, pineapple/orange cubes), but the drink is overall very satisfying where each sip feels like eating a fruit. (BTW, there's a white wine version) "Sampler" (or something like that). This is for those with 1/2 adventuring spirit. Each piece offer a unique flavor and the grill red meat (which I am not going to mentioned it as the adventuring part for you) is tender and juicy. Try the Mixto under classic section if you have a full adventuring spirit. This dish was never something we have imagined. I thought that Peruvian food is all boiled/grilled or fried (considering most reviews are about chicken or sausage/fries), but this dish is a mix of different lightly boiled seafood and Peruvian corns mixed in a lemon juice sauce. Some seafood is so lightly boiled that I gotta say they are more like sushi (the adventure!). The dish is complemented with the white Peruvian corn and the yellow Peruvian corn where the white corns are cooked softly while the yellow ones are crunchy. The wait-person who took our order is very knowledgeable and confident about the taste of the dishes. As for other servers, they are also very helpful with changing plates and pouring drinks, etc. The place is kinder loud so this isn't the place for a romantic dinner but this will be the place if you get a few friends or a whole family to have good food with.
