my son loves this place. he's one of those fruit vegan kinda guys and loves his coffee. however, when i was in there catching up with my boy, Doug, the gentlmen in front of myself and my son Doug, asked for whole milk like G*d intended? what kinda crap is that? thought this place was cool not some sort of synagaguge
