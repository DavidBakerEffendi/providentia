everything i have had here has been delicious. great iced chai tea and sandwiches/desserts and great cold drink selection. also, this is weird, but i kept the cup in my car on a hot day, in a cup holder next to a starbucks cup. the grindcore house cup started to melt all over and "biodegrade," i suppose i could say. the starbucks cup, ew, nothing. also, i'm not vegan, but i love that everything is.
