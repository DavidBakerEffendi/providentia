I come to this restaurant for a slice of pizza or something real quick for my 30 minute lunch break. The staff is always very friendly and very attentive. They remember I love ranch dressing with my pizza, and they have it set up for me already before I even have to ask. Their pizza is very good and I'm sure everything else is as well.
