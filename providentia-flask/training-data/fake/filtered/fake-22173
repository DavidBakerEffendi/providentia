Pat's Pat's Pat's So good, I had to say it three times. The epitome of the great Philadelphian tradition of cheesesteaks, Pat's has clearly been my favorite for the longest time. The service is exactly how I like it. Fast, rude, and to the point. I guess that's the Philadelphian in me. My family tradition is to always go to Pat's. (My dirty, ugly cousins from across the way only go to Geno's.) I don't even consider them my family anymore. This Pat's, Geno's rivalry has families torn apart I tell ya! This is how philly runs.
