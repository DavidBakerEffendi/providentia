Their noodles are my favorite in Chinatown. Now they have this new branch here in old city with Karaoke and lounge bar. I'm excited and expecting their grand opening. I had lunch here last week, and get 20% off the food, since their bar was still under construction. But the restaurant on the second floor was open. The ambiance is much better than that in Chinatown.
