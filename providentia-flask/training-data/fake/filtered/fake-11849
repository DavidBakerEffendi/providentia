Cheap food with good quality, but in a really annoyingly noisy climate with slow service. Portions are really generous and generally, heavy. I Ordered with my wife the cappeletis. They had a liquid sauce that supposed to be creamy, but really good indeed. The pasta was OK, Nothing from other world, and the salad didn't came too complete. The Bread is tasteless but hot and feels recently baked.
