used to be more awesome 10 years ago, now kinda tasteless but their unlimited sauce makes up for it, 6 bucks for the mix platter and all the sauce you want, bbq, hot, and white. be smart get a dab of bbq to go with the bread, put a bit of hot all around but becareful all you light weights ( aka gringos)  it can cause serious discomfort , why do you think they have entire carts with overpriced drinks next to the food carts for? last but not least the most important sauce white sauce, use that to your hears delight, get a gyro to go as well i definitely like sammys more, and have heard of some good spots in astoria and one in brooklyn too,  theres decent carts all over the city and in queens. this one was the original gyro catrt and too my knowledge the only one that lets you od like a addict on thier sauce, final word cheap good and reliable been coming here for over 10 years now probably keep coming until they go out of business, i like to refer to the guys as habibz, that being said the habibs always seem very rushed pa you guys really need to make a actual restaurant by now and make more locations over the city especially in queens
