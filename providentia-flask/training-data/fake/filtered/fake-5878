Took my wife and friends here based on reviews: Monday night early, place was empty and we almost didn't go in.  We did and were extremely glad we did.  Everything was excellent, the prices were reasonable, the atmosphere was relaxed and the service was attentive.  Other patrons came in and the place filled up but it was still very pleasant.  All our food was memorable.  Excellent prices on wine by the bottle: limited selection but lots of good choices and the wine we selected was the best $25 bottle of wine I have ever had at a restaurant.  We recommend this place highly.  Can't wait to go back.
