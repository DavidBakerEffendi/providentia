Love this place! Yesterday was my first visit to the Double Windosr and I will definintely be returning. It features great food and I felt at home as soon as I arrived. I ordered the incredibly succulent burger (topped with melted cheddar and crisp bacon) and Â a side of fries. It was obvious that all ingredients were top quality, and my food was prepared to perfection. Others in my group ordered the burger, grilled cheese and the specials of the day- chicken arugula sandwich and creamy tomato soup, and we all thoroughly enjoyed our food. While we didn't drink on this visit, others seemed to be enjoying the wide variety of beers that are featured. Staff were extremely friendly and accommodating. Don't miss this place- it's a gem!
