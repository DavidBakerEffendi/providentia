I would have given it a three but the bad host service was substantial enough to give it just one star.   Ratings for the place (out of 5): food: 2-3 hostess: 0 waiters: 3 drinks: 4 atmosphere: 0 Advice:  don't waste you time for the food/seating.  Get a drink ( the one with the maraschino liquor is excellent).  Wait an hour and a half for seating at another restaurant (Freemans, Clinton Street Bakery, etc).
