Nearly every time I'm in the city I've gone here to eat. 90% of the time i've been very satisfied, a couple times the rice in the grape leaves was mushy. I recommend the hummus, very good!, THE kibeh appetizer-also great! I like the lamb and the chicken with couscous. Also, you can get the lentil soup, and they can spice it up, excellent!
