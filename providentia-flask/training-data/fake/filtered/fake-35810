Having visited Lucha Cartel for dinner and drinks a number of times, I have to say the owners of National Mechanics have done it again. Lucha has one of the best Happy Hours in the neighborhood. With friendly service and perfect $5 margaritas it's hard not to over indulge. I've also never been disappointed by anything I've ordered from the menu to soak up said margaritas.
