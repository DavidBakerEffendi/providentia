Loved this bar. Every time I visit my boyfriend, I ask if we can go here. I think I loved it for the free cheese balls and Twizzlers, but the sports man special was nothing to complain about either. For I think 5 bucks, you get a beer and a shot. Being a pathetic hard alcohol drinker/shot taker, I needed a glass of Coke to chase it with, but they were happy to provide. Free games are also great. We had a Jenga competition with other patrons at a neighboring table and won. This place is very "hipster." Just FWI if you're not into that scene.
