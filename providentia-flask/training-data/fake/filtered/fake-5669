This is one of my favorite lunch spots in Rittenhouse.  The sandwiches are fresh and delicious.  They are made using their bread.  My personal favorites are the Delhi and Caprese (I think....it is the sandwich with the proscuitto).  The roast beef sandwich is good as well.  They ask if you want them grilled.  I have had all three sandwiches grilled and cold.  The roast beef is best when not grilled because I like the beef rare.  They also offer cold soups which are fabulous during the summer months.   Their rolls, bagels, cookies and pastries are also delicious as well.
