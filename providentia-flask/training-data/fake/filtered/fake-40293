The brunch is definelty Â a good one. The attitude of Cheryl and another woman who works there is unreal. Patronizing, rude, uninviting, nasty...ive experienced this and also witnessed the treatment to others. I started thinking she thought customers were bothersome and that she was doing us a favor. Whatever goodness there is in the food is diminished by the owner's attitude, almost entirely.
