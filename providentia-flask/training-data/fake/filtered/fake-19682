DIIIIIIIIIIIISGUSTING. Overrated. Crowded. Noisy. Who wants to eat food in a "club" atmosphere? I know I don't. I ordered ginger chicken and it tasted like soapy cigarette water. It was so bad that I took two bites (just to be certain) and then told them to bring the check. They removed my food. They brought the check out and my food in a to-go containers. I told them, "I don't want that food. Throw it out." They looked confused but followed orders. I know they were perplexed. The food was just that nasty. This was in 2007. I never went back. Who knows what the food or atmosphere is like now. I was so incredibly scarred that I wouldn't even so much as THINK about going back again. And I only went because everyone RAVED about this place. If Joya were a guy, it would be a 50 year old loser of a virgin. WIth a comb over. DO.NOT.WANT.AGAIN.
