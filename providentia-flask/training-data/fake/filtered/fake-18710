I frequent this place over and over again (7 times since January, three times in one week in April). Why? The service and the food. It is top notch and I can see why they've received a Michelin Star. I've eaten around the city but Gramercy Tavern's menu is as consistent as it gets. It is essentially American food with hints of French influence that help exploit the main dish components. The smoked trout with cippollini pur√©e and pickled onions is to die for so do yourself a favor and have it at least once. The staff is always attentive as well. Other restaurants that I won't name don't really check up on tables as much as they should for the price that one is paying to sit in them but there's no problem with that here. Although obtaining a last minute reservation is tough sometimes, coming often and befriending some of the staff has helped.
