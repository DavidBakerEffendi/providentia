Found this on Yelp and decided to try while in town. Had a late lunch and the place was still quite busy. Friends had pad Thai and I had basil chicken with green beans. I ordered it medium spicy. The waitress looked at me and suggested mild spicy. She was correct in this case. It was a little more heat than I am used too but had great flavor. I didn't care that the chicken was chopped but not my preference. Â The curry puffs were good too.
