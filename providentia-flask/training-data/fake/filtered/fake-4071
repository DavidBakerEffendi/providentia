A group of us wandered into this place because our first choice was closed.  What a surprise, as I used to frequent the old place that was here for years. Great update to the decor.  Very classy inside and the staff are sooooooo friendly. The food and wine was really delicious.  Nice evening, great food, amazing staff.
