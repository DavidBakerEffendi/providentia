I've been to the oyster house a few times now and just finally decided to post a review. The atmosphere is pretty casual. As for food, I really like the new england clam chowder. My son, who is 5, loves the snapper turtle soup. It is quite tasty. I have have tried the shrimp and crawfish boil and it was a generous plate of shrimp, crawfish and keilbasa, espeically for the price. I noticed on the last review that they were disappinted with the portion size but I almost didnt finish my plate. Among the other dishes that I have tried there, the mussels are one of my favorite. The garlic broth is amazing. You'll want to ask for more bread to dip into it. The sardine dish has changed a couple times but I really liked the one with pickled radish and orange segments. I love calamari but I am not a big fan of the one they do here. The fried lemons I dont really get. The onions and jalepenos I like but that s about it. Last but not least, my favorite part of dinner is the desserts. I have been disapppointed many times with the desserts at other restaurants but I always have to try them. At the oyster house, I absolutely LOVE the lime semi fredo. It's not too sweet or too tart and comes with a dulce de leche sauce. They have a new dessert I just tried this past tuesday. A goats milk panacotta. The waitress explained that the chef gets raw goats milk to make yogurt and from there it is made into panacotta. there is a sprinkle of pistachios and candied citrus zest. Definately super awesome. To wrap up, the raw bar is alway nice. they have a nice selction of oysters from a few different areas. The bar has some new items. I dont remeber the name but I like the tequilla one. For the type of food that I got, I think that they are pretty moderately priced. Cheaper than most in the city.
