Went recently with my girlfriend on a Friday night.  The place was crowded but to CR's credit, they accepted a call ahead from me and we had zero wait time when we arrived. While the food, decor, and beer selection were very good, the complete lack of attentiveness from our waitress made it an experience that we agreed we would only repeat if we had a different wait-person.  We had to wait seven minutes or longer to see her again after any given stop-by or food or drink delivery.   We had to wait for over seven minutes before she initially greeted us.  After that it took a total of 21 minutes for my girlfriend to get her first drink delivered. She repeatedly passed by our table w/o looking to see that our drinks were getting low (one time both were empty) and give us the opportunity to order more.  The restaurant lost the chance to get more of my money that night.  We could have forgiven the delays if we could see some hussle on her part, but there was none. Had to ask for the check twice. Had to wait seven minutes to see her again so we could ask her for check a second time, then it took her another seven minutes to get it to us.
