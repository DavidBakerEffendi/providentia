I've only had their halal once and it was the best I've ever had. I've had a couple around Queens, but this one tops them all. I ordered the chicken over rice with white sauce and bbq sauce around $6-$7, without a drink. I liked that they had pita bread, it was soft and chewy and went well with everything. I've got to come here again sometime, I think about it all the time.
