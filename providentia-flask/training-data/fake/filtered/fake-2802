it is true the decor is nice but what LOUSY SERVICE, the manager is prejudice and arrogant. what good  is anything else in a restaurant if you are been treated as a pariah while spending your money  sponsoring that restaurant nothwithstanding the loud noise in that place? it is not worth the experience...
