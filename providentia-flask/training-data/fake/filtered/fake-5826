Pepe Giallo is a a rare bird in the NY jungle of endless restaurants.  It fuses charm of  atmosphere with  food and service at a reasonable to low price range.  The beginnings: from a bottle of water left on the table to keep things afloat while dining, to the great bread and olive oil and the pretty handwritten menus, are a sign of good things to come.  And good it is from the superb staff such as John and Rosie to the terrific salads, pasta and fish that my friend and I sampled on a Saturday evening.  The wines, both red and white, were a nice accompaniment available in carafes or half carafes at a great price.  Sit in the main area or the back garden, either a treat on tenth!
