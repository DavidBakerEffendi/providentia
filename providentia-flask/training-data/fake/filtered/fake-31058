The bar here is fantastic. The bartenders, specifically the male, had a fantastic knowledge of beer. Spent an extra hour (during a snowstorm) and stayed with a friend, totally trusting him to select new beers for is. Never have I met a more knowledgeable, and helpful bartender in my life. I've been here for food, and it was okay.... But I would totally return just for the experience with the knowledgeable bartender!
