My boyfriend and I are obsessed with sushi and after trying many, many sushi places, we are convinced this place is the best. Besides the fact that it is all you can eat, it is absolutely amazing. The fish is so fresh, it melts in your mouth. Their specialty rolls are out of this world. I highly recommend the Butterfly roll. The food is without a doubt fantastic. I would recommend this place to anyone that has the slightest interest in sushi. We took a friend of ours here that usually just ate California rolls; after going to Sushi Palace, he is a sushi addict now. Granted, it is a small restaurant and does get crowded; but, the wait is worth it. They do, however, take reservations. And, the head waiter is really, really nice and tries his best to accommodate everyone in a timely manner. So, in a nutshell, try Sushi Palace...you won't regret it.
