Really?  I'm looking at these other reviews and thinking "was I really in the same restaurant?"  Maybe if you're looking for a bar but NOT a place to eat.  Trust me!  We told the waitress we had theater at 8:00 PM.  We waited for someone to take our order, we waited for water, we sat for 35 minutes before they even brought our salads. We had a quick seven minutes to eat so-so food.  Avoid this place if you want a good meal and certainly if you want to be on-time for the theater.   Oh, and it's LOUD.
