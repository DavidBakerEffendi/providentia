If you like getting hit on by Jersey Shore rejects who think they're funny, this place is for you. The music is awesome but the last time I went, downstairs smelled like hot dog water and wet socks. Filthy. On a brighter note fellas, some of the girls who come to Sidebar carry themselves like they're one gulp away from being classified as orphanages.
