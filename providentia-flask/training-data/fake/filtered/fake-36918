I frequent this quaint place occasionally, I especially like it in the Summer time as they have a garden area in the back and I enjoy sitting out there relaxing with friends and enjoying the good weather. Â The food is always good but I would like if they had a bit of a more varied menu or maybe some more specials to offer.
