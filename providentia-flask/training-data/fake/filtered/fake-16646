I Ordered dinner from this place tonight and it was terrible. Ever since the new people have taken over, the standards have dropped! The food was stale and meat tasted really bad and very rubbery. The pudding had no taste. The women on the phone who took my order was rude and had a bad attitude! This is the second time I have ordered from here and had this issue before! Decided to give them a second chance, however this was disgusting! Bad, old and tasteless food.
