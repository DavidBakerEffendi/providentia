If you are looking for a  place for your wedding. STAY away from this horrible place. The services were extremly horrible. The staff very unprofessional and Laura is extremly rude. They totally screw up my wedding party. Our package inclued hot and cold o'dours, the provided enough cold o'dours but only bought out 3 trays of hot o'dours for my guests. We have asked them to make sure there are enough hot o'dours for our guests prior to the wedding and Laura ensure us there will be enough for everyone. This is a lie． The waiters and waitress were not very well trained to handle wedding parties. I have put all of my guests meal request on the seating card, they did not look at the card at all. They bought the food out  all at once and asked my guests to raised their hands if their food was called. Some of guests waited almost 40minutes to get their food. They do not have assigned server to the table, so, there might be 5 people serving one table and some table has no one to serve them. The head waitress doesn't even speak English and she yelled at my guests. Some of my guests told them they gave them the wrong order and their responses was " we ran out of steak so you have to eat the chicken". The worst part was that the kids meal were never served!!!! My family had to bring their food over to the kids table. My family had to leave my wedding to bring the kids to somewhere else. I called Laura and told her that I was very unhappy with the service, she didn't say sorry at all. She blamed my family was being rude. My vendors also complained the mill on the river was very difficult to work with. They didn't even also us to put up a projector for our slideshows. Also, they have to charge my vendors $25 per ride to use the elevator. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!!!!!!
