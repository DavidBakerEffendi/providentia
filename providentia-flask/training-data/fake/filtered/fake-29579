So, I grew up in NY but I've been in Cali for awhile. This place is a hipster rip-off of all the good soul food I've had in Oakland, Nashville and Texas and pretty much a total insult to all the good food there is in New York. The coleslaw was mushed up and bitter and horrible, my fries were like an F minus of fries, way too salty and bad, from frozen. The chicken was good but dry. I did get a breast in my sammie though. We also waited for twenty minutes-- then were sat at the very same empty table we had inquired about earlier. The service was dumb. I get it, your busy, your faux hawk is falling in your eyes and you desperately need to pull up your pants, but damn dudes, get it together-- THIS IS NY. Two stars for brooklyn lager on tap.
