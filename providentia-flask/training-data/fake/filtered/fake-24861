I tried to like this place, I really did. "Suzy" is a sorry excuse for a restaurant owner. I've been there maybe five times in the past three months, and there is never a consistent staff. The longest person working there was probably just hired three days ago. I wondered why there's such a huge turnaround with the staff until...*in walks "Suzy* She degrades her staff members, talking down to them in front of her customers. She reprimanded a member of the staff, then proceeded to complain to a customer about said staff member after he went on with his shift. She spent most of the time lushing it up at the bar, which doesn't surprise me because before she owned the restaurant, she was a regular (who regularly left drunk and once crashed into the building). I ordered the St. Louis style ribs, and there is NOTHING positive I could say about it (I usually just get the smoked wings and mac & cheese and hang out at the bar during happy hour). I thought trying something new would be nice, but even my usual wasn't great. I brought some friends with me and was thoroughly embarrassed by the quality of the smoked wings that I so highly recommended. The service was horrid. Our server put his FINGERS in my food. His attitude could use an adjustment as well. Then again, how can you Â expect the staff to be happy and motivated when the person who is running the place is mean and hateful.
