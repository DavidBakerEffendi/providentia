For someone who works in the area stopping by to grab a slice or two would be great but as I walked in, I was directed to a small take out window on the side of the building. I waited and waited until one of the guys in the back "noticed" me. Finally I asked for for 2 slices and they cheaply said we don't do slices only pies... that turned me off at first. Fast forward a week later, decided to give Papa's another try. Phone line was busy for at least an hour, ended up driving over instead. Ordered a small, 6 slice $12 pie. 30 minute wait. Pizza was good at first, quickly became cold and the pizza became tough to chew. Customer service to could be a lot better, especially at the tiny take out window. Be more attentive to your customers and offer slices to a working community.
