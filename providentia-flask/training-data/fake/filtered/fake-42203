My friend and I came here for brunch today, and I can honestly say it was a very enjoyable experience. We ate on the patio by the garden, which was very relaxing. Our server was very attentive, and the meal was very nicely put together. I had the egg-in-the-nest, in which the egg was perfectly cooked for me(nice and runny), and the nice melted brie, along with the portabella and truffle cream made for an awesome flavor combination that I would recommend to anybody.  My friend had the chicken and biscuit with gravy which came with a watermelon salad. It was a very tasty dish and one could tell that it's construction was well thought out. The chef also sent out a sliced pineapple dish with  a pomegranate-molasses sauce, which was a perfect end to the meal(nice and refreshing). I will definitely be back to try the dinner menu, and I will suggest this spot to anyone that is interested in having a nice dining experience in Williamsburg.
