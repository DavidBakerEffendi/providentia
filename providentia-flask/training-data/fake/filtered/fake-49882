Love their beer so I figured I would also like their food. The seating in most areas of the place is elbow to elbow. The croud was all college kids and the food was a joke for the prices. I had sweet potato tater tots to start that were mushy and the dipping sauces were horrible. One was cream type sauce with cumin in it, which didn't at all go with sweet potatoes and the other was a spicy mess that also didn't pair well. My burger that I ordered "pink" instead of their one other option "no pink" was so dry, well done and flavorless. The cheese on the burger was translucent on the edges meaning it was dried out when melted (old cheese) . The mashed potatoes had uncooked chunks of potatoes in it. My date had salmon that was so fishy you could smell it when they walked up (old fish) . To top it off your going to spend 5 to 10 dollars just to park ! The best part about that place was my beer and pickle, would never go their again.
