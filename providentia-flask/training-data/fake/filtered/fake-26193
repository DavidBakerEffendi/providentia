I tried the prix-fixe lunch last week with my wife, and was very glad we did.  Appetizer (soup), main course (fried chicken) and dessert (carrot cake) were all amazingly tasty.  At $15 for the lunch, it seems like a great deal, considering the quality and level of the food.  This place reminds me of Market restaurant that used to be in Montclair, back when it was still in the diner and was taking real care in making the food (and before it moved and went slightly downhill before closing shop).  Very glad it's here, and can't wait to try it again.  Service and atmosphere seemed just right to us (nice, casual feel), but there were only a few tables seated so we didn't want for attention.  I'm told they have a children's menu, so we may try bringing the kid next time to see what she thinks.  A lot of the restaurants on Bloomfield Ave in Montclair leave something to be desired, but this one met all my expectations.
