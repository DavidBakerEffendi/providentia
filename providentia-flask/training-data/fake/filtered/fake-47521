I'm only giving two stars because the 30-60 minute wait is totally not worth it. We ordered a medium pie, the cheese was ok, and there was barely any sauce. Honestly the whole pie had almost little to no flavor. I had dollar pizza better than this crap. But don't get me wrong maybe with some toppings and extra sauce it can go up a star. My friend asked for waters first then soda. The guy gave us the sodas first and we were done quite quickly. We had to ask three times for water, what incompetent and slow waiters. So if you have about two hours to kill it might be worth it, Maybe, other than that Difaras, IL Fornetto and others have better pizza.
