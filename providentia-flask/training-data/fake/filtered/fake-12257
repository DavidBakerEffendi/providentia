This place sucks!!! Menus is extremely limited, service sucks and food is over priced and tastes like nothing. To make matters worse once we told waitress how bad it was 35 min after food came out since that was the only time she came over she said well the next time the manager said if you tell us right away we will make you something different. Too bad the waitress never came out and all staff ignored us. There will never be a next time.save your time and money never come here it is NOT the merchant house.
