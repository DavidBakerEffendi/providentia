I have been going here for years, this is the best place to grab something cheap and goooooooood to eat! Writing this review is making me want to grab some right now. They have pork and chive dumplings, different soups, pancakes with veggies and meat in it, etc. Listen ... it's realllllllly good and realllllly cheap, so just go! But don't hog up all the room, the seating area is tiny but the food is worth waiting for someone to get their greedy asses up so I can sit down. AND THEY TAKE CREDIT AND DEBIT CARDS, YAY! BEWARE: VERY HUGE RATS, I MEAN VERY HUGEEEE RATS DOWN THE BLOCK .... AVOID THE BLOCK ONCE YOU SEE A CAT SIZED RAT. THEY ARE VERY DANGEROUS, THEY HAVE BIG TEETH. BEWARE. I SAW ONE EAT A SQUIRREL WHOLE! PLEASE BE CAREFUL!!! .....Oh LES/China Town, I loveth you.
