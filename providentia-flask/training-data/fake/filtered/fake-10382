Chaska chat -Desi Delight Horrible and worst ever restuarant for snacks and am sure for all types of food they sell.Trust me they sell spoiled food and when asked they would reply super rude.When you complain about the food that it is spoiled they would not be surprised and inctead they would reply you in such a way as if you are asking them to pay you back.They are just DISGUSTING AND please dont go there if you want to eat soemthing nice.Worst ambience and they asked if we realised the taste only after eating half of the food?? Does that mean that we should have relaised in the first bite and throw the food on their face?? God..Incredbile lady there..
