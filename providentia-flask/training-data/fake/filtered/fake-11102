Came here last night for the time and I CANNNOT wait to come back! Place looks really small and you don't really notice the store front as you're walking past. I came in with my boyfriend and some friends and we opted to sit in their backyard which is so cute. I love the mural and vine they have. Our waitress Seagan was awesome she recommended the perfect choices for us so that we could try a little bit of everything. We got a butchers platter with their specialty BURNT ENDS. Our waitress described the exact cooking process and what meat it was so now I'm obviously a BBQ expert. But seriously 14 hr smoked beef tips PILE THEM ON! I only wish we got more. We also got their Philipino sausage sweet and tangy, their pork belly yum and 1 sauced ribs and 1 dry ribs. Our lovely waitress recommended the Mac and sweet potato wedges. They put maple syrup and cinnamon on them which makes them heavenly! We also got corn on the cob which looked bland but tasted so sweet! Props to them for using organic products. We ordered string beans as well which were good although not my favorite. I'm so happy we went had a great time! Bring booze although they do have two beers I'm bringing some alc to spice up my Arnold Palmer next time! Thanks butcher bar xoxo
