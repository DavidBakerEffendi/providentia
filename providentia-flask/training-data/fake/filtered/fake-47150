Went to Entree this weekend with a party of 8.  Everyone had a fantastic meal.  The staff was wonderful.  I have food allergies and had no problems with the menu.  We had the wedge salad, prosciutto wrapped dates, mussels, salmon, steak, scallops, tuna and the fried Oreos.  I personally had the steak and it was cooked to perfection.  The place is small, so I would call for a reservation.
