Was in last week for the Russian River beer event and had a really great time. I've been to a bunch of their beer events and they always do a good job with the beer selection and providing information about the beers. The fish & chips were perfect, and the service was solid. This was a 5 star night for me b/c i love Russian River's beers and the event was put together really well.
