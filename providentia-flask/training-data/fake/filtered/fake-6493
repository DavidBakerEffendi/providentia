I had reached out to Eagle Trading for a catering order and I ordered an array of sandwiches for a baby shower in the neighborhood. All the guests raved about the delicious sandwiches and kept asking me where they were from! Also, the Brooklyn Pita Chips were super tasty! Thanks again for the delicious sandwiches and suggestions!
