I was lucky to stumble across this place one night & now I can't get enough.  I have yet to walk through the door and not want to dance.  Great combo of old school funk, soul, jazz, r&b, hip hop, latin.... you name it they play it.. & your always in good company.  If your lucky enough like I was you'll be able to hear one of the live bands that play there, The Maddnotes.. These guys know what they are doing. Good Times
