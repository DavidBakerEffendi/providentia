The lunch at this place sucks. The lentil soup was the worst tasting I ever had. Salty and gridy. The cheft that day just threw together a salty messy concoction called lentil soup. A Friend told me when he went for a panini, it was too mushy and way overpriced.  The croquettes are tiny and sit in a glass enclosure all morning until lunch. Nasty!  One Friday a few coworkers and I wanted to give this place another try...service was great but the staff is clueless.  They don't know anything especially how to make a good cup of Cuban coffee. I visited Cuba this place is a disgrace on Cuban's tradition (good coffee blend). Big disappointment, will never ever come here to dine or order out. Eek!! Urg!  Too expensive and not good. Be careful!!!
