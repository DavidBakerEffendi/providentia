Has the economy got you missing the opportunity to eat flight food?  Are you a fan of egg beaters?  Brunch at Almond is the place for you.  We ordered a chorizo omlette, asparagus salad, and burger for brunch.  To be fair, I have eaten here for dinner and it was pretty good.  One point for that.  the service was great as well, so another 1 point for that.  But brunch--not a fan.  The egg had the consistency and color that was very reminiscent of plane food.  The burger was pretty tough in consistency and the salad was just alright.  Prices are not low either.
