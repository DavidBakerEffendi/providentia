march 11 2013... was asked to come in for an interview.spoke with a nice lady on the phone who told me to come in at 3pm to meet deena who i guess is the manager. i show up dressed for the interview. deena never came out to interview me.she told the hostess to tell me to leave my name and number.im confused,they told me to come for an interview today and now they dont wanna even meet with me.was she busy with the four people that were at the bar.,or was my skin color to dark to work at this restaurant...hmmmmmm
