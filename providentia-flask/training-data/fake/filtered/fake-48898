Gorgeous space! I wanted to sit on the comfy couches in the entry all night. Great space for a date or quick chat with friends. The menu was extremely limited for a vegan, which is sort of unacceptable in 2013. They also told my friend his meal was on the house because they'd 86d what he first ordered. But then when the bill came (at this point we had a different waiter than we'd started with) - it was still on his tab. Which is fine - he was ok with paying for his meal obviously, but don't say you'll take it off and then not do it.
