Good place. As we arrived, a table was leaving so we sat right away. Good price on the pad Thai (considering you can get shrimp for the same price as the other ones, which is rare). Very interesting presentation for the Thai iced tea. Shrimp and chicken Pad Thai were both good, although it tasted a bit smokey....fast service, would recommend.
