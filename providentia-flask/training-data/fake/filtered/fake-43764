These little meals add up! Great atmosphere, a little loud but a lot of fun if you are with the right people. The portions of the food are tiny, but hey that is tapas, but the price is for a full portion in certain cases. If you are selective you won't break the bank. The drinks are powerfull and the food is very good. Love the building! Oh yeah, ask for a table on the second floor!
