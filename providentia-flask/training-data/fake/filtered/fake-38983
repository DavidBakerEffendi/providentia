great price for house wine, i think we got a glass pitcher for 21 dollars and split it among 4 people. gnocchi was excellent, however we ordered ziti with spicy tomato sauce and eggplant, and there was nothing special about it. i felt like i could have cooked that for myself at home. also, my friend ordered the special soup of the night (shrimp bisque) and did not like it at all. prices were really affordable. atmosphere was alright, nothing special. staff was very attentive. If i were to go again it Â would be for the house wine and gnocchi only.
