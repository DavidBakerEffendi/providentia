Great place for the best burgers in town. Our favorites NY Steakhouse Burger and the Half Bacon Burger. Also can't pass up dessert.. Jack Daniels Bread Pudding with a scoop of Bourbon Brown Sugar ice Cream!! Â Our waitress Kate was awesome and the managers there stop by every table. Great service!! My new favorite place to eat.
