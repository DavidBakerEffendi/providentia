PJ's is more about the fact that's it's a princeton classic and less about great food. They took a turn for the worse when they covered up their walls - which used to have writing from decades past all over them. Still, it's not a horrible place, it feels homey, and it is a place you have to go if you're ever in the area for a while. The burgers are pretty good, pancakes aren't bad. It's a little pricier than it should be but, hey, it's princeton.
