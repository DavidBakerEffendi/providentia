Ok , where do i start? The owner of this place is a genius bacon on everything on the menu? i had to go try it so i walked in with 3 friends at 8:30pm but were told the wait was 1hour. We tried to go to the bar and order drinks but it was insanely crowded and there was no way of even getting close enough to a bartender to order drinks BUT 10mins later the Hostess with the mostess  Mila aka. Kim Kardashian as i call her came to our rescue and was able to squeeze us in . Talk about amazing! We All ordered Flights of beer and Bacon 4 choices in each. We also got the Lobster Mac and Cheese  AMAZING but brace yourself "Brussels sprouts and Yogurt" sounds crazy but i had to try it and holy cow...... Heaven!!!! My buddy got the Lobster roll he said it was great and a very generous portion which made it even more better. Our server actually recommended the grilled cheese to me but i have to say the soup tasted like marinara sauce thats my only negative feedback. This was a definite experience-The service was great, the atmosphere was cool!!!!!!
