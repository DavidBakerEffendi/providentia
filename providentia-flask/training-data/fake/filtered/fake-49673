Went to Portofino's on Saturday night.  Very disappointing meal.  My steak was tough, the mashed potatoes had absolutely no favor and it was way overpriced.  The place was empty as well.  Not a good sign!  We've been there twice before and the food was very good.  Defintely has gone down hill!  I'm surprised they stay in business.  Will not be going back there again
