I dine out often. Always looking for the best, price is rarely an issue. But I must say, there is NOTHING I can add to what has been written about Barbuzzo.  If you have dined at Amis and think that was good, be prepared to be overwhelmed. This place is off the charts. Prices are fair for what they serve: JUST INCREDIBLE  JUST MAKE SURE you have reservations. My reservations were early, 5PM, and when I arrived there was a line waiting to get in. I subsequently learned that line was for the bar seating, because if you don't have a reservation for a table, you are out of luck, it's the bar or nothing. Let me just say this: they have it all together here: food, service, price. I actually can't wait to go again, and I will, nothwithstanding I'll be driving for 90 minutes to get there. . .but somethings in life are just worth it!
