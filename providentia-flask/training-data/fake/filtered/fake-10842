Went to this place the other day and it was good. The place was nice and comfy. The atmosphere was great. As soon as you walk in you can smell all the butter. The bar was nice but we didn't try the raw bar (maybe next time). The steamed seafood was pretty good, bursting with flavor. I had combo A spicy with the boil special sauce and it was really good. My friends just went at it with their combos, we also had the softshell crabs (it only came with one crab...) appetizer and it was pretty good, well seasoned fries (no need ketchup). I guess my only complaint is the crawfish...it was tiny...hard to freaking peel and not very tasty. The shrimp was better than the crawfish since the shrimps were freaking large. The potatoes/corn/sausage was even better than the crawfish and they didn't give that many pieces of potatoes/sausages. The waitstaff was extremely nice. I'll say come here if you want something other than the chinatown usual foods and never tried a steam-baked shellfish. I'll definitely come back for a special occasion.
