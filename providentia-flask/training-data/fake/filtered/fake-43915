I just moved to Philadelphia, been here about a month and this is already becoming a neighborhood favorite. Lovely outdoor space, very friendly owners and, most importantly, REALLY GOOD food. High quality bistro food with a twist. I've had the corn avocado bisque (very good), the crunchy/creamy eggplant fries with a zingy aoli (yummy), the velvety truffled mac n' cheese (EXTRA yummy), and the B4 burger - very beefy, juicy, and the blue cheese and caramelized onions make it very satisfying. Good house wines and an extensive beer list. Definitely give this place a try. The neighborhood is better off with this restaurant in it.
