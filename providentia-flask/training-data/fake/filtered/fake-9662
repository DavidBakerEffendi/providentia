Simple decor (diner style) but awesome food. Owner Vasantha is extremely imaginative in combining different foods to create new dishes that taste fabulous. Who ever thought that "healthy" could be so delicious. He does vegan, vegetarian, but also non-vegetarian for those who want it. Incredible crab cakes and roll-up sandwiches. And, to make it even better, in spite of the large portions the prices are very reasonable. Worth a special trip to eat there.
