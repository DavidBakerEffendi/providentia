My husband and I had a fabulous time at Agricola last night. We stopped in early, around 6, for some drinks and appetizers at the bar. As transplants from NYC, we have longed for a place like this to wander into in Princeton. The bar was busy but we got a seat at one of the communal tables within minutes. The ambiance was cool, the space was relaxing and our waitress was perfectly pleasant. We ordered two dishes and both were out of this world.  The burger was juicy and flavorful and was served with fries and beet ketchup. Whatever sauce they use on the burger is to die for!  The flatbread had exquisite mushrooms and a glorious fresh egg on top. Simple yet complex and, oh, so gratifyingly good!  I can't wait to eat every single dish that Agricola's kitchen offers.
