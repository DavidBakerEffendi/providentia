I'm surprised at these reviews. I wanted to like this place, but I just didn't think the food was very good. We had the hush puppies, fried chicken, and pasta. Really lacking in flavor and just sort of mediocre. Maybe I'd describe it as food you'd get in the suburbs. There are much better places in the neighborhood, I think. Try Brucie for pasta and Prime Meats if you want to have a real meat nomz. Sorry Buttermilk Channel--I wanted to like it, I really did!
