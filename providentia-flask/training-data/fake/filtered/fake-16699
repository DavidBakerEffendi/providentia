horrible food - horrible staff - i didn't know that ignorance is part of customer service... the lack of concern for a customer complaint and issue refuses to be resolved. not only did we get treated on fairly. we were cursed out and ignored for 30 + minutes while sitting at the bar with no more than 15 people. Â maybe hiring staff with manners would be more beneficial to your company. absolutely disgusted with this place and will never return again... my first and last time ever.... when you get new management and staff that is respectful, caring, and understanding than maybe a 2nd attempt to try but till then this place is a waste of time and my hard earned money.
