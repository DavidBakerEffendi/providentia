My husband and I celebrated both our birthdays on 1/29/11 and ordered the tasting menu.  I had the lamb as the entree and the steak for him.  Both were a very big disappointment - served after a long wait, both dishes were lukewarm and salty. Service was uncertain.  The bill was not surprising for a restaurant such as the Grammercy Tavern but my husband and I felt the quality of food and service was severley lacking.    Will not go back for sure.
