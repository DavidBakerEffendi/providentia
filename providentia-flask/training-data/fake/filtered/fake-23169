Went here for lunch (a veggie burger with fries) and it was fairly uninspiring. Pretty average food and not too cheap either (5.50 for a small orange juice is quite a lot...). The other food might be better value for money or a bit more exciting, but on the basis of my experience I wouldn't hurry to go back
