I hate to say it, as the staff is very nice for this hood, but this is not what is used to be. My kids loved it so we went alot. The are often very accomodating but the portions are much smaller now, often not hot, and I once had a puddle of beer under my table that took quite a bit for them to clean up, even though it was still dripping from the underside of the table all over me. I hate to be critical but if it is Pies and Thighs, those 2 items should be outstanding. They are not. I think the prices are reasonable if the food was as good as a year ago..
