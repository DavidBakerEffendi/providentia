I would prefer to just use a pro/con chart for this review. Pros +Great Sandwhiches, look and taste great +For an airport restaurant in NY, pretty reasonably priced +I got the correct amount of change back Cons -This is ONLY place in the the airport terminal that actually sells "food" like food you would eat for a full meal.  So if you haven't lunch or dinner yet and you're not up for waiting another 30 minutes again through security, expect to be eating some of Earl of Sandwhiches. -That being said, the place is packed, and the restaurant doesn't plan accordingly. So expect at least a 20 minute wait on your food. -As some others reviews said, the music is BLARING, factor that in with mass conversation around you, and you will be able to sufficiently not hear a word your cashier is saying. -Speaking of cashier, the service was mediocre at best. My order was completely torn apart from what I asked for.  Not sure if it was from their lack of attention to detail or that they couldn't hear a word I was saying either. -If you feel like waiting another 15 minutes, then you will have the wonderful oppurtunity of actually being able to eat in the resaturant.  Otherwise, you will get kicked out for trying to eat in the restaraunt and you get the option of finding other great eating areas in the terminal (the floor!) In summary, if you're heading to terminal A in Newark, I would highly recommend eating beforehand.  If you're willing to put all the cons into consideration for a good sandwhich, then go to Earl of Sandwhich.
