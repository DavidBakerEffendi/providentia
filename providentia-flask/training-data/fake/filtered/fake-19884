Really good food and beautifully bright back area. At the weekend between 10am and 12:30pm they have a dresscode: Scandinavian expensive understatement. And the place is uncomfortably crowded then. I recommend going early on weekdays, when one gets a lot of space. Mogador also employs a small contingent of really, really unfriendly servers (one, to be precise). Kind of ruins the mood and endangers ambitions to go back. But as I said, the food and the light are really good, and unfriendly service is nothing that can't be fixed. And, maybe she's really an artist. Yo.
