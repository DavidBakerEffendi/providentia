Claim to fame is one of the alleged owners, Robert DeNiro. Chairs are hard metal with no pretense at comfort.  Napkins look like cheap Wal-Mart stuff.  We were a party of 8 - they seated us immediately, took our drink order, then we waited 40 minutes for them to bring our drinks and some bread to the table.  When the bread finally did arrive, they brought 8 pieces for 8 people, but no oil, no garlic, no butter.  The bread looked and tasted like leftover sicilian pizza with the sauce carelessly wiped off.  The menu was small and sparse, and EVERYTHING was a la carte.  The portions would be laughably small, except at these prices it amounted to legal robbery.  Insult was added to injury via a mandatory 20% gratuity, so the server had no incentive to even pretend to give a damn or good service, unless having the busboy repeatedly interrupt your conversation to lean over you and fill you water glass constitutes good service.  When they (mercifully, finally) brought dessert, they did not bring the coffee.  When they finally brought the coffee, they did not bring any sweetner or sugar, but they did bring an itty-bitty little bottle of lukewarm milk.  With any luck, I will NEVER have to go back to Locanda Verde - a thoroughly unsatisfying and pretentious excuse for a culinary experience.
