This is your local Butcher. Â Everyone I know gets their meat from here. It is class above anything you can get at Whole Foods (Whole Paycheck) or any other chain. Their steaks are world class - on par with anything you will get at the best restaurants. The chicken is all free range and organic. You want something gourmet like a crown roast - call them and it will be done just like you see in a cook's magazine. I know some find this a bit much, but I have a real craving for their veal sausage. I know I should eat more tofu, but this veal sausage is something else - please forgive me all of you. If you want some really nice meat for a stew, you can get meat here that is just like it was when cows walked down Whalley Avenue. What can I say, Alan is our local Butcher and if it meat you want, Amity Meat is your place.
