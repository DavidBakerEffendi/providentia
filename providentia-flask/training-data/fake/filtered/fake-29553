Went here for a early dinner based on friends reviews. Had the chicken and waffles. First impression was not impressed. The price does not justify food or service. Chicken was good and the waffles tasted like cardboard covered with cinnamon butter. On the way out I decided to pick up a slice of key lime pie for later that night. Half way home I decided to open it to see how it looks and I got pecan pie, which I'm allergic to and threw it out. Now it's close to 1:30am and am throwing up non stop. I don't know if I got sick from the chicken or from being surrounded by midwestern transplanted trendy hipsters. Â Never going back nor recommending it.
