Amazing food!!!! I loved everything. I ate a buffalo chicken wrap and the white supreme and vegi pizza was delicious. Definitely a must try for a great taste. I have to visit twice a week for lunch to get my fix with all the great varieties they have and because of the freshness. Â I am so picky with food and how clean the place looks and i'm very satisfied in both areas.
