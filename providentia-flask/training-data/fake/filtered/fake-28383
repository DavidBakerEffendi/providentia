Great food..great service!! We go here every time we go to Astoria. The service is very friendly and attentive. I had the grilled calamari and hubby had the baby shark... both were cooked simply & delicious. I recommend this to everyone I know that is looking for a great place to eat. They even finish off your dinner with a wonderful piece of galaktoboureko ( a Greek dessert )at no charge
