Ended up in NYC for an extra night after the rest of my group went home.  So as a single walked into Maialino and tried to find a spot at the bar to hopefully have dinner.  The place was packed with couples and large groups of regulars.  Ordered a very tasty cocktail and things seemed to be loosening up as people migrated from the bar to tables.  When I spotted a couple in the corner leaving I tried to make my way over to grab a seat.  As I got close the bartender suddenly appeared over in that area in my path and as I attempted to get through said "where are you going?".  I said to the open seat.  He said, "oh no, there is a wait list for bar seats".  Being alone and with a lot of people around and listening I felt like a child being scolded.  It did not seem like there was a practice of a list of people waiting because I watched others walk up to the bar without his approval.  He acted like he was some big shot with all his cronies and regulars and who the hell was I?  I have eaten at Union Square Cafe 25 times and referred so many people there also.  I have never felt such a lack of customer service or respect ever at USC.  The feeling was very un-welcoming.  This salt peppered hair bartender was a jerk and I immediately walked out.  I am sure Danny Meyer would not approve of this employees ego and attitude and because of it has lost a customer for all Danny Meyer restaurants because you hired this guy and gave him a place to practice his little ego-trip.
