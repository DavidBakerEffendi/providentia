Marigold Kitchen is eminently mediocre. The food is pretty good, maybe worthy of 4 stars, but the rest of the experience leaves much to be desired. Not only did the door keep swinging open leaving us subject to cold blasts of air, but also the music being played was so awful we weren't sure if the staff was aware that the sound system was on. These kind of missteps seem small, but in sufficient quantity they severely detract from the quality of the experience.
