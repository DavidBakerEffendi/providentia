I was really hoping that this place would be a new place to hang out, have a good and quick bite to eat, and feel comfortable sitting at the bar at any time of day or night, but I was wrong.  I was excited to try the burger, but it was way under par.  They didn't even serve ketchup with the fries! When I asked for more, the sever brought over a tiny portion for my table to share. I'm sure it was due to the cost and wastefulness, but it was just odd at best.  The bartenders were fine, but not people you could really start a conversation with. And that goes for the rest of the clientele as well.  I would like to give it a THIRD chance, but it would do some major convincing from friends to get me to spend my money there again.
