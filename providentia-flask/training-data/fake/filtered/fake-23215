Nice date spot. Possibly the best mexican food in NY. Oh, and sports fans? Their bar joined World Cup fanaticism back in '10 and added to the regular happy hour from 3-7pm, to whenever a match was on. Much has been said about the bartenders in other reviews. They mix a mean cocktail, with several varieties of spicy margarita to choose from. The jalepeno margarita is spicy while the last margarita on the menu has a sweet, sour, spicy kick. Food- The mole was lovely, complex. They have a chile relleno vegetarian option with more quinoa than cheese. You can play it safe with fish tacos or be bold and try the grasshopper taco. It doesn't taste like chicken. The decor makes a subtle reference to La Dia de los Muertos, perhaps the name tipped you off. At Ofrenda, these offerings are fit for the warm-blooded and depart far and wide from the hackneyed dishes at most Mexican spots.
