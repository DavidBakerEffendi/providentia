On point food (craving right now) great service, horrible waits (but worth it), unfriendly hosts, 20 stars to allowing you to bring your own wine,etc. Tight waiting space. For the volume this place gets- expand! Reorganize. Do something! that tight hall way and servers flying through with hot plates is suffocating!
