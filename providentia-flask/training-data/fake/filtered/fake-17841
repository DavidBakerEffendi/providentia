If you are NOT A HIPSTER  you wont like this place.  Plus bartender is cocky and arrogant.  He blew me off and ignored me cause im not a smelling hipster with a iphone and scruffy beard.   Drinks are way to much for buchwick.   They dont want anyone just wondering on in, so there is no sign or address outside.   Only hipster word of mouth.   The crowd here is hipster to the max.  With everyone full of their hipster selves.   how can hipsters who dont bathe, shave, or change  their clothes be this snobby?
