Had fennel salad with roasted red peppers, artichokes and pine nuts.  FABULOUSLY FRESH!!   Had cheese-less pizza with roasted red peppers, artichokes and fresh shredded parmesan cheese on the side.  It was BETTER than PEPES and probably the best pizza outside of Italy that I have had..and I've been to Italy 9 times!
