We were helping our friends move into their new apartment in Windsor, Vermont, so we went to the Home Depot in New Hampshire to get some supplies. It was late and we had not yet had a proper meal all day so I suggested a japanese place I saw on the way over. The host was very sweet and got us a very nice little secluded room to ourselves. We loved it and that wasn't even the best thing. The food was of course the best! My bf got the shrimp pad thai, I got the chicken katsu and a sweet potato tempura roll (I was super hungry and thought I could down both meals but couldn't so I shared ;P), and my two friends got some vegetarian soup options (I can't remember what they were but I recall one of them being WAY too spicey to even eat.) So all of the food was good, the only downside was the super spicey thing but man even that was tastey! It was just too much spice. But yes, the host/owner/waitress was fantastic and very accomadating and even though it was close to closing hour, she was very sweet and quick with the orders (and it was all cooked very well too, nothing was half-done). So yeah, I would definitely recommend this place! I left feeling very satisfied. Give it a try! Everything on their menu sounded great and definitely worth it.
