I am all for good, locally sourced food but A. Kitchen was a disappointment.  The food was mediocre at best, and the servings were so tiny! Definitely not a place for value. But beyond that the server was not friendly and did not seem to care much for being there. He kept going to the bar and talking to the bartender rather then be more attentive. Also the noodles in the pasta dish was very overcooked and soggy.   Would not recommend or return.
