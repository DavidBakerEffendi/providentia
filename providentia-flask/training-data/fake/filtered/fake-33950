This was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had! After eating Â at Pepe's (and loving it!) a number of times we decided to try Sally's instead. WORST decision ever! After waiting in a line with 10-15 other people for nearly an hour and a half we finally got a table. There was one waiter who soon took are drinks. 20 minutes later they came. Once we ordered are pizza we were amazingly lucky. Instead of waiting up to two hours like most of the people we only had to wait 45 minuets. I really hate to say it but the pizza was delicious. ( Though not as good as Pepe's). Over all the experience was TERRIBLE. So if you want to have real fun go right down to street to Pepe's where you will have a twenty minuet wait to get in the same at the most for your pizza and over all a better time.
