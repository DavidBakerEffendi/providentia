4 of us were heading down to NJ via the Merritt and I was told that we should have lunch at your place. Worst restaurant experience I have ever had!!! It took 2 hours to get out of there, and it wasn't even busy!!! All we heard from our server (creepy guy with a mustache & beard) is that it was the gun clubs fault for not calling in their order!  There were only 8 of them, and a table with 2 other people so that excuse was totally lame. Finally, towards the end of our nightmarish visit I called him on it and said....."dude, you really put us behind our schedule, if it took half the time to get our food that would have been bad, the service here was just horrible!".  He started in with the excuses again, to the point that the girls got up and left and went to the car and me and my friend couldn't even look the guy in the eye......here i was complaining about the service and this knucklehead is spending yet more time making excuses again, i felt like saying, look jackass, you just don't get it, go back and get us our $%^&^  check already!!! It was $55, we gave him $60, which was way to much. I will never set foot in your place again, and I will copy & paste this to every possible website. I can't believe you've stayed in business this long!!! Steve
