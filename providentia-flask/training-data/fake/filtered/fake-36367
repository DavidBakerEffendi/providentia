Went to Scarpetta on Halloween evening. Couldn,t  think of a better place to be than in the Village. The restaurent has a nice intimate room for dining. The service was attentive without being obtrusive. We had the duck-foie gras ravioli. Melt in your mouth delicious. The black squid ink pasta with sea urchins  made you feel as if you were sitting at a table on the Mediterranean coast. The goat was earthy and satisfying.All in all an excellent dining experience.
