I  have been to Amy Ruth's a few times and I must say its different every time. The service is great the waiter are nice. But  The corn bread was dry and cornbread is my weakness sets the tone for the rest of the meal. I've had quite a few things on the menu and the best thing I can think of is the Reggie Harris. Their chicken and waffle is nothing to brag about and their greens are not all that... Just sayin... I can make better Mac and Cheese at home....But over all it was good will go there again.. if  I'm really hungry ...
