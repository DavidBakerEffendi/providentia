I went back for my in-laws birthday.  She is very picky about food and I was nervous about taking her there but she approved. *whew* Food: Appetizers - We ordered the farm board as usual.  My father-in-law is a cheese person and he is a big big fan of it.  The potato and leek soup was great for the season.  It's not too rich nor heavy yet still carries the creaminess you would expect. Entree - 1. Crab Hash Salmon - My mother-in-law was very specific about her salmon and the chef delivered.  The salmon was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  The hash with lump crab meat complemented the wild salmon very well.  It's also served with baby kale (if you are the healthy green type) 2. Lobster Pappardelle - This is the one dish my father-in-law wouldn't share (by entree time)!  I can't tell you the taste from experience but it looks very creamy and it smells so good. 3. Grass-fed Burger - My husband loves what the chef does so he told them to make him something creative, and they did.  They put thick cut, and I mean thick not wide, bacon, top with sweet onion jam and pepper flakes, on a lean but super juicy burger.  I'm not a burger person but I had to take a bite.  The bun was the best part.  It was light, crunchy, and carries the burger well. 4. Stuffed Bella - Crab meat stuffed baby portabella mushroom  with lobster and butter.  It's rich and pretty filling.  I love the sauce; it's super flavorful and it goes very well with my husband's fries :P Dessert - We are so spoiled.  They gave us a dessert board which we always look forward to.  There was my beloved coconut macaroon pie *heart* , my father-in-law not willing to share creme brulee, and poached pear with fresh homemade Madagascar vanilla bean ice-cream.  See the pictures and tell me that doesn't look mouth-watering. **FYI, this is not one of the restaurants where the servers hover and ask how you are doing every 10 mins.
