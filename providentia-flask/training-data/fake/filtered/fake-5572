I have never felt compelled to write a review, until now. Last month, I stopped at Max Brenner's for a drink with friends. Within several minutes of sitting down, my husband's frozen, chocolatey drink was spilled all over my friend and me by a server. Another drink was brought out, but, much to our surprise, we were charged for it. The manager did come over and offered to reimburse our dry-cleaning bill, but I thought simply comp-ing us a few drinks would have been easier for them and more appreciated by us. Today, I went to brunch at Max Brenner's with my family. While we were promptly seated, our coffees took literally 25 minutes to be served. (Keep in mind, the place was near-empty, and these were not specialized drinks - just plain coffee). The food is expensive but only average in quality and taste. Needless to say, it also has some of the worst service I've experienced in town. Don't waste your time or money at this place!
