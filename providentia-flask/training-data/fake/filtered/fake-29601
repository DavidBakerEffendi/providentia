This place was ok. I wanted to be wowed but sadly was not. We went early on a Friday evening. We were sat immediately which made me very happy. I have to say I was not totally impressed with the food or the service. I think everyone but our server was fantastic, they were happy to get us what ever we asked for. Â Our order was the following. App- Mac and Cheese, I was pretty happy with this. Dinner- Catfish with creamed spinach I wanted to love it, it was very tasty but needed a lot of tarter. My BF got the fried chicken and he had to add hot sauce and honey, he liked it but was not floored. For dessert we had the fried apple pie- it was similar to a dried out mcdonalds apple pie- but not as good. Overall the place was ok but I feel like it has past its prime.
