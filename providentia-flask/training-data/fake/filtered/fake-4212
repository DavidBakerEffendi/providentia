We found this place by chance on our way to see a show Off Broadway and called in for cocktails - a $5 each, we ended up having a couple! The place is small but exceptional in the decor, service and friendliness. We couldn't help but check out the food as it was served around us and were gutted we had already eaten. Sooo ... we went back the following night for dinner and were very impressed. We regularly dine out at Thai restaurants near home in the UK and would love this little place to be on our doorstep! The food was amazing!
