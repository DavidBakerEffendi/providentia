I have to say from a Puerto ricans point of view the food was outstanding! The service was excellent and the atmosphere is great a real family feel. the place is insanely clean and the food was all seasoned perfectly and very nice sized portions. I have to say i felt lile the staff really cared. which is rare nowadays when u go out to eat. i would definitely recommend this place.
