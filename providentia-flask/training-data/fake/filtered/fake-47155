Went for the last night of restaurant week, like 15 minutes before closing.  There was drama with the rest of our group so we didn't want to be seated right away.  The staff was very cool about letting us stand there on such a cold night til the rest of our group got their s%^t together.  The food was great, the waiter was probably the nicest I've ever had in the city.   I wish I remembered his name, I'd give a shout out!
