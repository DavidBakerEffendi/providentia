Very authentic Thai.  If you like more mainstream Thai food (like panang curry, etc), you might want to go somewhere else.  There's not a lot of curry on this menu.  Also, buyer beware...our credit card number was swiped and stolen while we were here (or at another restaurant...Bocca di Bacco...only two places where we used this credit card).  Someone bought a lot of Forever 21 on us.  Don't use  your debit card here just to be safe.  The atmosphere is cool.
