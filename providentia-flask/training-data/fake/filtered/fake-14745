Place is horrible.  I was served tartar sauce with hot wings.  I thought it was blue cheese dressing that went bad.  The waiter picked up the plate and said "Is that tartar sauce?"  I said yes and that was it no apologies nothing.  Lobster macaroni was disgusting.  Lobster was rubbery and the macaroni and cheese was greasy.  My wife's salmon was over-cooked.  The grilled octopus smelled and tasted fishy but not in a good way.  The bill with tip was over $100.00.  The only positive was the nice young lady who seated us and took our coats. This place has no shot
