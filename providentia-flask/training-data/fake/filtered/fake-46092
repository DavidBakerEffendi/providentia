This is the new gem in Germantown - First of all you feel like you are in Center City when you are inside.  This place is classy, kid friendly, a great place for a brunch date, after church meeting, or take-out.  The food is delicious. The staff is very friendly.  The place is clean and the atmosphere feels great.  I actually order the Rose Petals waffles with the buttermilk batter...and turkey sage sausage on the side.  Its the best.
