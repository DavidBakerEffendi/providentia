This place is not new but it still delivers a surprise. The warm beverages are unusually good (how many places in NY serve a hot toddy??) and the food is fabulous. The devils on horseback are some of the best I have ever had (outdoing even the Spotted Pig), the quail was cooked well and spicefully seasoned. The rabbit entree was truly a work of art both visually and tastefully. Desserts (bananas foster and brownie) lacked the pizazz of the rest of the meal. The hostess was a little rude, but the location and food made up for it. Great place to impress a date with your insider knowledge of New York.
