We drove a distance and had high expectations and they were all met or exceeded. The wait staff was truly great. Our waitress really cared that we had a good experience and was patient and knowledgeable. Her recommendations were excellent. The food was top notch starting with the addictive chick peas and pistachios that were brought out to munch on as we looked over the menu. We started with a  nice assortment of the Salumi and Formaggi and it was delicious complimented with a honey dipping sauce as well as a spicy sauce.   The Pepperonata and Riva chopped salad were recommendations that also were great. The Aggrodolce ribs and Mommy's meatballs were unique in that the sauces that accompanied them were very different and not at all like what you would expect. No plain tomato sauce here but a deep tasty wine sauce of some kind .Our Cippolini pizza was one of the best pizza's we have ever eaten. The brussels sprouts were cooked so well every kid would love them and the crust was charred just enough to be tender and delicious in the center. All in all a terrific meal and atmosphere.
