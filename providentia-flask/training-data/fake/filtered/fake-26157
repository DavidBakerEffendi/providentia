We met friends for dinner. The ambience is fine, the attention prompt. The food was above average, but was way overpiced for the quality and quantity. Everything is a la carte -- my husband paid $17 for a lone lamb chip with no trimmings. I had shrimp and pasta @ $25 -- way too much for a rather ordinary dish. Pasta was good, sauce OK, shrimp were not tasty -- just ordinary frozen supermarket type. Especially annoying was their refusal to split our check between two credit cards -- something we always do when dining with these friends. We then asked for two checks, which they also refused, and in an offensive manner. We are not going back.
