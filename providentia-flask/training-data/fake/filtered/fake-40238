Hype? Yes. Deserved? Big Yes. I'm a native New Yorker, a native Bensonhursterer, and can say I've eaten a lot of pizza in my lifetime. Of all the artisan, or "boutique", or "these pizza places make me seem cooler when I say I've been to them" pizza joints in the city, imho, Di Fara's is the best. Some people complain about the place as if it was any old pizza joint where you get your slice after a quick warmup in the oven. Yes, you are gonna wait. Yea, they close down between lunch and dinner, and if you get there on the tail end of lunch you're not eating. Yea, you might not get a seat. Yea, you'll look years of grease caked on the ceiling. But you'll also get the best pie around, heavy on the EVOO, a crispy crust with subtle flavor, the best ingredients.. yadda yadda yadda. All the artisans make their pizza different, everyone's got different tastes, Di Fara's is my favorite.
