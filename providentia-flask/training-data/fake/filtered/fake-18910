I love this place's food. They grow it on sight which is very exciting for me since freshness in food is something we miss our on in New York City so often. I ordered the Bib Salad and it was perfectly dressed, and the lettuce was so fresh after just having been picked from their garden you could taste the difference! The kind of quality found here can't even been found in places in Manhattan! I also got a Margherita (spelling?!) pizza, which was unusual because this kind of pizza is so different from other kinds in New York. The sauce was made from their very own tomatoes and it wasn't as dough-y as what you're used to. The food here is amazing for the price, but I had to take off a star because of convienience. Both times I've been I had to wait for at least a half an hour since they don't take reservations. Also, they only take cash and there aren't any banks in Bushwick so you end up getting hit with an ATM fee! Also it's so busy it's easy for the waiters to get caught up, so the wait for food can sometimes be spendy, but if you have enough time it's definately worth it!
