Excellent tacos. I'm from CA and I've had many tacos in my lifetime so my expectations were high. These guys know what they're doing and they're really friendly. Not the best tacos I've ever had in my life (their sauce is holding them back, I've had MUCH MUCH better) but they're pretty good and I'm glad they're in Philly.
