Hi. I appreciate that it hasn't changed the slightest bit since I first went 10 years ago. Â  Same staff, same food, same cool-lookin' menu hanging from ceiling. Food may have even IMPROVED. I dunno. I like the bread they roll their sandwiches in. Pretty individual. Wonder if they make it themselves. Thin but doesn't fall apart.
