I went for brunch on a Saturday and despite the lines outside walked right in and was given a seat - probably because I was dining alone and it was easier to seat one person rather than 4 or 5 people at 1030am. Or they just felt sorry for me! The service was fantastic and the staff were genuinely friendly - instead of just when it's time to tip them. I ordered the signature dish - Benedict Jane - which unfortunately came before the coffee did, which made me think that it was pre-cooked as the crawfish cakes were not hot and even a bit soggy. That said I will give them another go because the service was good and the atmosphere great - even if the music was a bit too loud and rock-like for that hour.
