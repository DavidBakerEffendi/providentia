Its rare that I am so impressed with an establishment given my somewhat captious demeanor when it comes to food/wine/hospitality. My nitpicking is due in part to my work experience in high-end and Michelin Star rated restaurants, so the standard has been set pretty high (occupational hazard). Still, I find no areas to critique when reviewing my dining experience at PT. This weekend was no different when I had a casual, comfortable and delicious dinner solo at the bar - a moment that has become a weekly habit. Whether you're enjoying a proper dinner or stepping in for a quick bite/glass of wine at the bar, the service is unwaveringly on the mark, friendly and respectful, even during their busiest moments. It is clear that the staff genuinely wants you to enjoy your experience to the max and will do their best to accommodate you. In regards to the food - Before I had been to PT, I never experienced Italian food in NYC that rivaled that of my Italian grandmother's. The food is exquisite and clearly made with love. I recommend the Salmon Special, Gnocchi Gorgonzola, Steak Special, Lobster Special, Bread Pudding, Chocolate Mousse and Calamari Appetizer, to name a few. If I had the time I'd go on. The wine list is extensive enough but not overwhelming and the selection is well rounded. Staff is knowledgeable about the wine in addition to the food. Get there soon before the entire city gets there before you. Its about to happen.
