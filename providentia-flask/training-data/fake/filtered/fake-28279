Great food find in LIC. Wait staff was friendly, quick and helpful. Resto is a block from the 7 train stop along Vernon Blvd. Â  The guacamole was fresh and really delicious. Sis and I both enjoyed our main course orders of chicken enchiladas and mole de piaxtla. It was our first time to try tamarind margaritas which I have to say was different but quite good too.
