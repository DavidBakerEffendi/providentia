Went here for a post theater meal and it was so good!!! My friend and I both had a spinach risotto with scallops and the taste was amazing, it really was one of the best things i had all holiday. The staff were friendly, we went quite late on a monday night and it was basically empty yet somehow the atmosphere was still cozy. They had a lot of gluton free options if you need them, i would really recommend this if you want some great italian!
