Mehek is amazing. Great service and friendly staff, food to die for and not all too pricey, and an intimate feel. It's in a great location, near Princeton's campus but just far enough to see the sights of Nassau Street on your way. If you're looking for high quality Indian food, go here and have the Tikka Masala and Garlic Naan.
