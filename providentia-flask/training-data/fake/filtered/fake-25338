This is the best Chinese buffet in VT.  They are rated the best buffet in Yankee magazine!  I tried them out, and i am so happy i did.  food is fresh and hot, tasty!  they have the best chicken dishes there.  I love their peiken chicken.  if you want to eat more seafood, than go for dinner, i also love their fresh calamari, (not breaded).  waitresses are nice, atmophere is cozy.  I would recommend this place to everyone!
