We went for restaurant week. The menu looked good, but unfortunately the food was not. The fried risotto balls with smoked cheddar tasted like the oil was almost rancid. The grilled chicken was dry and tasteless. The carrots along side the dish were so hard you couldn't cut them with a knife, and they were cooked! The beef short ribs had a weird tasting sauce. And the desserts were bad too! Very disappointing. We will not go there again.
