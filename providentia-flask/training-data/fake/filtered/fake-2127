this is the worst thing i have ever eaten in my life ever. chicken taste like rotton tuna, when cook was confronted said it was made yesterday. like i have never eatin chicken before, didnt offer to replace or wave the bill. did i mention its was the worse thing i have ever ate? if i puked and put it on the plate it would be better
