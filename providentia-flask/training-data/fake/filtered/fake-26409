When we walked in, it was a warm night and there were lots of people sitting outside and lots of noise. I thought" big mistake"for our anniversary dinner!  The great thing about this restaurant is that it's really two spaces.  If you go, make sure to ask for a table inside in the back part, because there it really feels like a place on Boulevard St, Germain,  The service was great, even by a new young waitress, and the food was delicious.  Great place to celebrate and have a really good meal at fairly reasonable prices--positively not low cost, but not out of this world either.
