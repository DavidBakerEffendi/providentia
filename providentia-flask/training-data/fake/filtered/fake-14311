I went here with my Girlfriend on a Saturday night, we were told 1 hour 20 minute wait. I enjoy getting a drink or 2 at the bar on a Friday or Saturday night when I go out to eat I don't like being rushed in and out, if you don't like waiting then either go during the week or real early or just go to Mcdonald's. So we sat at the bar and got the $26 pitcher of Sangria which was worth the $. The staff was good- the bartenders were very personable, nice guys and the host kept updating us on when our table would be ready- and it felt shorter than we were originally told- probably like 45 minutes. While at the bar we got chips with homemade guacamole to pick on while waiting and they were really good. We sat and ordered wings (alas y piernas de pollo) and some chicken skewers(pollo y mango)- it wasn't a lot of food but it wasn't too much, we weren't too full to eat our meal and both appetizers were very good as well. I ate the steak (bistek cubano) and it was great, I don't usually eat plantains but they were good too. We left feeling full but not bloated and almost sick, it was the perfect amount of food. If you are cheap, don't go here you will spend money but it's worth it. All around this was a GREAT experience and it instantly became one of our favorite restaurants.
