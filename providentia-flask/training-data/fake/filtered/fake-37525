My fiancé and went to Diamonds last night for her birthday.  The entire experience was horrific.  We were subjected to an hour and a half wait, while the place was not remotely close to being crowded.  One of the more frustrating parts of the night was how inept our waitress was. We placed our order at 6:45, and did not recieve our drinks  until 7:30. What compounded this was the fact that 3 tables that were seated after us were finishing their meals as our food was just coming out.  When I questioned the waitress as to how this was possible, she proceeded to just smirk at me and walk away with no response.  The food was mediocre at best. We dine regularly in the area and this food was not on par other places.  They quality of food does not justify the price by any means.  It pains me to have to write a negative review, just as it pains me that my fiancé's birthday dinner was so abysmal.  Personally, I will never go back. There is a serious lack of professionalism, and it resonates throughout the entire establishment. Do yourself a favor and eat at restaurant that actually values its costumers.
