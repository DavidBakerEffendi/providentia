I have been coming to this place for years. The review about the "plate of orange slices" is absurd, as the fruit plate is something that comes out to each table after dinner. yes, it is COMPLIMENTARY. also, this place is BYOB- big savings there. I absolutely love the food and service. The waiter, Al, is very knowledgable and helpful., the food is always fresh, the staff is always willing to help. There isnt much to complain about this place, except that you may face a wait if you don't make a reservation on a saturday night. Make sure to ask for the secret dessert items that are not listed on the menu! BEST cannolis and tiramisu!!
