I am from out of town and just stopped in Material Culture to shop that wonderful store and saw this very clean, quaint eatery so decided to give it a try.  The super rich dark hot chocolate was to die for!!!  And I had the mushroom and goat cheese panini which was definitely a culinary delight!  Absolutely delicious food, excellent service and very pleasant personnel.  Will definitely return there when I am up in this area.  Hey Baba Olga's....Ever think of moving to Milford??  Hummmm?
