Saturday nights are a very busy night, which we understand.  We put our name down and was told it may be a 30 minute wait and for us to come every 15 minutes to check.   So many people waited by the stairs, there were no room for the three of us so, we decided to go outside and come back to check.   Every 15 minutes, one of us would go and check.   When it was my turn, the  manager told me to move it.  I told him I was just checking, he was very nasty and said out loud "in and out"   I told him, I know it's busy but he didn't have to be so rude.  I just want to know if our name were called.  He said, " if you don't like it, just go, you don't have to stay!"   I was shocked.  How could he say that to a customer or to anyone.  He needs better training.   I was very, very upset and wanted to leave and because, it was our sister's birthday and we already waited more then 45 minutes... I didn't want to let this one jerk ruin our night.   I will never go back there.  Just because business is very good, they should never be rude to customers.  They should be happy they are busy. This kind of attitude tells me that they really don't care. What comes around goes around.  One day they may be begging for customers and by then ... it's too late.   By the way, their portions are getting smaller.
