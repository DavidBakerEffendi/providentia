This place has to be the absolute worst buffet I have ever been to. First of all the place is not very clean, I made the mistake of staying after walking in. I was told the food was great and it was absolutely disgusting. Everything was cold and tasteless. The crab legs were small, definitely not King Crab, and the rest of the seafood just didn't look good. The only food that was basically safe was the soups, the grilled food and the ice cream, even the white rice was gross. I would NEVER EVER recommend this place to anyone. Take my word for it!
