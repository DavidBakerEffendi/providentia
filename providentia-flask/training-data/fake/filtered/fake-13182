We went there on a Saturday afternoon for lunch. The dining room was not crowded but we waited for what seemed for a long time for menus and server to appear. We ordered appetizers and waited again. Finally when they appeared the server said there was no charge because we waited so long. OK, now for Â the main course which was the lunch special...we waited for over 45minutes and when we asked the server for our check he went to the kitchen and came back and said we could just go no charge. Well, we still do not know where our lunches were. NO EXPLAINATION.
