I couldn't agree more with all the positive reviews I read before dining here yesterday. I'm not familiar with the area as I'm from Monmouth County & was meeting my sister who's from Bergen.  We wanted a location in the middle.  This is such a gem & we hope to be returning often. The restaurant is lovely, cozy and comfortable and had a very acceptable noise level.  The food is fresh and cooked to perfection.  I had Tilapia Oreganta which was delicious, beautifully prepared and served.  My sister had Chicken Francesca over brightly colored, crisp greens with cherry tomatoes.  Both our entrees where served with a side of linguine which neither of us thought we'd have room for but was too good not to eat.  We also had a delicious Cabernet that our server suggested with our meal.  We  ended our meal with  expresso and a tartufo...all fantastic.  The service was excellent from both our waitress and Matthew.  I highly recommend it & can't wait to return.
