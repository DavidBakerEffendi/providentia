Okay! Really.... this restaurant is amazingly awesome. ....though its of route 1 and can be missed easily which would be unfortunate for you....because there are few things in this world which are not worth missing...and this definitely is one of them. ... walk in to the warm welcome from the very polite staff.... you will feel like ur at home. ...menu is amazing. ..its got everything you could wish for....if not. .jus ask and they might even make it for you. ......I am fond of spicy food and they hit the spot every time....the food is so tasty and every dish has its own taste unlike all other Indian restaurants....where they put samee masala in every dish.....Neways the more I talk about Ispice....the more I want to go there and eat the tasty food..so that's what I'm about to do. ...u should too....You will Love it and become a fan of Ispice just Like ur Iphone...though it isn't Apple.....
