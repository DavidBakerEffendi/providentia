I had the worst octopus appetizer at Scarpetta  last night.  Had the place not been chosen by dear friends who were treating us I would have sent it back.  The olive oil braised octopus was a mealy mushy mess - the chef should be embarrassed. I also had their signature tomato and basil spaghetti - which was ok but not worth going out of your way for.  The consistency of the sauce made me think of glorified spaghetti Os.   The staff was professional and attentive and the back dining room is nice enough - the huge skylight definitely adds something to the otherwise standard décor.
