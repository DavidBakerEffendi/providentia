Had a birthday dinner for one of my friends and I really wished I can like this place more. Everything about this place was very mediocre...First off, the music was way too loud in there. We had a reservation for a party of 9 and was placed on a big, round table...and we can barely hear each other and was practically screaming bc it was so darn loud in there. Secondly, the food was very mediocre...Ive had way better hummus and eggplant dishes at beyoglu. Nothing was really tasty or stood out in any way except for the brussel sprouts...
