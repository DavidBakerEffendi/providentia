Good for date night.  Great wine.  Truffle risotto was good as would anything with 70g of shaved truffles would be.   Commonly with fine dining, the atmosphere is overly-refined and the crowd is older.  Our truffle shaving expert was nice and chatted with us without making us feel as though he was putting on the song and dance.
