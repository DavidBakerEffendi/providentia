A friend and I had the top tier chef's tapas tasting menu ($65 each) and the second tier chefs wine tasting menu ($20).   I really wanted to love this place based both on recommendations from friends and the hype surrounding chef Jose Garces.  Maybe I set my expectations to high, but I was really disappointed.  For a place that prides itself on top notch food and wine (with a hefty price tag to match), Amada succeeds in kitchen execution but fails in final touches and flavor pairing.   The food looked gorgeous. The ingredients were fresh and top notch.  The meat/fish in every dish was cooked perfectly.  The hands in the kitchen obviously have skills.   The problem was that they ruined most dishes by finishing everything too liberally with either some type of oil or a rich sauce.  The meal started heavy and just got heavier as it progressed.  The excitement for our courses left to come was overshadowed by the fear that our stomachs couldn't handle the richness of it all.  I expect a good chef to better understand the balance between heavy and light... especially when you pay them good money to pair it on your behalf.  While each course had a stand out item, they didn't always fit together that well.  Our last course was 3 dishes which were all drowning in the same finishing oil?!?!  Any difference in flavor we could have experience there was completely lost.   The other downside (I admit that I might be a little too picky here) was that the wine wasn't served in the appropriate glassware.  They have a killer wine list, but It was all served in the same small/medium sized wine glass. Good wine benefits from the appropriate glass and I would also expect a good chef to emphasize this in the meal.  It's subtle, sure, but that subtly is what often takes food from average to amazing. I don't plan on returning.  It wasn't worth the expense.  If you go, I certainly wouldn't do a chef's selection.  You could probably have a decent meal if you choose each item yourself.
