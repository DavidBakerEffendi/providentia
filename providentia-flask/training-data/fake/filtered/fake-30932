I made an online order for a delivery from Sushi Lounge in Totowa. After I placed my order, I received a prompt phone call confirming my order and letting me know it would take about 40 minutes to arrive. Keep in mind I live 5 minutes away. 2 hours later (no joking... 2 hours) the delivery man shows up. As soon as I take my food he then holds his hand out... and he keeps it there! Really? He knows I paid online because it says so right on the reciept stapled to my delivery bag so I know he's not holding his hand out for a grand total. Now I had every intention of tipping him even after a two hour wait but the fact that not only is he demanding a tip, he's on his cell phone the whole time glancing out of the corner of his eyes at his hand then to me.... eeeew... what a disgusting jesture! I had to close my door on him because he just would not put that hand away. Unbelievable. That's not even the end of it. When I open my food I was shocked to see that it looks just like the sushi I could have bought from the Willowbrook Mall for half the price and half the time on a thursday night! The rolls were so small and on top of that out of the 2 rolls and 2 a la carte items I ordered, the egg sushi was the best thing I ate! I've never written a review before but I felt obligated to share this TERRIBLE first time experience with the world. I will NEVER order from them EVER again. Oh and another thing. They serve Bluefin Tuna. If you haven't done your research they are an extremely overfished tuna with their conservation status at Endangered and Critically Endangered depending upon the Atlantic or Southern Bluefin species, Pacific Blue Fin excluded but we aren't on the west coast, are we. Check out the "End of the Line" documentary or just wiki the Bluefin! It will have you thinking twice about spending $15 on that one Super Toro Roll.
