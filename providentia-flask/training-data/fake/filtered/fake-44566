When the Cat's away the mice will play...Chef Andrew Carmellini was not there and it showed from the service to the food. The server informed us we had to put all our order in at once and couldn't start with appetizers. When the dishes did arrive (on top of one another without proper pacing) the Steak Tar Tar was freezing cold and almost uncomfortable to eat. The Cotechino Sausage on Ciabatta bread was so greasy it's as if they forgot to drain the sausage after it was cooked. I will say the lamb meatball sliders were amazing as well as the roasted brussels sprouts. In fact, we like the brussels sprouts so much that we asked our busser for another order and experience dan uncomfortable moment when the server and cooks were admonishing the busser for taking the order. Apparently, they were all ready to go home. Our server closed out early and we didn't realize we were handed off to another server, whom happened to be quite pleasant. However, when it came to dessert it was an embarrassment. The Tiramisu was a scoop of vanilla ice cream with a wafer on top. There was no cake. Maybe it was 86'd along with most of the menu. I'm not sure why they served it. The Chocolate Bread pudding was like a burnt brownie with no pudding or bread. If you're out of desserts or one is not edible, then serve only what you have and is good. Â  I was hoping my Italian friends who were visiting and both "foodies" to have a New York experience at one of the celebrated restaurants. However, it was a very expensive disappointment and put a damper on the evening.
