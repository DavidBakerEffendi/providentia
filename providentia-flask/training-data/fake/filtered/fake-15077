DON'T GO!!! Going there was a horrible decision on my part. I was looking for a comfortable setting where I could eat on my own. The risotto was mediocore and the service and clenliness were horrific. The person who puts the silverware together plays with her hair, the "wrapped" silverware is then placed on the counter where the waitresses lean over to touch everything with their clothes. The "cook" talks on his cell phone then "prepares" food. The manager was indifferent to everything because he is busy sampling the wine. My impression is they know the place is closing and no longer care. One waiter who tries no one else cares.
