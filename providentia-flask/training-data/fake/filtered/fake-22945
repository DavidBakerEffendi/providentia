What a place!  The absolute BEST CARROT CAKE I ever had in my life.  Moist, not too sweet.  A delight.  So elegant, warm and comfy.  The Coffee House we've all been waiting for!  Lovely, great service, great owner.  6 inch deep Quiches, Apple Pies and Peach Cobblers.  Never seen desserts like them.  Big spacious windows looking out on the Avenue, comfy sofas.  Wow.
