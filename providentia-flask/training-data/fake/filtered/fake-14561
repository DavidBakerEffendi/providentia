Always liked the place,  Went on Thursday May 31st, looking forward to a nice lunch with my wife.  While viewing the menu I tried to chat with my wife and we could hardly hear anything, the music was very loud and the choice was not something I could enjoy over lunch.  There weren't many people there,  we got up and walked out.  Who ever is in charge of choosing the music and volume may want to choose something more pleasant to dine over.   Won't go back for a while.
