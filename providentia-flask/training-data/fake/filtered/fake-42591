The food is very good but stay away from the specials. Unlike many restaurants where the specials are a few dollars more than the standard entrees, this place gouges you another $10 or more and of course they never mention the price when describing the dish.  Also, they take the cork from your wine bottle.  My guess is that if you have a half bottle left most people might not want to ask for the cork back and so leave the wine.  No wonder so many dishes are made with wine -- with your leftover bottle!!
