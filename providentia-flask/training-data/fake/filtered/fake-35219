Mediocre--lots of hype. I read quite a few reviews and decided to try Roberta's. I ordered the "Famous Original".  First, the ingriedients are NOT certified organic, and not certain. Secondly, the pizza is like papa john style (small triangles) and not NY style pizza. Mine was priced at $13 (which is outrageous if you consider what you're getting and what you're paying for), and each additional topping ranged from $1-$4, which is incredible.  The taste was OK.  I will not be going back. There are far too many pizza options to settle for this over priced hype. I am happy to pay the extra cost for organic ingredients and to support local venues, this one can do  A LOT better.
