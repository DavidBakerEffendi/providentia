The pizza is awesome.  Even my Bergen County friends agree.  I love the chicken parm also, but I could seriously make a meal out of just the antipasto--it's excellent!  Prices are great, too. The owner, Tony, is a great guy and everyone who works there is super nice.  I won't order pizza/Italian from any other place in town.
