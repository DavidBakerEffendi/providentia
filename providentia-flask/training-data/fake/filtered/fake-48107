Had the most difficult time with our reservations for July 10, 2013. Made a reservation for 7 pm for 5 people a month prior. Had to change the time to 8:15 still on July 10, 2013. Called back the next day to make the change and they told me they did not have my reservation. Made the reservation again for July 10, 2013 for 8:15. Called back on July 9th to confirm and was told I did not have a reservation. Spoke to a person called Louie, who told me all the managers were in a meeting and he would or he would have some one call me back. Never received a return call. We went to Beauty and Essex and had a wonderul birthday meal for my daughter and son-in-law. If you don't want to give me a reservation just say you are full. Don't take my information and leave me empty.I will never try to make a reservation there again.
