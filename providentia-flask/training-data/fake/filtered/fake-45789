I don't know what the hype is about. I've been to Max Fish twice. Once when it opened (I remember it being OK, but overpriced) and tonight. Tonight I ordered the market special cod. It came with spring onion risotto and asparagus. There was ONE stalk of asparagus cut up; the risotto was tasteless and the cod was overcooked and barely seasoned. My dish had NO FLAVOR! My father ordered the lobster roll with a toasted, buttered bun. The bun was soggy and he said his lobster was watery. His girlfriend ordered the lobster cobb salad. She said the lobster was previously frozen but the salad was decent, mainly because of the avocado. They also shared fried calamari which they enjoyed. My husband ordered fish and chips which he liked and the mixed drinks were good. I would not recommend this place to anyone. We ate at the Max next door just last week and would much rather go there. For a fish house, I am still in shock that the chefs are so unimaginative and don't know how to cook or season fish properly. I guess if you're going for the raw bar and wine, then its the place to be.
