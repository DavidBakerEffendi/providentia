I'm constantly accused of being a food snob so I thought I would send in a food stunt double in to try this restaurant as my first experience was lets just say "meh". The stunt double concurred that the spot is adorable - clean and then we got to the service. Mediocre at best - slow and steady wins the race only if your a turtle. My buddy and I purchase organic foods for our family so we understand and can appreciate having to charge a little more but $7 for an empanada is ridiculous. Keep the micro greens if that will save us a few bucks. Maybe it is true - clean, healthy, organic food is only for the 1%. Considering what the rent must be on Walnut Street I think food equality is compromised and this place is only for those that can truly afford a $25. lunch.
