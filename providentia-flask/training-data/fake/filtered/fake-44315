I love El Vez! And Liz, my favorite server ever who really goes out of her way to take care of her customers. Thanks Liz! El Vez is a trendy looking spot that gets really crowded Thurs-Sat. and hard to get into without a reservation around these times too, so plan accordingly. My personal favorites are beef tacos (tender and delicious), salsa mexicana, the original guac and the churros! Apparently the margaritas are delicious but a little pricey, so be prepared to dish out money if you're going to drink. They do have pitchers of margaritas though. Either way, I really love El Vez, probably one of my favorite spots in the city. Just get a reservation, try not to get seated near the bar if you're just there to eat (you get crowded and bumped a lot by the happy hour crowd who are too tipsy to care), and make sure you have some cash if you're going to be drinking.
