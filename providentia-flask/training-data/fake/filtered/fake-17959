Had dinner last Sat night and the place was packed like sardines.  My first impression was that it didn't feel very sanitary but I don't expect any sort of spic and span atmosphere in any establishment in Chinatown.  But I was willing to overlook it b/c my fellow diners had said their salted squid was good.  And indeed it was, it rivaled the ones in other similar dives in NYC Chinatown.  Also enjoyed their garlic eggplant in hotpot.  I could've eaten that whole bowl myself.  The other dish worth mentioning was their shrimp with spicy black bean sauce.  Although the sauce itself was a bit slimy (perhaps too much corn starch) and I do love anything with black beans, their shrimp was jumbo.  This was a pleasant surprise b/c I loathe when restaurants try to skimp on shrimp and serve the really, well, shrimpy sized kind.  No pun intended. The idea of one cockroach spotted by other people is enough for me to only get take out from now on and not have sit down service.  Shudder.
