Me and my husband have been to zinc many times and have always had a good experience there. After you order they bring out complimentary bite sized pieces of bread with a  pepper corn type of dipping sauce. I would eat here for this bread alone. The menu seems to change seasonally but some iteams are always avaliable. The duck nachoes are a must try appetizer.   We always share the organic greens salad. Its big enough for 2 people and the staff usually offers to spilt it up before bringing it out to us. I was dissapointed to see that they subsitued the pine seeds for pumpkin seeds though... Probably a sign of the times seeing that pine seeds are more expensive. Its hard for me to go there without ordering the Vietnamese chicken. But ive also tried the hanger steak which was pretty good. My husband enjoys the tuna dish. They also have a good variety of cheeses. Cheese plates come with tasty bread and fruits(which seem to change seasonally as well) We love the purple haze goat cheese. Always get it because its hard to find in stores. Never room for desert but they do bring out bite sized treats with the check. Service is always good but best when you get one of the older servers who have been there for a while.
