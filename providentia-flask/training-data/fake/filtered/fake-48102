Their food is excellent. I got the pork + rice/beans/plantains a couple times and it was solid. I most of all enjoy just the rice/beans/plantains for less than $5, it's huge. While I worked in the DUMBO area I made a solid lunch of that once a week. Very nice fellas who work there, too. FYI: it's very casual inside.
