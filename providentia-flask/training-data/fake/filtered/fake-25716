This place is great for lunch ,specially ,if you are in the area stuck into a Jury duty journey. Nothing can be more relaxing ,the great service  and great foods,make you forget why you came dowton ,at the first place. Try the duck(cold )which was cook the right way , .and the short ribs with rice buns are divine . The sushi are super fresh  and well balance. I can 't wait to be call for jury duty again(just kidding!) and take the time to enjoy a great lunch! And next time, I will bring the all Jury with me and we will deliberate at the big familly table at Zutto Bravo Zutto
