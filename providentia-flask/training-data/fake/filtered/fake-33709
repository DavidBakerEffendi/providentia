Always a wait, so come about an hour before you think you'll get hungry. But in the meantime you can snack on chips and salsa and margaritas so the time goes quickly. But don't eat too many chips! The entree portions are sizable so you need to leave room. When you're seated the waiters are pretty slow but the food is worth the wait. Pretty cheap for the portions. Fajitas are delicious and the cajun options are nice for a change.
