I don't know what restaurant most of these people are reviewing, but for being a new restaurant in a very competitive downtown area, this place was HORRIBLE....Very limited menu, inexperienced bartenders, $10 for a marguerite that was 70% ice cubes, and too sweet. We had the quesadillas..they were soggy, and the portion was ridiculously small..I was 1/2 way done w/ my meal before the side of guacamole came, and that was $10...The waiter handed me a hot plate that I almost dropped on the table. This place probably won't last long...Geronimos isn't 100% either, but alot better than this place.
