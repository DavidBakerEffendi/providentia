Very good restaurant. They've been there for a long time and definitely know what they're doing. Just like the guy below said they have fantastic pizza, def the best in mercer. Their food is very good and most of its family owned and a family member is always there and they are all very welcoming and extremely friendly. They have a huge draft beer selection, excellent martinis, big bar, and a bunch of Tv's. Oh and they also have good bar food and bar pies :) Def recommend this place.
