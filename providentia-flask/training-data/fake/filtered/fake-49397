We celebrated a graduation, a long hard year of studying an no socializing.  We had reservations, a table of 9, 3 pitchers of margaritas, appetizers, entrees, etc.  Food was excellent, service was great.  A mishap brought several servers to immediate assistance.  However at the end, one present given to the graduate included a cake to end our fine dinner.  The restaurant policy is to charge $4 per person!   That would have been $36 for us to enjoy a cake that someone had bought with the idea to share it with us.  I can understand a nominal fee for dishwashing etc.....but $4??? Certainly left all of us with a bad taste in our mouth.  No one wanted dessert after that news.
