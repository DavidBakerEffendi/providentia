I recently went here for my boyfriend's bday with a large group of friends. Â We are big fans of Little Frankies, their sister restaurant, so had high expectations and Supper didn't disappoint. The food and service was exceptional and the prices can't be beat!!! We will definitely be coming back to Supper again!!!
