I love this place! I spend most of time in the mornings over the weekends watching my Liverpool FC. Their breakfasts are fantastic and love the decor. I haven't had a breakfast plate I didn't like. My three faves are the Irish Breakfast, Hangover Helper, and Garbage Plate., with a Guinness and you are set. Haven't spend much time with the lunch menu since most of the Irish Pubs serve up your classic American dishes which are good as well. But lunches are a dime a dozen on these places. I highly recommend Anna Liffey's in the morning on Saturday/Sunday (especially when the rivalries are playing each other) if you want the full experience.
