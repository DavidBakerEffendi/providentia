Great wait and bar staff with tremendous sanduiche and very good daily specials. Karaoke nights on Thursday and Sunday! They also have Dj playing house music Friday and Saturday, It's like Cheers for Inwood and as they'd say in Ireland, there's always good craic (great times) to be had. The best bar in Newark. And I can not forget to mention the Sangria and the Passion Fruit Caipirinha, just Wonderful!
