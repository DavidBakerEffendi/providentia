Charcoal BYOB has been on my list for a while, and it met every expectation. We enjoyed delicious, skillfully-prepared and innovative dishes using the best ingredients. Almost everything is made in-house, including the bread, pasta and desserts. My husband and I ordered two small plates each and shared everything, then were too stuffed for dessert. The chefs kindly sent out two donuts in celebration of our anniversary - we managed to savor one and save the other for the next morning. Truly wonderful food without the slightest bit of pretentiousness that often comes with that caliber of cooking. We can't wait to go back. The staff members were kind and professional, and our server was able to answer every question we had about the menu. The atmosphere is clean and spare, not intimate but relaxed and casual, with a lovely view of the Delaware - we hope to go back with a small group of friends next time. It's a joy to have this restaurant nearby.
