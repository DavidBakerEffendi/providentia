Really good quality food at a reasonable price.  the owners or people that work there have always been nice to me. Me gusta mucho the black bean paste.  The burritos are large and in charge. Someone wrote about being disappointed there is no shredded cheese, guac, and sour cream on the burritos but that's bc it's not tex mex, just mex.  Actually, I don't even know if they eat burritos in Mexico but everything else is legit.  The tortillas are the corn kind and they come warm and are goooood! Sometimes you get free nachos, sometimes you get free chips, sometimes nothing. When they say 'vegetable' anything, that means a kind of onion-ey mix.  It doesn't float my boat buy my vegetarian sister likes it.
