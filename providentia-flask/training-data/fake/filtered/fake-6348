We have eaten at Spasso several times and always enjoyed it. Recently we hosted a reunion of my Navy squadron and had a luncheon for 35 people at Spasso. We were based in Italy and every reunion centers around a traditional Italian feast. All attending agreed that this was our best meal ever. Food, service and ambiance couldn't have been better! Highly recommended for a regular meal or a special event.
