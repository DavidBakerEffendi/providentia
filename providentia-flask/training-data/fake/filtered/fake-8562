I really wanted to like this place. I've been here several times, and each time leave, wondering why I cam again. Maybe it's good real estate location, but I don't understand the wait for this place. Or, I don't understand the taste palette on the chef. Everything is oversalty. The Kale salad was more like salt with some Kale, and the ramen broth is overkill on salt. You don't taste the comfort of a meaty broth. The salt is on overkill at this restaurant. I would not be surprised if this restaurant runs on buckets of salt everyday. \
