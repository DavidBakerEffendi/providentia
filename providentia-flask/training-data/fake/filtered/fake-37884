Coming from a bigger city than Burlington, I was pretty accustomed to good, non-chain pizza. After a little exploration I found Marco's, and I'm super impressed by it. I ordered a Sicilian cheese to split with a few friends. For the same price as a chain's large, we had enough pizza for all of us with about 6 slices to spare. The pizza tasted great. The cheese tasted, well, as it should. The crust was cooked almost perfectly, and it came with a couple little rolls which were also pretty good. Everyone was pretty pleased. I'd order again.
