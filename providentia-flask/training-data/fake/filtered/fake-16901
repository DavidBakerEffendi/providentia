Wary after reading some reviews. Could not have had a better experience.  My son and I arrived half hour early.  Restaurant was buzzing.  But the staff was unflustered and courteous. We were shown to the bar, enjoyed some drinks, then sat at our table on time. The service was exceptional.  Friendly, timely, but not hovering.  The food lived up to the hype.  It was that good.  Recommend the squash toast and the suckling pig.  Crazy good.  Great great meal.  Exceptional experience. Will return.
