I've tried to order from here twice and both times their web app claimed they wouldn't deliver to me, even though I'm four blocks away (at 20th St & 1st Ave), and when I called they said they would deliver but it would be at least an hour. Hire some more delivery people! Or don't claim you do delivery.
