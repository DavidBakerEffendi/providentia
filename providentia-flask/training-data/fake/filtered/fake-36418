This deli is fantastic. The staff is super-nice & helpful. I'd say the mozzarella (made on-site of course) is the best mozzarella I've had in Manhattan and definitely holds up to the best mozzarella up at Arthur Avenue (Joe's deli). The olives are *delicious*, and the sandwiches are amazing. I didn't realize that it was the same folks as San Matteo, but now that I know that, I'll definitely be heading over there as well.
