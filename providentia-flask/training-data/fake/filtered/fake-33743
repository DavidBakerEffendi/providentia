If there is a better value for your restaurant $, I cannot think of it.  Food is excellent: warm chips, yummy gumbo, cheesy enchiladas and  the chimmichurrri steak.  Big soft drinks, good southwestern Texas/Louisiana music.   Willis' favorite restaurant. Same review for Fairfield location where it is easier to get a table.
