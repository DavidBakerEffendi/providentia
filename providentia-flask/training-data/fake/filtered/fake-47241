My husband and our daughter and her boyfriend just arrived home from Luca's.  I just want to say that our evening was so enjoyable.  The food and presentation were excellent.  I had the shrimp Nuevo which was absolutely out of this world.  My husband had the lobster cannelloni  which he loved and finished all of it.  Our daughter had the tilapia and her boyfriend had the veal saltimbocca.  Everyone loved what they had and finished everything except for me.  I get to eat the rest of my shrimp Nuevo tomorrow.  The atmosphere was really warm and cozy.  As the for staff, they were warm and friendly.  In particular was our waiter; his name was Zak.  We can't say enough about him.  He was so sweet and accommodating.  He was timely and efficient and mostly the reason we liked him was because he was so courteous and friendly.  He had a smile on his face every time he came to our table.  We asked for his schedule and it turns out that he works on Saturday nights which is the only night that we usually go out for dinner on.  We told him that we would be requesting his table area the next time we come and we will because dining out is only good as long as the food and service is good and he made our evening wonderful.  Thank you Zak!!!!   Stephanie
