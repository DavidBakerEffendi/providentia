If I can give this restaurant a rating of 10 stars I would! I absolutely enjoy the meals here every single time. I make it my business to try something new when I visit and I have no complaints. Everything tastes fresh, the ambiance is extremely comforting and friendly and the service is superb. Their fish tacos are the BEST I've had, the Shrimp Penne alla Vodka makes you waking up the next day wishing you can have it for breakfast and if that's not enough, their take out is as delicious as eating at the restaurant. Everything is delivered hot and fresh. OBVIOUSLY, I would recommend this restaurant :)
