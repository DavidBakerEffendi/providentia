We just had the worst brunch experience here. Sat right down & was given water and drinks quick enough, but the food service was terrible. The place was empty and yet we waited over a half an hour for two scrambled egg dishes. I would have complained if my waitress, who was too busy talking about an upcoming show she was doing there, would have dared to ask us how we were doing. Once the food was delivered it was Luke warm and mediocre at best. With only 5 breakfast dishes on the menu, you'd think they'd all be edible. I again would have complained if my waitress was at all interested in service. It's a shame. This place is terrible and you'd think that a place this far off the beaten path would do something to stand out other than provinding poor service. I'm not sure how it's received so many positive reviews.
