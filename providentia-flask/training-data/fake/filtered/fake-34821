Let me start by saying I NEVER complain in a review usually.  I had an event for 150 pp this past weekend at the Pond House.  When we met with the party coordinator before hand she knew the amount of people that were coming and had no problem with servicing that amount of people. First, the room was lovely, beautiful decorations, tons of space, and the bar was set up very nicely and flowed well. The food was delicious! But there was not NEARLY enough of it for 150 pp.  They had about 3 waiters serving the passed hors d'oeuvres, but there was usually only one or two butlers circling at any one time with about 10-15 canapes on their trays.  With the size room the party was in and the amount of people there should have been at least 4 butlers in the room at the same time serving the appetizers in order for everyone to have 1-2 apps each.  Many people did not get food, and the butlers did not often offer any to the older people sitting down rather than the younger people that were standing.   The appetizers didn't start to come out until 3:15-3:30 (party was 3-6), yet when the party was over they were rushing us out.  The buffet style food was out for about a 1/2 hour, in two small servers, and some people did not get any food again!  This was so embarrassing - the planner told me everything would be taken care of and I spent the night running around trying to get them to bring out more food.   All in all this was a VERY POOR experience, the Pond House Cafe should NOT be advertising that they can host 150 pp at an event if they cannot even serve enough food for those people.  This was embarrassing and prevented the party from going well.
