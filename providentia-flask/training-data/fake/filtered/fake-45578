don peppe is the best family style italian rest. in the nyc and surrounding areas, hands down!  the decor inside may be dated, they dont accept credit cards, and its location isnt the best, but if you want good italian food this is the place.  i challenge anyone who disputes this places food.  they wont kiss your ass when you come in but if you're a friendly, courteous diner(unlike many NYer's) the staff will treat you with great respect and help you decide what you might like.  if you are going out to lunch or dinner with the intention of eating great food and being a fatso like me, then go here.  you wont be disappointed!
