My boyfriend and I love it here, so do my gal friends...drinks are great and food is delicious and authentic.  Love the outdoor seating and service was exceptional.  Other times, we sit at the bar and have drinks and sometimes have dinner as well. Food is always tasty and staff are super nice.  Bartender has even given us complimentary shots.  We will continue to come in for their drink, food and overall service!
