I've come here in the past and absolutely loved it. Great atmosphere and wonderful food. The last time I dined here, the service was so awful!!!! We were seated late on a Saturday night as it was still packed. After about 35 minutes the majority of guest began to leave. Instead of making us feel comfortable, all of the workers started frantically cleaning the entire inside and outside including unhooking the plants from our table. Some of them were drinking coffee, smoking and overall hanging outside just waiting for us to finish. We were not offered coffee or desert. When it started to slightly rain I asked if they could open awning again, they suggested I finish my meal at the bar. When we looked inside, all of chairs were on the tables. We complained to our server in a very gracious manner and she said "it's not my fault"! I am posting because I thought the owner would like to know and because I would like I warn everyone, get there early!!!!
