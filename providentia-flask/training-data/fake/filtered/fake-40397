It's hard giving Song only 4 stars because I love the prices and the food so much, but there are a few drawbacks so I'll get those out of the way.  The wait staff is not always the friendliest, it's cash only, there's usually a long wait for weekend dinner and the pad Thai is not as good as other Thai restaurants in the slope.  Otherwise, I love Song. Song is a little hard to find if you have never been there because there is no real invasive sign out front, but when you do find it, it's worth every little penny.  The food is super inexpensive and you get a ton for the price.  Quick table service, but it's cash only, so be prepared.   I recommend getting it for delivery if you are within the area.  You get so much food.  For $20 you can get 2 huge curry dishes, rice, and 2 spring rolls.  It ended up being 5 full meals! Try the Kang Pak for a spicy vegetable dish.  The eggplant is killer!  and I always get the Tofu Masaman because their peanut sauce is just perfection.
