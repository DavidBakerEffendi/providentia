Good food, great service and the portions are HUGE - I order dishes with the next day's meal in mind, because I know I will have leftovers - it's like getting two meals for the price of one.  The capaccino's are the best, and it's incredibly hard not to have dessert when you walk by the case of biscottis, cakes and gelato.  Be prepared to go home full and happy!
