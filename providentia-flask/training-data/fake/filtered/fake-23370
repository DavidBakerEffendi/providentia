This place is BAD! In one single meal, these things happened: -The bottle of wine had gone bad and had to be sent back -- the ONLY time I ever had to do that. -My pizza was "dropped" and the replacement pizza came out 20 min. later with no explanation until I asked. -The table was unclean with walnuts and oil on it until we asked for it to be cleaned and then it took 15 min. to make it happen, and when the waiter finally cleaned it, he sprayed Windex on someone at our table and in her water. Every time the waiter did these sorts of things, he'd say, "It happens, you know?" ... Â No, these things don't need to happen! Granted the pizza was decent, but the appetizer was so-so and the wine was tannic to the point of tasting like jug wine at a bad gallery opening. Avoid Avoid Avoid!
