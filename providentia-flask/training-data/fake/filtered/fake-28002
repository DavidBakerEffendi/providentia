We held a repast at Fitzgeralds 1928 after a family funeral.  The space and atmosphere worked really well and the guests truly enjoyed the food selection.  The flexibility with the buffet menu and the uniqueness of the food offered really made the difference in our planning.  The food itself was outstanding!  We received many compliments about the restaurant and food.   It was a great end to the celebration of our beautiful sister.  We look forward to returning to the restaurant for dinner one night.
