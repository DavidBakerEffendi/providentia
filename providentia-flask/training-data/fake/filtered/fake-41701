I don't know what went wrong. I have been going to this establishment since 2010/2011, and it has always been a favorite of mine. In fact, I drive about 35 minutes each time I indulge in a meal there. The food always used to take long, but I never cared because it was worth waiting for. I brought introduced so many different friends to their food. Today, however, I was very disappointed. The food has become in edible, the servers are inattentive and do not pay attention to any special requests. We were there for almost 40 minutes, and not once did anyone come check on us during our meal. The one waitress was dropping prescription pill bottles out of her apron (on a previous visit). I am so confused. What happened? You used to be great. My dog wouldn't even eat your potatoes that's how burnt they were. I'm so sad that I have to look for another place to call "my breakfast joint"
