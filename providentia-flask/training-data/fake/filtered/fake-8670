People are mean and have too much to say. You either like this place or don't. Prices are fine. If you go before 7pm mon-fri its happy hour, so you get a dollar off every taco you order and beer is $3! Nachos? Stfu! They are amazing! Margaritas?! Amazing!? Oh and hey! Its a bar so you can't take them to go so people stop doing it. And yes there may be "hipsters" eating here a lot but let's face the facts, it doesn't matter who eats where. All that matters is that the fried shrimp taco is omgosh amazing! And if you are allergic to anything you should always ALWAYS tell the people while you are ordering not after so that they can accommodate your needs. Just like you would anywhere else you might eat. Yo shout out to the girl who had blue hair, because she always knew to switch up my tortillas after the 80th time or so of giving her my same order everyday. Now! It may take long sometimes for my order to come out but if you look with your EYES you can see that there is only one grill in this place and one fryer. So! I'm going to assume if there are at least 10 orders placed before my own that I will have to wait a little. But then again I have common sense. Anyway! Awesome place! :)
