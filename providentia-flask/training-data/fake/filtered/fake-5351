On Saturday, May 3, 2014, I had the amazing experience of having a true Southern experience at Mama Mary's Soul on Whalley in New Haven. The staff was pleasant, the decor and atmosphere was inviting , but then came my cornbread. Now I was at grandma table.  The cornbread was like none other, delictable. My smothered pork chops, yams and collards were cooked to perfection. The one complaint the I have was that I was full before I finished half of my plate. As full as I may have been, I was determined the have a slice of sweet potato pie. Of course I had to taste it before I left,  it was heavenly. I knew it was going to go great with my coffee that evening. The total experience was truly worth the trip. I would encourage anyone, try it for yourself. You will be a believer, just like me. Can't wait for my next trip!!!
