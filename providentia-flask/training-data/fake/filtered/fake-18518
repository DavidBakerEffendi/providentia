What a great Surprise!   a rain delay prompted an hour with a pint at this lovely old bar just a block away from the Intrepid, on Eleventh Avenue better known for strip clubs than Irish pubs.   (with an impressive array of Scotch)   Original tile floors, a tin ceiling, and wood paneling, too. There are a few sturdy wooden tables by the windows up front and the food looked really good from what I saw.  In back there's a  classy dining room with exposed brick, white tablecloths and candlelight.  I would definitely make the trip to come here again.
