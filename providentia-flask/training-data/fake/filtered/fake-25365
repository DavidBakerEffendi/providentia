I about a year ago I would have given this place a full 5 stars.  (cramped space and all)  Today, only 2.  I've been going to Habana for years and have always had a great time.  The atmosphere is cool, the food is great and the wait staff WAS awesome.  Laid back and attentive.   Lately I don't get that.  The past several times that I have gone in this year I found the hostesses and waitresses to be inattentive, and rude.  A few weeks ago I actually had a waitress step up to me (literally) and get in my face about her tip!!! (ironically, the tip was a mistake but b/c she showed her ass, we didn't rectify it!!)   Needless to say, I went back to speak to the hostess and she was of no help.  I explained to her that her waitress was rude and out of line.  She asked me about the service, I told her it was mediocre and she proceeded to make excuses for the waitress and be extremely condescending. I was furious and told her about herself and walked out. (breathe)  So, I recommend that you go to the one in Brooklyn.  You get the great food, and a wonderful Brooklyn atmosphere and way better service!!!!!!
