The Spanish breakfast is delicious  eggs, yuca, mangu, arepas and pickles onions is my favorite!! They also have a PREFIX TAPAS MENU FOR TWO! Every Thursday start with 2 glasses of wine, Manchego cheese and bread, soup or salad, 4 tapas from the tapas menu, coffe and dessert only $ 70 per couple I was very satisfied the food was the best tapas I ever had, service was really good and what we payed was more then worth it.  Very happy to have MANJARES in our neighborhood!
