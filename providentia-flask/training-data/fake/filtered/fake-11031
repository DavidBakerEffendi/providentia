A great restaurant in lower Manhattan! Their Mediterranean seafood salad (with olive oil) was divine. Calamari, shrimp, scallops boiled, lightly salted, and dressed in olive oil. Amazing. A must try. Their grilled sea bass was also great. The only drawback is that the restaurant is noisy. The noise level made it very difficult to talk across the table. It gets very crowded too, more like a mix of a busy bar and dining area. Food is good though. Service was not prompt but OK.
