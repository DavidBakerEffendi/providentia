There are a lot of people who have an answer for everything and those answers most likely aren't true. Not Scott. Scott is an expert in all things pizza as part of this fun hobby that he's turned into a great business. We learned a ton, ate awesome pizza and had a guide who knows his craft and loves what he does. We couldn't have asked for more. Our tour today was fantastic, and the next time we're in NYC, we will absolutely book another.
