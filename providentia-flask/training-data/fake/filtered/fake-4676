A colleague and I had an opportunity to eat at Rouge while on a business trip to Philadelphia.  He had the swordfish while I had the crispy striped bass which had an excellent glaze garnished with sweet grapes (yeah...grapes with bass - who knew?).  We arrived at 6PM and had great seats outside where the view of Rittenhouse Square was complemented by a cool breeze...we sat there for 2 1/2 hours and found it difficult to leave.  My colleague had the "My Blackberry" martini and was offered a sample of an upcoming drink they were inventing.  Would definitely return to Rouge and suggest it to anyone looking for a great view, top notch service and spectacular drinks.
