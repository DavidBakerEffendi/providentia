I've been to the Gander four times this summer for business lunches and have been wanting to take my wife here ever since. I guess that about sums it up. I'm confident that my wife--an excellent cook in her own right, with the highest standards, and someone more often that not disappointed with nyc restaurants--will love it as much as I do. The Gander is my go-to restaurant of the moment and not because it's right across the street from my office. (Okay maybe that's a small part of the reason.) From the moment the warm fluffy rolls hit the table to the yogurt Panna Cotta, everything was made with relentless attention to detail and tasted that way. After tasting and devouring all three of the warm rolls, one ecstatic lunch companion grabbed the waiter and asked, "are these yeast rolls," and when the waiter responded affirmatively, said, "I haven't had these since I was a kid in the South." He then went on to request more. I've had the salmon once (pristinely fresh and perfectly rendered) and the spaghetti and clams the next three times. I should also not fail to mention an appetizer of heirloom tomatoes and Burrata, the most delicious tomatoes of the summer, with just the perfect amount of extra virgin olive oil. One last thing. When was the last time any restaurant substituted a dessert on a prix fix menu. One lunch my companions asked for fruit. They got it. And a generous amount at that. More expensive for the restaurant. But they aim to please. And do.
