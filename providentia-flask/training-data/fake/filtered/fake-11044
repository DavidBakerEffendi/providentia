I came by here a couple of weeks ago. My boss recommended it to me and said that I HAD to go here. Took my best friend and a couple of other friends for dinner and all I can say, it was AMAZING! We arrived late, but we called in earlier to let them know. They only accept reservations until 7 pm so for us to ask them to hold it for another 10 mins was already a stretch for them. They were very accommodating, and the whole experience was just warm. Loved every minute of it! Our favorites: Chicken skin Chicken hearts Duck with scallions kuruma ebi Maguro Zuke - tuna sashimi in garlic flavored soy sauce! YUM! Zucchini Tempura lamb chop harami asparagus bacon... OK OK....we LOVED everything! So anyone who is visiting or lives in NYC should go there! I'm so glad I found another excuse to come and visit New York, well aside from visiting my best friend of course! =)
