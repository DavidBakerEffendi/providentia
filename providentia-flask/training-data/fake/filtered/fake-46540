Food was terrible. Owner tried to scam me. After eating was told that I owe $23.10. Ok, no problem I give him my $15 off coupon and then he said the price was now $25.00 due to tax.... You didn't charge me tax originally? no response... repeated question. $24.00 after tax now. Bunch of scammers at this place.
