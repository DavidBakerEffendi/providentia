I came here about a month ago with two friends and I have to say that this is by far one of my fave bars in NYC.  Granted I am not from the area, but I need not look any further for the perfect spot to be.  It is so chill an atmosphere with the best music, a lovely intimate crowd, and amazing food.  Their sweet nutella crepes and savory brie paninis are beyond satisfying.  Oh yes, and our server was so sweet too.  She catered to us all night.  I will definitely be coming back when I visit NY again.
