Extremely disappointing! My sister loves this place and decided she would grab lunch from here. She orders a salad Â , me a chicken Parmesan . The lady on the phone sounded as if she just started working there , FORGOT to get my phone number , so I called back. Took over a hour to be delivered , The driver nearly snatched the money from my hand and my pasta was ice cold! When I call to see if I can get a WARM pasta dish , I was put on hold for 20 mins , 20 mins!! Finally when the lady answers again she tells me she can not give me the pasta and can not call the owner because he "gets annoyed" when people call about stupid problems , apologizes , and hangs up. So needless to say I will not be coming back ! Please save your 40$ and get some quality food and service!
