Whoa, I can't EVEN with this place. I was craving Mexican like back home in California and alas! TD (as I like to call it) has answered my prayers. I came in with a group and we shared tacos, nachos, and a quesadilla. Everything was just as I hoped- fresh, flavorful and served with such friendly service. All of the proteins (we had chicken, al pastor, & asada) were high quality with the perfect amount of spice. All I could think about was how perfect this would be on a late Friday night with all my girlfriends. They're open til 4am on weekends! Not only that, but how perfect this still was at lunch time! I'll 100% be back. Next time I'm going for the rotisserie chicken combo with rice and beans. Hell, I might even throw in one of their salads also! New York, be at ease. We finally have real taqueria food worthy of talking about.
