I went there about a year ago and loved it! I returned on Saturday and mas very surprised by how the quality of the food changed. It seemed under seasoned compared to what it used to be. Sangrias were amazing, and the little bread they give you with the black bean or strawberry spread is to die for! The mojitos are some of the best I've had as well!
