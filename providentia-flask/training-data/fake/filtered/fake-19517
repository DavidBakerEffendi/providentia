Went to this place about 2 weeks ago for the first time and it became my favorite place to drink and have something simple to eat , really good burgers and beer, Â plenty of space downstairs and upstairs our waiter was really cool , wasn't accustomed to tap beer but the selection of locally brewed beer is even better
