This place is a neighborhood gem. Good food, good service, very reasonably priced, casual... the kind of place you could eat at every other week. Probably not a place to travel across town for, though. We ordered the Mezze platter, Greek salad, and Iskender Kebab.  This was plenty of food for two people since the plates were all huge!  Loved the hummus and Patlican Salatasi (mashed eggplant). The bread came out nice and warm.  Prices are very reasonable and you definitely won't leave hungry. They have a nice wine selection I just wish they had more options by the glass. Come here any night of the week for some amazing Mediterranean food, although maybe make a reservation.
