On a cold, snowy night a few weeks before Christmas, we stumbled into Tony's, weary of the wait and expecting it to be a tourist over-priced sub par restaurant. We were pleasantly surprised. The wait was 45 minutes.. But after spending hours getting pelted with ice, it was a nice environment to be in. It is a family- style restaurant and everything was delicious. On an extremely crowded evening, the only down side is it's loud and you're sitting elbow to elbow with other tables.. but it seems to go along with the italian family style of the restaurant. I can't recall the exact dish we ordered but it is a great place for groups, families, birthdays, etc.. wonderful environment & very fun. It was just two of us so we decided on a meal, everything else was a la carte. The dish was something like chicken in a tomato bisque with shrimp.. delicious. I was surprised how affordable it was. The pitcher of sangria was also great along with the dessert. We were even more pleased with seeing the bill which was very reasonable. They haven't taken advantage of their location right off Times Square, an area obviously bustling with tourists.. even chain restaurants like TGI Friday's & Red Lobster practically double their prices due to their location. I would highly suggest to anyone looking for a pleasant experience in NYC. It even seemed as though there were plenty of locals and repeated, recognized customers which also goes to say how consistently appeasing this place must be. (I do have to mention I did not feel well after dinner but I think it was a combination of our meal and it was so good I'm hoping that's all it was.. hopefully no one else had the same experience! I will see next time as we are sure to visit again.)
