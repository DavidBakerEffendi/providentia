Finally...a great seafood restaurant opens in Philadelphia to counter the endless stream of steakhouses in Center City lately.  Don't miss the lobster roll sandwich, soft shell crabs (when available) and the crab cakes that rival anything we've had in Baltimore.  I'm not a oyster fan, but those around me that ordered them seemed quite pleased. My only complaint is those french fries?  They're like a pile of singed angel hair pasta pieces piled high on a plate.   Note to management:  Please do us all a favor and replace the singed cappellini with real french fries!!  With better fries this place deserves a four star rating.
