We had to live in the TEmple area for 5 motnhs while our house was being restored after a fire. The area does NOT have a lot to recommend it, but the one highlight was City View. Their pizza is excellent and only slighly over-priced. I liked their on-line ordering system as well as it made things very fast and efficient.
