This place is amazing.  The menu has so many good things on it, that my boyfriend and I just split a bunch of things BOTH times we went so we could try more.  I don't remember what we got, just that it was AWESOME. It helps that goat cheese is like my favorite thing in the whole world, and there are a lot of items with goat cheese. The staff is super nice and smiley, and the environment is very cute and clean. I'm so glad this place opened up just a few blocks from my apartment!  I'll go again soon :)
