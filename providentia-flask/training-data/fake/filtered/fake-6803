a stunning experience.  they offer 2 fixed-course meals (vegetarian and meat) that will amaze you.  recline on the pillows like a Sultan while they bring you course after course of delicious Moroccan food. the only shame is, they don't let you take a doggy bag, which is trouble because by the 4th course i was incredibly stuffed, and i felt like they took a few courses away half-untouched.  i mean, you're paying for the full spread, they should at least let you take it home and not throw it away. so, come very hungry and you'll be satisfied
