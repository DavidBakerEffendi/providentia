This is, without a doubt, the worst buffet I have ever had the colossal displeasure to suffer. I arrived at right about 7:00pm on a Friday, the time and day where a buffet such as this should be the most crowded. Instead, there was a total of three families scattered around the buffet, all American. I knew this was a bad sign as soon as I walked in, but I've been surprised before under similar circumstances, so I decided to give them a chance. If only I could have known. Every piece of food in the building seemed as though it had been dragged behind a jeep through the Sahara Desert, it was so dry. The sushi A La Carte could be picked up and snapped, sort of just like a cracker. The seaweed had the texture of stretched gum, and the rice crumbled under the chopsticks as I attempted to lift the pieces. The meat was tough, and not in that good "Beef Jerky" kind of way. It was like chewing through hide of buffalo. The broiled salmon lay there like it had been beached in the sun for days, sauceless and barren, and a one dollar McDonalds chicken sandwhich contains more spice than the various fried and smoked chicken this place offered. The one and only redeeming quality this waste of real estate has, is due to their lack of customers, I did not have to walk far to my car.
