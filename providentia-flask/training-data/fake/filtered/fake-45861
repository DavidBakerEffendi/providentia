As far as steaks go, I had better.  Appeitizers would have been good if they came out hot instead cool.  The bar is limited, ran out of my favorite scotch after one drink.  New York strip had alot of fat on it.  The only thing that was good was the service.  Would I go back again ? I don't think so !
