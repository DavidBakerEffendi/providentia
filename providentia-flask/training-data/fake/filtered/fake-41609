Went here for a birthday dinner. We all ordered one or two apps each and the birthday girl ordered a pork entree. Beers were 5 dollars, not bad. Margarita was 10 and weak/watery. Our waitress was rude and inattentive. Why wouldn't you tell the cook to make all of the food to be ready at the same time? The apps came out together but the pork took about 15 minutes longer. Birthday girl was not happy. I had the shrimp tacos, they were very good. The calamari was rubbery and cold. GROSS!!!! The pork dish was good but over priced. We wanted our bill split and the waitress was being SO DIFFICULT. Myself and 3 others sitting with me are servers and we know its NOT THAT HARD to split a check. Then she ended up doing the math wrong and told us we still owed her 30 dollars. Wrong. She was either new or just didn't care at all about customer service. Not going back again.
