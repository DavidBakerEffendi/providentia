OK we went to the Brindle Room for lunch today. It's a little small but big on the flavors. MY wife had the five herbed chicken with sauteed kale, roasted garlic and horseradish, I must say a Great combination. I had the burger which they are famous for, and I can agree with that. It was approx six ounce burger very tasty made from the Deckle cut of the rib-eye cut. It was 80/20 mix, cooked med-rare, unbelievable taste, juicy and perfectly cooked. It was accompanied by had cut fresh french fries, crispy on the outside creamy on the inside. The burger is So rich that anything more that what was served would have been a waste. Def going back for another crack at that burger.....
