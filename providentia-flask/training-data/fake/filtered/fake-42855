A-W-E-S-O-M-E!!!  A friend of mine bought me here afew years back and the meal was absolutely the best.  I have since married and my wife and I frequent TOTP whenever we fo out to eat.  Every person we have taken there are now regulars.  The only problem is they need a bigger space!!!  May have shot myself in the foot on that idea.  Anyway it is family run and I mean they treat you like family.  I read a few reviews that says there's a wait...well all I can say is "good things are worth waiting for".  If you're looking for fast food there's planty of those all over.  I don't mind waiting for a good meal and good food takes a wee bit longer.  They also have great bread.  You will not be disappointed.   If I had one criticism was the parking...worth the walk!
