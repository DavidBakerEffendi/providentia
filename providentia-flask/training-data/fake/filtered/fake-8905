Its all in the title: YUMMY YUMMY!! their daily special is great to cut down the price but not the taste. the lobster special thats going on right now cut down the original price of 21.99 to 10.99 but the taste is still a wonderful treat to the taste bud. i just finish the cantonish style lobster 2 hours ago and i'm thinking of getting another one by dinner time. the downside is the special pricing is only available for pick up. the best part is the free soda that came with the lobster. did i mention their buffet? i was there at 12 for the buffet, and there were still some shrimp left. when i asked the front desk, they told me that the shrimp was only available for one plate and will not be served until tomorrow when finish. i was lucky enough to get couple before the whole tray finish. the tray that replaced the shrimp was general tso's chicken. so glad i made it in time for the shrimp, and im not talking about the fried shrimp. and the buffet is only 3.99, and around 5 something with a can of soda. still cheaper than most lunch out there.
