I was in the mood for a nice quiet dinner to end a long week.  I  hadn't eaten here in many years and when this was suggested I thought I would give it a try.  We sat upstairs at a table near the bar which has a cozy feel.  It turned out to be a great evening...good food, good music and good atmosphere.
