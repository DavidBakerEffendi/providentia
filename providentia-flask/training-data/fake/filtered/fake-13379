Randomly found this place walking around the city and what a find! The bartender was everything a bartender should be, friendly without being creepy, offered suggestions without being pushy and really knew his beers! Great beer selection! We didn't eat but the food we saw come out looked and smelled amazing! (We just ate elsewhere unfortunately before finding this place). Would definitely recommend and go back! The only downfall was the bathroom could've used some attention.
