LOVE NUNYUNS! Excellent egg and cheese on homemade biscuit.  Excellent french toast, my ideal french toast actually.  Very serene spot to eat breakfast, big plate glass windows, self serve equal exchange coffee. Nunyuns is a great break from the 45 minute waits available elsewhere in Burlington/Winooski for weekend breakfasts!
