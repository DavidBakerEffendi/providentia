I do not give any stars to this location. I had a horrible experience there Sunday morning. First my friend and I walk in and our sandles are literally sticking to the floor it was so dirty. Tables were dirty we had to skim through out toppings because they were all combined. I Love kiwis and I always use them on my yogurt but not from here!! They were rotten!!! It was so gross. My friend asked the girl behind the counter for a sample cup and she basically threw it at my friend.  This is one of the worst thing the franchise manager did was open this store. Its ashame because my friends and colleagues were very excited for this Red Mango to open and what a disappointment!!    With that all said of course I asked to speak to the manager about this store and the girl told me she doesn't have a manager that she wasn fired for being sick. WOW I was shocked your employees shared that kind of information with guests ! So unprofressional that store. And I feel bad for the manager  im sure he doesnt want to go back.. all in all my friends and I will never go back.. back to montclair
