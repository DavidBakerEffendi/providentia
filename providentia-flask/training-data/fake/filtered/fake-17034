Sangria is watered down, I ordered the mariscada and it turned out that the salmon was rotten I tasted it and it came apart and was just nasty. I got a stomach virus from eating one of the clams in that soup too. The owners were condescending and rude when I tried complaining to them in order to get the food replaced. You can just forget it when I tried to ask for a refund basically was told to get out or they'll drive my head through the wall, the dude's name was Jerry. I support local business but only when they deserve it...this place doesn't. There was a weird smell guess sewage in the dance floor area as well like a toilet was overflowing or something...disgusting.
