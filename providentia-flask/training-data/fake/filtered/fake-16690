HANDS DOWN THE BEST JERK CHICKEN IN BROOKLYN!! Â I CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT IM A EXTREMELY PICKY EATER and with that in mind im a huge fan of jerk chicken being from jamaica and have LITERALLY tried almost EVERY jerk and sea food spot in brooklyn, queens and the city in my last 12 years of being here and i can say with CONFIDENCE that BROOKLYN BELLY TAKES THE CAKE....or should i say - THE JERK!!! Not to say that i havent had amazing jerk at other select spots but they fail in comparison to these guys!! I stumblled upon the cozzy, off-the-beat-and-path, spot one night after putting a little time in at the bar "Vision" around the corner from the resteraunt on Coney Island Avenue ( witch by the way was probally hands down THE WORST bar i have ever seen in my life. POOR service, DEPPRESING atmosphere, EXPENSIVE drinks, WATERED-DOWN liquor, and NOT A SOUL IN SITE. Have no clue how they manage to stay open) ANYWAY we ended up giving the belly a shot and WERE PLEASED! Needless to say i eat there 4-5 times a week now!
