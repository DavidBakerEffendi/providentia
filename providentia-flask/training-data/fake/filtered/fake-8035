A friend and I waited more than 45 minutes to have brunch at Tartine. Asked if I could have a cup of coffee while I waited -- the answer was no. Once we finally sat down the waitress blessed us with her appearance. My friend asked for "dry" eggs. The waitress informed us rudely that they were too busy to take special orders. While the food was tasty, the overall experience let me knowing I would never go back. There are many wonderful gems in the west village where they actually appreciate your business.
