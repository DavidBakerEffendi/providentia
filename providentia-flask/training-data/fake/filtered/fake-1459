In a word: the best. You really are getting something special here at Pepe's. New Haven is the birthplace of pizza in the United States and Pepe's on Wooster Street is where it started. They haven't missed a beat. If you like CPK, Domino's than skip this experience because it will be wasted on you. Thin crust + top-notch ingredients = perhaps the best pizza you'll ever consume. All they serve is pizza, beer, wine and soda. That's it. No coffee. No dessert. No kidding. It's a wait-in-line kind of place and as much as I despise waiting - especially in winter - it's worth the wait. The clam pizza is a specialty. If you're not from Connecticut or have a connection with the state, you've likely never heard of such a thing. It's a delicacy and spectacular. Truly unique.
