Charming old school irish pub.  Frequently visited by neighborhood residents and employees.  Though area is saturated with college aged students looking for the next new scene Mollys is kept out of that loud obnoxious group and is a place one can run away from the outside scene. Fireplace adds a warm  nice touch to the rustic appearance.   Perfect Pints and friendly faces makes Mollys a keeper.  This pub will be around for decades to come!
