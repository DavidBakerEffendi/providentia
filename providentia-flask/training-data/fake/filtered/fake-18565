Simple, organic, small restaurant in the Meat Packing District. Green table is run by some of the nicest people you will be served by in NYC and the food is all really really fresh. If you're coming with even a somewhat large group of people be forewarned - this place is seriously small. When I came with a group fo about 15 we ended up renting out the entire dinning room.
