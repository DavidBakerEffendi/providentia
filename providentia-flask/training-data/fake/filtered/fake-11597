A friend and I went a couple of weeks ago so I could earn 1000 extra frequent flier miles as they were a participating restaurant in the promotion. Great service, fantastic food, terrific margaritas and some good beers on the menu.   My only real complaint is that I don't quite get the concept.  It looks essentially the same as when Copa II was there except now they have tex-mex food instead of lots of burgers on the menu.   don't get me wrong, the food was very good but I felt more like I was hanging out with one of the cool Mambo mover crews than stealing away to a mexican restaurnt.
