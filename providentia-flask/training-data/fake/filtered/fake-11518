Not only was the food delicious and sweet tea authentic, the service could not be beat. As a Southerner, I was impressed with the quality of ingredients and taste of all the dishes. Highly recommend the fried okra, hush-puppies, and pulled pork sandwich. I only wish peach cobbler was on the menu. I will continue to return time and time again.
