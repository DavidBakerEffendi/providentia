Love Love Love me some Abbaye. In a neighborhood flowing with foodie favorites the Abbaye has found a way to stand out in the crowd. Their Vegan options are untouched in the area, weekly specials menu is never missed, and their nachos are the best in the city! I know I know, nachos are the same everywhere. NO, the Abbaye takes 3 layers of cheese and bakes them all individually. One cheesy bite after another will send you taste buds into nacho bliss. Mussels with pancheta, onions, and crusty local bread are also a local favorite. If you're into the whole craft beer thing, be sure to stop in for one of the 30 beers on tap!
