I tried the korean bbq tacos this past Saturday and all I can say is YUK.  I threw away the meat of the second taco and ate the tortilla.  It did not work at all, even my daughter wouldn't eat it.  The meat was salty and the flavor was off.  For two hours after I ate my stomach rumbled LOUDLY.   I might be tempted to try something else next time -
