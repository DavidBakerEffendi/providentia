While  their sushi may be good, there is more to running a restaurant than good food.  Excellent customer service brings repeat business, while just having good food may not.  Repeat customers are the life of any business.  The manager and the cashier at Fat Salmon show poor judgment in customer relations.  It's a shame since the food is decent.  Alas, there are many many decent restaurants in Philly that will bend over backwards for your money.  I am more than happy to take my business to them.
