I cannot recommend Cappricio's.  The more serious problem I've experienced is that they served me pasta fagioli soup that had turned.  Yes, the soup had a nasty smell, nasty taste and had definitely gone bad.  When I complained, I got attitude.  The second strike was when I had them deliver a pizza.  When I opened the box, I was surprised to see about a third of the pizza folded in on itself.  The cheese was stuck to itself; it was a big mess, and about half the pizza was ruined.  I called the restaurant to complain and again I got attitude.  The employee said "the pizza was too big for the box" like I should be glad I got "extra" pizza.  He didn't seem to understand that pizzas should fit in the box they come in, not folded over on themselves so that the slices are ruined.  Never been back there again.
