I was a bit skeptical about vegan food at first, but the food here completely blew me away. The Big Wac was absolutely outstanding and I loved every single bite of it. I also had some of their vegan soft serve ice cream, pumpkin flavored with vegan marshmallows, and it was heavenly! I will definitely be coming back here again.
