Very, very cramped (lost count of the times servers kicked my chair and knocked my elbows) and noisy.  Food does not compensate for the uncomfortable environment - standard steaks, not particularly generous serving size.  Really awful wine list too.  If you're looking to have a few drinks with friends, soak up a vibrant atmosphere, and eat a little while doing this then this wouldn't be a bad place for you. If you're serious about food however, rather than a scene, then don't even consider it.
