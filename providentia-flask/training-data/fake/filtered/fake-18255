My wife and I enjoyed a wonderful date night here. The menu was amazing and the amuse bouche zucchini flower was a nice touch! I loved their st germaine cocktail but didn't really understand the movie selections, but hey who really cares about that. The dishes were all beautifully presented. Tasted amazing and it's a definite "return" spot. Our faves of our meal were: the mussels, halibut and ribeye. HOLY CRAP that ribeye was huge and cooked to perfection!!!! Melt in your mouth good. We were very impressed.... Great work!
