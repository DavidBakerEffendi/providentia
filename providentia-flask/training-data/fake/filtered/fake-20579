Heard about this place referred from a friend.  I'm from the area and decided to stop by for lunch and I had the shrimp house salad, clay pot curry fish and an iced vietnamese coffee.  The house salad was something different I had never tried and it was good.  The fish rice plate was spicy which was great for me because I love anything extra HOT!  I did not see anything there to complain about. (Basically I'll come back again)
