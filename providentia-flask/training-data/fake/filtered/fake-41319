Let me say that the previous two reviews were overly generous!  Started with calamari appetizer. Like eating rubber bands. Accompanying "sauce" seemed to be crushed tomatoes from a can. I ordered clams over linguini. My son ordered shrimp over linguini. Both orders came with rigatoni or similar pasta, with no explanation. When we questioned it, we were told, that they had probably run out of linguini and this was the substitution. My son sent his back and ordered chicken. Neither meal was anything to write home about. Just before leaving I overheard "No more chicken" Service was horrendous. Ambiance?   You bet!   Purple curtains Bill R.
