There is little to complain about here.  The service was fantastic-our server was very tuned in.  The food was very rich and delicious-noticed there was a LOT of polenta on the menu.  I'm not complaining but definitely a reason for mentioning each course/dish was rich. You could taste that everything was given a long time to develop flavors (slow roasted, intense marinades and sauces etc..   The only complaint our party had was that the dessert menu had a chocolate flan but it was clearly a generic 'lava cake' and less than exciting.  The honeydew gelato was insanely delicious as was the rhubarb.  The glass dining room was very loud.
