the coffee is stumptown, therefore the coffee kicks ass. and the barista that works in the morning with the cool tattoos is a serious pro. i am obsessed with the yogurt/granola bowl, and i like to go early so i can sit outside before the hipster crowd comes and seats are imposs to find. great whiskey selection and not too expensive. all in all, a delightful place to go but be prepared to wait.
