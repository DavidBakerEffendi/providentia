I'll start by saying the atmosphere and decor were very cool, hip and trendy and an overall fun place. However when it came to the bugers they were just ok. I was really annoyed that you are unable to order a burger cooked to your liking, when I asked for a burger medium rare I was told they only take orders of "pink or no pink" No medium rare, no medium well just pink or no pink! If you specialize in burgers and charge$14 for a burger you should be able to have it cooked specifically the way you like.
