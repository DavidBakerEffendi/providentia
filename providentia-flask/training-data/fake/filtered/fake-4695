I brought my friend here three weeks ago for her birthday. We both ordered an appetizer, an entree, drinks and a bottle of wine. The appetizers, calamari and wonton shrimp, were both delicious. However, the entree Love Letters was completely bland. The sauce tasted like it was straight from a can and the lobster tail tasted like freezer burn. The waitress dropped off the entrees and returned a half hour later to check on our table.  When I told her why I did not eat any of my entrée, she replied "you should have told me earlier." If she would have checked on her table periodically throughout the night I would have.  As a former restaurant manager, it was difficult for me to complain to begin with, but with the response I received I asked to speak to the manager. When the manager arrived he told me I "ate part of the lobster tail so there was nothing he could do about it." After the argument, he proceeded to offer me dessert. At this point I was just aggravated and declined. My dining experience was completely ruined and was certainly not worth a $200 bill.  I have eaten at all three of Julian's restaurant and have had great experiences in the past.  I tried calling management two times later on in the week to discuss my terrible dining experience and no one returned my calls.  The ambiance is beautiful, however not enough to make up for the terrible service.  Manhattan prices, but VERY far from the service you would receive in Manhattan. Proof that you do not always get what you pay for!
