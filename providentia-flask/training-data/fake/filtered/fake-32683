I would not recommend visiting this bar. The one time I was here it was really nothing special. The food was average at that and I had to wait for a while for a drink while the guy bartender sat and talked to people at the end of the bar, which was suprisingly pretty empty for a friday night. Nothing would really draw me back to the town pub. The food was not really good, and priced higher than it should be and the service was pretty bad as well.
