Decided to visit Splash on a beautiful Day in July.  Glad we did.  We were seated promptly and greeted by excellent staff.  The view is to die for, the "Best" in Burlington. Right on the Water, a floating dock.  Love watching the boats come and go, and the sunsets are amazing.  Now for the food.  Yummy.  The Lobster Roll was excellent, full of meat, no filler. Mahi salad, was perfect along with a cup of Gazpacho. Hit the spot. There drink menu is excellent, no cheap wines here.  If you are lucky you may spot some VIP'S one of which is the owner Barbara, who is I have to say the hostess with the mostess. What a fabulous job creating an island atmosphere on the water along with Palm trees to boot. All you have to do is relax and take it all in. I will make this Restaurant one of my first stops when I am in town.  Also they have a beautiful room upstairs for functions if you are looking for that "special" place to host a party or reception. Thanks again for a great day on the water. "Spash", you should dive right in and enjoy! You will be glad you did.
