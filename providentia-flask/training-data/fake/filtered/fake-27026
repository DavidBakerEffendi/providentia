After waiting 3 months for a reservation with friends, we were greeted by a hostess who claimed that we were early for a8:30 reservation, which we arrived for at 8:20, she claimed the table would be ready closet to 8:30 and by 9:00 pm when other patrons were seated before us, she then claimed that they were running behind, and thus was after standing in the side walk without any communication until someone in our party went to question what the problem was, she was then told it would be a while longer until the table would be available, it is really a shame that a 22 seat restaurant has such a poor front of the house when the food is rated so highly rated, I hate to say that I won't wait another 3 months for a reservation and feel like the front of the house really dropped the ball!!!
