SO PRETENTIOUS! Sometimes less really is more. When a dish requires a three minute description, it's probably over-complicated. I can appreciate wanting to incorporate new techniques but it was overkill. My steak tartare was the biggest disappointment. The plate literally had an identity crisis. Instead of having blue cheese ice cream or a beef broth cube (why??), maybe they could have served some kind of bread on the side. Just a thought.
