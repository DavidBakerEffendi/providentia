I visited Grazers for lunch today, in hopes for a quick meal before I finished my daily errands.  Little did I know this would be more than a quick meal, but FRIGGIN' DELICIOUS! I ordered the turkey burger with the lettuce wrap (instead of a bun) with a side of the truffle fries.  Delicious!  The burger was tender, juicy, and you could tell it was made fresh.   The LOCAL aspect for their meat options definitely caught my eye as well. Overall, I highly recommend this new restaurant.  The bartender, Brandon was very personable and made me feel very welcome.
