Another small pseudo Italian ( but honestly  cute ) restaurant from  the owner of " aria ". This time the result is mediocre at best. We went tonite and the service was non existing. The hostess was completely clueless and helpless.... All she kept saying to us was " I don't know.....let me ask someone else ". If you are that clueless don't wait tables ! And the food was nothing to write home about.... I had better taglioli with clams in my school cafeteria in Italy ( yes, I am from Italy ). But the shock came with the check when we realized that a glass of sparking wine ( NOT French champagne ) is $ 18, a bottle of Pellegrino is $ 8 and the cicchetti of the day ( usually $ 10) are priced at $ 19. For some " mysterious " reason  all these  prices were missing from the menu. Now we know why ! Would we go back ?  NOT !
