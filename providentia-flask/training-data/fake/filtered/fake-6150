My husband and I just went to Stone Hearth and we really enjoyed it.  We have just recently begun the Paleo way of eating so it was great that they have many options for us and they are clearly marked on the menu.  I had the pan-seared scallops and they were perfectly cooked, tender and succulent.  The butternut squash soup was delicious and my husband loved the meatballs in marinara over spaghetti squash.  Oh, and the chocolate torte was rich with just the right amount of sweetness.  They make all of their desserts on the premises and it was evident. Our server was great and the place is very cozy and modern. We will definitely go again and highly recommend it to those trying to sustain a gluten-free, vegan or paleo diet.
