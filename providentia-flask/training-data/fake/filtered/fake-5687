Nice Italian restaurant in the Bella Vista area of Philly. I had the pollo vita (chicken with spices and vegetables) and it was outstanding. The servers were very nice but a little bit slow in asking if we wanted desert and the check, but nothing too horrible. Would definitely recommend this restaurant, and the BYOB is always a plus.
