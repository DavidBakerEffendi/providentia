The food at Osteria Giotto is very good.  But if you are looking for a dining experience that is welcoming, this is not the place to go.   The service is not great.  It's obvious that if  you are a regular, you get good service, otherwise you are lucky if they notice you are there. The tables are squeezed together so closely that it is hard to have a private conversation.  And yet, it is easy for the waiter to not see a customer who has a request!  this place may have decent food, but the lack of service negates the dining experience.  not worth the aggravation, there are plenty of good Italian restaurants in Northern NJ that do offer good service.
