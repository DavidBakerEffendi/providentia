Totally love the foods here. It's only a stand but trust me they serve the best food in NYC. I know because I stayed in NY for a month and everyone I know has been talking about this place. When I went to where the stall was at, the line was pretty long. At first I didn't understand why but after it was my turn, I finally knew why the line is long and form there till the end of my stay in NYC, I've been getting foods from them :)
