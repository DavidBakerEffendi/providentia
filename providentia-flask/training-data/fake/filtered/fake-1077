I came here on Friday night with a party of six people.  The hostess was very friendly and sat us when a third person arrived.  The waitress did take a long time to get to the table.  I was starving and wanted appetizers so I was a bit annoyed.  I should not have to ask if you are our waitress in order to have you come to the table and finally acknowledge our presence.  Anyways, she ended up being okay, this girl that looked like the lead of "Dirty Dancing," but that first impression really irritated me because I was hangry and I am a little bit of a b-tch.  I ordered zucchini cakes that came with a dill sauce as well as the brussel sprouts.  The zucchini cakes were kind of flimsy and unimpressive but the dill sauce was very good.  Score with the roasted brussel sprouts however!  I could not get enough!  I probably was not a good share-r with this plate...  Later we all were sat and ordered a bunch of items off the menu- lobster mac and cheese, Chilean sea bass (me- no sharing!) ahi tuna, salad with chicken, two quesadillas and some other items.  The Chilean sea bass was okay.  It was weird because the sweet potato it came with was white and I was not sure it was sweet potato even though the food runner insisted to me it was.  I have had better lobster mac and cheese.  I think the other issue is the lobster was very pink and cooked- um over-cooked, and the pasta was orzo.  Why not just tell me it is orzo?  I tried the tuna with chips and that was excellent.  At this point I was full and did not try the other items except for a baby dessert.  I love tapas and dessert tapas is even better!  I tried the warm chocolate "liquid" cake with salted caramel pretzel ice cream based off my server's recommendation.  Can't complain for $5.  It was okay.  Overall I do think the service could have been a tad better, and had I known what items here were popular before I arrived I could have had a better meal overall rather then have ordered a few duds.
