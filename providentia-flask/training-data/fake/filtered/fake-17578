The food was good - we had traditional eggs benedict. Can't say the same for the service. Went on saturday around 11am for brunch. The lady at the front desk was very grumpy and rude, cutting me off mid-sentence, telling me to let me know when my friend arrives, kay. They wouldn't allow me to be seated first and there was a huge bunch of people standing around at the bar. The very rude lady basically avoided eye-contact with people and looked like she didn't want to be there. Food was good but dining experience was just meh. Waiter came by so many times it got annoying after a while. Don't think i'll be back again.
