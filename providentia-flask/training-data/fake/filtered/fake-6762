As always its the little things that added up to a spectacular Valentine's Day Dinner.  Me an my lady went for the Prix Fixe Valentines Day Menu and I must say I was thouroughly impressed.  The service was as attentive as any FIne Dining experience should be.  The atmosphere was nice and romantic and where it really counts; The Food... Everything was great. -The Behind The Knee cocktail is as good as everyone says! albeit a bit girly for me.  I had the Tea Tippler which was fierce but nice. -The Foie Gras which was super rich.  My first time having it ever... -The two salads we had were crisp and perfectly balanced and dressed. And I Quote "This is the best crouton I have ever had and I don't normally like croutons!" -The steak for 2 was perfectly prepared and it rivaled many a steakhouse. -The desserts a Creme Fresh w/ crisp Blood Oranges was insane and the chocolate cake was great as well. I can't wait to go again and try their regular menu.
