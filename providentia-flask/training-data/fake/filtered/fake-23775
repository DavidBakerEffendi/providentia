About as good of an Irish pub as you can ask for. Probably the best Guinness I've had poured in NYC (from an Irish bartender no less). They also boast one of the best whisky selections you're like to find and make a helluva cocktail as well. Totally unpretentious (if slightly cramped) scene, but definitely recommend.
