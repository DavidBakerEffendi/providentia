I really want to like this bar. I am a fan of Resurrection / MTR / Strangelove's and wish that the same attention and effort would be put into this place. Instead, the food is inconsistent, the service more so, and too often I get short pours from the bar.This is just disappointing. It seems like they are skating by on the endless supply of undergrads/grad students looking to drink and the fact that are no other gastropubs in the immediate area with which they have to compete. The result is that once every few months someone suggests trying 44 - to see if it's any better or because we are just to lazy to walk any farther. When it isn't, this intensifies the anger and annoyance that this place isn't as good as it could be and, therefore, the amount of time that passes before we will consider going back again. Meh.
