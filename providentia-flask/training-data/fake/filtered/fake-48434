I visited here while I was in Philly on business, because everyone said that it was a "must visit" experience. I have to admit, the food was great - the ultimate comfort/treat food, and really affordable too. The only problem is, the noise. I visited during lunch time on a weekday and the place was packed, so it was hard to find a seat. It was really noisy too. Service was quick, and the food was filling and tasty. I would have preferred eating somewhere quieter, though. If you're in the area and fancy an authentic fast-food experience, this is a nice place to eat, but it's not somewhere you'd go for a formal meal. Maybe I just had the place described to me badly since I'm not from the area, but I'd just like to emphasize that it IS fast food.
