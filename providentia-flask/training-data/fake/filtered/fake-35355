Went here last night with a couple of friends.  We own and operate bbq restaurants and also do competition bbq all over the country.  I must say the brisket was very very good, the sausage was good, the pork was very good, the ribs were below average, very dry.  The beef rib had good flavor but was very over smoked.  I really like how they finish all of their products with sea salt.  The sides..............Pickled vegetables were good, nice tangy and fresh, the beans were good, lacked a little seasoning, the edamame was terrible, had a pasty mouth feel and no flavor at all, the sweet potatoes were good, but missing the wow factor to put them over the edge.  Over all its a very good BBQ restaurant, they have the right idea and some of it is perfectly executed, just a few things they could do to add the wow factor and make it that much better like paying more attention to the seasoning of the sides.  Servers were very friendly.
