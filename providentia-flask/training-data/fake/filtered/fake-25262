This place gets insanely packed, so like many in the neighborhood when I'm craving I just order and pick up. In a first, it appears they also cut off pick up orders as well since I was told by phone "we've cut off pick up orders for today". Too bad, nothing worse than finding a place with good food, but can't seem to to get the service right.
