pieces of plastic in soup Overall an o.k. Korean restaurant, however last night's experience made me now want to dine there ever again. While drinking my soup, I have found not one but two pieces of plastic mixed with the tofu sundubu. Now, I'm not the kind of person who would usually complain, but this was really unacceptable. The owner had the nerve to try to persuade me that these were actually calamari bones! Eventually she offered to replace the soup for another dish. I'm a great fan of Korean food, however, I don't think I would ever want to eat there again. Plastic in one's food is a serious health hazard. Trying to get away with that on part of the owner is very bad service.
