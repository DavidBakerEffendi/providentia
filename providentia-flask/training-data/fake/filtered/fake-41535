My friends and I came to this place after having terrible service at another nearby establishment. The staff was super friendly and very conversational and had a great sense of humor. We started the night with one server and ended the night with two! They both made great food and drink recommendations. I was not super hungry so I only had the Frisee Salad. However, it was delicious nonetheless. My friend had the Steamed Mussels, which he practically inhaled. I don't remember the name of the french beer I had but it was very refreshing with a bit of a light wheaty taste. The Vanilla Bean Cream Brûlée was torched a little too much on the top, however delightful underneath. When we left, practically the entire staff was waving goodbye to us. They all came off as genuinely kind people. Great place and wonderful staff.
