Excellent service, great food and great location for a pre-broadway show meal. I had a seafood risotto that was beautiful. My wife had lamb chops that were so tender. Appetizers were delicious as were the desserts. The night we went, they had so many specials. It was hard to choose. Extensive and fair priced wine list. I didn't love the bottle I picked, but I didn't spend a fortune either.
