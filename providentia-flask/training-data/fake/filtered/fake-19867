I had the pleasure of being at their first brunch last Saturday! What a gem! It's really what Astoria needed. The decor is cute, without being over done, the staff was attentive & friendly, the drinks were strong, and the food was delicious! I had the Eggs Benedict with fried oysters. It was heavenly! I rarely rate & review things on Yelp, but I just had to for them!
