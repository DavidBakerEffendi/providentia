This is one of the most expensive pizza places that I have ever been too.  This wouldn't be a problem if the food was good.  I wouldn't even say that it is acceptable.  I work close to here and have tried both their pizza and subs.  The pizza is average on a great day.  The subs and sides are what I have the most problems with.  There hasn't been a sub that after I finished it that I thought, "Wow i would eat that again".  The bread tastes firm to the point of almost being stale.   I do not recomend anyone go to get food here unless there really is no other option for you to eat at.  I am much sooner to drive down rt 130 the next time I want to have pizza for lunch.
