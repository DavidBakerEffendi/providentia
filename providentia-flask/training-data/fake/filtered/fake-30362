I love this place. Decor is timeless, wooden, high ceilings wood paneling, ( a little cozy) but very Parisian feeling. Great kale salad, brunch menu is awesome. In the spring/summer months try to get a seat outside. Great view of all of the lovely hip inhabitants of greenpoint. I'd recommend this place to anyone.
