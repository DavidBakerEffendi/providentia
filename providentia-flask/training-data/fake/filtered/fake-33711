As a Mexican from Texas, I can assure you this Tex-Mex restaurant is the best you are going to find in all of New Jersey.  The food is absolutely amazing, and they make their enchiladas almost like how I remember in my hometown Lubbock, TX.  Highly recommended, just beware that it can busy there, but don't let the crowds deter you.  The food will not disappoint you...
