Having heard wonderful things about the London Grill I was looking forward to a delightful meal.  What a disappointment.  It was probably the worst meal I have had in years.  Everything is ala carte so the price of an entree is minimal and so are the portions.  I ordered the Liver and Onions which is their signature dish.  I received a large plate with a dark reductions of something spread all over the plate in order to make it look like food was on the plate.  The piece of liver I got was the size of my index finger, I simply could not believe it.  I would have sent it back or walked out of the restaurant except for the friend who raved about it and brought us there.  She later mentioned that she hadn't been there for at least ten years...well a lot had changed.  When we talked to the manager about our disappointment she said well you did get 3 ounces didn't you?  I am thinking that was before it was cooked ...if they weighed it and I guess it shrunk to 1 ounce after being cooked.  Something this size would be hard to cook medium rare too I suppose that is why it was overcooked and more like shoe leather.  I will say that the happy hour at the bar was nice and the appetizers were also nice.  I would recommend going to the London Grill only for the happy hour food and beverages and then going out to a good restaurant in Philadelphia for a nice meal.
