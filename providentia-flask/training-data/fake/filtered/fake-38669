The Greek is really, really good. However, they recently changed the setup so that the bread and spreads you got before your meal are now a $12 appetizer. Not the biggest deal in the world, and still worth ordering (the spicy feta spread is particularly good). Definitely recommend the Brizola for a main course. Sometimes, they're a little slow, so don't go if you're on an intense deadline. Honestly, just go there and enjoy, it feels very European and is a nice break from fast-paced New York sometimes. I've told multiple friends to go and try it. Really good food and wine, and nice people who work there.
