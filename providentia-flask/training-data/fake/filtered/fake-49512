El Vez definitely deserves 5 stars. The atmosphere is so classy and comfortable and the service is great. When I was there, our waitress came and checked on our table throughout the entire night to make sure everything was okay and if we had everything we needed. She was so genuine and nice. As for the food, delicious! I got the Chipolte Chicken Tacos and was is heaven. The food is prepped and served in such an elegant style as well. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for anyone who is looking to be enjoy excellent food and great service.
