This place is hidden gem in midtown. First of all, food is great. Steak Frites is my favorite. Their wine sauce on the steak is so good. Escargot is excellent. It was in shell with herbal buttery sauce. It tasted authentic just like I had in Paris. Second, Service is good. Staff was very attentive and extra nice. Lastly, they have a great wine selection.
