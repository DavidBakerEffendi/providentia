This place is great.  The staff was exceedingly friendly, and the choices are almost overwhelming.  They have classic diner dishes and also some real oddities (Tater Heaven!). Definitely coming back here often.  The only cons are that it's pretty small so you'll probably wait for a seat, and they're cash-only.
