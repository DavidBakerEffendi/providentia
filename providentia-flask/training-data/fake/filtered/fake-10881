No value here! The vegetarian appetizer was good, but the main courses came in very small dishes with nothing else.  No rice, nothing.  Hey, a nickels worth of rice would have gone a long way.  The dishes were very spicy hot, so we just decided to take them home and make our own rice.  They gave us two cream cheese size containers, they were about 2/3 full when filled with the whole entree.  We had to buy our own bread, which was just OK, I have had a lot better.  A little ice in the pitcher of water would have been welcome, too. As we left I looked over at the pizza place and the Chinese place nearby in the strip mall and wondered what $48 worth of food would have been like in those places. I don't know what passes for good Indian food in Manhattan, but this wasn't it.
