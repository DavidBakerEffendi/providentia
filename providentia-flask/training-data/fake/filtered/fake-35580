this place is a no frills but unique burger joint.  The burgers and wings are great and they have a good selection of beer. the burgers are big and can't compare to corner bistro, shake shack style, but they are definitely satisfying.  I usually eat here once a week and have never been disappointed (save for an undercooked burger once). Good build your own salads too.  can get cramped on the weekends and space is tight so not great for large groups.  highly recommend for a casual dinner out.
