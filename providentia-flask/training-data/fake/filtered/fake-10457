I love the craft sundays. I have made a corn bird, argyle sock puppets and was all' geared up' for the PBR robots when life got in the way of my good time! Love the food and the PBR tallboys. Love the diorama. Love the music. I wish I could post pics of my sock puppet and a nice bit of bathroom graffiti.
