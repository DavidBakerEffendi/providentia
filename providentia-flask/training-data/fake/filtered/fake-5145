Had a lovely lunch at Riverpark today.  My husband and I had the restaurant week menu which is full of options. My husband had the salmon for appetizer (absolutely delicious), the Berkshire pork chop for entree, super juicy and tender and flavor was perfect.  He ended with the basil cream puff, which was delicious as well.  I had the corn salad panna cotta for appetizer, which had a beautiful presentation and very refreshing taste.  For entree, I got the lamb chop and sausage, which I thought the flavor was a bit to strong for me.  The portion was quite small, and although I didn't mind that, it seems like there is nothing on the plate to balance out the strong taste of the lamb.  Everything else on the plate was part of the sauce, so equally salty.  If I knew the entree would be like that, I would order a side of mash potatoes or veggie to balance it out.  But overall, the flavor was good, just a bit too heavy by itself.  For dessert, I got the raspberry cobbler.  I enjoyed the ice cream that was pair with the cobbler more.  My husband did like it cuz he is more of a heavy dessert type of person.  I do think that all three of my husband's choices were better than mine.  Perhaps if I ordered what he did, I would be more satisfied.  Overall, I think Riverpark is a fine restaurant, and they always put a lot of thoughts and effort into each dish.
