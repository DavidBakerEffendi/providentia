bad experience with the service... which is unfortunate because my wife and i love going to this place. on a slow weekday afternoon, my wife and i were going to meet for a nice lunch. my wife arrived a minute ahead of me and the manager REFUSED to seat my wife even though the restaurant was EMPTY. bad call to have been so inflexible and to so arrogantly say "all" manhattan restaurants have the same policy. the place had only 2 other diners in there, no kidding. very unfortunate. they lost 2 loyal customers.
