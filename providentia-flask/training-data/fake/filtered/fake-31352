My boyfriend and I went to Bubby's Pie Company for brunch at his insistence on Memorial Day Monday.  We had to wait 15 minutes for a table then had our take-away cups from Starbucks confiscated by the hostess, although we had yet to finish our lattees.  She seated us and  while the white bench went along with the restaurant's country theme it made my butt hurt.  The menu was not veggee friendly and we were charged extra for egg whites.  The "hash browns" they brought on the side resembled something that would be served in a prison or state mental hospital as they were a pile of brown, soft mush, which resembled dog excrement.  As for as I know neither of us has any pending warrants. The cinnamon toast I had ordered was burned black and my boyfriend said his bacon tasted like, "tree bark."  Most distressing was my $11 mimosa was brought out in a dirty glass and only filled a 1/4 of the way.  The waiter, a heavy-set, indifferent fellow who spoke little English, never inquired how we were and I had to flag him down to complain about the impostor beverage he had dropped off masquerading as a mimosa.  Additionally my boyfriend's OJ was warm; it tasted as if it had been microwaved.   Although they deducted the cinnamon toast, OJ, and mimosa from the bill we still paid $50 for tree bark, bland toast (no jam), and 2 coffees we wouldn't have ordered if they hadn't stolen ours.   If you can't prepare and serve food of the highest caliber in an area such as Tribeca, you should be shut down.  I am never eating anywhere not Zagat rated, again!
