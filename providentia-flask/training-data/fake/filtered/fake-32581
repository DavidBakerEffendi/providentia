On a recent work trip 7 of us had dinner here. I had the Monk fish dish which was great. The place was empty other than our group which was a little alarming. Even with the lack of patrons in the place it took the restaurant over a half hour to get our meals to us. Also, the waiter forgot our order for a bottle of wine. So food was great, service not so great. Four stars...
