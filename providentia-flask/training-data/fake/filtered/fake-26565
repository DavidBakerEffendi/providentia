Went to Mesob tonight with friends to celebrate a birthday. WOW! Their food is absolutely delicious. We had the vegetarian samplers and plenty of bread (they walked around to make sure the baskets were always full). Favorites were the shiro watt, gomen watt and mesir watt. Fun cozy atmosphere with great service. Owner walks around to check in on customers, which I love to see. Definitely a "go to" place for our group of friends. I've had Ethiopian food before, but this place was far superior. Vegetarians and vegans will have no problem ordering but there are meat dishes available too if you wish.
