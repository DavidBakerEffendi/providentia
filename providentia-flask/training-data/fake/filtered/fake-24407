Beautiful space, very disappointing food. Mezzo platter close to inedible Â and ingredients had clearly been bought in with no attention to quality or taste, a steak sandwich needs to be more than reheated sliced meat bought from the deli counter at the local supermarket! Shame, it visually had so much potential - not going back to eat there!
