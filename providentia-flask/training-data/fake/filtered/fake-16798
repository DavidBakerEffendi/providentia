ith all the reviews and hype about the restaurant, it was somewhat disappointing. Noise level too loud, the lighting too low, but the all white atmosphere would have looked like a chic hospital waiting room otherwise. The wine was good, and made the rest of the evening tolerable. The carrot and avocado did not advise that there was an abundance of cumin spice, the bean side dish was overcooked, oily and cold, the pasta was mediocre, but the single serving of portable mushroom was nicely cooked. The peach cobbler was more dough than peach, but the ice cream was good, but the grape sorbet tasted like a popsicle. The service was attentive to refilling the water, and when complained about the beans, there was an offer to reheat.
