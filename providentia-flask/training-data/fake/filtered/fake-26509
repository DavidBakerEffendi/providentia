I was hoping that the creators of Thali would create a Mexican restaurant with the same gourmet quality we know at Thali (one of our favorite restaurants in New Haven), and alas, I left extremely disappointed on Sunday evening.  Sadly, we still lack a good gourmet Mexican restaurant in New Haven. First, the service was horrendous.  We waited nearly 45 minutes for our starter, about another 45 for the entree.  The dessert came about 30 minutes after that.  Given that it is restaurant week, and the menu choices are very limited by the prix fixe menu, one would think it would make things go more easily and quickly in the kitchen.  Unfortunately it did not. After our long wait, my husband received the wrong taco appetizer (he asked for the shrimp/chorizo tacos, and ended up with beef).  He felt they were marginally better than Taco Bell.  My grilled seafood salad was ok, but very bland. Our entrees were worse.  My husband ordered the steak, which was supposed to come with a black bean/corn/jalapeno salsa.  The steak, which he ordered medium,  came beyond well done to the point of unidentifiable, over a bed of canned corn and black beans.  No jalapenos to be found anywhere.  I had the free-range chicken mole verde.  It arrived as two small grilled boneless chicken breasts over mole verde sauce.  While the sauce was good, this is not how mole is to be cooked.  It is actually supposed to be braised in the mole sauces, much like....what's the best example I can think of in another cuisine with which they should be familiar...perhaps a curry?! The desserts were ok...I had the flan, and my husband had the cheesecake, which was runny but good. We may go back once more in a month or two to give Oaxaca Kitchen a second try once they have more practice as a business and a regular full menu.  The first impression, however, was not a good one.
