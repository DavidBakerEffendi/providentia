I and my Wife went to the restaurant last month. Both of us are very picky about our food, but we were not upset. The restaurant was very good. The staff was great and very accommodating The Food was excellent The price was unbeatable We are planning to go again this month Thanks for the great job Cheers Pras & Deb
