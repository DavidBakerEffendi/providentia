A Five Star restaurant located in Princeton area. The decoration is very unique and beautiful, dim light and jade-like white plate boost a romantic atmosphere, which made our last time's dinner an unforgettable experiment. Love their "sushi and sashimi for one", it was an eatable art and "The autumn of Jersey". I have to go back again to try other dishes.
