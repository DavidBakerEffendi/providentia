My second time here, and I order the usual Cuban.  Tasty little sandwich with the crunchy bread, average pork, and tasty chipotle sauce, but there's a little of everything on this sandwich.  That's the problem, too little.   The sandwich needs more pork and a little more cheese for the price you pay.
