Overpriced and with poor service and food!  First, let's begin with the service - Saturday afternoon when no guests were at the restaurant we sat for like 10 min to get someone's attention. Finally, after waiving to the waiter the menus were brought and  we were explained a little bit about the cuisine. I'm not a picky eater, but I do know what a good ukrainian food tastes like - and that was NOT good. Most of the food was dry and needed tons of sour cream to be added to make it taste edible. Borch soup was ok, but nothing to remember. We didn't try alcoholic drinks, but the soft drinks (fruit punch type) were good but the priced almost like cocktails - so be aware. Would NOT go back.
