I'm not a coffee drinker, but I hear the coffee here is one of the best in the city.  However the iced tea here was great!  I tried the rasberry mint and the jasmine green.  Both were lightly sweetened.  Perfect for a hot day! So refreshing.   This place doesn't have that many seats, but it's not too crowded either. Star sighting:  We saw Anthony from Sex and the City! He seems really down to earth as he was chatting it up with the ppl who work here.  I think he must go all the time. If you're in the hood, doesn't hurt to stop by for a good drink and you never know who you'll see. Rumor has it that a decent amount of celebs who live in the area frequent this place.
