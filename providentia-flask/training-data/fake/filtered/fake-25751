The corned beef was out of this world.  We were given a plate of pickles and cole slaw; excellent taste.  The fries were delicious, the chicken soup  was outstanding.   The corned beef sandwich (1/2 of it is now at home for later).  Biggest cb sandwich I ever saw. Don't get me started on the fries.  We shared them and brought the rest home.  Too much for one sitting.  The waitress acted like we were relatives in her home.  Will be back.
