Mexican food for people who've never tasted Mexican food? We got the lucky seat in front of the photobooth - so blinded by flashes throughout the meal. A pretty restaurant and fun concept, but nothing we had tasted good. Â We ordered Macho Nachos, steak tacos and shrimp tacos. All a bust - and we won't be returning. The nacho chips were cooked fresh, but very greasy. The meat on the nachos tasted like it'd been cooked in a vat of Worcestershire sauce - very salty. The main ingredient in the nachos was black beans. Nothing to write home about. The tacos came out next. I swore the waitress smirked as we ordered them, $13-15 entrees - the world's tiniest tacos on these mini platters. Cubes of beef - super salty. Shrimp was over seasoned in some sort of paste (I wiped it off and tried to cover it with lime juice - slight improvement). Everyone seemed to be enjoying drinks around us - maybe people go for the alcohol. We ordered horchata to combat some of the salt - watery and not tasty at all.
