This is hands down the best pizza in the world.  The scilian pizza is to die for.  The sauce has very good unique taste, and the crust isn't too puffy and is crunchy.  The cheese is on the bottom and then the sauce is spread on top of it.  Then on top of the sauce there is parmesian cheese sprinkled over it.  The slices look small but they fill you up very quick.  It only tastes good if you get a full or half of tray, it doesn't taste as good by the slice or reheated.  There is restaurant seating inside and tables for regular seating on the outside, which is great in the summer.  If you have any room after the pizza, I would recommend the spumoni,  or any of the ices.
