This is a really late review as we went on a Six Flags Great Adventure trip back in August 2013. I went here two times, once for breakfast and once for dinner. The place itself is pretty cool for a diner. It was very spacious and clean. Our breakfast was just average as was the service. We all ordered standard breakfast food. Not great but not terrible. The problem came when we returned for dinner the next night and had maybe one of the worst waiters ever. Once again, the food was average. Burgers and grilled cheese sandwiches. Nothing fancy. I'm not a hard guy to please and I can live with just average food on a road trip. What I can't stand though is a server who clearly doesn't give a crap. I don't remember the kids name and probably wouldn't write it even if I did, but i'm 99.9% sure he was stoned out of his mind. The place was almost empty and he couldn't even be bothered to ask us how our food was or if we needed refills on our drinks. All he did was take our order and give us the bill. He wasn't even the one to drop the food off at the table. He was also a little arrogant in the very short bits of contact we had with him. I almost didn't even want to give him a 15% tip, but maybe he was having a bad night or something.
