As a Mario Batali fan and regular at his Italian restaurants, I was eager and excited to finally try Casa Mono. The food was decent although I prefer Boqueria for tapas. The service on the other hand should be noted, BEYOND HORRIBLE! I agree with everyone who has posted complaints regarding bad service. If you are considering this place, check out Yelp, NYMag and Citysearch. Dozens have had bad experiences with service. Mr. Batali, I hope you read this. Your Casa Mono staff is RUDE and DISRESPECTFUL to your customers. The hostess/manager is more concerned with turning tables in a timely fashion than she is with customer service. Â She kicked us out of our table before we were finished and was extremely rude about it. It would have been nice had she offered for us to get up and finish our wine and remaining appetizer at the bar or Bar Jamon next door. But no, she was nasty, snappy with a perma-scoul and filled with attitude. So not cool. I will never go back to Casa Mono and plan on spreading the word.
