Very disappointing! We were visiting family in CT and went out of our way to stop there on our ride home due to the coverage this place received on the Food Network. What a drag - waited an hour for our burgers and they were average at best. I wouldn't wait an hour at any restaurant for my order. It was ridiculous. I'd rather have a Big Mac next time. They do not serve basic condiments; no ketchup, mustard, pickles - nothing! The burgers were dry and would have benefited from some ketchup and mustard. Decent quality ground beef but dry. AND - the "cheese" on the cheeseburgers is "cheez-whiz" and I'm not kidding. Also - very cramped; very few seats; it's a small place which is fine but it's very smoky because of the poor ventilation. Not sure what all the hype is about here. Oh well - we won't be back. Guy Fieri got this one wrong or maybe they knew he was coming. If you want a great burger experience go to Bobby's Burger Palace!
