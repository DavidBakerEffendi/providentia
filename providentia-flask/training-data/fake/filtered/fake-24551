My new favorite spot in New York, just next to the High Line Park. We had an amazone dinner and the best octopus ever! Tender inside and crispy outside. Try also the tuna tartare with avocado. Very knowledgable staff when it comes to the wine list, as a European I'm quite pickish when it comes to wine, but they nailed it!
