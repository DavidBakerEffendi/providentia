I had my wallet stolen there just the otherday. Paied my bill but left wallet on table by time i got to my car and noticed. I went back and said i left my wallet on table they said no one gave them it to them and maybye you lost it somewhere else so i called the police. The police arrived there and they asked if they could see the tapes the restauraunt manager refused and the police said he can not force them to look at tape. Â I had everything in my wallet including my childrens insurance cards and there social cards. I am so distraught and this place could have looked at the cameras and saw what happened. never go there please
