I love rustica.  I hate when it rains and all the seats are taken. What can you do.  i love the pesto pizza.  I love the mushroom too.  The pepperoni is damn good too.  I like to get some cream soda and a water to wash it all down. I figured I should review this since my profile pic is from their bathroom!  Its kinda funny and I had to do a double take.  I only use the bathroom to wash my hands before I eat and I look at this sign every day.  I found a picture of it online one day and swiped it for my profile pic.  too funny The service is great and the owner is usually always there working the counter.  There are a few slices I have yet to try because i'm not a fan of chicken on my pizza but I did try the bbq once.  I like regular sauce on my pizza or some sort of tomato though.  I know people love the bbq but i rather not on pizza.  Thats jut me though. I do like the tomato and spinach though.
