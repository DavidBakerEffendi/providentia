love the food and the devotion drinks (gluten free flavored and non flavored vodka). the front room is awesome when they open the windows for happy hour. theres always sports on the TV and drinks on the bar! food is all made fresh, and the bartenders can sling a good cocktail! mondays are mustang mondays, tuesday is beer pong, wednesday is karaoke, thursday is ladies night, and fridays are for country music (i know all you country music ppl have heard the ad on NASH FM!)
