What can I say, 3 out of 8 of my friends got poisoned after eating prosciutto platter. Not going back there and do not recommend this place to anyone, as the general manager rudely implied that all 3 people got poisoned someplace else, despite the fact that all three of them traveled from 3 separate places and haven't had a meal in hours until they came to Osteria to have dinner, which resulted in same symptoms of vomiting and Â fever for 12 hours. One person had to the Emergency room for dehydration.
