This is the worst place.  The service is NON-EXISTENT.  The young girl at the register had the worst attitude and acted like she was doing us a favor by ringing up our order.  We had a big party and had to even push our own tables together.  The food was horrible. What is worse is there was a creepy guy standing outside the restaurant leering at staring at our children.  This place should be shut down.
