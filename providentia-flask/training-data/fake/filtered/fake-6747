The food is great.  The service is like playing roulette.  Sometimes it's fine; sometimes awful and dismissive.  On a uncrowded night, it took 30 minutes from the time we were seated to get drinks, and even then only after flagging down the manager.  And that one round was all we ever got, never mind that we sat there with empty glasses for an hour.  The server was perfectly friendly, i guess,  for the 2 minutes we saw him at the beginning and end of the meal.  He just wasn't around and just didn't care and worked very hard to pretend not to see anyone trying to get his attention.  It's really the one thing holding this restaurant back, but it's hard to get past.
