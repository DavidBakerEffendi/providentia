I was at a bar around the area and saw this new Vietnamese Place and I decided to get something to try out.  I ordered the spring rolls and the traditional banh mi.  Both were very delicious.  The restaurant is petite with great service, very friendly.  If I'm around again, I'd definitely come back.
