I've eaten here twice so far, and have loved the entire experience every time. The restaurant is GORGEOUS. The first time I went, it was on a Tuesday evening and we practically had the restaurant to ourselves. Friday night was a little more busy, but we never felt rushed or ignored. When our server that night was busy with a large table that was seated at the same time, the sommelier and hostess picked up the slack for him. It's a real team environment there. The servers were knowledgeable and super friendly - you could tell they had tried everything on the menu and could make legitimate recommendations. I love that you can watch the guy making fresh pasta from your table, and that they source a ton of local ingredients, including pasture-raised meats and eggs, for the menu. I highly recommend the cheese/salumi platter as an app. They have an incredible wine selection - and offer carafes as well as glasses and bottles, which is so convenient for a small group that might want to mix it up. The portions are perfectly sized - not super small and pretentious, but not obnoxiously large either. Both times we have taken home leftovers in order to have dessert - which is not to be missed. Eno Terra really defines "fine dining" for me. Incredible food, impeccable service, and a relaxing atmosphere without being overpriced or snobby. It is possible to pop in for a nice, weeknight dinner, but you can also go all-out on a multi-course extravaganza for a special occasion.
