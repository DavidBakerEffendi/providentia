My husband and I ate here during their "soft opening". I understand it is new, but the service was terrible and the food was worse. We ordered the calamari and spring rolls. The food was so greasy and sloppy looking. My husband had fish tacos. He just ate the inside of the tacos because the shells were so stale. I had the steak po' boy. It was edible but not very good. We were excited about this place because the reasonable prices on their menu. After our experience there, I wouldn't eat their food if they were giving it away for free.
