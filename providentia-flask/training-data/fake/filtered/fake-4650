Miami Mike is the best! This will be my 4th Bowling Banquet party and each year Mike does a wonderful job, why else would we keep going back year after year. The room is always clean and set up perfectly for my league. They are very generous with the food but most importantly... love all the staff members. Mike makes you feel like part of his family. Thanks Mike & Staff! ~Maggie~
