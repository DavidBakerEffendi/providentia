Took me some time to figure out what I should rate this particular restaurant however, after visiting this not twice but three times, I am definitely ready to make a review. After 3 visits, Im completely sold to the fact that this place is where to go for; tasty food, great cocktails and alluring environment! The first time I came there was with my family, went straight for the bbq tabletop (Yummy), family and I loved it, our server was polite, sweet and engaged conversation with all of us (my father in particular enjoyed talking about sports). Anyway. the second time I brought my friends to experience the bar scene, Cocktails were GREAT! Melon ball and hummingbird was my favorite, friends couldnt get enough! DJ played all night got a few of us dancing. bartenders were super busy but we got our drinks in a timely manner, also saw managers helping out, nice to see a restaurant working as a team. Now for my last visit, I brought my date to experience a romantic night out. Crab top salmon was delicious, she ordered the rib on a bone (i think thats whats it called) our server recommended those choices to us and definitely hit the taste buds jack pot. ordered wine by the bottle (tasty and affordable), enjoyed the fish tank (would love to see more fishes tho) and lastly our waitress (easy on the eyes) recommended us the dragonfly sampler, even as stuffed as we were, we couldn't help ourselves, it was overall to me, my family, friends and now girlfriend that we all will be returning.
