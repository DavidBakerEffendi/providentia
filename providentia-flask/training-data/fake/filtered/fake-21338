I went to Bogota for the first time about a year ago and loved it. Afterwards I've ordered it several times and it has been good but not as good as it is in the restaurant. I came again last week with a group of 10 people and it was perfect. Some of us got there before the reservation time and they let us sat on our table (even when arrived before time and incomplete). Service and food were amazing, everyone loved it. Some favorites: sancocho, ceviche, the tacos (both veggie and fish), the churros.
