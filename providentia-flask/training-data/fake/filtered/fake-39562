The food is good but the service is just horrible. You practically have to beg to get attention. Not helpful or friendly. I rather go to a thai place in the city. After hearing so much rave i really wanted to like it but the service lacked so much to desire. Oh and my friend said no ice in her thai iced tea so thy charged her more, like really?
