Food was good... I had the grilled veggie wrap, the vegetable and bread was very fresh. I did take out, it was around 6pm it wasn't crowded and I was in and out.. I think they had our food ready in about 10 minutes which is good because I was starving. Oh by the way I had a smoothie it was delicious.. The price is reasonable so this spot is ok with me. I will come back again from time to time when I am in the area
