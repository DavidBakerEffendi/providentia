Eh, What happened here? The Continental used to be a fun novelty place to bring friends and get some good fast food at decent prices. However, I have not had a 'great' meal there for a long time. You can tell that we're in a recession by how they've cut back on portions. I used to loooooove their grilled octopus, but the last time I had it--it was all chopped up in a little dried pile-not the octopus of the past. And their fatush salad? Yuk! Go to a good middle eastern restaurant for some real fatush.
