i really liked this place.  i like that the staff here could give a shit about what yelpers think.  they're doing what they like, the way they like.  if you don't like it, getouttahere!  the food's good and honest, and it's fun to be there.  if dining is your entertainment, go here.  btw, instead of bitching about the wait, just go early--before you're hungry, get your name on the list, and do something else for a while.
