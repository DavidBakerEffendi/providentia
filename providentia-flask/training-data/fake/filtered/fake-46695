Went there with friends last week after reading reviews here. Was not dissappponted. The meze (s? is that a plural?) were terriffic. Â Loved the fresh pita they kept bringing out (and it's free ). The best thing was the check. We were amazed to only pay $50 for 4 people (after tips) which is a bargain on the UES for a sit down meal with drinks.
