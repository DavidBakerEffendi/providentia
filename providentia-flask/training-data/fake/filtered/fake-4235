DONT WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY.  I ordered the scallops for $23. I got four scallops that were NOT that good and on the side there were carrots that were cold, pickles, and some sort of sweet bean and spicy onion.  I was so ANGRY that I left there hungry.  The service was AWESOME, but I don't know where they get off charging so much money for the littlest portions.  I am not a big eater, but CMON at least give me a little more food for the price.  IT IS NOT WORTH IT.  I have NEVER written a review on Yelp but I felt I needed to warn people.
