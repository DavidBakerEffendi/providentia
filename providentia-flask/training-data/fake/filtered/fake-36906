I am so sorry to say that this is not the John and Maria's that we have visited in the past.  Let me start out with the one positive, and the reason for the one star I gave it.  The waitress and the hostess were lovely and very accommodating.   The waitress even asked why I had not eaten my dinner.   The food on the other hand left a lot to be desired.  The pizza my husband ordered was average.  The fact that they used green peppers rather than cherry hots on a clams casino pizza voids the fact that it is a clams casino pie.  As far as the dinners go, my dinner was inedible.  I had to work around hard chunks of chicken and rock hard (uncooked frozen) peas, and the worst, unidentifiable prosciutto substitute to reach the only edible part of the dish, the pasta.  The Alfredo was average, but watery.   Do not bother ordering the garlic bread.  The one thing that should be the easiest to do well was tasteless.  It was basically a large hot dog roll smeared with jarred garlic paste and a wad of mozzarella. Also, do not order the creamy Caesar dressing for your iceberg lettuce salad, it was awful.   As an Italian myself, I used to enjoy the food here.  I am not sure what has happened, or if it was a REALLY off night, but we will never return here again.   In the end, our dogs ate the leftovers we brought home, but then again they eat anything.
