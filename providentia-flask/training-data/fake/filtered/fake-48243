My second experience completely soured my interest in this place. Yeah, it's cheap for what it is. After all, $6 for about three servings worth of chicken/rice/gyro. I came here at like 7:10 PM so the line wasn't very long to begin with. While I understand they have long lines, if you're going to rush us, you better be accurate with your orders. I ordered to-go, but they handed me a bowl with two spoons. Me: "Hi, excuse me. I actually ordered this to-go." Halal Guy: "Oh, you can do that yourself on the side of the cart." Huh? Fine... I'll pack my own food after witnessing you guys pack to-go meals for the people before us. Maybe they misheard me, so whatever. But the second problem was when I went to get some white sauce. I didn't want to OD on it, but at the same time, I worried it wasn't going to be enough. I asked for one pre-packaged sauce. During this moment, the guys are preparing this woman's meal and giving her like six sauces. Me: "Hi, can I please have one white sauce on the side?" Halal guy: "Oh, you can get it from the side of the cart." Me: "Yeah, but those are bottles. I got a to-go plate. Can I have one on the side?" Halal guy: "I put it in the bag for you." Me: "Wait, what?" Customer: "HE SAID HE PUT IT IN THE BAG FOR YOU." Lady, I'm from California. I can speak English, no need to shout. In addition, I packed my own bag; you didn't do squat, Halal Guy. They gave me a hard time for asking and were being real stingy with their ranch-like sauces. I didn't even understand why. They're pre-packaged--what else are they for? To the Guys of Halal, your food is not God's gift to NYC; therefore, you should be more considerate when speaking to your customers. I'm not trying to be a princess, but is it too much to ask for polite service?
