Quality grilled foods, Japanese style, simple yet tasty. Four of us sat by the counter for dinner. There are many choices to chose from and it can be overwhelming for the first timers. Great selections of sake and shochu. The waiters are very attentive and helpful, but they tend to 'recommend' the more expensive dishes. We had whole sea bream, dried stingray fin, assorted meat & veggie combos, aspara bou, and Kamameshi - salmon with roe + snow crab.
