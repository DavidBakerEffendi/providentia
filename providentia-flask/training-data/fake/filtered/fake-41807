I can't say enough about this place. To start we arrived at about 10:35 pm, only 25 minutes before closing and were greeted by by the owner and assured that it wasn't too late to sit in and eat. Alicia has got to be the friendliest person I've ever been waited on or served by. An added bonus was the same awesome pizza that I had remembered eating when I was younger at their original Juniata location. I'm just bummed that I don't live closet because this would most definitely be my family's "go to" pizza shop/restaurant. If you haven't tried this place, do it. You'll be in for a really big treat!!!!!
