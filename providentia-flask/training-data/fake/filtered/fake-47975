I'm a vegan (no meat, dairy, eggs) and so the crust and sauce must be superb in order to compensate for the substitute Daiya Cheese I bring to any pizza shop from the Bayonne Stop and Shop.  I happily say that Pizzalino's crust, sauce, and veggie toppings are excellent with any vegan pizza they make for me.   I love and request their marinara sauce, as the owner Joe explains the only ingredient is fresh and sweet San Marzano tomatoes - with no additional spices needed.  Add this to a well done crust and you have exactly what pizza is expected to be.   Great pizza and a wholesome honest shop.
