I had the worst experience with this restaurant. I booked a Sunday brunch for my mom's birthday and had a reservation for 15 people, coming from all over. Two weeks before the event, I called up to confirm some details, and they told me "Oh sorry, you can't do it here that day. We just got in a big party."  I'm not kidding. First of all, THEY DID NOT CALL ME. They told me when I called them. Were they ever planning to call me to tell me?  Or would I have showed up on that day with 15 people and they would have told me then?  Second of all, it was two weeks before the event and I was not able to find another restaurant.  So they went for money over loyalty of local customers. I would never dream of going back to this restaurant again.
