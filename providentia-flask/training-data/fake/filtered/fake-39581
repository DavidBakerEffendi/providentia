Heard a lot of hype about this restaurant from my co-workers at the office.  I finally decided to tag along with them to Queens the other night and judge it for myself, and I'm glad I did.  If you're the type that has trouble deciding on things when presented with too many options, good luck deciding on what to order with this vast menu!  We ordered the papaya salad, soft-shell crab, panang curry, pad see ew, and coconut rice. The food was tasty, authentic in flavor, and fairly priced.  The service, however, was mediocre at best. The drinks we ordered did not arrive in a timely manner. Half way through our meal we had to inquire about our drinks and only then did they arrive (after an additional few minutes of waiting).  The restaurant is modest in appearance (nothing fancy or outstanding) and if you arrive during peak lunch/dinner hours, don't expect a quick seating. We had to wait outside the restaurant for quite some time--which subtracted from my experience considering how hungry and cold I was.
