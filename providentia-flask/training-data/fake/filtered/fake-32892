A casual version of Jean George - feel equally at ease wearing jeans or a suit.  The staff are elegant, courteous and accommodating, the food is great and the abbreviated wine list & cocktail list varied.  The decor is contemporary although with a little too much airport lounge influence for my liking but the overall experience makes for an elegant night out.  I've tried the crab cake & mozzarella/pineapple appetizers and the lamb and tenderloin entrees - all have been great but be sure to save room for desert.....
