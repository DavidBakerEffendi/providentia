The food is pretty mediocre, but I don't think this place is about the food. It is successful as a nice outdoor spot to have a drink-either beers or frozen drinks that come out of slushie machines. And the food is just filler to put in your stomach so you don't get too drunk, which hey, is how a lot bars work. It's a fun vibe though...
