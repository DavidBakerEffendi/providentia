We had an amazing evening at this modern, organic, local and fresh looking restaurant! Jacob, our fabulous waiter couldn't have been more service minded and friendly! We had the jalape√±o hummus and the veggie crisps as a starter- absolutely delicious and the organic chicken was also really tender and tasteful! The chocolate cake was really yummy!!
