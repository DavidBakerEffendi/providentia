This is one of the only pizza places I order from in Burlington. Having grown up in NYC I find judging pizza too be almost unfair too restaurants but with big daddies I am always happy. When you order the food the people CAN be rude ( See just like real NYC pizza joints.) But if you can get past that and the slightly higher price then other pizza joints you will be pleased. When you order a full pizza it is always freshly baked not premade then heated like many other local pizza joints. They never skimp on the toppings, When you order extra cheese you can tell it actually has extra cheese they aren't just charging you 3$ extra pure profit. Essentially the pizzas are the best around. Their wings are the second best in Burlington They are of good size and Cheech's Â Cajun wings cannot be beaten. That being said in my opinion their boneless wings are not for me the way they are breaded gives them an almost sweet taste which I do not enjoy. Their subs are awesome aswell. They come on a great hearty roll that compliments all of their subs very well, I really recommend the oinking gobbler.
