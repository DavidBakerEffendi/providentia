I love this place. AWESOME food for such a cheap price! The chips & salsa are great! I love the gumbo & I usually get the Blackened Chicken Fajitas. The only warning I have is that if it's a weekend or even dinner time on a weekday be prepared to wait about a hour. I suggest you go early. If you do have to wait for a seat there's a bar with reasonably priced drinks and make sure to ask for some free chips & salsa.
