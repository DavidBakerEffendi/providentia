Very slow service and a motto of "slow service without a smile. Food took way to long for a night when restaurant was not full. Drinks took way to long and we had to beg for a refill of water. Kids food was dried up after sitting under a heat lamp (what restaurant doesn't bring out kids food when ready)? Â Hostesses were not helpful at all. First time and last time we will go there.
