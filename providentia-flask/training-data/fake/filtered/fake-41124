Absolutely overrated.  The noodle was terrible, canned soup taste better than their soup/broth and the pork.......the pork was so thick, dry and had no flavor.  This is the worst noodle I have ever eaten.  The only suggestion I have for everyone is "DON'T GO!" And there was tuna appetizer dish. Way to salty.  Horrible place!
