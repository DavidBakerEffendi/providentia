Good until one of the girls got frustrated and called us "losers" for not giving her enough money. First, you a stripper....why would you call anyone a loser. Second, if you don't get enough money, then it probably means you were not good. The next girl got tipped heavily out of pure hate for the other girl. First and last time going here.
