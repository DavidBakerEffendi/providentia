Best breakfast in NYC!  No kidding, it's true.  Unfortunately they shut down breakfast a little while ago and restarted with a limited menu but still:  BEST !  Best bacon in the city (which might mean in the world!). Stellar greens ( and I usually hate salad with my eggs!). Superb coffee, perfect toast.  Ice water without ice! And refilled without asking.  Seriously, would never have guessed from the outside, hidden treasure Can't speak to lunch or dinner, but guaranteed the food is that rare combo of fresh healthy AND delicious ( and I'm a fried chicken type)
