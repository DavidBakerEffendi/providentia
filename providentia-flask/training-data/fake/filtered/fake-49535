I opted for the three-course lunch special, as follows. Homemade lemonade: Unsweetened and refreshing (if a bit watery) Samosa: Perfectly spiced, shell crisp and not greasy Beef momos: Oh. My. Heavens. Lean beef, gentle spicing, yummy dumpling dough--tiny pleated bags of delicious. The light tomato sauce was fine, but no accompaniment was really needed. And then, khulfi: What ice cream wants to be, with a dusting of pistachios, served in a hammered copper champagne glass (not really, but that's what it resembled) Verdict: I shall return! Extra points for service: My friend couldn't get the first two desserts that she'd wanted (one took too long to make and they were out of the other)--so the one she got was on the house!
