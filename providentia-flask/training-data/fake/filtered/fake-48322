Date of visit 12/6/2011 Weather at the time: rainy and 55 degrees.  This is important because there was no line. Following the posted ordering information.  I ordered wit/out provolone.  Obviously, I missed something somewhere for how to order and receive a hot sandwich because it was the same temp as the air outside.  55 degrees, that's cold!  The cheese never left it's refrigerated temp and the meat was just as cold and lacked any flavor being that cold.  The bread was tough and very chewy.  I went back to the window and asked if the sandwich could be wrapped up and put in a microwave and they told me they didn't have a microwave (it was clearly visible from the window not but 3 feet away).  When I told them the sandwich was cold and the cheese not the least bit melted they said they only heat the cheese steak with Swiss cheese and told me to "get lost".  Get Lost?  Now that is customer service for you!  You don't have to tell me twice.  This is NOT the place for a good Philly cheese steak.
