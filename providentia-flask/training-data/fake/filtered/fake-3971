Perilla is a haute cuisine restaurant, whose chef has been on TV. Notwithstanding that, the food is often excellent at Perilla. We have been there several times. The menu changes with the seasons. One criticism is that it has a small menu, so sometimes the food combinations and choices which interest the chef, do not interest me. Sometimes there is only one or two menu choices which suit me. But the wife loves this place.
