Bland! If this is Puerto Rican food, then the cook needs to get some lessons from a real Puerto Rican that knows how to cook. The rice & beans were practically flavorless and the rice was over cooked. Â The 1/4 chicken breast was D...R...Y...DRY!!! and had no seasoning at all! This place almost makes me embarrassed to be Puerto Rican! Both of my grandmothers were excellent cooks and their food would run circles around La Taza de Oro. It really should be called La Taza de Mierda. Because thats what the food there is....sh!t!!! Huge disappointment and didnt think it was worth $8.50 at all.
