Worked well with our allergy list.  My daughter has an extensive list of food allergies and our server, Mark, worked with us to make sure that we got a great meal for her.  The kitchen went over a list of 15 allengens and made sure that they were not in her food, what it was fried in, or even near where she had her food cooked. And to top it all off,the food was awesome German food (what else is there) and the just tapped a firkin so a couple of free biers to boot.  A great time and we will be back next time we go to Philly
