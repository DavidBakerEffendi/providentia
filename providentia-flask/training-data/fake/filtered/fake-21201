We had an excellent dinner here last week. The menu offers something for everyone. The Farmers Salad is yummy. We each had burgers that were large and tasty. The portions are very generous, the service is terrific, and the atmosphere makes for an upbeat vibe without being overwhelming. We will be back on our next trip to NY.
