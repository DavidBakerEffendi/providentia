I'm a steak guy simply put. I have been to numerous steakhouses and Ruth's Chris is my favorite by far. The staff is always attentive and food is great. I usually go in about 30 minutes before my reservations and grab a couple drinks at the bar. Once we are seated, I always get a steak, usually a NY Strip cooked mid rare and side of whipped potatoes. It always comes out in a timely manner and again always come out juicy and flavorful. I would have to say the same about all the Ruth's Chris I have visited. I always know what I am getting no matter which one I go to
