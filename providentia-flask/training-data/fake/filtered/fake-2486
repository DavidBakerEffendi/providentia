The cheese steak with american cheese was great! However, dining with a 3 inch COCKROACH on the wall was horrible.  The american man behind the register walked buy and bused a table and made a comment to other customers that were eating saying "yes, she's looking at you" refering to the COCKROACH.  The man then came back with a large paper bag, and used the bag to then kill the COCKROACH on the wall.  His response was that it's summer and the weather is hot there for that's why the COCKROACH was on the wall.  There is a large tip jar at the register, they should use the money from the jar to buy some RAID!!!!!!!!! I won't be going back there!!!
