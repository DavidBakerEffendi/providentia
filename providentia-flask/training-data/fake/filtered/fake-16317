Came to Christy's a few years ago and can confidently say it is my favorite neighborhood bar! A great place to meet other neighborhood people and have created some lasting relationships through this bar. The music selection is always varying, ask the bartender to play anything you want to hear and they are more than happy to find the song for you! The bartenders are great and always happy to help you decide on which beer to choose from their wide selection of varying brews. The food is amazing, comfort pub food. My favorite is the crispy chicken sandwich, it has fried chicken, pepperjack, bacon, and CHIPOTLE. yummm. Their traditional food is always very yummy. All around great neighborhood pub. Fun people, good food, and also the only place I will go to watch soccer games. The crowd is insane and awesome!!
