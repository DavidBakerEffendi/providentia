So I decided to bring a friend out to lunch today while spending the day in New Haven for falafel. We arrived and were seated promptly.  The mango iced tea was fantastic.The place was super dusty, cobwebs all around!  Falafel were ok, kind of well done though.  The hummus was oily but tasted good.  We ordered hummus and two pieces of  pita bread, only ate 1/2. A piece and placed it in top of the the un eaten one to take them home.   ,When the waitress cleared the table she took the plate. What really did not sit well with me was that we saw the waitress throw out my eaten one and put the other on back on the grill where they heat them!!  So basically they re-use whats not eaten from your plate! Horrible and we will never be back.
