From the front of the house to the back of the house staff they are excellent. My wife and I try a new place every friday since moving back to NYC. This place was found by one of our daughters so we had to try it. Well, needless to say it did not disappoint. We had to wait but it was worth it. The drinks & appetizers at the bar were great. The bartender was friendly. He makes a great of a Caipirinha. When we sat down the waitstaff was prompt and attentive. Though my wife and I cannot eat spicy there was enough on the menu to make the night wonderful. Even the manager sat down with us at the end of the night to talk. Â In all this place is a keeper and a place that My wife and I will return with our family and friends!
