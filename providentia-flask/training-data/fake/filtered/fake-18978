Everyone talks about this place, and it didn't disappoint.  I got 2 slices and was thoroughly satisfied with both.  I will say, the long line was a bit annoying, but hey, that's the price you got to pay for some good pizza sometimes.  Real NY pizza at its best.  Just expect to wait and eat on your feet.
