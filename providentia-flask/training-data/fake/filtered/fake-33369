Great neighborhood spot. wide variety of beer. the empolyees there are friendly and personable. Great place to come to grab a bit and a beer or two. good crowd to watch a game. especially the eagles. its not so lod wher eyou can not enjoy the game, but lod enough to where you can have fun with friends or make frineds during the game food is great and resonably priced. Try the fish tacos or the mussels.
