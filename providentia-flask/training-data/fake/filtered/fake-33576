AMAZING Thai food! the Pad see ew is the best i've EVER had. tasty flat noodles, amazing flavor - NOT at all spicy. On the other hand, the emperor chicken [or beef or duck] is fantastic and SPICY! I usually choose 4 for a spice rating [from 1-5] and it's HOT but delicious. everything i've had here is amazing and i've been a dozen times.
