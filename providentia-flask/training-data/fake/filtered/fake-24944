We went to Rare on New Year's Eve, and had the worst dining experience of our lives. It was pretty chaotic, poor management, our server was nowhere to be found, we had to beg for water. We waited 20 minutes for drinks.  We were pretty much ignored the entire evening.  We had reservations for 9, and did not get our meal till close to 11:30PM.  What made it even worse was the table next to us, got their drinks, appetizers and meal in due course,(same server) while we sere sitting there starving.  The bread was very medicore, the strip steaks were average. My husband ordered the short ribs, which were excellent, but a very small portion, my friend got the lobster tail which was big, and cooked fine. The manager did come over to apoligize, gave us some drinks and took a percentage off the the bill, but our New Year's was totally spoiled.
