Fantastic dinner in the upstairs room at La Fourno Restaurant last night.  Al and his team took wonderful care of us.  Our dinner and appetizers were terrific.  The mozzarella with peppers was very very good and the veal parm lives up to it's best in Philly title.  Our first time in the restaurant but it won't be our last.  Thanks to All the owner for a wonderful night.  Shamus was a fantastic server.  Try this wonderful neighborhood place.  You won't be disappointed.
