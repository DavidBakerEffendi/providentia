It was my first time and I don't like it , this place is always packed , prices are not reasonable for a sandwich. I noticed that they only use one meat slicer for the meat and the Â cheese and the slicer looks dirty . Because this place is packed they make 5 sandwich in 1 min, so they just want the sale. My opinion !
