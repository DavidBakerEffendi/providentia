The perfect neighborhood eatery. The dinner menu offered numerous options that sounded fabulous. While Salmon can often be boring, I was blown away at how flavorful and well balanced the entire entre was. The drink menu was tasty as well. I highly recommend stopping in for an early dinner when the weather is warm and the doors are open.
