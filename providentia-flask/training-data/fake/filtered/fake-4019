I knew the old owners and they were nice. Went in more recently to find out they retired and its under new management. The new staff was even friendlier and actually conversated with the people rather than just watching them eat. As for the food, I'd say its pretty consistent as it was with the old owners, however i do taste a slight improvement on the pizza which is always a good thing.
