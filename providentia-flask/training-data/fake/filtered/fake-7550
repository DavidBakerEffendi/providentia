Ok, I have to admit my bias based on them giving me my first job, however their food is all amazing.  Everything I have eaten here is delicious, albeit a bit pricey.  The salad, soups, pizza, focaccia bread, and of course my favorite chicken francaise is all to die for.  This has remained consistent since I worked there almost 15 years ago.  I have never been disappointed with a meal here.
