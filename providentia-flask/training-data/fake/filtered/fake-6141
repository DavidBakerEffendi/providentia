Having eaten at Stone Hearth 2 times in March, I very much disagree with the other reviewers.  The food was excellent, the service was wonderful, and the manager was closely supervising everything.  I had a margaritta pizza the first time, which was a bit bland.  The second time I had the meatballs on spaghetti squash, which was delicious.  My friends had the short ribs, and the pasta/chicken sausage dish, and a bacon, gorganzolla pizza, all of which were excellent.  This restaurant is a wonderful addition to the Westville eating scene.
