Giuseppina's has been my favorite pizza spot since it first opened a few years ago. I loved the fresh, classic ingredients and the friendly, warm staff. I walk in and I feel like I'm being invited into someone's home each time. Last month my husband and I had our rehearsal dinner before our wedding here and it was literally a dream come true. Our guests were drooling over the pizza and our wine glasses were never empty. The wait staff was incredible and made us feel so special and welcomed. It was a fantastic night and it was all because of Chris and the rest of the Giuseppina's team. And the delicious, perfect pizza of course. We'll be back!
