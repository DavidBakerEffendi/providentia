What good food, and what great service! I came here with a friend and wanted to order this noodle dish-- sorry, I forget the name, it was like a different language or something ;) -- but I was hoping it wouldn't be too spicy, because I can't abide spicy. The waiter assured me it was very mild. Well, it came, and it was burning hot! So I said, "I hate to be a pill, but can I have something else? This tastes like burning!" And they were super nice and apologized and brought me another dish, which was not spicy and very tasty. I left a very satisfied customer.
