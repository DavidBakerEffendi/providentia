Having been born & raised in Hawaii, there's very apparent Asian influence to our local Pacific Rim cuisine. Never a particularly huge fan of Filipino food however at first I was hesitant to commit one of my dedicated Sunday brunches to Maharlika. Now Maharlika occupies nearly every single Sunday mid-day meal of mine. The Eggs Imelda is an absolutely fantastic choice for any traditional eggs benedict lover. This lighter (lighter in this case is a good thing) version incorporates a Filipino biscuit like bread with taro versus spinach a lighter alternative to hollendaise sauce and prawns to top it off served aside these also light (another good thing) version of house-potatoes that I recommend dipping in the banana ketchup (delish!). I'd buy the ketchup by the bottle it's so tasty. The chicken skins are a great starter or side to snack on with your Bloody Clara (gin bloody mary spiked w/ fish juice) and for the sweet fan the Kalamansi or Tang Mimosas are an ideal pick. On the edible side of the spectrum, the Mango Stuffed French Toast is also a 5-star selection in my book. In comparison to the American version, it's also much lighter and filled with fresh mango and a decadent caramel sauce. There are still so many things I've yet to try. I could brunch at Maharlika every weekend and I nearly do. Now, that they're serving dinner, I can't wait to try!! FIVE STARS FOR AN AWESOME RESTO!!
