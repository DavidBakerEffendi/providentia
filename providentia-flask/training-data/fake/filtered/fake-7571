I have been telling everyone I know from the neighborhood about this place the paninis are fantastic and my personal favorite tomato soup with chicken and orzo. The problem is no one knows its there its slightly off the beaten path however once you find it you will love it. I love eating in my neighborhood and supporting our local buisness so vital to our community!
