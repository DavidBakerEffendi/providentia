Supper we found for a birthday dinner after reading amazing reviews.....we couldn't have been happier with our experience there!!!  Were seated at the bar----because of the crowd, but this is not a bad thing, we had the opportunity to watch the very talented chefs in action prepare our meals right in front of our eyes!  The grilled asparagus appetizer was perfection, while the lemon spaghetti so simple yet so tasty.  The special pork chop that night was mouthwatering goodness, we had to go back again for our second birthday dinner.  This time it was on a Monday night , and we ordered the special-----which we will go back for every Monday night from now on, was so succulent and right on.  Thank you to Supper for having this authentic Italian haven that is affordable with great service and even better food!!!  Buonissimo!!
