This restaurant opens at 5:30 and there were 3 of us that tried to walk in at 6. We were told an hour wait when the restaurant wasn't at all full. I'd tried to call all day for a reservation and no one answered the phone. As another reviewer wrote they obviously have a following and are not concerned with gaining new customers. I don't care how good the food is, I won't be back.
