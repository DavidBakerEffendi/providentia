I was never big on Indian food until I tried Ekta a few months ago. I thought it to be too spicy than to attempt to eat on a dare. Now, I am a full-fledged addict. I love this restaurant. We always get the same server, who is just wonderful. The atmosphere is very low-key, unpretentious, warm and inviting. You can relax with your favorite BYO of choice over a delicious meal at a reasonable price. I know giving any place a full 5-stars seems a bit much, but I can not think of a real, reasonable reason ( is it really necessary or even fair to comment on something as asinine as say, the paint color of the walls in a restaurant? No, not in my book) not to. I always leave fully content ( and usually with a doggy-bag of left overs!) Personal recommendations: Shabanam Curry and Kachha Aam Ki Sazi ( gets easier to say with practice, I assure you).
