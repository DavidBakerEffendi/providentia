So I've been in here about 4-5 times now. Have had a wonderful experience every time! I'm a full blooded meat eater, but I'm open minded and not picky as long as it's at least somewhat healthy. One thing that really stood out to me was the attitudes of the servers and just the overall vibe I got from the place. Really quite pleasant I will tell you. You walk in, receive a few hellos, eat a good meal, pay and walk out. Just what I like in a place.
