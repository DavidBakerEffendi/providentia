I really enjoyed my meal yesterday, as did my 3 other friends.  Drinks were all very tasty, with a wide selection of beers, on tap as well as bottles.  More of a meat eaters menu but still a few veggie options... Service was very good and the food was TASTY!.   Yes the place was loud, but this is what happens at Bars!  The negative comments below are so silly, if you want quiet, STAY HOME! Bar stools aren't the most comfortable, I agree, but that's the 'look' they are going for and I say, it works. I welcome this new bar/restaurant to the neighbourhood. What a Great surprise to find Poutine on the menu, I recommend it as well as the Haddock & Chips, nice chunk of fish with a perfectly crispy batter, not too thick.  Fried chicken sandwich was also delish. Station Stormy drink was my fave! Good Luck Station House, I hope you stay around.
