I would never think of finding a place like this on Staten Island , Creole Cajon spot!?!? Had to check it out.  Food was very good and their menu was interesting. Alligator bites?!?! Definitely try the crawfish nachos and the sweet potato fritters .Drinks were good too but watch out they're strong.  I had the electric lemonade , very tasty.  Anyway a must spot to check out when on the island.
