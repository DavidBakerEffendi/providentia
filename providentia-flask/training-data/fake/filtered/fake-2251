Let me first say that this is my very first yelp review and unfortunatly it is not a raving one. I have no problem with the food, it was good and the place seems to have a good reputation. My problem with these types of restaurants is what your getting for your money. I had the banana pancakes which were pretty good but for $13 I can make pretty darn good ones at home. If your gonna charge a ridiculous amount for such a basic item it should blow you away. I will say it again the pancackes were good, not outstanding but above average, I just cant justify the price. I will go back to try and egg dish or bakery items they looked good but will stick to pancakes on my own. OH Btw if you order more of syrup/sauce that comes with item it will be another two bucks, again i think is crazy.
