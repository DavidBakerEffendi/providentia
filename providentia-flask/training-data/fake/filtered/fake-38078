I know this place as my breakfast and lunch spot.  Couldn't wait to try dinner.  One of our starters was not the correct dish - we ate it anyhow and decided not to say a word because it was THAT GOOD!  Love love love the place, the food and the owners are very personable.  Will be steering all our friends an clients in their direction.  We will be supporting this place as one of our new favorites.
