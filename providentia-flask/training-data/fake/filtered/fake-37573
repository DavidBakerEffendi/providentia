We played music at Four Corners of the Earth this past weekend and had the best time. The food was delicious and Latzo couldn't have been a more hilarious and awesome guy. The sandwiches, the pizza, the beer and wine-- it was all delicious! They also know how to serve up a decent cup of coffee! If you are in Burlington, you have to make this place a priority!
