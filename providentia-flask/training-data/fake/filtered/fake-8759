I consider myself an unfortunate connoisseur of take out Mex in South Philly and couldn't be more disappointed with this place. Ordered an appetizer and entree that were both supposed to be vegetarian and both contained chicken. Fortunately i'm not a strict veg and decided to just eat them. The red enchilada was in a tasteless orange sauce more akin to dishwater. I hate to be so harsh but I was genuinely disgusted trying to eat it. I'll stick with El Jarocha
