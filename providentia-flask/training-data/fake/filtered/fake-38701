I have a half sleeve tattoo, and I was the person with the least ink at this bar. True story. Anyway, I had biked by this place every day and been intrigued by the mannequin diving bell hanging from the ceiling, so I finally went in. Great beer, surprisingly good food, chill vibe. The bartender gave me free beer when i closed my tab. Also, awesome paintings (huge oil painting of squid fighting whale as well as portraits of Machiavelli, Kim Jong Il, and others). Epic win.
