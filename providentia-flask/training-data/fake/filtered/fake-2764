Cuban Pete's is the Worst damn restaurant EVER !!Horrible customer service,and BAD MANAGEMENT. The manager Dominick is very rude .waited over 3 hours after me and my family were told we were going to be seated in 2 hours. We watched every other family party's get seated before us and when we told this to the manager "Dominick" he didn't say anything .he is a horrible manager and his workers aren't any better,very rude snobby workers and they ignore you,there is no seating area either they have u standing and waiting for hours on "STAIRS" ,so un organized and unprofessional, I REGRET GOING HERE...they were HORRIBLE.got better customer service at MCDONALDS. SUCH A HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE, my first and my last time going I WILL NEVER GO BACK TO CUBAN PETES,THANK GOD I LEFT AND DIDNT SPEND MY MONEY ON THAT REPULSIVE PLACE.SAVE YOUR MONEY DONT COME HERE.
