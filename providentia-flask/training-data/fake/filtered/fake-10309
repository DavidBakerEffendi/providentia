Stayed here midweek about a week ago for a ski trip with 2 buddies of mine. We were the only people staying at the inn that night.  The owners, Aleks and Michiko are extremely welcoming and friendly people. The room was very clean, very simply decorated. Beds were comfortable.   We ate dinner at their restaurant, where Aleks and Michiko are the chefs. Michiko is from Japan and every single thing we tried was absolutely delicious.  Hands down the best miso soup I've ever tasted in my life. My 2 friends agreed.  Sushi was fresh and delicious. I don't understand how they get it so fresh in VT. BYOB if you dine in. After dinner they asked what time we would like breakfast. We told them 745am. We had the 3 bedroom suite in the front of the house so there was a bit of road noise, which is the absolutely only negative about this BnB. Room had a small TV with DVD player and a common room downstairs with games and nice leather couches. After a good nights sleep we went downstairs at 745am to find our table already set with a pitcher of fresh OJ.  Coffee and tea freshly prepared along with mixed cereals, oatmeals and fresh fruit.  We were served bacon, eggs and waffles for breakfast. The waffle was really tasty, the scrambled eggs were absolutely cooked perfectly, and the bacon had such a nice smoke flavor.  Incredible way to start the day before hitting the slopes. Aside from the road noise and slightly creaky floor boards (the house was built in 1947), this little spot is a great stay. Great owners, incredible food and easy location to main roads to the ski mountains. Will be back!
