The food is good I had a grilled cheese and  fries the fries were crispy and the sandwich was not soggy.   The doughnuts are tasty not too heavy.  The reason for the 3 stars is service.   I was left sitting for a while and no one came to get my order.  I got up to leave because I forgot to put money in the meter and that's when like three people came over.   Then they forgot my fries.   Eventually they came out but only after I ate my sandwich.  I wanted something else for my daughter and it was a hassle to try and get someone's attention.   Then when I was leaving I wanted to buy doughnuts and coffee.  The girl behind the counter looked annoyed.  She was looking over the counter at a couple who I guess was waiting for too long because they left too.  My visit was during lunch time where there could not have been more than 5 tables occupied by the time I left and I was the only person in the restaurant when I got there.  There were 3 waitresses when I arrived and 2 when I left.   The yelp coupon is well worth it.  Oh and my coffee was given to me black with no sugar because she was rushing so much.
