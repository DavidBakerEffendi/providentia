"Parfait," I replied when the chef asked me how my meal was--and it was. My steak-- sizzling outside, pink and juicy Â inside--was cooked to perfection. In NYC, 'bistro' is sort of a buzzword for pricey, pretentious francophoniness, but in Paris it's like your corner diner, with a mostly predictable menu, but where they get everything right. Know that in France "right" doesn't imply "well prepared," it's when food ascends to a "miam..." status, like the sauce at Ponty which I can only describe as transcendent. I could say, "Add a good Bordeaux to the per-glass list," but I'm so thoroughly pleased with (and grateful for) this place I abjure all improvements. It's on the other side of the world from me but I will SO be back. PS Service is impeccable.
