LOVE, LOVE, LOVE! Went here for the first time a few months ago and all I can say is WOW! My tastebuds were dancing from start to finish. We had wine pairings with each course and they were all delicious. Not only is the food spectacular but so beautifully served. The atmosphere was intimate and lovely. I was able to try so many new foods that I have never tried before and I enjoyed them all. I have told all my friends in the area to go there and I will be back again soon. Thanks Zahav! Keep up the great work.
