My new favorite place in TriBeCa!! My girlfriends and I went by Manhattan Proper for happy hour last Friday and ended up staying well into the night. The music was great and got us dancing after a few drinks ;) Good looking crowd and a fun bar staff. Drinks were strong and the food was delish. If I could give give this place 10 stars I would. I will most definitely be going back. This place is awesome!!
