Ate lunch there yestaerday and generally liked the food. My wife ordered the pasta special and found part of a metal pot scrubbing pad in it. That is not the worst of it. Upon going home she got extremely sick very quickly-the classic symptoms of food poisoning. Now 24 hours later she is still quite ill. No stars here as a result and caution to the owners regarding their kitchen and staff. LouR Rutherford
