Bought the Sweet & Sara toasted coconut marshmallows at Jimbos Natural Foods and will make sure to ask for a refund. I couldn't even finish one without spitting it out. I bought these based on the glowing reviews and found they are quite possibly one of the most sickly sweet and terrible rubber-like textures in faux-Marshmallows (?) on the market. Marshmallows are supposed to have a slightly powdery texture, none of that here. Not to mention they are loaded with corn syrup and you can taste it in the mix. Why do so many vegan treats go overkill with the sweetness factor? Â  Worst I have ever tasted. I don't understand what all the fuss is about other than it's trendy. These are horrid and I would not bother with any of their other FAKE 'marshmallow' items after these wretched and over-priced lumps of corn syrup and cane sugar.
