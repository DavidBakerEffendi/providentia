Greek Lady is one of my favorite restaurants on Penn's campus. It's a great place for all meals (breakfast, lunch, or dinner), as well as a convenient place to eat late at night. My favorite item on the menu is the grilled chicken salad with honey mustard dressing. The portions are extremely large, so they not only become a full meal, but also, they are great leftovers the next day! The prices are very reasonable, given the size of the portions. All-in-all, Greek Lady is a great spot on campus to get delicious food, and I definitely recommend trying it!!!
