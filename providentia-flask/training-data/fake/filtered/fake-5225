Good morning Mr. Tantillo, I would like to take a moment of your time to thank you for your recent visit to Marzullo's Restaurant in Montclair NJ. I live in Massapequa Long Island NY and every few weeks I visit friends in NJ and one of them happens to live in Montclair and we go out to a local restaurant for dinner. I listen to the channel 2 news every evening at 6:00pm and when you mentioned Marzullo's in Montclair, it sparked an interest in me. When I met with my friends last week 12/29 I said to them lets try out Marzullo's because I heard about it on the news from Tony Tantillo and they said who's Tony Tantillo, I explained. Â :-) We now have found our restaurant of choice with a fantastic menu (I had the Ribeye medium rare), and the fried calamari and we brought our own wine to the table. Don't get me wrong, the places that we were going to were okay, but Marzullo's is our choice for now. Thank you Raffaele Marzullo and your staff for a very pleasant evening, we will be back next week. I can't say enough about Marzullo's, Thank you very much, Sincerely, Richard, Steve, & Ed
