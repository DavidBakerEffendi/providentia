Great dining experience and setting in the kitchen room for our holiday business function but CRAPPY customer relations from either the special events coordinator or female manager on duty that evening--I didn't catch exactly which role she held.  My colleagues and I had a simple question at the end of the night on the bill. In a nutshell, she came over and quickly introduced herself.  She indicated that the waiter had informed her that we had some questions about the bill.  Before we had an opportunity to pose any question or barely open our mouths, she went on a ~ 90 second stern lecture regarding the contract we signed and stated that any opportunity for discussion or negotiation should have taken place before signing the contract.  She seemed quite pleased with herself and her command of the situation as the three of us stood speechless and caught off guard by her approach.  Since we were expensing the bill to our company anyway, we let it go.  However, her poor customer service approach outshined the otherwise very positive experience at Agricola.  It could have so easily been handled in a courteous and less offensive manner.   I've enjoyed dining there on my trips to Princeton for local business.  Unfortunately, I'll have to find a new favorite spot as they will not be getting any of my future personal or professional dining business. I'm bummed because I love their bar.
