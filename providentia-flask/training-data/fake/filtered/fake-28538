Our first time giving them a try is our last time. The guy taking orders is too busy chatting with the guy behind the register to actually listen to what you order.  After 2 mistakes we finally got our correct order.  The pizza was just ok but the calzone was AWFUL.  The dough was still totally raw on the inside.  I bit into it and could only taste raw dough.  I took it back for a refund and did not receive an apology.  Just "Ok that is 7.49 here I'll give you 7.50" and that was that.  When I said "seriously?  Not even an apology? you served me an uncooked item!"  He sarcastically said "oh ok ma'am I'm sorry".  We will not go back.  Horrible food and horrible service.  Don't waste your time.  There are plenty of better pizza options in the area.
