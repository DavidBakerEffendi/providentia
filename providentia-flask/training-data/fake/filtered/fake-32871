If the eyes are "the window into the soul" then Perry Street needs a new host because this restaurant host never made eye contact. with us; his customers. We should have known that we had just entered restaurant "hell" and our souls were damned. We entered  the restaurant,and were not welcomed upon entering, but patiently waited until the host (no not on the phone and no idea what is more important than a customer in front of him) had time to look up and then ask what our party name was and then seated us.. We then looked at the limited menu and ordered our  food which was "okay" no wows at the table but okay. The appetizers were the most exciting item on the menu everything else "okay." At the end of our meal we then went back to the host and again he is not on the phone, not busy, but is writting on a pad of paper  (what his memoirs of contact with those pesky customers ) and once again does not look up till I loudly ask "could you call us a cab?" his reply, "no but I can call you a town car or you can walk two blocks up and get a cab." We did decide to walk and will never walk back into Perry Street. What an overall disappointing dining experience. Save your time and money there is beter out there.
