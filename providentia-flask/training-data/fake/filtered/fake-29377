Hidden gem I tell ya! This spot is off the beaten path but so much fun. The atmosphere is great to grab some food and drinks or just enjoy a night out with some friends. Don't forget about the back room they have. Seems as though people get trapped at the front area and don't bother to roam towards the back, be sure to scope out the whole spot. They have some great DJs on Thursdays and Saturdays - so be sure to check it out.
