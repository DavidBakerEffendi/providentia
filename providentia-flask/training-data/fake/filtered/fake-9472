4 stars for the setting, out back cafe feels like Montreal or someplace in Italy! Brick walled patio, walls covered with ivy, roof a tent, bug repellent lanterns effective but I would wear long pants, long sleeved white shirt. We didn't think the food was great, for example the french fries were cold and soggy. I asked for replacement, and the new fries they brought me were the same. NO excuse for that! The chef salad and cub sandwiche that others had were so-so. My hamburger was ok. So I am meeting friends there tonight, AFTER dinner elsewhere. It just feels good to be there.
