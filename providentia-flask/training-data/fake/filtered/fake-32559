I've only ever eaten in the upstairs restaurant, but it was AMAZING. The food was by far the best I've ever had in the Upper Valley area. We had a simple bread basket as an appetizer, which featured a variety of breads that were each better than the last. I had the filet mignon & scallop as an entree, both of with were ridiculously good. It was the kind of meal you walk away from wondering why you would ever eat anything else. Service was top-notch...the only downside was the dining room itself is tiny, (and the next table over featured a loud 7-9 yr old boy with trivia cards..ugh.) but it is a historical building.
