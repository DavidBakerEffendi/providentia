I had one of the best dinners of my life here.  The lamb special was the best lamb stew I have ever had.  My old boss made the reservation and the place killed me and my fiance, from the hard core bartenders who run the front of the house to the kitchen who put out the best fucking food.  I wanted to eat the legendary burger and was enticed to eat the scallop appetizer (I hate scallops) and the lamb.  The 17 pound scallop was to die for.  Schwartnegger scallop casino it was.  The lamb you have to get.  sit at the bar and get the burger next time. The thing that made my night was the end of the meal. I eat at Del Frisco's often.  Like more times than most people should and I ran into one of my waiters there.  He not only got us drinks ahead of the line, but he bought us desert and after dinner drinks!!!  Manetta Tavern caters to the best crowd of people!!! You have to eat here.  And if you ever go to Del Frisco's, ask for Curtis, he's the MAN!!!!!!!
