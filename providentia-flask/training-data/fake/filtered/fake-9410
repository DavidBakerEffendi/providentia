my boyfriend took me to dinner the other night and half way through the our meal i broke out in a cold sweat thinking he was about to pop the question....turns out it was all in my head. Â its all for the best though since we've ONLY been dating for a year now and i think it would have been a shame to spoil such a great meal! ... oh at some point i should probably talk about the food, try the pork chops they were delicious! had two bottles of wine so the rest of the night was a complete blur....would definitely go back.
