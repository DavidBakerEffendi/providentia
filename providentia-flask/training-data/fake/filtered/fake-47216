Went here based on the reviews and was extremely disappointed.  Appetizers were actually ok. Dinner was  obnoxiously over priced and full of second rate ingredients like frozen shrimp and either frozen or imitation lobster (I couldn't tell because it was swimming in cheese). I dont mind paying good money for top shelf food, but this wasn't even close. My girlfriend and i didn't even finish out meal and had no desire to take the rest home. Absolutely willl not be coming back!
