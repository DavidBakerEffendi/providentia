Wow I have been coming here since I was a kid.  Food prices are cheap, the food is delicious and it is open all the time! For something very fast, get the wonton noodle soup.  3.75, last time i went there.  You order it and 4 minutes later it is ready in front of your eyes. But my absolutely favorite is green peas with beef over rice and with a egg, sunny side up.  Nothing better than that. Also try the soft egg with beef over rice.  Just hop on over and try everything on the menu.
