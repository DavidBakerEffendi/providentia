I love this place. Everytime I am in NY, I HAVE to come here. Funny thing, once I came here to have some octopus after having dinner in a good Manhattan restaurant ( I don't thing is fare to mention the name). It's a little noisy. So what! I come for the food. It is fresh, simple. I feel like in Greece. Even the tables have greek pictures.The servers are all very nice. Good job!
