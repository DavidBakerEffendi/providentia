Brickyard! What a great find! My friend and I stopped in to have brunch one afternoon a month or two ago after a trip to the park. The food was phenomenal and I absolutely loved the space. The decor is lovely and I immediately thought that the back room would be an amazing spot for a party. We spoke to the owner, Pat, and he could not be more gracious. About 2 days later I got the ball rolling and scheduled a halloween costume party for the night of October 30, 2010. 3 hours, open bar (craft beers, wine, well liquor) as well as some great appetizers (we chose: sliders, chicken satay, and veggie potstickers) for $45 a head. Each guest paid at the door and received a bracelet. They have many other options for planning private parties and really help you along the way deciding exactly what will work for you. The staff was very kind and helpful making the party a complete success! They reorganized the furniture in the room, took some out, and made the space exactly how we wanted it. We brought baked goods and party favors that they gladly stored for us and brought out toward the end of the evening. Service was seamless and followed a timeline that we laid out. In all aspects, I would recommend Brickyard whether you are stopping in to enjoy a bloody mary and a delicious brunch or are interested in planning a party. Many thanks to the Pat and the rest of the staff! We had a wonderful time this weekend!
