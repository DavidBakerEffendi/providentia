Went here after being rudely turned away at 'The Park'..   I highly recommend cookshop.. My food was excellent, my drink was perfect, and the $ wasn't bad at all for the location.. 4 people with 4 meals, 7 drinks, and desert came to about $200..  Service was perfect... overall i will be going back very soon! P.S. - the highline is a great after dinner walk! :)
