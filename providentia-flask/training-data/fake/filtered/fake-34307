: Awesomely fresh fish and the rice here is amaaazing. I haven't had rice cooked that perfectly in awhile. It's the perfect stickiness and temperature to match the fish. We got 4 rolls (friend oyster, tuna, salmon skin and scallion, and spicy scallop), a Chirashi disk, and the eggplant miso appetizer. The portions are adequate. You never feel full off sushi until you stop eating, but I was very satisfied with the food quality. My favorite was the shrimp and salmon from the chirashi. I am definitely going back to try the fried oyster and one of their hot dishes.
