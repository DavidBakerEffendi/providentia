This place feels like a high school cafeteria.  Maybe I am spoiled by seeing the luxe French bistro concept work well in other cities.  Way too large and crowded for my tastes.  The only amusing part is watching middle-class grad students pretend they are on the Left Bank.    Many folks here from neighborhoods away, very disheartening.  I left my change on the bar after getting a round and some ne'er-do-well tried to use a ten dollar bill of mine to get a beer.  No apparent dress-code, but they ought to implement one.  Very slow service because of the dilettantes 3 deep at the bar mispronouncing the names of what they feel are grand drinks and proudly waving hundred-dollar bills.  But a nicely laid out and finished bar, well-prepared drinks from the bartender.  I didn't eat for fear of an even longer wait time for the food than for the drinks.
