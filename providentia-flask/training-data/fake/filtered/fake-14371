As a recent transplant from Manhattan, I've been really disappointed with the quality of food in the area. Whether it's fancy or casual, there's a dearth of tasty food around me. Until now. We passed by the restaurant this afternoon, and though I didn't have high hopes, on a whim we decided to try it. OMG, the jerk shrimp are TO DIE FOR!!! I'm not exaggerating when I say that I just about had the best meal of my life there. The green salad that comes with the meal was incredibly fresh and colorful (NO iceberg lettuce), and the rice and beans were tasty as can be - I'm Puerto Rican, so if it's one thing my people know its definitely rice and beans. I'm a "pescatarian," so I can't comment on the chicken or the ox tails, but this is perhaps the one time in over ten years that I wish I did eat meat because my boyfriend's dish smelled absolutely heavenly. While he had a side of creamy (and spicy!) mac and cheese, I had a spinach patty that was sooooo good - I love that they've thought about vegetarian and "pescatarian" options! Anywho, I definitely recommend this place. My only issue is that they came around just in time for bikini season...woe is me and my waistline!
