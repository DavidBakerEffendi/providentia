Warning: the outdoors seating is currently under construction. Sad I couldn't sit outside , but didn't allow it to ruin my time. Started off with a few Hennessey mojitos which were off the hook for all you henny lovers. For appetizers had lob Mac & cheese (delicious, but could use more lobster)! Our server Michelle recommended the Lime Crusted Salmon & Pernil ... We loved it all!! She was so awesome. Made sure our drinks were on point, threw in a few jokes, was simply amazing. It's always awesome when you go out to eat and have An amazing scene, view, food, and can vibe with your server. Thank you Michelle!
