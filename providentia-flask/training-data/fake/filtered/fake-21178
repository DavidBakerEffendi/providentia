Friday night at 8. 2 people. Place 50% full. Was sat right away but waited 30 min for our first drink to arrive. Then another 15 to order. Then had to ask where our fondue was that came out cold. Terrible service that was more concerned with talking to coworkers than actually doing the job. The food was less than moderate and booze overpriced for what they carry. Do not recommend this place to anyone.
