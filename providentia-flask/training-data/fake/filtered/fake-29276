I stopped by Juniper with my friend who had a 50% off coupon the other night during the ongoing heatwave (otherwise known as July in NY). I suggested we sit on the patio, and we were quickly, and often served tall glasses of ice water. The patio is very simple, casual, could be anyone's backyard-there was the back screen door (the entrance/exit to the kitchen I imagine), and a few bikes leaning against the wall. There really isn't any sort of ambiance outside. Inside, there is a really cool vintage typewriter (?), and gleaming wood tables and floors that evoke bygone years. Again, pared down but not without charm. Both of us ordered pulled pork sandwiches with sweet potato fries. The barbecue was rich and sweet but not overwhelming, the texture of the meat wasn't too dense. I think the pulled pork can near rival any authentic Southern trailer restaurant in the backwoods (of which I am acquainted with). The sweet potato fries found a convert in me, crisp, hot, and finished within a total of maybe 5 minutes. I was pretty disgusted with myself for the level of gorging, having completely cleaned my plate, and even mopping up any leftover sauce with my roll. I can't wait to go back.
