I love Mama Gyro! When I'm starving and need something quick they are definitely my first choice. They're very affordable. Where else can you get a real, fresh meal for less than $5.00? I've only had the mamagyro. Both the chicken and lamb are great. Well seasoned. It's not a crazy amount of food, but it's a perfect serving. They also make amazing sweet potato fries!
