I brought my son to have a treat of pain au chocolat .   The hostess said, "I can't give that to you,"  like I asked for something illegal. I said "But it's on the menu."   The hostess replied in her most condescending voice, "Because it's just so delicious that people eat it all up in the morning and there's no more left."   (Oh, why didn't you just say you ran out of it?!!!  Duh!) Then a waitress came to our table, annoyedly took our order, and served us like we were an imposition.  She disappeared for a long time and never brought us drinks.  When she returned, she felt the need to address me as "Love."   You can only chalk so much up to being young.  Perhaps the cafe is so crowded that the girls who work there are not getting enough oxygen to their brains. Was this review ...?
