This was my first visit to the restaurant and I can't wait to visit again.  The hospitality made me feel like I was in Taverna in Greece.  The staff were friendly, professional and down to earth.  The atmosphere is warm and inviting.  Great for hanging out with friends and it also has a romantic side so you can come on a date. Everything I ate tasted fresh and amazing. The complimentary dips were fresh, homemade and fantastic.  The lemon potatoes and grilled octopus with bacon were to die for.  I also really appreciated the extensive Greek wine list.  Two of my favorites were on the list.  And lastly I loved the Greek spin on the halva.  It was served to perfection with the Greek coffee.
