Salt & Fat has got it like that! ** youtube.com/watch?v=WWi3… (FF to 4:12) ** A cozy spot in Sunnyside with dishes like porkbelly tacos, fried chicken with diakon and buttermilk ranch, oxtail with onion puree, and korean BBQ lettuce wraps in perfect portions to share. Everything is warm and ready to be devoured as soon as it hits the table. The waitress will recommend 5 - 7 dishes for a party of 3, so prepare your taste buds for a non-stop spectrum of textures and flavors during your meal.   Skip the brussels sprouts with parmesan. Go for another less boring dish like the pasta or ribs! The bacon popcorn is good the first few kernels popped in your mouth. Then they take on the greasy texture and you can't even taste the bacon anymore. If you want to know how greasy, just notice how transparent the small paper bag becomes when you're ready to leave. It's a small space, dimly lit, and the black and white decor is as simple and straight forward as restaurant's name. Service is quick and everyone is friendly. I thought I heard avocado when the waiter brought and explained the small dessert menus, but he kindly repeated the mouthful list of ice creams when I asked. Even though I definitely heard avocado in my head--wishful thinking. The marshmallow ice cream is super thick and creamy. The perfect cold counterpart to the crunchy rice squares. Salt & Fat for dinner has never sounded tastier!
