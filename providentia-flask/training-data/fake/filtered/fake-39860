Absolutely the worst place I've ever been to. First, there was dirt in the salad (yes, dirt!). Then, the waitress had a bad attitude when the dish that someone in my party ordered wasn't up to par. Then, they wouldn't even substitute her meal for something else! Even after we found dirt in the salad! ALSO, we personally witnessed one of the waiters remove half-eaten food from someone's table and proceed to EAT IT. So gross. There are so many other options on Wooster. Choose wisely.
