This restaurant was recommended to me by a co-foodie.  It was the best meal I have had in about a year.  Pork buns were unreal, unbelievable yellow tail (hamachi carpaccio) and maguro sashimi apps.  The two of us shared the karaka-men with a poached egg on top.  It was suggested we order extra noodles if we had broth left over but we were stuffed by then.  Fantastic service, waiter was so enthusiastic about us having the right experience given that we were newbies!
