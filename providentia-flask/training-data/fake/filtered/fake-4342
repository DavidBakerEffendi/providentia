Perhaps the best value restaurant in New York.  Very high in terms of authenticity - clearly they're not faking it as so many "meditaranean" restaurants in NYC are wont to do.  The quality of the food is extremely high and the prices are more than reasonable.  Add fast service and how can you complain?
