I like to support local businesses, but MacLaomainn's never fails to disappoint.  Service has been mediocre in the past, but today, after joining a group of friends and sitting at a table for 15 minutes, I was rather rudely informed by the proprietor that I could not sit where I had placed my chair.  Granted, it was busy and crowded, but after the long wait for service, the first thing I heard from a server should not have been, "you can't sit there."  Nor did he seem to have any inclination to accommodate me or our group in any way.  Congratulations to them for having so much business that they can throw mine away permanently.
