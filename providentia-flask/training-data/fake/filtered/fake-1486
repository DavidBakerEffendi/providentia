Nice place but the décor's a bit dingy.  Definitely needs an update or at least clean walls!  I really don't like sitting at a table where I can see dried milk splatters.  The food was good, but not stellar.  Decided to go here after seeing it listed on the Farm to Philly site.  I really wanted to eat at a restaurant that supports local, family farms and organic agriculture.  I went for lunch ordering the winter citrus salad and Spicy Lamb Bolognese.  The salad was a bit disappointing.  I couldn't find very much fennel.  It was mostly baby arugula and some of those leaves were wilted.  People--Salads need to be vibrant and salad leaves should stand at attention with crispness!  It tasted okay and the blood orange segments were a nice touch.  The lamb Bolognese was delicious, hearty meat sauce with a generous dollop of herbed ricotta and Parmesan cheese.  Pasta was cooked al dente, just as I like it.  I was stuffed so didn't have dessert or coffee.  I would order regular burger fare or sandwiches next time.
