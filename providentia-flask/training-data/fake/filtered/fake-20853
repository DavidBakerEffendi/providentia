I had quite a terrible experience. Let's be clear -- the place is charming, sunny and cute with its plants and outdoor seatings. The staff is OK, not rude, but not really friendly -- they could learn how to smile. My problem is with the food, the primary reason why one goes to a restaurant. Burnt potatoes -- and when I say burnt, I mean little black crusty rocks served in a bowl. I could not believe it, either the server was blind, either he thought customers like to eat BBQ charcoals. They only had onion breads. But I dont like onion breads. What do I do ? Poorly. I'll be fair. The benedictin old McDonalds sandwich that I got was good, but I was still so hungry since I couldnt eat anything else. The worst part of it was that we waited for More than a hour to get our food. This was unacceptable -- when we arrived they were only a few people in the place, it wasnt busy at all. I cant imagine when it gets busy...
