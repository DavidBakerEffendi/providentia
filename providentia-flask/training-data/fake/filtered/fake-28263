I went here from a recomendation from my sister. The short girl who is like a hostess, should be replaced or should be told to greet customers with a smile.  I when there with my wife, there was 2 open tables for 2 people.  Went to the hostess and was told there was a 15 minute waiting list, and than we pointed out the tables, than she said, sure go take a seat!! Either she does not know what she is doing by not following her tables, or just wants customers to form a line to attract more customers outside. Any way, ordered, sword fish, some salad, crabcakes. Lets make it short. Nothing 4 or 5 stars. The sword fish was well done and everytime you ate it, you got a taste of burt fish in your mouth. Would never go back again.
