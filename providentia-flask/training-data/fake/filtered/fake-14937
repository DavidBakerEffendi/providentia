The food was really delicious, can't argue that. However, the wait staff was horrible! We had barely finished eating when they were trying to force us out. We were finishing an opened bottle of wine (there was no line, nobody waiting) and the waiter came up to us about 4 times rudely asking us to hurry up. When we didn't comply with his orders, we heard him talking about us with another employee. Not to mention while we were actually ordering and eating our food, the waiter kept commenting on how much we were eating. Overall, the food was great, but the staff was brusque, unfriendly and down-right offensive.
