Been going here ever since it opened. Good cheap food, great wait staff that never keeps you waiting even when they're crowded, which is often because in Flatbush, we ain't dumb. Don't bring a crowd - four is max they can sit and you may have to wait a few minutes at peak times in early evening. Baked pretzels are great, as is the lamb lasagna and their burgers are all good. They update menu a lot but I hope they never stop making that lamb lasagna. Mmmmmmm.
