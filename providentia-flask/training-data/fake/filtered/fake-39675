Highlight: Singapore Kari Laksa I've been to a few Malaysian restaurants, but not to this one, so I decided to give it a try and see what the restaurant had to offer. Its menu had a lot of food to choose from. DÃ©cor: The restaurant was small in size, but "average" clean and organized. I wouldn't mind the area size as long as the restaurant has delicious food to serve. Service: Great service! The waiters were attentive and courteous. When I was leaving the restaurant, they said 'thank you' and 'goodbye' to me, but not 'come again' (I just realized it lol). Even so, I still enjoyed their service. Simply saying 'thank you' to customers is a nice gesture. Common courtesy is hard to come by these days. Food: I ordered Singapore Kari Laksa, even though I was at a Malaysian restaurant. I wasn't disappointed at all. It tasted so good that I even finished the whole bowl. It was spicy and savory. I could even smell the aroma of curry. Its spiciness was moderate to my taste, and its price was reasonable based on its serving. I just wish I could have more tofu in it though. I would definitely order it again, especially on a cold winter day. Winter is coming anyway!
