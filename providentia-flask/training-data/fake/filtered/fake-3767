Would have loved to try this place out - what could be better than a low key beer on the water in the Spring?  But, I'm afraid I won't be able to as the owner of this building keeps a guard dog at the facility all year round, in deplorable conditions, with no shelter.  The dog barks all night out of misery.  Sadly, if you support this establishment, you are supporting the abuse of dogs.
