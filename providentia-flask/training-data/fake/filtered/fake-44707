As a Latino I've had better Spanish Food. This place sucks. It's a perfect location for the new transplant of whites that now dominate alphabet city. Don't waste your time coming here to find that Spanish rice or tostones or bistec, you won't find it here as i said it caters to blanquitos Latinos that don't know true Spanish food.
