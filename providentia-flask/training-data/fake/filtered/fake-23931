Finally, a Restaurant, with my namesake as an owner. Ambiance: check out the interesting paintings/murals on the wall. Small dining space. Food: 1st attempt at Kathi roll. VERY different. Did not expect the cheese laden roll to be that tasty. Only one thing. Burns right through the tongue. So be patient and dont try to gobble it. 2nd item : The very best chole bhature in state. Hands down! 3rd Item: Â interesting Dosa: paneer masala dosa. After discovering Talk of the Town . We dont go anywhere else
