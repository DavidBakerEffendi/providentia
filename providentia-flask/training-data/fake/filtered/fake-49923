I have to say, City Steam is my favorite watering hole in the entire state. I work in Hartford and come here for lunch - They have an express lunch menu that is the best value in Hartford. I often swing by after work, or come back on weekends as well. Admittedly, it helps that I have company parking in Hartford, but that's not really the fault of the establishment. I loved the place so much my friends and I joined the Mug Club, which is a fantastic deal in itself. I could put away Naughty Nurse everyday for the rest of my life, haha. Such a great beer. They have rotating brews and stock brews that are all at the top of their game. The food is always terrific, and they really support their locals - before I joined the club my company got a big food discount. The fact of the matter is, City Steam has been an incentive to move to Hartford for a few of us and it should absolutely be proud of that.
