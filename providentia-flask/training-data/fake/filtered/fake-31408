Love this place...and would absolutely recommend it for dinner and/or drinks...even for locals.Once inside you dont feel like you are attached to a hotel. Wait and bar staff all so super friendly. Food is amazing. My few pointers for the bar: wish they had an official "drink menu"; St. Germain Liqueur and Ginger Beer. Â But the bartenders are so acommodating and always willing to mix you a "mystery" cocktail when they dont have the ingredient you ask for. Will go back often....
