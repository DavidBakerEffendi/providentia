Shifty's started out solid 5 stars when they first opened up. Good vibes, banging tacos, and awesome prices. Little by little, they began to disappoint - menu items started disappearing, prices went up, and CONSISTENCY was lacking entirely. Every time I would order the black bean Little Blast, it would come with a mysterious white sauce which ranges from a fantastic smoky sour cream accompaniment, to questionably mayo, and definitely ranch dressing a few times. Ranch dressing and black bean tacos? In the beginning tacos came with banging salsas and the works, and now, will occasionally be presented with a few sad shreds of lettuce. Sad to say that the tacos get sadder and sadder and I wanted to believe in you guys. Chips were originally thick crunchy delicious homemade tortillas, and seem very much store bought now. I see what you're doing here Shiftys. Please bring back the good vibes.
