came here for lunch tuesday. didnt have the buffet bc the selection was so-so. nothing too great. i tried to order from the menu but asked for 5 things and they either didnt have it that day or they "sold out". so we were forced to have the lunch menu. the food was okay, it was really fresh since it wasnt that busy that day...so there was the ring of the dry crust food in the serving pans. but the naan was really yummy. the staff was friendly too.
