Just bought four cupcakes and started with the Carrot cake. Not only was it hard but it taste like soap. I gave it to two of my co-workers and they said the same thing. No of us can get the taste out off our palettes and are not willing to risk trying the rest. Total waste of $14.00(3.50 a cupcake). Never again!!!!!!
