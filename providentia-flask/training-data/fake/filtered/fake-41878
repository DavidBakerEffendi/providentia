Absolutely fantastic! Our server, Angelo was as handsome as he was helpful. They bought breads and olives to the table to start, the selection of domestic and imported beers was extensive and reasonably priced; along with the plethora of wine available by both bottle and glass. I had the Italica salad, and our darling waiter suggested I add mushrooms, which was incredibly good. Perfect salad to dressing ratio, well distributed cheese and walnuts, and the beet was perfectly fresh and prepared to prevent mess :) One of the people I was eating with ordered the Gnocci Alla Baba which I had the pleasure of tasting and it was so good I could have wept. There are few things in this world as enjoyable as having that amazing creation grace your taste buds with it's presence. It's a vegetarian option but would be satisfying for even the most discerning meat eater. My other companion ordered the Rigatoni Alla Trecolori which, although I didn't personally try, he absolutely loved. The three of us shared the Ricotta baked cheesecake and a Tiramisu on Angelo's recommendation which were even better than expected. All of the meals were fantastically portioned, the atmosphere in the restaurant was overall very nice, even with the first floor at capacity, it was hardly bustling and the highly capable wait-staff were checking in at comfortable intervals to ensure everything was going smoothly. All in all, it was a wonderful experience and I hope I can dine there again during my stay in the city.
