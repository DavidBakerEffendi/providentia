When I think of Downtown, now I automatically think of Manhattan Proper. Best way to describe this is a relaxed sport bar, that has a clean/fresh feel once you walk in. Great looking staff (women), that truly connect with its patrons, and make you automatically feel a part of the environment. Prices were very reasonable for the area. I came in on a Wednesday, and it seemed like everyone there was successful. Great vibe....Was a bit crowded at times, so hard to get around, but i'm assuming this is now the go to spot after work. Drinks were strong as well. Downtown is coming back, and Manhattan Proper proved itself to me. Highly recommend you check it out! Great looking crowd, and not your typical TriBeca Bar. Will definitely be back to do it the Proper Way!
