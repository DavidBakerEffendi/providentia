This place looks like someone converted their home into a diner/cafe.  There isn't much seating and what there is is packed in so tight that you do not have a lot of room at the tables.  The decor (what there is of it ) is very cheap and sort of looks like someone's yard sale leftovers.  The place was packed when I arrived for breakfast, however.  I had to stand by the door for 10 minutes to have a place to sit.   When I got a table, the waitress was very friendly.  She promptly brought coffee.  Eventhough it was served in a chipped mug that had seen better days, the coffee was delicious. Better than Dunkin Donuts and at less than half the price.  Breakfast arrived rapidly. The portions were huge. The hash was heavenly good, so were the potatoes and eggs.  So good, in fact, I'd swear my Grandma fixed it, if I didn't know better.  I went back the next morning for pancakes......oh my...better than my Grandma's.   I just wish this place had free wifi.  If it did, I'd show up every morning, if I could.
