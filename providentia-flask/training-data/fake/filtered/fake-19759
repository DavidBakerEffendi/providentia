We tried this place on a Friday evening before attending a Bonnie Raitt concert.  The food was quite good, but the real high point for us was our bartender, Keith.  He was attentive despite how crowded the bar became.  He was knowledgeable about the menu, and made our entire experience a very pleasant one.  We would eat here again, possibly even on a non show night.
