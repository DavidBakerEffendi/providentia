The food was good and the ambiance was fantastic. I'd definitely be a regular had it not been for the TERRIBLE service we received. Apart from getting our drink orders mixed up twice (2 cokes and a cooper's beer) we waiting over 50 minutes for our food. The waitress was extremely rude and not at all attentive. Being a former waitress myself, i always make sure to be a good tipper (i don't think i've ever tipped below 10%) and to tip according to the service. Accordingly me and my fellow diners tipped just over 10% as the service was bad to say the least. As we were almost out the door, the rude waitress comes over to us and says the following: Waitress: Was something wrong with your food or something? Me: Excuse me? Waitress: You only tipped 10%. Here in America we tip at least 15. So what was your problem with it? I can't get over that encounter with that exceptionally rude waitress, which is a shame because the food was really good.
