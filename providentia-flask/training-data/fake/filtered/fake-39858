Seriously the best Thai experience I've had.  The waitresses are all really cool and very hands on without being too hands on.  The chefs actually bring the food to your table.  The prices are totally reasonable and I love the Thai pop soundtrack playing in the background.  Oh yeah and the food is great as well.  The only downside is you'll never find it unless you're really looking for it.
