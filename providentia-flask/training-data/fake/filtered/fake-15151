I ordered off of Grub Hub because it was the only sushi restaurant still open at 9:30 when I wanted to order. The sushi arrived fast but when I opened it I was extremely disappointed. I ordered 2 vegetable rolls intending to eat one and save the other for lunch the next day. They only gave me one container with what looked to me like the equivalent of one roll....so they either messed up the order, or their rolls are half-sized and they put both in the same container. Then I tried it....the worst vegetable roll I've ever had, and they are pretty hard to mess up. I paid an extra $1 each for avocado and cucumber, which I don't understand because they were basically the only vegetables in the rolls besides lettuce (who puts lettuce in sushi..?) The avocado was brown and the whole roll was soggy and fell apart as soon as I tried to pick it up. I picked out some of the rice to eat but ended up throwing out the whole thing. NEVER ordering from here again- $12 for basically one, inedible veggie roll....so disappointing
