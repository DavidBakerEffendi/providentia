An amazing find. I was looking for a restaurant to celebrate my birthday with a group of 12. I also wanted to find a spot that had a flamenco show on Saturdays. As soon as I came in to make reservations, I knew this place would be great. The decor is great; it's an intimate, low-lit place with exposed brick walls. Dinner was amazing. The best part was definitely the flamenco show. It is free, and lasts for hours. The dancers and singers were top notch!!! I felt like I was back in Madrid watching a show. The service was also amazing; with such a big group, our waiter was always available, smiled, and served us very quickly. The food was good, and there is a big variety of sangria. The prices for the tapas were also very reasonable. There is a flamenco show every Thursday & Saturday at 8:30. It is a must!
