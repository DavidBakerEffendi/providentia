My experience at Shogun 27 has turned me off of using Yelp for ethnic food.  I really, really like Japanese food, and have experienced enough Japanese food to know that this was a bad Japanese food experience.   I typically don't do hibachi restaurants, but I was looking for a place that had food options for little kids.  We had did the non-hibachi dining - chicken teriyaki, sushi for two. * Decor - Little beaten up inside.  Ceiling tiles were old and dirty.  Sat in a booth by the window.  Tables were clean, but the wood edging was sticky (the kind of sticky requiring sanding down and re-varnishing).  The both benches were too far from the table. * Chicken Teriyaki (below average) - chicken was overcooked so that the edges were chewy.  Only the center of the breasts were still soft.  The teriyaki sauce was a little artificial tasting.  Onions were ok.  I didn't touch the noodle side dish * Sushi (not good) - tuna, yellowtail, salmon, spicy tuna roll, salmon roll, shrimp, mackerel.  Rice and fish were too dry.  Rolls had too much rice, and were really poorly rolled.  Salmon wasn't bad. * Service - The servers were nice.  Attentive. I am not coming back to Shogun 27.  It is a Japanese of last resort restaurant.  Unless you are specifically looking for hibachi (which I didn't try), take a pass.
