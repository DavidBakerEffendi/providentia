If your looking for good spanish food and a friendly environment this is not the place to go. My husband and I stopped in after about two years and this place that once was welcoming to families is now a DIVE!  Since we thought the food would still be good we decided to order to take it back home.  We ordered Carne Frita,( fried pork) It was a thin sliced pork chop fried in old oil and they burnt it.  The yellow rice was tasteless, and the beans were wartery.  We also ordered the two of their  famous Mofongo, I asked them to put the Seafood my husband wanted in a plastic container so that it would not spill out of the take out box and they did not ...so of course the juices from the garlic seafood spilled out and into the other takeout box of Mofongo with Chicharon... now what can I say about the chicharon.. MY DOG wouldn't eat it and I'm not kidding.  It was old meat they must have had under a heat lamp for at lest two weeks. Dry  meat with alot of fat that had that old grease smell to it Lesson learned...if the place looks bad it must be.  I am just greatful we didn't get food poisoning.  Total cost of food $40.00 total value of food 1 cent.  You've been warned stay away....
