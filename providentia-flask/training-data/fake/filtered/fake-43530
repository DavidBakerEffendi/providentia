We sat down, looked over the menu, and the owner himself came over to take our order and then proceeded to literally criticize us to our faces about our order. "I would rather send another server than take a crappy order." That is only about 1/3rd of what he said to us.  We were so shocked that we almost got up and left.  I cannot believe ANY owner would ever be so arrogant as to insult his customers!!  How were we supposed to know what HE wanted US to order?!  It felt like the soup Nazi.   Do NOT eat here.  Food was very overrated.  Have had better Chinese takeout.  Owner is an arrogant jerk, to put it blunty.  I prefer a place with a little more humility...a LOT more actually.
