I have found my new favorite restaurant!  La Calaca Feliz was highly recommended by a foodie friend.  Boy was she on target!   The interior has the beautiful bones of the previous restaurant with an elegant Mexican flair. Service was very friendly and welcoming.  Nice to hear servers present Mexican food with a Spanish lilt in their voice.   Hubby & I tried 4 appetizers - the meatballs, pulpo, chorizo & duck.   Meatballs were perfectly cooked, with cheese in the middle.  These had a nice full flavor that did not get lost in the mourh.  Pulpo was nicely seasoned and pleasant.  The chorizo we fought over and sent a clean plate back to the kitchen.  They are served with a tortilla and frankly,  I'll have to order them again to figure out what is in there in addition to the chorizo and beans.  The duck - well , we had it after the chorizo so frankly I don't remember.  Each plate was unique and so good we'd have ordered 2 of each, but that would have meant another hour on the treadmill.   I definitely will be back.  So glad it is in the neighborhood so we don't have to deal with the weekend crowds other reviewers are struggling with. But what the heck,  a few margaritas even the whiners may relax and enjoy the night!
