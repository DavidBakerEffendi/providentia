Amazing amazing amazing Indian food. If I lived here I would be a regular. I can't wait to come back to this restaurant!! Wonderful food, nice ambiance and great service! My favorite Indian dish is paneer tikki masala, which is what I typically get when I go to an Indian restaurant. The food is so flavorful and very Indian with all the right spices. The attentive and helpful staff add to the experience. Also like that they are linked to opentable for reservations, which is quite rare for Indian restaurants in the neighborhood. That's a REALLY decent tab for quality food and service. I'm looking forward to eating there again!
