This is by far the best food around! The owner is awesome and so is the staff. We look forward everytime my wfie Mildred and I go there. We have never been disappointed . The food is so tasty and the variety on the menu is unmatched. We've eaten all over the country and overseas in Asia, this is our favorite spot!
