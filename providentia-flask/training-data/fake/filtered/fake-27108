I went to this place a week ago and I was suprised when I walked in, the place was nicely designed! It is inside a strip mall afterall. I was seated by a nice gentleman who I found out later to be the manager of the place. He suggested the live scallops to me. I thought I would give it a try here and LOVE IT! So fresh found out they only offer it on fridays and saturdays when its just in, not like some places that keep it for a while even after it goes bad, ick! Anyways, I ordered the chicken hibachi afterwards, absolutely fabulous! The chicken was so thick and tender and the price was reasonable. The service was good and the manager seemed to have a good sense of food pairing. I read some other reviews of this place and I don't know what myrtle was talking about but the service was excellent and the food is top notch! I guess you can't please everyone. I would definetly come back here and try the Korean dishes next time can't wait!
