As a sales professional, I spend a lot of time on the road looking for a place get some work done. I have three requirements; good coffee (read: not burnt tasting), nice food selection, and comfortable atmosphere where cellphone use is tolerable. They receive check marks for all three. But they actually go above and beyond. They serve La Colombe coffee, a delicious selection of Israeli/Mediterranean food, and a great menu offering both sweet and savory items. I'm happy to see their policy about limited time on the internet when they are busy. The only people who criticize that policy are probably those that couldn't even imagine what it is like to own a cafe. The goal is to make money...it's a business! People who go to sit in coffee shops for internet and not spend money are very rude. I like this place so much that I have no problem buying a gift card for $10 or more so that I can purchase smaller $$ items whenever I am in the neighborhood. Every neighborhood should have a place like this...they break the mold and set a very high standard! If you haven't been there yet, you should check it out.
