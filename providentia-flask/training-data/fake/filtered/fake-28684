Came here on a Friday night and sat at the bar, the bartenders where amazing and very helpful advising in me about the beers as I didn't know all of them. The were very attentive as the Night went on and I never had to wait for a drink! The food looked great and a lot of people where eating both at tables and the bar. I ordered the ribs which where unbelievable! I was joined by a few friends and asked could we move to a table which was no problem at all, an there was no problem transferring my tab over to the table. Here the waitress looked after us and was so nice and polite and very fast at taking out orders and getting our drinks, once again we never went without having a drink. My friends ordered some munches and again they where all out of this world, and came very fast! Excellent staff, excellent drinks, excellent atmosphere can't wait to come back as soon as possible!
