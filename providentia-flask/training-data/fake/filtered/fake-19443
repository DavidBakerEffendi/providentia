The Â hot dog with the works was the worst sandwich I have ever eaten. The potatoes were terrible, the hot dog was all shriveled, the peppers were uncooked and the roll was soggy. The steak sandwich with the broccoli rabe was worse. Won't be going there any more. There is not much you can do to ruin a hot dog but Jimmy Goes has managed to do so.
