I read a few reviews that were bashing this spot and there were people who were claiming that the glory days were over.  Those people couldn't be further from the truth.  The brunch is always amazing.  My favs include, the pancakes (3 fluffy huge ones that I always have to share--no syrup needed) with chicken apple sausage on the side, huevos vaqueros and the poached eggs with the salmon hash.  The bloody mary made me change my mind about the drink and realize that I do in fact love tomato juice as a chaser lol.  Lastly, the coffee makes me moan a little (wish they gave refills).  The only not so good things is the outdoor seating (too small and faces the back of a bunch of prewar buildings) and the baked goods.  Other than that try it all including their lunch and dinner options.  Cheryl's is here to stay!
