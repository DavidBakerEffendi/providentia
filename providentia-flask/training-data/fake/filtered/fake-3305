This place is one of the best restaurants in NJ, especially if you want some real German Swiss food.  I drive almost 1 hour each way to get there and back. Oh how I wish they were closer.   Love Love Love this place.  Poor Mark from Hillsborough.  Keep going to McDonalds Mark.  Food is reasonable and so so good. If you are into Chinese or sushi this is not your place.  The pub is a pub you can't expect fine dining in a pub.  I am not an outdoor diner so I can not comment on that . I can say,  the meals at Phesants Landing is as fine a meal as you will find in the Hillsborough area. I can assure you of that. As for drinks one of the best cosmopolitans I have ever had and they don't rip you off for a glass of wine.  Do not miss going to this restaurant.  If you have not been there it is well worth the trip. I am not related to or part owner of Phesants Landing.  I wish I were. Paulette D Union County
