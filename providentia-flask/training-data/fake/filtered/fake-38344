This place is great and went there based on the good reviews on here.  The only thing that was off-setting were the host and the pizza making guys.  For some reason, they had a very serious demeanor and they looked like they were goin to a funeral.  Several times I made eye contact with the pizza guys and no smile, not even a word!  It was my husband, myself and my 3 yr old daughter.  My daughter was oohhhing and awwwing watching them make the pizzas and not one of them said hi to her or even acknowledged her.  And she is the cutest!!  Anyways, yes, the food was amazing!   The pizzas were incredible and we'll definately go back.  But those guys need to have a personality adjustment...for real!
