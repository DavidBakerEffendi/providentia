We came down to try this place and were super glad we did. Excellent delicious new York pizza.  Just the way thin crust should be.  A lot of the other pizza places have become generic (familiars?) but this place stays true to the concept of new gotten pizza.  So good.  Def wirth a try when you are in the area
