First of all, I'd like to say that the decor is very cool! It is so NYC style. The hanging lanterns, wooden wall are just great! My most favorites are Spare ribs sugar canes and Catfish claypot. They are to die for!! The staff there they are very friendly and helpful. They are very knowledgeable with their food. They recommended us great stuff. Ohh Obao Sunray is just to die for as well! Everything in here is just perfect when I was trying to see what other people here on yelp would recommend and see some bad reviews. Too bad they just had a bad day to not enjoy this place. This is a definitely come back!! Great food and service!! One of the best places in HK.!!
