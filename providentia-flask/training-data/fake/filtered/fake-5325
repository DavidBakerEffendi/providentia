Came here late on a friday and were told there was over an hour wait, but the host took my number, and actually called me as i was having drinks at a bar nearby to tell me a table was ready in less than a half hour. once we got there, margaritas were very interesting flavors Â (and nice and strong) and the guac and chips were amazing--as were the enchiladas. ambiance was crowded but it was a nice night so all the windows/doors were open creating a great date dinner. waitress was very friendly and ended up giving us free chips&guac--still not sure why. loved it there, worth the wait!
