Congratulations to Brooklyn Crab! You have successfully replicated your business model which has seemingly worked at Alma.  Your rooftop deck and views of the harbor are fantastic but you do not care to supply your customers with comparable food and service in order to actually be a success.  If you keep relying on your views and ambiance and choose to provide terrible food, service, management, experiences to your patrons you will find yourselves out of business once real restaurants begin to move in.  Improve on your businesses rather than sitting back and taking people's money without any care for what you put on a plate, how you put it on the plate, how much you put on the plate, how much you charge for that amount, how you treat the customer and most importantly how you retain a customer.  Shame on you for your prices and your disregard for those willing to pay for some semblance of a good experience.
