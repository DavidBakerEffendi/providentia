I went for a sandwich here based on Yelp reviews because I am in town from California.....and ordered the turkey sandwich with smoked apples.  It was a big zero, not memorable in any way and I only ate half.  I am re-rereading the reviews and I see there are three times as many for this place as for any other in the area.  Makes you wonder who's writing them.  Eat someplace else.
