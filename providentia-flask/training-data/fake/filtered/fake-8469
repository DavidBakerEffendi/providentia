Love this restaurant! Easy to get to from N.J., easy parking w/parking lot  just across the street, casual, and great food!! Yum!! My husband and I have been going for years. Whenever we go to Philly this is our  place we love to go to. Only thing is they don't take reservations. Usually go to the bat next door and they call us when the table is ready so it's not that big of a deal at all and so WORTH IT!!
