i got to say im dissapointed after hearing all the hype not to say the pizza wasn't good but i think it was just over hyped and to expensive but with all the talk about the place he can def get away with it... and i understand he uses evoo, three different types of cheeses and reggiano Parmesan its i guess wen ur Italian u expect theses kind of ingredients and i wasnt thrilled
