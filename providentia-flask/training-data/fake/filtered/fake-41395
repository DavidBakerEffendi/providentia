absolutely horrible, this is the worst food and restaurant i had ever went to. not only did we wait for a table 5 months there was also hair in the meatballs from the chef. i refused to pay and michelle the manager was threatening to call the police. save your money and time from this dump you are better going to il mulino in nyc where they treat you much better than this dump in harlem. they try to make it like there food is good but at the end of the day its all a hype to swindle your hard earned money at this over priced restaurant.
