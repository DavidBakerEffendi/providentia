JUST LIKE GRANNY USED TO MAKE! The soup here is incredible; just exactly like the very best homemade soup you've ever had.  I am so glad I stumbled upon this place.  The standards, like chicken soup, are offered, as well as many other unique and unusual blends.  Best of all, if you get hooked on a favorite soup that is not being served hot on the day you stop by with a yearning, there's likely a container of it in the refrigerator that you can take home and heat up.  I've never personally had any of the deserts here, but I bought the rice pudding for someone for who loves rice pudding (ie, he has a lot of experience with it and is particular) and he gave it rave reviews.
