So I really wanted to like this place but was pretty disappointed. First, service was iffy. It was just me, myself and I and I was pretty much ignored by my server for larger tables. Don't worry about me- I don't need that glass of expensive wine if you don't care enough to ce and check up on me. On to the food - I had the steak tartare which was bland and served with what I assumed to be garlic bread but was so burnt I couldn't really tell. For an entree I had the Atlantic cod. The cod was edible if not extremely bland but the accoutrements were TERRIBLE!! Â The potatoes were crunchy and barely cooked and the artichokes were burnt and tasted like charcoal. Bottom line, I won't be going back.
