i had a dinner with my friends who are crazy about sushi but most of us were not satisfied with them. it seems to me that the prices were so high considering its quailty.  moreover, you should know the fact that one roll will be only 4 pieces instead of 6.   You would better try Vic's sushi bar before wasting your money at Zento.
