I am going to Di Fara for over 45 years. I laugh now to see how popular Dominick has become. It is very well deserved; every bit of his fame and following. He is a true artisan and comes from a far too fast disappearing generation. He treats everyone with respect. He always has from the time I was still a child. His thin crust pizza was always super thin before that became popular. And his Sicilian variety always a very complex tasting experience. I don't like the lines however his pizza is well worth it. One more thing; the entree's are often overlooked but they shouldn't be. His Shrimp sauce over pasta is incredible as is the rest of the food that comes from that kitchen.
