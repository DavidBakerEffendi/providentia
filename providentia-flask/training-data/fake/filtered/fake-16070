I've been going to Cafeteria for many years -- first while living in NYC and later during almost every trip visiting frequently from Texas. I've always liked the food and atmosphere. French toast or eggs benedict with salmon for brunch, burgers for lunch. Always good. However, this last time, and it will be the last time I go to Cafeteria, when I asked for more maple syrup, since the thimble-sized original amount was not sufficient, the server frowned and said she would have to put in an order from the kitchen. It took a while -- longer than it should have for another thimble of maple syrup especially since I was waiting. Did they have a maple tree out back and had to tap the sap? She did not tell me I would be charged for ithe maple syrup but I kind of suspected it considering what she said about ordering it, etc...and how long it was taking. Needless to say, serving a barely sufficient amount of maple syrup in the first place and then charging for more is ridiculous. My sister who lives down the street who wasn't there with me that day said I should have complained to the manager. I chose not to make a big deal out of it. If after all of these years Cafeteria wants to take the attitude that they can do whatever they want to make the most money possible from customers, then so be it. That is their right. However, there are plenty of other perfectly fine places around the neighborhood to eat where nobody will think twice about giving me as much maple syrup as I want without any fuss.
