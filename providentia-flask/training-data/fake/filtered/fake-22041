This place has to be Philly's best kept secret! We were walking past when one of the employees assured us they were opened (currently there is scaffolding in front of the entrance). My wife and I were looking for a place to eat, and what a great little restaurant it turned out to be! I judge all Italian restaurants on one dish Linguini E Vongole. I have had this all over the country, if I've had better I'm at a loss to tell you where it could have been. My wife had the Gnocchi, she loved it. Just a quaint little place, a definite must do if you're looking for a great place to eat. Jennifer our waitress was wonderful, I didn't catch the waiters name, but everyone was just great. It is a BYOB restaurant, but we aren't big drinkers so it wasn't an issue for us. We were offered a complimentary glass of wine.
