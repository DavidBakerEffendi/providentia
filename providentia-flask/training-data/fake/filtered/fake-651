King of Shish Kabob in Woodland Park, NJ might as well be known as King of 'insert menu item here' - their kabobs are good but their shawarma is to die for, their lamb stuffed grape leaves are addictive and their house made Syrian lamb sausage is out of this world - and everything else not mentioned here is also super tasty. The chef/owner Michael Ibrahim and his staff are the friendliest bunch, service is very good and prices are awesome. They fancied up the place with a new coat of paint after the New York Times paid them a visit and posted a positive review. King of Shish Kabob is BYOB and offers plenty of parking.
