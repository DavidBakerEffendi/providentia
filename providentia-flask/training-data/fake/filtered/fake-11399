Being from Europe it is difficult to find the food that you are used to. That is why we love eataly. The pasta, the bread, the meat, the cheese, it all tastes like home and somethings even better! Their hot chocolate is divine and they icecream to die for. The only reason I do not always get icecream there every chance I get is because the number of people in line to get it is somewhat disencouraging.
