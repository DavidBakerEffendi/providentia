I went there for the first time this morning, and I fell in love. You walk in and you are welcomed with beautiful pastries (that taste even better than they look). The chocolate croissants were fresh and the cherry hazelnut tart was the perfect sweetness. Pair it with a cup of coffee and you've got a recipe to get through the morning.
