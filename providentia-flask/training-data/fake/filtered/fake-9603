We were up in Bayonne for thanksgiving and decided to give the place a try.  Overall we were happy with the experience. For appetizers we got the chicken satay and the pork dumplings.  The satay was decent but the dumplings were quite literally something I've bought in the frozen food section of the grocery store.   I'd expect a sit-down place to make their own or to at least have some of higher quality. For I our main courses she got the hibachi (shrimp and scallops), her "strip and scallops" was misheard.  That being said,  they're was plenty of food and she enjoyed it all.   I got the filet off of the "from the kitchen" menu.  It was slightly underdone "I ordered med rare", but not too rate for my taste.   It was a very tender and flavorful cut of meat.   I'm picky when it comes to steak and I would give that 5 stars. For dessert we were hoping for the mochi green tea and red bean ice cream but had to settle for the regular style of those flavors.   The green tea was pretty good but was more like a chocolate green tea.   The red bean was pretty chunky and did not have much sweetness to it. Our server was polite and attentive and the other employees were very nice (host not impolite but not friendly sorbet). The main dishes and service earned the rating.   Just avoid the dumplings.
