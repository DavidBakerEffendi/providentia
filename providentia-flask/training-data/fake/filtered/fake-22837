The general manager at Cici's North Brunswick is STELLAR! So hospitable, warm and welcoming. Fun, fast and easy food at a terrific price. The cinnabuns are to die for (I do NOT want to know the calories). Great place for kids as well with a fun play area with video games in the back. Stay, eat, and relax as long as you like. Definitely a fun little joint in North Brunswick. Would recommend to a cash conscious person!
