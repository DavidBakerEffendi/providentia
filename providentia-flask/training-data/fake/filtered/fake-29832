Our favorite Portuguese restaurant in Newark's Ironbound neighborhood by far.  Have been going for years and am never disappointed.  It can get crowded so be sure to have a reservation or go off hours.  My top three dishes here are the cockles in garlic sauce (appetizer) enough to share with 4-6.  They are small, succulent cockles, better than any steamed clams you've every had.  Be sure to sop up the sauce with the wonderful, fresh, rolls.  As either a main dish or an appetizer you should have their mussels in tomato sauce.  I only eat mussels if they aren't fishy and these are a winner.  Even good next day cold if you have leftovers.  Plenty for two people to share as a main dish or more folks as an appetizer.  Also, big enough to share (if you're getting the idea that the portions are large, you are correct) is my hands down fav main dish, Frutos Do Mor Na Cataplana - Seafood in a light red sauce served in a copper kettle.  It's incredible and again, you will sop up the sauce or put it over the rice that comes with it.  It's a mix of lobster, clams, mussles, scallops and other fish and the sauce isn't heavy like a marinara but is light and with a hint of sweetness. I avoid the codfish because it's a dried, salted codfish (typical for Portuguese food) and I would rather have fresh fish / seafood.  Their steaks are good too if you must. For ambiance we try to sit at one of the tables in the front near the bar.  Be sure to specify that if you are a party of 4-6. The staff is friendly though busy.  We always get the "green" wine too.  Blue label on the bottle.  Perfect with the fish.  It's a young white wine that is refreshing and not at all expensive.  As a red wine drinker, if it's white it's got to be exceptional and this is. Desserts are standard fair though their flan is really good, we usually walk down the street to a bakery and get fresh natas instead.
