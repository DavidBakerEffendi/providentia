Cuba is a good place to eat dinner at. My family and I enjoyed our dinner here a few weeks ago. My wife is a big fan of Cuban food and loves this place. The service was really great our waiter was kind and very attentive. The drinks we ordered were also very tasty, if you haven't been to this place and you like Cuban food you should try it.
