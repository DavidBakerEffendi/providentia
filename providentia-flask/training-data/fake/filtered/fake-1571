This cozy spot was introduced to me by my sister from another mister (sharon) and I have been thanking her ever since.  The food is amazing. It is fresh, delicious and will have you wanting more.  Other Indian restaurants have fatty meat but this place uses lean cut meat with no fat and did I mention fresh and cooked to serve. You can see the care given to each dish.  Compliments to the Chefs and to the hospitable owners who greet each customer.  The mom and pop duo are very kind and make you feel like a guest and not a customer.  I highly recommend this wonderful little restaurant to anyone who appreciates good food and kind people.   To the owners, thank you for the birthday cake. You are too kind and I will be back.
