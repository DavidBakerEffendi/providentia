As a business owner, I get together with my friends at least once a month.  My friends, also business owners, always share do's and don'ts that we experience along our way in business aspects.  We also catch up with personal events.  We enjoy our time at Mr. Sushi because the sushi is always fresh and good.  We bring our own bottle of wine and they have always supplied us with glasses and wonderful service. We really like going there. Zentient, Inc.
