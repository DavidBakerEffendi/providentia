My husband and I went to Terrazza on Friday night.  We heard there was both a new owner and a new chef.  The place was hopping, but we still got a great table right below the kitchen where we could see the new chef at work.  The food was excellent. Pastas were cooked perfectly and super delicious. We had the special fish entree and a main menu short rib entree.  Seriously, it was the best short rib I had ever had.  The wine list was terrific and had new offerings we had never seen, which was a treat.  The staff was attentive and the new owner came over to the table to say hello, which was really nice. Terrazza is a winner, we'll definitely be back!
