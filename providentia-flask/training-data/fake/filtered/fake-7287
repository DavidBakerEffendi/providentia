bald doorman was real cool guy. I was commiserating with him about how douchey the people inside were. So much keeping up with the joneses, everyone looking at their iphones, no real communication/socializing/fun being had. Just a bunch of posing. Steaks at Peter Luger are better, though they aren't too bad here.
