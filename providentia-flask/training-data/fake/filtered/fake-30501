Yes, this is as good as it gets!  I have been eating tomato pies since I was a little girl.  We would cross over the river from PA to go to Chambersburg.   However, I never went to Papa's, as a matter of fact,I never even heard of them until I saw the sign--- opening soon.  Sometimes it will take me 20 times to get thru on the phone for take out, but it is worth it!!!!  I like it better than the place down the street primarily because the sauce isn't as sweet and my kids like that it isn't so well done.
