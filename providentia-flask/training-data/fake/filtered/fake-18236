Pig and Prince sits in a beautiful, renovated space that's unusually sophisticated for a Montclair restaurant. Our hopes also were raised by an interesting and well-priced wine list and a tasty appetizer--a half portion of duck confit risotto. (Our first appetizer, some sort of cheesy, corny, rich dip thing, was less impressive.) Then they were dashed by our main courses--the skate and the rabbit fricasee--which were just okay. The service was great, and I'd probably go back for a drink and appetizer or two at the bar. But I don't think it's the place to go if you're looking for a great meal, at least not yet.
