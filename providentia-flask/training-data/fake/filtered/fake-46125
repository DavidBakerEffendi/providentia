Terri is absolutely delightful! Delicous, varied, yummy, mostly organic vegan choices of wonder. I adore this place! I've tried most of the things on their menu, and enjoyed them all! If I were to try and formulate a complaint, it wouldn't be about the exceptional food or service, it would be that GrubHub doesn't have all their options (while Seamless does)- but that's not so bad. :) Exquisite!
