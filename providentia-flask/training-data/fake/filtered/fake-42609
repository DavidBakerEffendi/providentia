Misleading... Its not a Tapas or a bar... Tapas i associate with spanish food... they had none.. They are obviously trying to fool the people who live in the area (mostly Hispanic).  Bar?... it seats like maybe 10 people... and like others said.. lots of conversations going on with friends.. i would call them regulars.. but i doubt this place has them... this is a once and done kind of place.  Where are the WINGS?..  A place that puts BAR and MICRO Brew on the front of the building then doesnt have atleast two or three iconic bar foods is waiste of time.. NO WINGS NO FRIES... instead they have the ultimate in dive bar food "bar pies".. that werent so good and are very inconsistent.  Last but not least, COME ON NOW WITH THE PRICES?... your in Bellville man not Montclair!... My only advice is to cut the menu items in half cut your prices, add some icons like wings, fries, onion rings, and nachos... and you will probably tripple your client tel and probably get some regulars.
