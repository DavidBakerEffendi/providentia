I really had high hopes for this place because it looks nice and is near where I live but it was bad. It was loud, the staff were rude and pretentious (they make the drinks like they do in that bad Tom Cruise movie called Bartender) they played awfulmusic, it was overpriced, and worst of all, the food was bad. The burger was no different than the one you can get at In And Out Burger but three times and price. We also got the radish salad which was literaly seven whole radishes with sea salt sprinkled on them and one or two sprigs of watercress and it was $12 - I kid you not. Don't go here. waste of time and money.
