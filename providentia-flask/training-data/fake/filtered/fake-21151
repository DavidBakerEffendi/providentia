Was surprised by  the nasty reviews about this place but my service and food was dam good!! I'm not one to come on the Internet and rave but I just got home and couldn't not post a great one . Well first I stopped by to pick up a  take out pie  since I was running late home from work and not only was the pizza the best dam pizza I had in new jersey  (  I'm originally from Brooklyn) But the help was pretty amazing....The counter girl took the time to show me and name every slice and recommend her favorites for a whole pie...she even went as far as to Carrie my food out to my car for me when I had to take an important call privately think my favorite part of the experience was when I tried to hand her 5 dollars for all of her help ...in return she smiled , declined, and said no thank you its my pleasure....showing not only kindness but class. When we ate at home the pizza was still amazing after a 10 minute car ride....perfact amount of sauce cheese and topping carried along with a thin crispy perfect crust!! there pizza is a very generous size along with generous cheese and toppings.. I found my new long term pizza place!! Highly recommend!!!!
