Such a great location and very cute restaurant vibe, too bad the food was more then lacking. The pasta was bland, the steak was tough, and the service wasnt great. The bread was amazing, i could have just eaten that for my meal and been much happier. Overall take your money to any of the other amazing restaurants in Princeton.
