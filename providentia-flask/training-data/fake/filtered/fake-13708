As a working Chef (trained in Italy). I was not too impressed by the Pizza there. For all I know it could have been an off night. So I'll give it another try later on in the year. One point I have to bring up here. The old fellow called Patsy really, really made a pest of himself tonight. For one he was way too chatty cathy for our taste and forced us to have espressos that we didn't want. My advise is this: He should take some pointers from our / his beaded server that was Highly professional and Very discreet. Come to think of it why is that kind of server working there?. Either way give it a try!
