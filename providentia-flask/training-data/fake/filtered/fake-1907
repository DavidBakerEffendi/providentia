had the same sort of experience as the previous bad reviews... long wait, horrible service, overpriced not very good food.. Â  only couple things to add are, oysters from the raw bar were obviously not fresh (smelled really fishy and left fish smell on my hands) and the atmosphere suck.. unless you like hanging out with wasted, obnoxious, 30 somethings reliving there frat boy days
