I love going there. I use to hate eating steak until I went to this restaurant. My kids are very picky eaters. They're 6 and 7 years old, but when I say Texas Roadhouse they scream and say yes mommy please I want the chicken and fries with a funny voice. I don't really have to worry if my kids get a little loud, cause its loud in there. I love it. The staff is really friendly!!
