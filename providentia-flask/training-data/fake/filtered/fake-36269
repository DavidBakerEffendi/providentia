I heard a lot of good things about Yakitori Boy so was excited to book a room to celebrate a friends birthday.  I know nothing about their food - but  Horrible customer service.  On the phone they told me they had a 24 hr cancellation policy and that I would be charged $60 if we did not show up.   So the day before our reservations there was a snow storm predicted to hit and be the heaviest at the same time as our planned party.  I called Yakitori Boy about 6:15 pm the day prior to our reservations (our reservations were for 8 pm the next night) and told the girl my party was nervous about traveling in the snow so thought it was safer that I cancelled.  She said no problem and sent me an e-mail at 6:30 confirming my cancellation - never mentioning that I would still be charged the $60.  One month later they charged my credit card $60 for cancelling to late.  Apparently their policy is to cancel by 6:30 the day prior so by the time they entered my phone call - they logged me in as cancelling at 6:35.  I called multiple times trying to figure out why I was charged but when I could get a live person, a manager was never available to talk and never returned my calls.    So - I will never go to or recommend this place to anyone - I'm a potential customer who did plan on visiting but you've already treated me with horrible customer service and unfair charges, and I haven't even stepped foot in your business yet, I can't imagine what the service must be like once you get there.
