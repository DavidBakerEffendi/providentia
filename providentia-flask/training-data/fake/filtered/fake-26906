Wow, I was really looking to this place opening up. Butcher bar offers decent BBQ for Astoria, but that's where it ends.  After going multiple times I've tried the brisket, burgers, pulled pork, and burnt ends.  Everything was just ok, but portions are small and the food is expensive for BBQ.  Sure, everything is organic and grass-fed, but I'm not sure how much of a difference that makes for smoked meat.   Bottom line: It works to satisfy that BBQ craving if you aren't willing to travel to Manhattan.
