I'm done with the Greenbelt Starbucks!!! Done! Another experience with a poorly trained, ill-mannered young employee who must think working at Starbucks requires rude, aloof, flippant, don't-really-give-a-damn-about-you service. Malik was his name. Hadn't been here in about three months, since another careless young employee refused -- yes, REFUSED -- TO WASH HER HANDS after returning to the food service area from the floor. Was sorry to see her still working there tonight. Since my complaints to the manager and the company amounted to nothing in that case, I don't expect much this time around. Greenbelt Starbucks, you are out!
