Yay Rybread. Thank you for coming to Fairmount Street. We definitely needed some more options for quick breakfast / lunch beyond the uber slow/expensive/crowded Mugshots! I had a salad with chicken, pesto, sundried tomatoes and it was great. My friends had sandwiches and paninis and those looked delicious too. We split a large chocolately cookie that was heavenly. I'm now just want to try breakfast. Someone here said it's the best coffee in the neighborhood! Looking forward to finding out.
