Bishop's Collar has all the attributes of a perfect neighborhood bar.  The staff is tenured, the beer selection is solid and the regulars are just that.  The kicker with Bishop's is the surprisingly fantastic food.  This isn't your typical bar-food.  From an amazing Sunday brunch to my fave, the chicken burrito, you can't go wrong with anything on this tantalizing menu at McDonald's prices.  I hate to let this secret out, but they'll even let you call ahead and reserve a patio table for happy hour (watch now, I'll never get one).
