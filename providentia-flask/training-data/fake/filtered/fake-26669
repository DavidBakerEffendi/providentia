So this is my first ever review!  I enjoyed myself so much that I signed up on Yelp!  But enough about that, let's talk about the food!  I had the Beet Salad and the Mushroom Pie. All YUM!  Who knew you could get gourmet pizza like that?  I like the fact that the chef gets locally sourced and organic products - that deserves an extra star!  The owner even came around and chatted with us for a bit asking how we like everything and also asked for suggestions and feedback - nice guy.  The decor was cool too. I was told that they just opened the room we were led to.  I also heard that they have a nice outdoor seating area in the back. I'll be back soon and can't wait until the weather gets nicer for outside.  Oh and it's a BYOB - nothing better.
