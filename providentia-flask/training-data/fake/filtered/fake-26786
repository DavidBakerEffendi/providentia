BE WARNED! Giving this place one star is ONE TOO MANY! I had little expectations about a chain Tex-Mex restaurant and as I expected, it was terrible. Our server asked us for our drink order and then took 10 minutes to bring us even water. My husband's beer then arrived but I had to wait an additional 10 minutes for a house margarita. My family then decided to split a few appetizers and ordered their chicken filled empanadas and nachos grande with chicken, No where on the menu were the empanadas described as having refried beans in them, but they did. They were extremely greasy and cold as were the plate of pre-assembled nachos. Â We discussed sending this all back but the service was so poor, our waitress all but forgot about us. That same evening my daughter began stomach woes and the following morning my husband and I suffered the same fate. I called the restaurant to inform them that three people felt ill after eating there, all with the exact same symptoms. The manager apologized to me and told me that he hoped my family felt better, then hung up!
