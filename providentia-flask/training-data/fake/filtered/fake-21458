This is my "go to" Indian spot. I order takeout from here at least once a week because it is insanely delicious. The service is lackluster (takeout is better than delivery or eat-in) but for me it's about the food. The samosas are thin and crispy and stuffed just the right amount -- also served with great condiments. The lassi is great in both plain and mango. I encourage you to order anything and it will probably be great. And always add a naan. You will still have a nice, complete, filling meal without it. Get it anyway! If they took as much care in the service, decor etc. as they did in the food, they would be unbeatable. Hands down some of the best tasting Indian food in the area.
