Originally had a made a reservation here for Mother's Day. Upon speaking to whoever picked up the phone about getting a vegan option, the woman was super frustrating/aloof. For a restaurant that prides itself and gains business by allegedly focusing on organic more veggie-friendly food, that staff member should be put to shame. There was literally one item on the entire holiday menu that was vegan and when I asked the woman on the phone about possibly modifying something (like leaving off the cheese--super hard) she said "oh but there are tons of vegan options already" which there totally weren't. Not helpful. Not appreciated. Cancelled the reservation. The non-holiday menu, however, looks more inclusive.
