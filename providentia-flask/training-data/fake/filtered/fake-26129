Pedestrian food. Passed off a brand X drink for a Baileys. Seated pre - theatre Sat. nite table for 2 in second floor room with group of 12 including young children. Granny put out because no chocolate milk. Must have thought it was Chucky Cheese. If for low prices would be a 2 not a 3. Overall meh.
