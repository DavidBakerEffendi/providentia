Recently had a late evening dinner after a show, and left extremely disappointed.  Positives first...the atmosphere is charming.  We had a front of the house table with a breeze wafting in from open windows, and a lively street scene serving as a backdrop to our meal.  Unfortunately, the experience was downhill from there.  I am glad another Yelper noticed the salt....way too much!  After the first "sop" of the white wine broth from my sauteed clams I had to put the bread away...the salt overpowered everything.  The same went for my braised lamb with ribbon pasta...salt, salt, everywhere.  As for the service....one word....horrible.  We had to beg for every glass of wine, and for water refills (the server refilled the table next to us and ignored our empty glasses).  We were some of the last customers in the restaurant, and in the city that "supposedly" never sleeps, they couldn't wait to get us out of there and go home.  Overall, this place is overrated.
