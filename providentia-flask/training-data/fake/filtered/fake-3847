This place is tiny (it literally occupies a small corner in the Essex Street Market, an area barely big enough to seat three). The menu changes daily (some staple items remain on the menu), and from all I've tried so far, they're all pretty good. Their tamale is great - the corn paste is very well made, and the horseradish sauce is delicious! As for tacos, I really enjoyed their meatless kale and potato taco. On a side note - they have glass bottled coke!!
