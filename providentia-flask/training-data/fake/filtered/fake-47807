Visiting Philly from San Francisco area.  Wanted seafood tonight, cehcked Yelp and found the Oyster House.  Cool place.  Raw bar is excellent.  Oysters very fresh, fried clams great, steamed clams awesome.  The heirloom tomatoe salad was really good.  Tried the urtle soup toay I had tried it, guess it is an acquired taste. Service was attentive.  I will go back here.  Oh, did I say I am very particular about my seafood... I am.  This place earned the 4 stars.
