Went there for dinner on a Tuesday night a few weeks back. Place looks great remodeled and is very clean. I was impressed with the choice of music and Waitress was very sweet when she greeted us and took our order. I ordered a cup of orzo soup to start. Very plain/bland. For dinner I had a Philly steak with fries and even though portions were large, food was still nothing special...waitress got pretty busy so I asked if she was the only one working and se said no there's also a manager who was sitting in the booth on her phone the whole time I was there. Even when she was taking care of several tables she was still very calm and polite and wrapped our food, got us dessert and make sure we were all set. When we got up to the register to pay she had to get the girls attention by calling her name 3 times to ring us out..I was a little surprised and so was the lady behind me. All in all it was not a place I'd be visiting a second time based on the food. I was not impressed and neither was my family.
