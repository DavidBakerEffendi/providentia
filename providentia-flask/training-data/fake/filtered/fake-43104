I'm typically not a big fan of Indian food, but I've been to Mehek a few times now and thought I should say a few words about it. It's definitely Â cheaper than other restaurants Indian restaurants I've been to, and the food is just as good if not better. The staff is consistently very friendly, and the service is great. A great place to go for lunch or dinner.
