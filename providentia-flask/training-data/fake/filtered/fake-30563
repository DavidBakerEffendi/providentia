The homemade bread with whipped butter was very good. We had steamed edamame as a starter, kind of hard to miss on that simple dish, they were good. I ordered the wood-fired stir fry with chicken and was quite disappointed with what should be an easy to prepare dish. Some of the veggies were burned, the chicken was dry and the whole dish which was served on a cast iron sizzle pan was drowned in soy sauce, way too much sodium. The portion was meager. My wife ordered the spanakopita and Caesar salad and found her meal to be quite tasty and to her liking. Our server was pleasant and attentive. The Richard Simmons dance music which played throughout our meal was not our idea of dinner music. Disappointed overall, would not hurry back.
