I specifically created an account to review this place. I went here with high hopes, judging by the good reviews (which I now believe to be fake), but I knew that things were going to go downhill when greeted by a rude hostess.  We were sat in an uncomfortable table that felt like it was in the middle of traffic. However my date and I tried to make the best of things, and agreed to give the place a second chance. The decor was interesting, and I thought it was pretty cool that you can almost see into part of the kitchen. When our waiter came over, he quickly shot off the specials, but when my date asked to repeat the last two dishes, he seemed annoyed. Also, my dish came out a little salty. My dates dish was excellent, so I guess on average it's okay.  However service was well below standard, and it wasn't even a busy night.  Needless to say, I'm never returning.
