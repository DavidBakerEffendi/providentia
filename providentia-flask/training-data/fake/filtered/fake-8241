If you like roast beef- really like it- this is the best place in the state to get it! When you first go in you can tell the waitress that you're a virgin (proof not required) and she will give you a sample plate with some of their roast beef, pastrami, corned beef etc that are all cooked right there. Each one is best of class-and it will be hard to make a choice-  but I prefer the beef. A heaping sandwich with AuJus and home made horseradish, a pickle and slaw will set you back about $8.95- ask for "Black Magic". Dinner is a few bucks more. And dont forget the soups- also homemade. Try the lobster or seafood bisque for a real treat. My frequent lunch partner likes the turkey best- sometimes a half sandwich and soup for about the same $. It's busy at lunch and evenings with mostly local crowd and can be a bit noisy -but you wont be disappointed in the fare or friendliness of the waitstaff. Hope those negative reviewers dont return to spoil the good vibes that makes this neighborhood "pub" my favorite. My only hesitation about writing a good review is that it may become too popular for me to get  seated every few weeks when I want to pig out on a really delicious  roast beef sandwich. See you there!
