I understand we're in NYC for the price but the taste matters. I ordered bulalo and it was not that I expected. The soup was NOT really made of REAL BEEF BROTH but ARTIFICIAL BEEF BROTH like KNORR BROTH CUBES. I called this as "Bulalo ng mayaman" (Bulallo for the rich). Another one is the soup was not really hot as fire, I believe they re-heated it using just a microwave. We've waited for about 30minutes to an hour including finding seats and table just for 3. They should serve soup based food very hot especially on the winter season. When you go to the Philippines, try Bulalo in Tagaytay, City particular in Leslie's. In there, you will taste, sip the REAL BEEF SOUP OF BULALO naturally without requesting for bone marrow as additional amount. If I could rate this as zero star or negative, I would rate this as that. Really disappointed. Sorry kabayan, just want to be true for your improvement.
