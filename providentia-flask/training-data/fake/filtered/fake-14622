First visit to BrazBQ and had the "Big Burger" which is filled with churrasco steak, ham, egg, potato sticks, lettuce, tomatoes, and corn and a very tasty sauce.  Bring your appetite.  I went as they were videoing customer opinions so got to enjoy a fellow customers review of their burger and he raved about it. Will be back for more.
