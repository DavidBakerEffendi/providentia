Nutley Diner Doen't support the "GAY" comunity Me my girlfriend and my friends went to The Nutley Diner after a nice night out. We all went Thursday the 16th of April. We received a table in the middle of the diner. We were waiting to order our food. My friend kissed his boyfriend and while he was kissing him an employee from the diner said in a mean and rude voice "don't do that here it's a public place no one wants to see that." He was so offended and hurt that He didn't feel comfortable spending his money in a diner that is going to discriminate against him because he's gay. My other gay friends confronted the employee and asked if it was two girls kissing would he had said anything? He replied "I would have loved it." One of the other staff members made a comment under his breath calling us " faggots." After that was said the altercation was brought outside where it started to become physical the staff and friends of the staff were screaming and trying to fight us calling us "faggots" and "no one wants us around here." I am a straight guy and I was hurt by the way we were treated and I hope everyone that reads this boycotts this place for this discrimination.
