Let me say that If you want Excellent tasting, Coal fired pizza this IS THE PLACE! Nothing bad to say they are the standard! If you read my past reviews you will see that I am VERY fair and balanced. There is a wait here...But it is first come, first served! BAR NONE! you and your spouse or significant other will enjoy the food. I live in NY and my wife and I make a day trip to visiting this fine establishment. You won't be disappointed! Beer also! that's a plus!
