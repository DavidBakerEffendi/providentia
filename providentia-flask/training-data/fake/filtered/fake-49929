A surprising delight just around the corner from the Hartford Stage Company.  Manager Connor went out of his way to get us settled-not easy with severe nut allergies- but the food was so tasty and well prepared, and our server Ali added to the friendly atmosphere.  Now we're fans and can't wait to go back!
