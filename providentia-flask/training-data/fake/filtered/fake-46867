One of the better sandwich places in the city. More innovative, interesting menu than 'classics' like John's Roast Pork, but i think similarly overvalued bc of perceived 'authenticity' (one of the lamer elements of philly/yelp culture and something i'll continue to harp on in my reviews).  I had the Paesono which was poorly constructed and sloppy (and not very good imo - though im not a horseradish fan). The potatoes, however, were bangin- heavily seasoned in the best possible way and something I would make a go-to snack (though stopped by  the Italian Market location where it took 20 minutes from the time of order to get them).  My main issue the time i went was the poor service.  My friend and I were the only people there on a Sunday afternoon, they forgot to make my order for 30 minutes, instead making call-in take-out orders (which they struggled to keep track of-consistently mischarging people and getting their sandwiches wrong), and did a half-assed job when they got to mine.  Was amusing nonetheless to watch the dynamic between the knuckleheads trying to run the show.
