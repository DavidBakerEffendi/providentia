I heard from my friends so much talk about this Venezuelan BYOB, so I decided to head over on a Saturday afternoon with 2 friends.  One a really picky bitch and the other has allergies to everything including himself.  We all ordered different dishes, my friend ordered the vaquero (steak with homemade fries and eggs cooked any way you choose) which was cooked gluten free for him.  His girl ordered the mango banana pancakes with maple syrup and I ordered the fish omellete with red snapper,plantains,potatoes,onions with these nice little toasty cheesy things called arepitas and a generous fresh salad. This was not the run of the mill brunch not by any means,  it was very delicious and fresh and the prices were cheap.  The little colombian waitress was so accomadating and sweet.  We were also greeted by the owners yes by the actual owners of the place who were very cool. This big bald very energetic guy approached our table and made sure we were perfectly satisfied, even the bitch didn't have a single gripe. After our plates were cleared we asked about the famous HOT CHOCOLATES (which by chance were just showcased on channel 3 just this week) well the big baldy came back and answered all of our stupid and cocky questions about his insane creations.  We then received a Hot Chocolate menu, yes you heard right.  Of course we all ordered different drinks, the clasico for doppy, the orgasmo for grumpy (that be me) and for SNOW WHITE the Calabaza king.  Just so you know while I am writing this my dog is looking at me like "WHAT THE F AHOLE LET'S GO OUT YOU LAZY BASTARD." Ok back to the review,all I have to say about Sazon is they have better Brunch than Honeys and Sabrinas especially because they are doing something very different and as far as THE HOT CHOCOLATES HOLY SHIT,nobody cantouch this lunatic guy at this place. So go try this place out but please walk your pooches first. See ya!
