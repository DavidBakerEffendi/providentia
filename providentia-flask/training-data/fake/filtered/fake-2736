An ordinary but pricey eatery. Ambiance was okay. Staff were extremely slow and in-a-way unfriendly. The products were over cooked, soup was so salty it tasted as if it came out of the ocean. Food was so-so nothing to boast about. And it was pricey (I am repeating it because you can get the same food from a run-of-the-mill Chinese eatery as a take-out).
