In each of the four times I've visited Bangkok Gardens, I experienced a disappointment of some sort, which is too bad because the place has a charming glass-covered patio that is nice to sit in. I ordered dishes from the vegetarian section - always an assortment of vegetables with tofu. While I always ask for steamed tofu, in the first three times it came fried. Also, not all of the vegetables that are listed on the menu actually come with the dish - in one case I actually sent the dish back [for the first time in my life] because it was lacking all the greens I was expecting from the menu, causing the dish to be just a small boring pile of eggplant with tofu. On another occasion, My friend and I ordered the same dish, but her portion came twice the size of mine [in general the portions are smaller compared to the other Thai restaurants on the block]. Non of the dishes I tried were spicy, they were generally too sweet and covered with heavy sauce. The waiters and waitresses kind of remind me of the soup-nazi from Seinfeld - they recognize you but never smile back. It is not likely that I will choose to return here. Other restaurants around serve better food for better prices and with a better attitude.
