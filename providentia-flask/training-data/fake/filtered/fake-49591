I went here with a group of 6 last Friday and the food was excellent.  One friend said it was the best new restaurant she's been to in at least a year.  My husband woke up the next morning still talking about it. ("Wow, that was really, really good food. The chicken was awesome.  How do they make it so tender?")  We tried almost everything on the menu and shared, and there was not one dud.  (I think the only thing we didn't taste was the lamb tartare.) Some of my favorite dishes: chicken, black chickpeas, & cilantro grilled tomato, sweet corn, yogurt, thai basil flaky bread grilled radishes and feta (and I don't even like radishes) rice with yogurt, hen of the woods, and toasted nuts flatiron steak But really, everything was out of this world delicious, interestingly prepared, and perfectly cooked.
