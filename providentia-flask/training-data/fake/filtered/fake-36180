The atmosphere, staff and the food were amazing at this establishment.  One of my favorite southern cuisine places ever. I'm not big of American dishes but Marietta has shifted my perspective on that! I'm a huge fan of spicy food and the roasted porgy was amazing! To me it's a must have dish, if you have a love for spicy food! Another dish that was really good was the fancy fried chicken, very delicious and tender, surprisingly the white meat was not dry, which was another plus! My fiancé and I had such an amazing time this is now our date night hotspot! Now they usually have a seasonal menu, which is pretty awesome because there is always something new to try and you could never get bored with the menu. The drinks were so delicious it's obvious they know how to select the right mixologist for the job. The drinks were not overpowered with alcohol, which is a plus! The atmosphere is really relaxed, a warm feeling of home!
