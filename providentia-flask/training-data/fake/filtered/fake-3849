Kind of secret place, you have to go down alley and guy at door.  Once inside it's pretty chill, small with only a few tables.  There's a large diorama of nature scene taking up two potential table spaces.  Friendly servers but they don't really speak...it ways always a little vague whether they heard the order or not. Food was excellent, we had sliders, bronzino, soba noodles, beef.  All really tasty and interesting.  Cocktails were really good too.  Very comfortable and relaxed atmosphere.  Highly recommended.
