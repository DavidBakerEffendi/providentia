Good food, bad service. *let me explain a bit though- They should have a sign that says "seat yourself" because it is a bit confusing.... anyway it was a monday night so it wasn't that busy at all.  The hostess lady who dropped off our menus said "Stephanie wil be right with you!" but ten minutes later Stephanie had never showed up.  Another employee who had walked by us numerous time finally asked "Are you being helped?" When we responded "no," he stopped and asked if we wanted to drink anything.  He leaves to grab ur drinks and didn't come back.  Now if it had been busy I could totally understand but it was a really slow night.  He finally came back, asked what our drinks were (he had forgotten "water, sprite") and eventually we managed to get food, which was great- great, but the service was ridiculously awful.  I had to ask for my bill, and when he wouldn't come up to grab the creditcard dangling from the table I went up to another server and asked them to just settle my bill.  They didn't have a pen for me to sign the receipt with.  In the end again, ok food, worst service ever. Train your wait staff.
