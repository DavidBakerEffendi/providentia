I talked into a group of co-workers into ordering Korean for dinner. Food quality was a so-so but we felt we got fleeced on the price of gimbap since they charge $6+ for a roll which contained imitation crab meat, too much rice, cucumber and radish. We ordered 6 rolls thinking it was $3 on campusfood but when we got there, we got charged extra. Also, they didn't put any sauce on the chicken wings. When we called, the old lady told me to bring the wings back so she can pour the sauce on it.
