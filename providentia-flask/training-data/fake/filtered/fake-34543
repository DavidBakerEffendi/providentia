Yeah, i heard a lot of good things about this restaurant, that's why we decided to give it a try in a beautiful afternoon.  The service is awesome and really made my day! First thing, i am a vegetarian.  They have a pretty cool "vegetarian special roll" which is really yummy ^^  This is the first time i ever had a sushi with kiwi slices and mango sauce with it.....so pretty cool...try it out, folks! They recommended the "Sweet Potato roll" which is really incredible yummy to me. I have Teriyaki Vegetable as my main dishes....i finished everything! My friend ordered a "spicy girl roll" and a special sashimi appetizer.... "Summer Madai" ?? if i didn't remember it wrong.... she said the chef's special sauce really bring out the fresh taste of the red snapper.... so she decided to try the "spicy tuna sandwich", it is a special sushi roll but looks like a sandwich!! the sauce is awesome and fabulous! I have had a really wonderful experience in this lovely restaurant.  I would highly recommend everybody go and try it out!
