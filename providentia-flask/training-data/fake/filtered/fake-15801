The restaurant was way smaller than I expected...more like a big cafe.  The fried chicken & cornbread was good, the sweet tea was too sweet, everything else was only OK (potato salad, mac n cheese, collard greens, green beans).  Waffles was OK & strawberries tasted weird.  They didn't have any sweet potato pie.  There was a fly in my daughters drink (sometimes those things happen).  All in all, was a bit disappointed.
