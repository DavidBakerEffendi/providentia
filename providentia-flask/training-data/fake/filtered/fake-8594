Now, I'm no ramen expert. But I bet you aren't either. I bet you just like good food and you're looking for a nice meal in a nice restaurant with nice servers and nice atmosphere. Chuko fits the bill on all counts. My only previous experience with ramen was through a different restaurant on Vanderbilt which shall remain nameless--a more casual spot that shuttered rather quickly after its opening due to the mediocrity of its food. Based on that experience of overly salty strange-tasting brothy vegetables, I couldn't quite imagine what all the hubbub over ramen was about. Chuko convinced me halfway through our appetizers that it could deliver seriously delicious food in unexpected combinations. The spicy pickle special wowed me, as did the surprisingly complex and savory kale salad. My dining companions were bowled over by the brussel sprout dish, of which I only had a small though tasty bite. Then came the ramen. I opted for the vegetable broth with market veggies and soft-poached egg. Two sips in and I totally understood the hype of ramen. The broth was utterly satisfying and flavorful without at all being overly salty. The egg gave a lovely richness, and the veggies which included some kind of green sprouts, winter squash, and what appeared to be roasted parsnips provided texture and a pleasant subtle sweetness. I may know nothing about ramen, but I do know that I finished every last morsel of food placed in front of me. Two hours later I was craving for more and when I woke up this morning my first thought was about how much I enjoyed dinner last night. I can not wait to go back to Chuko. And I can not wait to see what kinds of wine and beer they serve after they get their liquor license.
