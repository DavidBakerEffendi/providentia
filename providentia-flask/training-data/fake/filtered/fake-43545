This establishment is locally praised for its authentic Chinese cuisine. I was enthused when I came upon the small to midsized restaurant and the ultimate reason I was interested in eating there. I ordered the meat buns appetizer and the tofu in garlic sauce. The meat bun were several steamed mouth-sized meat dumplings with a soft sauce, or "soup" within the dumpling. Enjoy them slightly cooled. The entree, Tofu in Garlic Sauce, was very pleasant especially when the different components of the sauce were appropriately mixed, as I wasn't looking to eat a very spicy dish. (The owner/chef does offer several different entrees of varying spice levels. And, he also offers to vary the spice level of any of the entrees upon request.) Personally, I like to taste the food in combination with the spice, or I would only order the spice sauce. The entrees could easily serve 3 small portions. I would follow a traditional pattern of ordering two to three dishes and sharing with groups of 3 or more. The staff was attentive and personable. I enjoyed the experience very much. Other Notes: Hot tea and cold water are a part of the service. And, I suppose you have to request forks and knives.
