The food is excellent and very authentic (although about 6x as expensive than what you'd pay in Cuba). The atmosphere is also very nice, although a downgrade from the restaurant that was formerly there. The staff could do to be upgraded, on the several times that I've been there we've received unintentionally poor service. Great cocktails, but prepare to pay the premium.
