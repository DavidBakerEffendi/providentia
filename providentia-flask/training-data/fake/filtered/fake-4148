Don't sleep on this place's excellent dinner menu! I've been coming to Commune for my morning coffee and occasional lunch since they opened a few years ago. Not many places make the transition to dinner easily, but the team who own this place have curated an awesome menu, with inventive dishes using local and organic food. The presentation of the dishes in itself is worthy of a high end restaurant. I had the salmon with sour cream tapioca and pumpernickel dust-they call it their interpretation of a bagel with lox and cream cheese. At first I had my skepticism, but with the first bite I was hooked!! Â I also love that they give back to the community, involved in local charity efforts and cooking classes. Give Commune a shot, you won't be disappointed!
