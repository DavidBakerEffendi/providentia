We went to check out this restaurant on the friday of a long weekend. The place was moderately full but there were a couple of open tables. We were asked if we made a reservation and since we didn't the hostess politely told us that they were running slow (bcos of some family issues) and that they could not serve us. We were welcome to stay but the service would be slow. Since it was our first time the hostess didn't want us to leave with a bad impression. Now we would like to take this at face value but we were wondering why they had the place open when they weren't taking any more guests. Â And as for first impressions I'm not sure which is worse being told we cant serve u or waiting for a while for service. I don't think I will go here again.
