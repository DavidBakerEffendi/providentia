Tonight was my first time eating at Grazers and I loved it!! The food was delicious, and my server Maddison was very helpful, and overall, an awesome server! Mind you, the hosts said we had a 15 minute wait and we were seated within 5 minutes. It was great! They were so welcoming as my husband and I walked through the doors. From my understandings, Grazers has been open for a little over two months. They have got to be going through a lot with starting up a new business. From weaving out committed workers, to figuring out what works and what doesn't. You have to think, working in the food industry there is never a perfect night. Ever. Something little could go wrong, or something little could go right. Everyone makes mistakes, and everyone learns something new everyday. I'm sure you make a mistake about five times a day, whether it be at your job, cooking your family a meal, or even forgetting to put your blinker on while driving. This doesn't give the Grazer employees any excuse to be able to mess up and not fix it. My point is, things happen, and as long as people make up for the things they mess up on, there shouldn't be a problem. My burger was a little under cooked, and all I had to do was tell my server, Maddison what my issue was. She apologized and offered to take it back to the kitchen to cook it the way I asked. I took the offer, and within 7 minutes I saw her come around the corner with my correctly cooked burger all ready to eat. The drinks we're great. I loved all the options. My husband and I topped of the night with an order of Crème brûlée. I was in heaven. It was perfect. So warm and tasty! I think Grazers has a very high potential to bring in more business, and much better reviews!! Good job Grazer crew!!! I am impressed!
