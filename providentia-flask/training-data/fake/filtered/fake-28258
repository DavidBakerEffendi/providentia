Went there with my fiancé and 11month son on a Thursday afternoon. We decided to seat outside but inside the canapy they have for the winter. Waiter tried to rush us to order the moment we sat down and I orders salad, fried zucchini and zaztiki sauce. And green peppers for starters. That took 35 min waiter never came back to ask if we wanted main courses or drinks. After 45 min in I had to get up get the waiter and I was possed not from the bad service but also from two jerks talking loud on there phones and cursing and just the people two blocks away could here there BS and the staff never went over to tell them up lower the ignorant voices or to put the phones away. Now ten min over a hour finally get our main. Courses chicken kabab and pasta and seafood . Chicken kabab was raw inside and the pasta seafood got my wife sick that we just left paid the bill and no tip!!!  This used to be my fav place when the owner was there and used to put his heart and love in the place now it's a bunch of idiots and a witch hostes with an attitude !! They should of paid us to be there and put up with that BS!!!! And worse food ever!!! Rating  minus a one stat -*
