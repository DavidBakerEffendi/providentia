First off Pat's has more selection than Geno's across the street. Like Geno's- parking can be difficult, its an outdoor eating area, no restroom if you eat there, and 2 ordering windows. 1 for the cheesesteaks and another window for fries and drinks. With that said, I usually order mushroom cheesesteak with wiz and onions. The meat is chopped up but not to the extent as Jim's steaks on South St. The mushroom Cheesesteak is good but not as good as Steve's Prince of Steaks. Pat's is a strong second though. Now complaints here. Will go here again. Sure its a tourist trap. But how many places have a cheesesteak competitor across the street from them that are well known. Heck, if its your first time having a Philly Cheesesteak you can't go wrong coming here to try one then walk across the street and try the other company's cheesesteak. And on your next Cheesesteak craving trip you can try others around town to compare them to these 2 (Pat's and Geno's).
