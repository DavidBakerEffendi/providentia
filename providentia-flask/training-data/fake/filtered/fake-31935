The pizza is ordinarily good, but the staff is substandard.  I picked up a pizza that was burned and the staff tried to make me walk back to get a new pizza.  I was left on hold for 10 minutes and then the manager tried to tell us to walk back.  Her name was Anna and she supervised the whole unacceptable mess.  Thin crust pizza is everywhere.  You don't need the headache with this one.  The kids cooking the pizza are good, stay away from the wait staff and management,
