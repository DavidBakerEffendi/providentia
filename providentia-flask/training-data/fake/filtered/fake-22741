Do not go to this place! I went with my husband for lunch but we should of turned around once we saw the place was empty. The food was horrible and overpriced for what they give you. The place looked dirty and there were white little things floating in my glass of water.ewww. Then when we went to pay my husband handed her our debit card and she she asked us for cash. We were will over a the min amount so she was forced to take our debit card after my husband pointed out to her that they have the MasterCard logo on their door. Â And to top it off, today I checked my online banking and they charged their own tip without us authorizing it! I called my bank to dispute. What a horrible place with horrible service!
