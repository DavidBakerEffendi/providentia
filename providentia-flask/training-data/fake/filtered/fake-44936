Was not overly impressed. High priced, average taste, small (super small) servings. I had the skewered greek salad which consisted off two small skewer sticks each with two grape tomatoes, two klamata olives, and a chunk of feta. The rest was lettuce greens with three or four small onion slices. $7 + tax. Only 200 cal but if you want a $10 salad, go to Gia Pronto....pick your toppings and it's big enough for two meals. Â  No calories listed for desserts, including the popular banana whip. Tasted like a frozen blended banana, nothing more and nothing less. Mine was strawberry although it wasn't really. $4 + tax. I'm 5'6" and 120lbs. I didn't eat the "bed of greens", but I was left starving. Good place for dieters with money to unload. Wouldn't go out of my way to go back again. Wouldn't avoid it if I was in the area. It's just meh.
