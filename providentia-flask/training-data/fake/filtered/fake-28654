I've been to this restaurant on various days and at various different times and on each occasion service was inexplicably slow. One time I went on a Saturday night, and understandably, service was slow as the place was extremely busy. Â My last visit was on a Sunday afternoon. There were only a few other diners at that time (maybe 3 other tables) and what appeared to be the owner's family having their Sunday meal. My table ordered a plate of feta cheese as an appetizer and it took nearly 30 minutes to come out. Thinking that our order may have been forgotten, one member of my party flagged down the waitress to ask and was met with a reply of "I know. I gave the kitchen your order"--no apologies for the wait, or assurances that she would check with kitchen staff to see why it was taking them so long to cut some slices of cheese. All the while, my table sat and watched the owner's family go back and forth from the kitchen to their table carrying out platters of food and soft drinks to share with their party. That said, each time I have gone the food has been superb. The complimentary bread and olive oil is great, and the salty feta cheese makes a perfect companion. The baklava is ooey, gooey, and tasty. I even like the "Turkish Sprite" which tastes a little like the Sprite Remix that came out at the beginning of the millennium. A word to the wise: don't even think about patronizing this restaurant for dinner before seeing a movie at the local Regal cinema, you'll certainly miss your show.
