Went to a shower last month. Food was good. Service could be better. We waited an hour before we got any drinks, then the waiter taking orders was a wise guy in a rush. Once we got our food, it was flung at us. Â We were next to the entrance, so there was a lot of noise, football game on, people talking at the bar, dj from the back room testing his music. No regard to our party.
