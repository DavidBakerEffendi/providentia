The Patty Melt and the Ribeye Steak were on point here.  The Patty Melt had a nice mix of sweet and savory with the house made pimento cheese.  The Ribeye was of much higher quality than was expected, and came with a whole clove of roasted garlic.  Yumbo!  I guess I should have tried the Fried Chicken to get a true barometer of this Southern place, but I had already had fried chicken 3x this week.  Next time.
