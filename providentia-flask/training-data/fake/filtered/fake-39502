Really great spot with incredibly lovely staff.  Can get hectic on the weekend, so get in early to ensure you have time to chat to Michael (the main guy) and linger over your flat white and omelette. They're graceful about having small children/toddlers on site which is both refreshing and welcoming.  Huge thumbs up to a top notch local eatery.
