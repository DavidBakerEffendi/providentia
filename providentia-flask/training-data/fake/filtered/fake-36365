Great restaurant, with very interesting and modern interior, including a window ceiling (looked like it could open up, although was too cold on this night). Drinks were very good, particularly liked the black rum drinks and the tea drink.  Wine list was also very good, with great options at all price ranges. Loved the bread that came with the meal, especially the pepperoni/proscuitto/cheese roll pieces.  I started out with the chestnut soup, which was awesome.  Also tried the creamy polenta, raw yellowtail and mozzarella, all of which were very good. For entree, I had black pasta with mixed seafood, which was outstanding.  The duck and foie gras ravioli was also very good, as was cavatelli and venison special. Skipped dessert as appetizers and main course were pretty filling. Prices are a little high.  While I really liked it, seemed slightly pricier than restaurants of similar quality. Will likely be back, although given the amount of places I want to try, will probably be a while.  Review based on dining experience on March 22, 2010.
