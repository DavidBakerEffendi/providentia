The crust on this pizza is fantastic and the ingredients were extremely fresh.  This would probably be a five star pizza had they distributed the ingredients evenly.  Actually, it was pretty poorly done.  Jim had about 2 slices before he realized that the pizza had olives.  I didn't order half and half but yet only one side of the pizza had pepperoni and artichokes and one side had mushrooms and prosciutto.  They really missed the mark there.  Other than that, I would highly recommend giving their pizza a try. Their other items on the menu also look fantastic so, I am looking forward to trying things on their menu other than the pizza.  I plan to be a regular customer
