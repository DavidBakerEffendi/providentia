I went there on friday (9/23/11)morning with my family because I heard that the food was really good, the hostess or waitress wasn't very pleasant when we came in, but the worst of all is that she threw the menus violently on the table and just walked away, I didn't like the attitude, especially being myself a waitress i would never do that to customers. Anyway, I wanted to have a good time with my family so we just walked out of the place and went somewhere else. I am sure that the food is very good but they definitely need to change some staff, that was very unprofessional!
