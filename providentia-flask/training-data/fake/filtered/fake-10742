Visited Friday evening 2-28-14 about 5pm.  This is the best restaurant in this location ever!  Dinners were made to order, plentiful and piping hot!  The waitress was excellent.  Cocktail menu was fantastic.  Will go back for the pizza and/or happy hour in the spacious bar area.  At leaving the restaurant it was obvious that reservations may be in order later in the evening.  Definitely recommend this place.
