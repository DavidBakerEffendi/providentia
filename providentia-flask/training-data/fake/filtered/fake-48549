Went here after being at Pat's an hour earlier. BIG difference. If you want to have a great cheese steak, then stop by here. Meat was tender, bread was just right, just an awesome experience overall. It's in the hood, yeah, but me and my girl were not looking for any trouble and its relatively harmless for the most part. I've seen worse.
