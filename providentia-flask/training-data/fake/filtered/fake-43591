just had a party of 30+ in the restaurant and we had one server and no bus boy . spoke to management and she claims thats normal . I have to tell you the service was terrible not that the waitress didn`t do a great job but 30people looking for drinks ,food etc at the the same time is impossible . The manager seems to feel that it is the waitress' fault,that manager shood be replaced .We booked this weeks in advance and they gave us one waitress. We truly felt bad for the waitress , working so hard with no support from management...and then getting yelled at from an incompetent manager who couldn't manage to be accountable for her "lack" of managerial skills , but felt the need to lash out (in front of customers ) to a hard working waitress ! !
