The first time I came to this restaurant it was excellent - the food epitomized the term cooked to perfection, but I'm not sure what's happened. Almost all of the food was horribly oversalted when we dined there tonight - out of 6 dishes 4 were over-salted. I could forgive the food, though I was very surprised that a restaurant with the kind of reputation this one has would mess up in the kitchen. But what made the experience so bad that I will never return was the service. The first time we went there the food was really good, but the service was poor to mediocre at best. But the food had been so good that we overlooked it and figured it was just a bad night. This time the service was outrageously bad. I hate being served by people who act like they are doing me a favor to come to the table. Our waiter had such an attitude. He was slow to come to our table, never brought us bread, never asked us if we wanted anything to drink, never asked how the food was. We had to waive at him to order. He brought the wrong pasta order and when we told him, instead of offering to correct it, he took away the first pastas and made us wait another 20 minutes for the pasta to come out. And then at the end of the night he overcharged us for his mistake. What a dissappointing night...I would think twice about going to this restaurant. We made our reservation 3 weeks in advance, and it was definitely not worth the wait. This restaurant could be excellent, but it needs to do some quality control with the servers and the food.
