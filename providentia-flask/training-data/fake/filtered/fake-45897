My husband and I went the weekend before Valentine's Day to celebrate. For the entre my husband was served a completely different dish! He was told they were out of the dish he ordered so the chef had the waitress bring out a different dish. He was not informed of this before or asked what he'd like instead. My dish was cold and the roasted potatoes were soggy! This was a very disappointing experience!!
