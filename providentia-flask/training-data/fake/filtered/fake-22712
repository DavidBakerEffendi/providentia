I should have known this was going to be bad when we walked in and the bartender was eating, at the bar, from a takeout container from another restaurant.  What I can't understand is someone who appeared to be an owner or at least a manager was sitting at the end of the bar letting this happen. The service was apathetic and uneven. The busboy was great but our waiter was not present for most of the meal, never asked if we wanted another drink and was really not professional. The food was either too bland or too salty. Drinks: we're good but I don't want to go to a nice restaurant and drink from a mason jar and a straw, ever. Appetizers : truffle mac and cheese was great. Pan fried cauliflower had no taste but texture was good. Tuna tartar was very bland tuna over Costco seaweed salad with a few pieces of mango. It was pretty awful. Mains:   hanger steak was ok but not cooked to requested temp ie overdone, sides were very salty. Tuna entree was sesame tuna over greens. Greens were over dressed and salty, tuna was very bland but cooked well and fresh, Anemic ginger and too hot wasabi(which also made an appearance in the appetizer)  were served on the side. Short ribs had too much of an alcohol taste but were cooked well. I was really hoping for some decent food on Staten Island but this was pretty awful.
