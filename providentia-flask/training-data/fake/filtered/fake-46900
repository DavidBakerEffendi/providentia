Desi Food Galaxy is very laid back, casual Indian eatery. Although there are several vendors under one roof, the only place noteworthy is CHIN CHIN. Its Chinese food with an Indian twist. The chef, Mr Shekar is Â very creative and can prepare personal dishes to suit taste. My husband and I love to eat or takeout from Chin Chin any time when we don't feel like cooking. Another good one is the Afghani place. I love their chicken and rice dish. Always consistent taste, Don't even bother to order pizza from the corner vendor. It must be the worst pizza I've ever eaten. Little did I know that they outsource their pizza!!!! I waited for a full hour for that pizza and in the end it was a disaster.
