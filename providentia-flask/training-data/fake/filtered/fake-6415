I brought my parents on graduation night.  I was not disappointed.  They had our table ready when we arrived. Both my parents got the New York Strip.  We are from Texas, and they both commented that these were "great steaks", by far much better than anything they had eaten recently.  The steaks were cooked to perfection sous-vide.  I got the best salmon steak I have ever eaten, bar none.  It came with a side of asparagus and rhubarb served with a black truffle aioli.  I highly recommend.  The service, as always, was wonderful.
