Won't go back.  Went there with 5 girlfriends for our annual Christmas dinner get together.  It was a Wed night.  Their website stated there's a $5 corkage fee when we got there they said it changed to $10.  They also advised that their small plate special was no longer valid (their website stated 3 small plates for one flat price).  The waitress immediately advised us that they were out of flanksteak.  We asked why as there was hardly anyone there.  They said they just didn't have any.  Two of my friends split a salmon dish...it arrived with the outside charred BLACK.  They sent it back and it came back RAW...pink, slimy and RAW.  They sent it back again and just decided not to chance their luck and didn't eat dinner.  I ordered a petit filet steak salad.  I'm a pretty small woman but I left this place still hungry.  There are too many BYOs in Essex County, don't waste your time at this one.  All of us agreed we'd never go back.
