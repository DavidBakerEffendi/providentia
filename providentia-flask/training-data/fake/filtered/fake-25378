This place is cute but they have a downfall- customer service. The food is great but this place gets pretty packed. There's a long wait time to be seated. I waited over an hour to be seated and thought no big deal I'll sit at the bar and have a drink. I was told to move because the bar is for people who want to eat! I couldn't sit and have a drink while I waited for my table, I thought that was absurd. I wouldn't go back to the location.
