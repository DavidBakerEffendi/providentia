The Halal guys are constantly at it. They really know how to work the corner of 53rd and 6th. I love the combination platter here which is chicken and lamb over rice. Gotta add the white sauce, barbecue sauce or the hot sauce for added taste. Warning that the hot sauce on the top shelf is super hot. I've come here a number of times after a night out and all I can say is the food tasted a million times better in a inebriated state. But then again doesn't everything. But really, this food did taste good and I felt great eating the platter that I was ready to go out on the town again. For most people, when they eat this stuff they will probably need to sleep. Who knows how many calories are in this, but who cares. The line looks long, but it moves along because these guys churn through the orders fast.
