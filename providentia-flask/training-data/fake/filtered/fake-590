Our family of five (three kids ages 17, 14 and 11) visited Philly this summer for the historic sites and also went out for some Philly Cheesesteaks.  We went to both Jim's and Geno's.  Jim's was good, but Geno's was much much better.  Geno's service was fast and courteous.  Geno's bread was nice and fresh, steak had awesome flavor which was complemented by the onions and cheese.  Our family loved looking at all the photos and memories on the walls while we fully enjoyed our Steak Sandwich.  Everyone fully enjoyed the Geno's experience!
