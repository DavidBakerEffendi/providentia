Amidst the projects, under the train lies a hidden gem.  Atmosphere here is calm,cool, romantic.  Wonderfully worn decor, even the bathroom was perfectly constructed.  Wine selection features organic always a plus on my list.  Mussels are a good selection.  Date cake was good but too sweet.  The band was great!
