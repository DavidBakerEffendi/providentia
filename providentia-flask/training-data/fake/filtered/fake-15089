This is such a great place. Easy to find on bleecker in the heart of the village, it's a great option for those nights when you're just not sure what you want. Not only is the food excellent, well prepared and flavorful, but it's gluten free! You can even get gluten free bread here! It's like heaven for anyone with a true gluten allergy. The only thing you'll need to beware of is the crowd. It's not a large space, and you can feel a bit in top of one another, so it's not the new option for a night when you want some privacy for a good conversation. You're going to hear everyone around you and vice versa, but for a casual night of homey, but interesting food, this is a great place.
