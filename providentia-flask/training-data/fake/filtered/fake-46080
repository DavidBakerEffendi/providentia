I like their food and the atmosphere. My daughter LOVES their fruit smoothies and say they rival her grand pops, which is saying a lot because in her eyes he makes THE BEST smoothies ever. Unfortunately I love pork and prefer pork bacon over any other type of bacon. The service was a tad slow. And I've only ate here twice b/c every other time I've come here it's packed beyond belief.
