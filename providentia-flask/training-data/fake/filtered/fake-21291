This restaurant is special. I had a party of four and we were seated at a spacious round table. The wait staff is superb - friendly and professional. I can't say enough about how the staff enhanced the experience. They were just wonderful. I was running late and called to ask the staff to take care of my guests. They seated my guests and took care of them until I arrived. They get all stars for being so nice. The food is great, the decor is fabulous.
