I love this deli! Very cute and a nice, cozy atmosphere -- and the place smells great! All of the basics are offered, but my favorite comes from the specials... "The" Sandwich has peppered turkey (YUM!) and bacon, and the melted cheddar on top seals the deal for me. I'm also a fan of the sloppy joe platter, which brings me right back to a childhood favorite (though Watchung Deli makes a sloppy joe better than my mother ever could have). The icing on the cake is that everyone that works here is nice, friendly, and outgoing. I go back not only for the food, but to say hi to the people behind the counter.
