Had concert tickets for Barclays on Friday 5/9/14...Stone Park looked like a great restauarants for myself and my wife, made 5:30 reservations.  We bar-hopped our way down from the LIRR, bar-hopped our way down from the LIRR, in a great mood til we knocked on the door to this way too pretentious restaurant.  We arrived at 5:28 ( literally!! ), and there was now a slight drizzle in the air.  A worker came to the door, looked at his watch, said two more minutes, and walked away...left us standing there!!!.  I called them from outside, and they said, " sorry, that's our policy".  I grew up in and around restaurants and pizzerias, and am now in medical device sales...customer service is ingrained in me.  I cannot possibly imagine ever treating customers in such a manner.  Having good food is a definite part of the equation, but what the hell happened to customer service!!
