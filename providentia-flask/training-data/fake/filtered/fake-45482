The food here is great. As a vegan, I appreciate the fact that they label vegan-friendly items on their menu. The falafel sandwich is great. However, shortly after witnessing a mouse run out of the bathroom and along a wall, I then got to watch an employee kill the mouse with a broom. Which, as an animal lover, counteracted any goodwill their intermittently-vegan-friendly menu generated.
