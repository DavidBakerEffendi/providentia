I had the Most Amazinggg sandwich at Kates Kreations!!! ^_^ A Grilled Vegetable Signature Sandwich with Chipotle souce. Honestly, I've never had anything like it, with such an abundance of flavor and taste. It is a definite must try, especially with a touch of Chipotle souce. I would recomend Kate's Kreation to anyone looking for a great meal and a possitive envirnment. Can't wait to be back! :)
