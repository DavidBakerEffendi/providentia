The owners need more experience in restaurant operation, maybe in cooking. If you like your steak raw, this is the place. I prefer medium rare, it came out raw. My companion ordered well done, it came out medium rare. On the menu, there was no mention of salad thrown on the entrée, it was there. Perhaps they never heard of vegetables to round out an entrée.  If you like your espresso weak like a cup of coffee, a weak cup of coffee, this is the place for you. Stick with the fish!!
