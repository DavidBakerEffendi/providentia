Worst experience ever.  We had a reservation for two for 8:30 on a Friday night.  We got there a little early (around 8:25) and checked in.  They told us a bunch of tables were getting their checks, so it would just be about 5-10 minutes and that we could wait at the bar (even though there was not an inch of room to move).  So why were we still standing there at 9:05 with no sign of a table?? The worst part was that they were seating larger parties of 3-4 -- as if they weren't seating us because two people would be "wasting" a bigger table.  The hostesses and hosts were rude and I heard them whispering about us after I complained that the table was taking a long time.  Also overheard customers complaining at the bar because the bartender charged them a totally different amount for the bottle of wine than the menu said, at which point they had to get the manager.  I will never come here again.
