Used a Groupon for dinner of 4 which included 2 apps, 4 entrees and 4 glasses of wine. The appetizers: hot clams and calamari. The clams were awesome. The calamari could have been a tad crispier but other than that pretty good. Entrees: my sister who is a raw fish fan ordered the tuna which said said was excellent ; boyfriend ordered the filet mignon which was rated as excellent as well; brother in law ordered the filet mignon along with lobster, the filet again, excellent but lobster not so great as it was not cooked enough. I ordered the black bean and corn burrito which was AMAZING (if you like a spicy Mexican I highly recommend!) The service was excellent and our waitress, Janelle was lovely and engaged in small talk with us. Our dinner reservation was at 7:45 and they had a band in the bar section at that time which we will be checking out another time. My only recommendation would be for them to expand the menu to include a few more vegetarian options...minimal options if you are a veggie.
