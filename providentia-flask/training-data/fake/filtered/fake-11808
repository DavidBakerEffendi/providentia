EXCELLENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! From appetizers to ambiance, dinners to dessert. Luce is sure to be a restaurant that we visit many times. Everything on the menu was prepared with the thought and not just 'thrown' together. Everything was fresh and the portions were great. Luce is a bring your own. We also happened to be there on a night where there was a performer singing a selection of Italian classics.
