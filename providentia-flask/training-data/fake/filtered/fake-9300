I went there a weeks ago with friends for dinner and was pleasantly surprised. We usually found it hard to find good Italian cuisine in this area and most times we would just end up at the local Olive Garden which is consistently mediocre at best. However this time we decided to try Mulberry Street for a change of pace. And WOW was that a great decision! Not only was the service and atmosphere very pleasant and incredibly friendly, we actually met the owner as he was going around checking on all the tables to make the meals came out to everyone's delight. This was something we have never experienced before at any change restaurant. Not only that but the food was outstanding and cooked to perfection. With great food and great service its no contest Mulberry Street beats Olive Garden and is hands down the superior Italian restaurant in this area.
