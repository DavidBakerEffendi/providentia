The food was AMAZING!!! There was a pretty long wait for our food, about 35-40mins and there wasn't even that many people in there and it took 20 minutes for my sister-in-law to get her mixed drink, she also had to ask about it 3 times. But I would have to say after all that I would still go back, because the food is just that good. The price wasn't so bad either and the staff was very nice.
