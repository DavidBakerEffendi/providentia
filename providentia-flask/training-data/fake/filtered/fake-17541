I made a reservation for 9 people on a Monday night for dinner. Unforunately, they don't seat you until your whole party is present. It's a relatiely small restaurant but has a pretty/trendy/low-lit decor. The service was good despite it being so busy, and the food cameout relatively quick as well. The food is cheap but good!
