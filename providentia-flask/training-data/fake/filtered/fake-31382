This spot never lets me down!  BEST RAMEN IN NYC!   I'm not a noodle/ramen person so this is a complete surprise for me.  I was pretty hesitant to try this place at first.  It was love at first slurp. Of all the many times I've gone to this place, I've never had to wait for more than 15 minutes.  Maybe it's because I usually go during off hours.  Service is great and you're greeted by the entire staff!  Wonderful!   My favorite dish is Akimaru Ramen.  It's usually spicy but now I have to ask for it...a tiny dish of hot stuff 2 bucks!  What a rip...but hey it's GOOOOOOOD. The best deal is the lunch special.  You get a small rice dish, salad, and of course your ramen noodle soup.  Very affordable and it will leave you in a food coma.  Yea, it's that good.  My only grip is that other than the ramen, they put japanese mayo in almost every other thing.  I would have enjoyed their awesome pork buns if it wasn't for the mayo.  The last time I ask for one without mayo, the waitress made a face, thus, I'll never order it again.  They also put mayo in the tiny rice bowl...eww. Other than that, the food is amazing.  The decor is very trendy and yet I love staring at the walls filled with Japanese characters.  Always a great time there!  Will definitely be back!
