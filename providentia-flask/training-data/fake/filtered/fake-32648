If your from the area than you knw there isn't much to do. Pub 46 has GREAT food & unfortunately no one knows about it. The music can vary from night to night however their busiest nights are Tues/Thurs/Friday. They have something for all personalities from Tuesday 2$ BYOM, Karokee Wednesdays, Ladies night out Thursdays, VIP Fridays, Football Sundays... etc. You can't go wrong good priced apps + drinks, plus specials throughout the night. Its def not a NYC/Hoboken bar but its not as bad as ppl make it out to be. I say you get try it for yourself... Ask for Jessica she's this mixed latina who's great and bubbly. Trust me she'll make your time worth while even if you hate the place for whatever reasons she'll make up for it w/ her customer service skills. She's on Friday nights
