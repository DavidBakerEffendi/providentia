I have been here several times and I love the place.. some feel it is a tourist trap. I how ever do not.. I have never had a bad meal here and love the atmosphere.. the decor reminds me of casablanca for some reason. I guess because of the warm brown colors and older feeling of the space. Yes the floor is slanted but the ship was built in 1904.. and I think there is very little you can do to correct that.. the staff is has always been a joy. My favorite meal is the pork tenderlion nestled on top of savory mashed sweet potatoes. The sunday brunch is fantastic.. be careful when you add liquor to your Champagne it can really kick the bill up.. The view of the water is nice.. Looking forward to spring and summer on the deck.. I love it..
