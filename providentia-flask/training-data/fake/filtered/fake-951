We finally managed to get  into Jo Jo's Tavern to try the oft raved about food.  We found the pizza tasteless- although the crust was mostly nicely crispy, the sauce had NO flavor and it doesn't hold a candle to Palermos or DeLorenzo's.  The antipasta was nothing more than a pedestrian tossed salad (lettuce/tomato, carrots)  with way too mild cheese (provolone??) and a very bland salami- not a garlicky spiced salami that shoudl be in antipasta.  No ham, no peppers, no olives, not chopped.  Extremely Disappointing.  We ordered a very basic plate of spaghetti & meatballs just to see if the sauce/gravy was authentic Italian.  DO NOT go to Jo Jos for this very basic of dishes (or other dishes??) - the sauce was a cross between Ragu and Tomato Juice and the meatball was just "OK".  $12 for a few ounces of pasta and 1 meatball. What is all the hoopla about and why are people going in droves to Jo Jo's????  Maybe too many people "want to belong" and nobody wants to buck what's  popular but not really worth their hard earned dollars.  Sorry.
