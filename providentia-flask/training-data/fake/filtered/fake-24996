Okay, I've been going here since they were just called "Dumpling House" and they used to do 6 pot-stickers for a dollar.  Back then, you couldn't get a seat (there weren't any) and you had to yell over everyone else just to put an order in.  Lines were irrelevant.  Tons of (mostly Asian) people were clamored in there and it was easy to feel as if you were being discriminated against, until you realize that it was the most aggressive that got to eat first.  But the dumplings with their juicy pork insides and the sesame pancakes were worth the trouble and feelings of inadequacy. Nowadays, the place is run like a normal restaurant, with seating (always full) and a register with tickets and all that.  Most of the women working there are the same, and the food is still good, but now you only get 4 dumplings for a dollar.  I suppose a good thing can't stay cheap forever, so i accept this inflation as par for the course.  I still love this place. But I can't help remembering the days when this place was wild and unruly and even cheaper than it is today.
