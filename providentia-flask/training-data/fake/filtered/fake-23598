TERRIBLE. My experience was horrible. It wasn't not the long wait in line. It was the service. I wanted to order a burger after all the food came because the portions were smaller than we had expected. The portions were small like at a high-end restaurant and the prices are very similar to a high-end restaurant. All of this is fine. I can accept. But the waitress said "I can't add on anything else after food comes. It's our kitchen policy. And the burger takes an hour." Then I said "I have an hour to wait." The reply i got was "We don't have an hour to wait because we have people waiting an hour and a half for a table. Plus you didn't order much." Wow wow, what is that suppose to mean? She didn't mention that they don't do additional orders when we first ordered our food. It's not my fault Spotted Pig doesn't take reservations and don't take additional orders, both criteria that almost ALL mid-range and high-end restaurants have. I've never had such an obnoxious service in my life. I felt I wasn't welcomed there and the waitress just wanted to kick us out. This place is more like a pub service. First come first serve basis. People come in, eat quickly and get out. I mean..... the food is good, but there are many places with good food. For the prices they have, I can do fine dining at a more comfortable restaurant with high-quality food and service. The most important thing is i can sit for 2 hours and would still feel welcomed. At Spotted Pig, it's not a place for dates or sports games or relaxing dinner. It's over-rated.
