I went here for restaurant week as I have not gone to a Garces restaurant yet and wanted to try it at a more affordable price. It was $35 for two starters, two more entree type dishes and a dessert. This is a tapas restaurant though so they were all small plates, but the whole meal was the perfect amount. We also got the wine pairing which came with two glasses for $15, one to go with the starters and one to go with the second course. It was supposed to be a light white for the starters and a more medium bodied red with the second course but everyone in my group opted for two reds. The food was phenomenal. If you go you have to try the duck mantadito, the duck with the cherry was a great combination I have never had before. Over all the atmosphere was relaxing and the service was spot on. I would go here again.
