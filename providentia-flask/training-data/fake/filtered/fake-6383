Food : Food is a fusion of japanese + korean but the korean dishes are byfar more appetizing in my opinion. I ordered a miso soup with a korean soup and the soup was indeed fresh and tasty. I will definitley come back to this place as service was very professional and the interior is beautiful ! Most definitely aesthetically pleasing.
