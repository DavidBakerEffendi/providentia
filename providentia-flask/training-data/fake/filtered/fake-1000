I have read all of the other reviews about this Thai place in Skillman and i can't see why there are any negative reviews. The interior is very nice and the pre dinner small salad plate is fresh and nothing is pre-cut or precooked like in other Thai places. Everything is fresh made from scratch. The ingredients in my Pad Thai where just good and plenty. I had six shrimp and for a lunch box that is sufficient also considering the price at $8.95. Service is good and my only comment is that when a restaurant has table cloth they also should have cloth napkins or thicker napkins than the one they use. But it is a affordable lunch price or pay more and have a better napkin, I go for the food quality. I will certainly will come back to this place.
