The food is really really good...I am still dreaming about the perfect matches of their different cheeses with almonds or dried fruits, or the octopus with potatoes that melts in your mouth...we picked five different tapas for the two of us and we like everything!! The place is tiny, so if you can, make a reservation. the service vas very nice too. We had a really good experience there!
