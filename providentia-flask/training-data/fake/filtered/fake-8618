My opinion- I believe the staff is prejudice! My child tried to purchase food here and he was treated as if he was beneath and turned away. Some adults should show more respect to children and set a far better example regardless of the situation- especially when running an establishment. I was at the hair salon down the street and I was unable to go with him to purchase his food therefore I gave him my debit card and he was turned away. (Second Attempt) I sent a note including my signature stating that he had my permission to purchase the food via my debit card. (Third Attempt) one of the workers at the salon offered to go as evidence that I was a current customer of their establishment and I could not walk down to pick up the food. (Fourth and Final Attempt) I then placed the order over the phone and advised the cashier of the situation and that he will be picking up the food and I even suggested paying over the phone and she advised me that it was not a problem for him to use my card since I was placing the order. Â When my son arrived and the owner noticed him leaving with his order, the owner came around the counter and began banging on the counter and told my son to put the food down and felt the need to yell at him. My son is a very intelligent kid and he was extremely bothered by the way this adult handled the situation over a $10.00 meal. My son was simply doing what his mother advised him to do and it was shown that he was indeed the bigger person in the situation. I am proud that he handled it very well and I will continue to teach my children the right and wrong way to act in this society regardless of others shortcomings and ill mannered ways. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance: and people who mean to be their own governors, must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives!
