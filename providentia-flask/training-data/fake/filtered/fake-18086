Park & Ochard is one of my favorite spots outside of Manhattan. The menu has a wide assortment of healthy choices, but there is also a mix of "meat and potatoes" choices. The common thread is that every dish is delicious and the portions are very healthy. One other big selling point is that they have one of the best wine lists in the New York area and the bar has a nice mix of micro-brewed beers. If you are stepping outside of NYC but still want some atmosphere and great food, this is your spot.
