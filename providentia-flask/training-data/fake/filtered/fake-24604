LIKE NO OTHER! This location of Joe's Shanghai is the better of the 2 in Manhattan. Â The best is the one in Flushing, Queens but this one comes in as a close #2. The taste of this food is unmatched, the price is unbeatable, and the joy of pop-ing your first dumpling is undeniable... There is always a wait outside, and for a very good reason-- this food is cheap and tasty and they have perfected the Soup Dumpling! If you've ever had soup dumplings anywhere else... these are better. If you never had soup dumplings before then 'pop' your cherry with these... but only if you want any other soup dumpling you eat in the future to taste like crap compared. Its always experience inside. Its crowded and loud and chances are if you go there with less then 7 people your going to wind up sitting next to some other groups which can be very fun/super awkward. The only thing that would make this place better is if it were open 24Hrs Things to get: Soup Dumpling- I prefer pork (not a big crab eater) Shanghai Noodles Bok Choy General Tso (spicy) Chili Prawns Chicken and Shrimp in plum sauce Turnip Shortcake Scallion Pancakes
