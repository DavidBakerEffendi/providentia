I've always heard great things about this restaurant but never get around to go to this place. Of course, the place is packed with people as usual.  I have tried Ippudo in New York, Hong Kong and Japan.  I must say Ippudo New york is the best.  The egg is boiled perfectly to half soft.  The noodle is quite al dente, and of course the soup is always very rich. Being a ramen fan, I always order the soyu ramen, that is soy sauce ramen. And the soy sauce is really the most important element to make a good ramen.  Ippudo just nailed it.
