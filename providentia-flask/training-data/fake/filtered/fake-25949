This was quite a disappointing restaurant, given that Danny Meyer is behind it. The decor and service were lovely, but the menu was pretty boring and rather limited. No green salad except one with kale (not everyone's favorite). The entrees were rather boring except for steaks costing over $80. We skipped those and went for grilled fish which was somewhat over cooked. And the dessert menu had nothing on it to appeal to anyone in our party of four. I doubt if we'd return.
