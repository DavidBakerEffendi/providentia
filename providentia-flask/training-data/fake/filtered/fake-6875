A range of decent to good food. Service was slow, unsure if some one called out but the host apologized several times.  Seemed genuine about it.   I had the peanut butter and fluff with fresh berries which was good and my brother had the chicken and waffles which he loved. Everyone else said their meals were ok.   Atmosphere, decor is nice.  Overall compared to others this experience is a little below 3 stars.
