Good food and great ambiance. For the price....we were expecting more.   We were one of the first parties seated that night and I think the servers were looking for something to do because about every 5 minutes someone would come by and "top off" our wine glasses...which we found extremely annoying.  It got to the point where we were holding our glasses so the hovering wine pouring person would leave us alone. We probably won't return.  Didn't think the food and service was worth the price.
