I have been to Lulu & Me a few times now and have had a great experience each and every time.  My last time there was so good, I was compelled to create a Yelp account and share my experience. First off, the wait staff was extremely pleasant, attentive and accommodating, without being overly "in your face", a major pet peeve of mine.  We had a decent sized party and sampled several of the appetizers. For me, the standouts were the Shrimp and Cod Cakes and the White Bean Dip.  Highly recommend both.   I was there for lunch the last time and after passing around several appetizers, I wasn't in the mood for a large dinner entrée.  I decided on the Chicken with Crispy Prosciutto sandwich with basil mayo, and let me say, I was not disappointed.  I am not a food expert by any means, but I do consider myself a "sandwich enthusiast". This sandwich was top notch.  All I was thinking about while eating it was how bad I wanted to order another one up to have for lunch at work the following day.   I have and will continue to recommend Lulu & Me to anyone looking for a place with great food and drinks and service with a smile.
