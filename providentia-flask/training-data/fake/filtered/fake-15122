A great craft beer spot on the UES that was LONG overdue.  I finally got to The Jeffrey on New Year's Eve (early on, so it was the perfect time to go) and I have already been back once and planning to go again this week.   The best (and maybe the worst thing) about this place is Jacob.  He's the best- friendly, creative, knowledgeable and allows you to try your beer to make sure you chose the right one.  I loved the beer selection.  When I went in the other night, it was cold and he offered a pint glass of hot water to warm our hands.  Have never had a bartender do that before and was so appreciative.   So why do I say he could be the worst thing there as well?  I am afraid that I may NEVER make it into the restaurant!  I am tempted to try the food and the coffee after reading the reviews and admit that I am beyond excited about the patio for this summer.  Hopefully, they will allow Jacob to make patio appearances from time to time:)
