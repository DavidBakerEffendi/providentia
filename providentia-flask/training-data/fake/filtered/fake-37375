My family (kids 10 and 7) went to eat there after reading the reviews on Yelp. I called them to  make sure that they served lunch buffet for lunch on Saturdays and also the price/age for kids.  I was told kids 10 and under is $7.95. When we got the bill, we were Charged for 4 adult buffet. How can they make such a mistake. After I told them the mistake he is saying that its 8 and under for kids. HELLO, I just called half hour back. Its not about $4, its about morality and honesty.
