My husband and I went in to check out this place thanks to a gift card that we had received. We were seated quickly and met our great waitress Jules.  She was super helpful and friendly.  We ordered the wonton appetizer which was good I just wish there was more of them! We decided to split the flatbread cheese pizza.  This was not to our liking and we quickly returned it.  The managers came right over and asked what was wrong and gladly took it off the bill.  We ordered the steak sandwich instead to split along with a side of the mashed up fries.  The sandwich was delicious!!!! The steak cooked perfect topped with cheese onions and mushrooms.  The mashed fry/waffle crisp was amazing!!!   Overall we were really enjoyed the atmosphere, service, managers, and food.  Everyone there seems to be on top of their game and aiming for customer satisfaction.   Seeing how we didn't use all of our gift cards we get the chance to go back and use it for another appetizer and a movie!
