Went to Perry Street last night for a (pre) 50th birthday bash and boy what a celebration it was!  This is fine dining at its best.  The room has gorgeous views of the Hudson River and the service is impeccable.  Hannah, our sommelier, made us feel welcome from the moment we sat down and had lots of great suggestions.  The peach and goat cheese appetizer was incredible - probably the most perfect, succulent peach I've ever eaten.  The Crispy Egg Caviar is a must try - almost like a magic trick how they can cook an egg so perfectly.  The fried chicken, a signature Perry Street dish, never disappoints.  The most impressive thing about all the dishes we had was the quality of the ingredients - the beautiful heirloom tomatoes, the succulent lamb and the super sweet tri-star strawberries were all flawless and delicious.  We went with a wine connoisseur from France who has eaten at restaurants all over the world and he was duly impressed by the Perry Street.  I highly recommend this restaurant not only for its tasty dishes, but for the warm, welcoming staff and elegant atmosphere.
