Tuk Tuk... I am clearly obsessed with this place. Â Even when I move out of the neighborhood, I KNOW I will come back here. Really good food. Everything we ordered was tasty and the portions were filling. The wait staff was attentive and helpful. My only complaint is that they charge a $10/bottle corking fee. I thought it was excessive. Totally looking forward to coming back to try out the other stuff on the menu in the future.
