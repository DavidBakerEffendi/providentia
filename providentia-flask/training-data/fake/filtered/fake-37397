the very first time we visited this place was sometime in sept this year and we were delighted by the authentic mughlai taste of the food served there. this is as good as it gets in authentic north indian mughlai food. even very few restaurants in india can match up to this taste. i had even written a review expressing these same feelings but then everything changed on Oct 16th 2010. as usual we landed up there, as usual the staff was courteous and usual there food was just too good but as i was chewing on this delicious food i felt something poke me in my mouth and when i took it out it TURNED OUT TO BE A 1.5 TO 2 INCH LONG ALUMINIUM/STEEL LONG SHARP STRING LIKE THING!! needless to say that it couldve bloodied my mouth , if ingested it couldve cut my insides. I DONT CARE HOW TASTY THERE FOOD IS BUT IN A PLACE LIKE THIS , SUCH A MISTAKE CANT BE TOLERATED!! can you imagine what wouldve happened if it was ingested and done to the stomach lining, the gut, the esophagus, etc. what if a YOUNG CHILD WOULDVE EATEN THIS??!! the waiter attending us , Lasitha, was very apologetic and rightly so and helpful and he categorically told me that all youve eaten today and whatever youve ordered to go today will be on the house. BUT MR. MANAGER WAS TOO MUCH OF A SMART ALEC! they did write off the 2 buffet plates that we had but they charged us for the packed stuff we took back home. theyre plain lucky we're not the "suing" kind of people or else they wouldve landed in VERY BIG TROUBLE, instead of realising this they went ahead and charged us!! EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED that SUCH SHEER NEGLIGENCE WHICH COULD SOMEDAY PROVE FATAL CAN TAKE PLACE AT SUCH A PLACE. IF YOU DO WANT TO VISIT THIS PLACE SINCE THE FOOD IS SO TASTY, PLEASE BE ALERT WITH EACH AND EVERY BITE, THERE COULD BE SOME FOREIGN BODY IN YOUR FOOD!!!
