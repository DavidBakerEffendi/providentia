Just having finished a shawarma and chicken sandwich, I find myself drooling over this review. This vendy is nothing short of "Supercalifragilisticespialidocious;" every good memory in my life flashes in my mind as I take a bite. Paired up with free solid falafel, line or not, professional, courteous, and friendly service, and sheer convenience, the only thing I wonder is why they are only King, and not Ruler of the Free World. Having lived in multiple cities in the world, I can not think of a better business that I would buy stock in if they went public. To top it off, one of my first visits a few weeks back was with some friends from Florida who are soon to be married. As a wedding gift, they jokingly asked me for some of King's food, to which the owner not only loved and welcomed, but offered me assistance in making it happen for my good friends. If I could use two, unvulgar words (while vulgar, still a great and raving review), to describe King, I would have to say "stand up", as in the kind of man I try to be, someone you can always depend on.
