Unfortunately, I did not have a great dining experience at Pumpkin this past weekend.  I had to wait 30 minutes for my reservation, which wasn't completely awful, but I was expecting great things...which did not happen.  I felt the service was inattentive, as I had to ask to have more water and our wine opened, etc.  Nobody ever once asked how our meals were going.  I ordered the cod....wow.  If food had an emotion, this cod would be apathy.  It was completely flavorless.  If I wasn't pregnant and starving by that point, I would have sent it back.  I have never tasted something so tasteless ever before.  I have to say, it was my worst meal at a BYO in Philly.
