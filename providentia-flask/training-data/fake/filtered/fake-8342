Best wings and clams in NJ! Mon-Tues deals are amazing. 50 cent wings and clams real divey place, kinda small and cramped. tough to get table has THE ABSOLUTE WORST SERVICE IN THE COUNTRY. no hostess to help get you a table, only 2 bartenders and no waitresses. no one cares to take your order. you literally have to grab a waitress by the neck to get her attention. Owner must be the cheapest bastard ever if he can't hire 1 more waitress. Also food takes forever, but once you get it.... IT'S WORTH IT!!!
