This is truly the best pizza in New York.This is an incredible place to visit. I live in Manhattan but I went to this small pizza place in Midwood,Brooklyn because I saw on Time Out Magazine that DiFara Pizza was nominated as the number #1 Â place of new york. The owner makes each pizza one by one and people are patiently waiting as he slowly prepares each pizza. You really feel you are in a cozy pizzeria in italy.He really knows how to make a perfect slice,toasted,with natural ingredients and italian cheese.HIGHLY RECOMMEND....
