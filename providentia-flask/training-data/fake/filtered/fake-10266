Great atmosphere, simple decor, very dim lighting and cozy. Delicious branzino, pasta, and special soup.  Only miss was the waiter. We came in for a late dinner (after 9 pm) but he spent most of the night on the sidewalk chatting with another table and having cigarrettes with them.  As they were smoking near the doorway, lots of nasty smells were blowing in.  And since he was smoking too, got to get another whif whenever he graced us with his presence (which was far too rare).  very unprofessional.
