I went to Lulu & Me with my family a few months ago it was excellent.  The location was convenient to Time Square and to the Broadway show that I attended that night.  I got there early in the evening so we sat at the bar and enjoyed a glass of wine.  The seating arrangement perfect for hanging out with a small group.  We later sat down at a table for dinner.  The menu had a lot of unique dishes that all sounded delicious.  I ordered the fettuccine and it was one of the best meals I've had all year. It had mushrooms in a cream sauce and was different that other alfredo dishes that I've had at other restaurants.  The portion was large, but not so large that I had extra. I thought that the food was reasonably priced.  I would definitely return to Lulu & Me for dinner with family or friends.  It would also be a great place to come for drinks after work.
