Came in from Astoria after reading the reviews online. I can't seem to find any good Lebanese food in Astoria, so I packed my kids in the car and off we went. The food was delicious, authentic, and tasty. It is ABSOLUTELY worth the trek from Astoria for me, although it would be awesome if they could open a location over here... hint.. hint.. I ordered plenty of items off the menu to get a taste of all the options, the shawarma sandwich was a hit with my daughter, as well as the falafel sandwich. I had the tawook and it was delicious. Ill definitely be back, try it out, you won't be disappointed!
