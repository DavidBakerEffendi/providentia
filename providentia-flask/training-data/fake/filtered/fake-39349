This place gets 3 stars for the design. It is arguably the most charming place to eat brunch in NYC. but the coffee is terrible, the service is miserable and everything takes 45 minutes. We waited almost an hour for a boiled artichoke and some donuts. It took half an hour to pay the bill. No wonder there was an hour wait by the time we left. I will return for the brunch cocktails and great music, but this place could be so much better. Thank you!
