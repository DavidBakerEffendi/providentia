Terrible service. Found the restaurant through a third-party site when searching for veggie burgers. When I went in, there were two cooks in the little corner makeshift kitchen, and someone at the connected bar playing with the register. None of the three acknowledged my presence for a good 5 minutes. When they finally did, I asked about the veggie burgers. They literally openly laughed and mocked me for asking. It says 'roast beef' in the name, they explained through laughter. Yes, I realized, but many restaurants offer vegetarian options, too. You can name your restaurant and be famous for one thing, while offering alternatives. But I blame myself for giving this awful place the benefit of the doubt. They were no help, they didn't offer any alternatives. In a way, I'm glad they didn't have what I wanted because I don't want to give them my money. The place looked like a dive bar, cramped, dark and dirty. I don't want to eat my sandwich next two drunks. And I wouldn't want to give them my money anyway. They were not helpful with alternative menu options either. I saw two pails of meat and gravy on the burner, both different shades of unappetizing gray. The crooks were sweating and there was an overall lack appearance of cleanliness.
