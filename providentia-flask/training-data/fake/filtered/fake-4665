My husband and I love, love, love Rouge.. we love their food, outdoor seating and Bloody Maries, people watching on the Square...however, today, not only did our waitress, Ashley, forget to put in our ticket, she chatted up with numerous customers while we waited for food and the check.. Imagine the fustration:  your watching neighboring tables getting their food when they were seated much later after us.. I mean, it was smoked salmon on a bagel.. c'mon!  How long does that to rectify?  When we pointed out to her that we still haven't received our food, she giggled " oh, right, the ticket was lost.."  Well, she should have been on us with service or compensation with complementary bloody maries.. yet, she seemed more concerned about gossip with the table next to us.  We were so disgruntled!!! Not sure we will be going back to Rouge, not with Parc and Devon right next door.   Advice to management:  Get rid of Ashley!
