I love Morning Glory!  My favorite dish is the smoked salmon, goat cheese, and asparagus fritata.  Morning Glory offers you an experience..it's not just the food.  The decor is lovely and the staff is incredibly friendly.  If you're expecting to wake up on a saturday or sunday and mozy on down to MoGlo for a quick breakfast/brunch, you're delusional.  But it's not like the wait is a secret so come prepared to occupy your time while you anticipate your hunger being satisfied. I usually write my name down and then walk over to the numerous coffee houses in the area, grab a cappuccino, grab a paper, and go back to MoGlo until my name is called.  It's a full morning event but definitely worth it when you taste your first bite!
