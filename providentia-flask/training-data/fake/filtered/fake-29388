I'm giving then five stars for un unexpectedly excellent corner tavern. Many great cold beers on tap including Great Lakes. Order the mussels and ask for extra bread, this will help prevent you from just putting the bowl up to your lips to drink the awsome sauce. Old Bay fries in a bucket and generous portion salads. Oh yea, the help, I want to take them all home with me. You'll find me on one of these barstools on at least a weekly basis. Did I mention crystal clear HD tv? This is an unexpected treasure!!!
