This used to be my favorite neighborhood spot.  Nothing has changed there...just not my neighborhood anymore (boo-hoo.)  It is still my favorite way to share a great meal/culture with a visitor.  Sometimes it gets a little noisy (people celebrating) but I consider that part of its ambiance.  The food offerings are luscious, with just the perfect mix of spices.  You can watch the chef prepare your favorites, always fresh, and I find the servers delightful.   During the warmer months you can sit outside and enjoy the people parade.  The BYO factor adds to the cost effectiveness.  Don't be intimidated by any parking issues.  Just be a grown-up and drive 'til you find one.  It is worth it.
