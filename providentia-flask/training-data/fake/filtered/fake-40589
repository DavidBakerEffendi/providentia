american style pizza,,.... I did expect somewhat more Italian.. since the name is.. and it is in all the guides... but honestly: I hated it.. sticky plastic mozzarella, garlic tomato stuff and I don't know what kind of dough they make.. I had to wait even.. to get a table... well, I do not understand the people in this city.. getting in line for a place like that!!!
