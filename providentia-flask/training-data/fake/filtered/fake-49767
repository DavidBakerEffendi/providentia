What a terrible experience.  Firstly, the food was not as good as the branch in NYC.   Secondly, the hostess kept walking by and looking at us as if we were common criminals.  To top it off, as we were walking out, she accused us of not paying.  We left the money on the table.  After seeing the $$$'s on the table, she didn't even apologize.  Totally unprofessional.....I can't believe Saravana Bhavan could hire such an inadequate hostess to run their restaurant.
