This place is always so busy and I feel like a chicken without a head. However, the soup dumplings are to die for. We did order a few other meat dishes which left me feeling quite thirsty. Although the atmosphere makes me want to run out, the soup dumplings bring me to a state of bliss that everything just doesn't matter anymore.
