Delicious food, warm environment and friendly service.  We had a very nice bottle of red wine that was organic.  Empanadas, salads and soups to start, all great.  Gnocchi in a ragu sauce was amazing.  My partner had a very well prepared flank steak roulade.  Dessert was avocado flan - yum!  We'll go back for sure.
