Had a glass of wine for $13....this was the same exact wine I saw in a state store the next day for $10 a BOTTLE. I understand wine markups at restaurants but based on how swanky they want to label themselves, they should maybe up their wine game. Just saying. Everything was good. Good...not great. It is pretty ambiance but the overall feeling there is snotty, upper class middle aged couples. I felt like I should be at Wimbledon match drinking mimosas.
