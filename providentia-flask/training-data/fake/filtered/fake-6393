Sakura Garden lives up to it's 5 star reputation. I love sushi and I will only go to Sakura for it after my first visit there. They have excellent menu choices that are authentic to the Japanese culture, but also offer entrees with a more "American" style. The service was excellent and fast. Hibachi chefs are wonderful. Sakura is my choice restaurant.
