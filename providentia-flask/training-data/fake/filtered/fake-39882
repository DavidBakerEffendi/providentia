It's ok pizza.  I heard such great things about the pizza, a few of us drove over to see what the fuss was about, there was a line. I am glad we did not get on it. We discovered Tony and Lucille's that night fantastic. We did get back to Pepe's another time and did not have to wait in line . None of us understood  why it has such a great reputation.  It's good, I have had better thin crust pizza in Stamford, CT. I do not think I am going to say where because there is not line down the street. There can be a wait once in awhile though. It's a neighborhood place, family owned fresh ingredients, some from across the street.
