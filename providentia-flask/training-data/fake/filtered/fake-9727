My family and I just dined here this weekend for my sister's college graduation. All of the food we had here was pretty decent, but I'm writing this review because my experience here was overshadowed by the HORRIBLE service. Our reservation was at 7 PM but upon our arrival we were told it would be a 30 minute wait. An hour later, after being told by the hostesses several times it would "just be a few minutes", we were lead to our table. I understand it was a busy weekend, however, this is the longest I've ever had to wait for a reserved table. It we'd wanted to eat at 8 we would have made reservations for 8! Following this frustration, 2 of us had to ask for new water glasses as mysterious black specs/chunks were floating around in our water. Our waiter was sarcastic and borderline rude to us the entire evening, (I didn't get his name as he gave us the name of a folk artists instead of his actual name) and someone in our party was delivered the wrong appetizer. The meal was finished with us trying to split the check ourselves while the same waiter stood over our shoulders repeatedly announcing that we were $35 short, even when we checked our math and couldn't see the error. He didn't bother to point it out to us, just kept repeating how much more money we owed. None of the 13 people in my party will be hurrying back here any time soon.
