I give this place five stars because of the quality of the food. A lot of people complain of the prices and I have to agree because just one burger and smoothie costs about fifteen dollars in here. On the other hand, the groothie (smoothie) is very healthy and good to my knowledge and that burger was gigantic!! I suppose if the burgers/sandwiches were smaller then the prices could be lower and I really cant eat a whole sandwich from Hip City unless Im drunk :-/ Not because of taste but size. In summary, you do get what you pay for at Hip City Veg and perhaps its worth the couple of extra dollars. It's convenient, healthier than most and taste's good. It's not going to be all the time but I'd go again (already been so many times). Oh and the employees are always pleasant.
