On Saturday August 16, 2014 ....I had the best culinary experience that I've had in NY in a long time.   The food, the waitress, the service and the atmosphere was FANTASTIC!!!!!  Saturday was my mother's birthday and our waitress, Monique, treated my Mom like she was family.  We were comfortable, relaxed and we took pictures.  We will definitely be back with even more family and friends!!!!  Everybody, if you want to have a good time and great food; GO TO PEACHES on Lewis Avenue in Brooklyn!!  LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS RESTAURANT!  It's gonna be my new hang out!! WORD!!!!
