I was really looking forward to trying this place because, as many others have said, there aren't many good options in Kensington to have a meal out - let alone a drink! Speaking of drinks, the 1st thing you should know is that they do not have or serve hard liquor.  Some weird law about being across the street from a church.  Just a heads up - beer, wine and soju are all you get. I went on a Sunday afternoon, not realizing that we'd get the brunch menu and that was the 1st disappointment.  If you don't want breakfast, you don't have many other options (and 1 of those we were informed was not available that day), but this forgivable considering it's "brunch" and my mistake.  The food wasn't anything special though and overpriced.  I had the salmon toast ($9) and it was okay.  My friend had the burger which he said was greasy ($14 with cheese - yikes). The staff was friendly but service was spotty.  We waited awhile for drink refills and even longer to get the check after our plates were cleared.  We actually had to go find our server. By the end, the place got a little busier but it felt like we were forgotten about.   Some good things about the place though are 1) the Bloody Mary; 2) outdoor seating; 3) beer selection; 4) overall nice space. I may give it another chance, maybe for dinner sometime but I was really disappointed.
