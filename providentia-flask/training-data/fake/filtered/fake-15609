Another wonderful meal last night at Perilla.  The place is consistently good and hasn't lost a step since opening. My wife and I have eaten here several times and we are never disappointed. Ate at the bar last night - and Jordan took excellent care of us. Great service.  Anyone who gives perilla anything under 4 stars is likely a clueless, miserable dummy.
