I'd like to try it again... We had dinner on a slow Sunday eve. during the Super Bowl. We really enjoyed the empanada appetizers - we ordered crab and spinach - which are in light, flaky filo dough.  We liked the soup (had Bouillon Creole), small salad, plus fried sweet plantains and cabbage pickle that come with the entrees. My husband enjoyed his Trini chicken in coconut milk, but the tilapia roule in a Creole sauce seemed fishy that night. The atmosphere and service were nice.  I'd like to try the place again, but my husband is not so sure.
