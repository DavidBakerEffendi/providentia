This place was recommended to me by a friend of the owner, so I will give a honest review..... NO VERY GOOD AT ALL!!! Let me start by saying I am Filipino, so I know our food.  The food here is NOT a very good representation.  My friends and I ordered several different dishes.  They were either too salty or very bland.  The portions servered were not worth the price.  Sevice??? What service??? The staff seemed too taken with talking to their friends that were eating there.  Over all, I will not go again.... To be honest I feel like smacking my friend that recommended it because it was a waste of money!!!!!
