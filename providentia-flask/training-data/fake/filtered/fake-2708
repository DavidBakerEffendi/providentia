North Star Bar, what can I say.... Highly unprofessional, one of the most unreliable establishments I can think of in the Philadelphia area. The MGMT cancelled gigs for FOUR BANDS tonight. These musicians could have scheduled other gigs, lessons, rehearsals etc.. had the MGMT not cut them out at the last minute. Time is something you can never get back and bonin' hardworking, incredibly talented artists out of a gig/time in this manner will not go unnoticed!!!! DON'T BOOK YOUR GIGS HERE... -"The B-Man"
