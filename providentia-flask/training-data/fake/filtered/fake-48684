One of my favorite dives in Queens in short.  This place is one that gets overlooked from many native NYers as I don't think many know about how amazing the food here is.  Boy oh boy this place has it right and it is extremely affordable.  The people there are warm too and will give free samples to let you try different foods.  I try to hit this place up at least 1-2 times a week, but this place gets reallllllly busy at certain times due to the small size of the restaurant.  Empanada cafe in corona is the only other place in this city that hits a home run in this cuisine imho.  Top notch!!
