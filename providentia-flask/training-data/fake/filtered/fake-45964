I was recently here and while the food was outstanding the place was so cold we could not enjoy the experience.  My friend assured me this was not the norm but what we both came away feeling was they purposely had the air up so that people would not linger.  There was a 25 minute wait for a table for the 2 of us and the waiting line never got smaller.  When we left there were even more people inside and out waiting to get into this place.  I believe there was a decision made to up the air conditioning to make people just uncomfortable enough to not linger as we would have.  This would not have been a problem is we could have at least finished our food.  I will probably go back but hopefully at a night when it is not that crazy.
