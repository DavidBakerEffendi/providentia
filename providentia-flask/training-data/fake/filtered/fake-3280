Checked out this place  on Friday night around 6. Sat at the bar and tried a lot of menu items, as we wanted to a large variety.  Everything seemed really authentic, and contrary to other reviews, service was great.  Water glass was filled promptly, and everyone was eager to help.   The pork belly taco was by far my favorite.  Would highly recommend it! Didn't love the pork rinds or chicken taco (little dry). Had the churro for dessert.  I was not familiar with Mexican chocolate, and found it to be a little bitter. Overall, the ambience was nice, service was good, and food all was authentic.  Like any new place with a menu different from anything else, you will probably not love everything but for sure you will find something you love.  I hope they do well!
