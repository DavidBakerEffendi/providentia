I confess, this place really does it for me.  Service is always relaxed and friendly, and the vibe is comfy and cool.  I'm a fan of girly drinks, and the pomegranate martini does the job rather nicely, but when I'm in a beer mood I opt for the terrific Rare Vos on tap.   But the best part is by far the food, speaking of appetizers alone: I could wax on for days about the curried mussel cocktail:  cooked, chilled mussels in a gentle coating of curried aioli with shallots, stuffed back in the shell and served on a bed of ice with Tabasco on the side--insane.   The brussel sprouts cesar salad is also a winner, with an inventive twist on the traditional dish featuring a mix of fried and raw brussel sprouts which provides for great texture.  I do mine without anchovies, but I'm a wimp. The house-smoked bluefish is also simply divine:  huge, meaty portions of smoked fish over a crispy potato cake(almost like a hash brown) with greens and dill dressing.  If you can get a bite with all four elements it is a freaking party in your mouth. And I could go on and on:  the burger, truffle/proscuitto mac and cheese, cheese fries slathered in sharp cheddar, etc, etc, etc.   I always leave here tipsy and in a food coma, happy happy happy.
