On each of my two visits, there was just one person to handle the front of the restaurant -- a capable enough and personable waiter who was as attentive as his divided time allowed (not bad) the first time and a wonderful waitress who cheerfully greeted everyone as they arrived and thanked everyone as they left.  She was more than sufficient all by herself -- one of those rare people who can handle a lot with grace and pleasantness to spare. The diner is clean and attractive and the breakfasts were pretty good -- marred only by the use of that yellow gunk that diners seem to prefer over butter or margarine for their homefries -- a shame since the potatoes were well seasoned and would have been delicious if olive oil (preferably from a taste standpoint) or butter had been used on the grill instead.   I found the two breakfasts I took there (eggs benedict the first time and two eggs over with sausage the second) to be satisfactory and the experiences calm and pleasant.  (If one could count on catching the waitress on duty, I'd up the stars to 4 1/2.  Her PLUS an upgrade from the yellow gunk for the grease provider and I might even go to 5.  But, alas, I suspect that the yellow gunk is there to stay.)
