Pleasantly surprised. Really nice staff and delicious food. Started with the Char Grilled Octopus Salad. Main course was Akdeniz Levregl imported mediterranean sea bass. I have an picky palette, so I must say that the char flavor was a bit powerful and the seasoning (if any) did not show. However it was juicy and the natural flavor of the sea bass left me finishing my plate. My wife had the Adana Kebab hand chopped lamb. The meat was succulent and flavorful. The rice was of good select. All followed by Turkish tea (wasn't special, could use a mint leaf). Ended with my first time tasting the desert Kunefe.... WONDERFUL! I will be returning to try the rest of the menu.
