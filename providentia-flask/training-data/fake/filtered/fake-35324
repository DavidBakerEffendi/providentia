Well, after finally getting a chance to dine at the Mighty Quinn it turned out to be a major disappointment. The long line seemed to be generated by staff that had a somewhat lackadaisical approach to keeping the line moving. When finally approaching the counter I was informed that they were all out of ribs. Really?!! When forced to try the brisket I found it to be extremely dry and somewhat bland (ended up drowning it in BBQ sauce to give it some flavor). After all the "raves" about this place, I was sadly disappointed at both the quality of the food and the unnecessarily long wait. Needless to say, I won't be dining there again.
