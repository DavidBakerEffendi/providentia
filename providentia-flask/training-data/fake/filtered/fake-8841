This place is like a Whole Foods quality place with much better prices. This is the best healthy food joint in the area. As a student, it's slightly more expensive than I would like, but I would rather spend the extra dollar or two for lunch and get the quality this place offers than go to any of the bars or fast-food places around the corner and eat a much less healthy and fresh meal. I eat here ALL THE TIME. I get the Tuscan Tuna pita with brie cheese, and it has always been superb. The ingredients are always fresh, I have never seen even the tiniest sign of old food, and the quality of the foods is top notch. They offer quinoa and brie, for goodness sake's. You know you're getting the good stuff at a place that has quinoa.
