a review that should have been done many, many months ago. New York pizza is good but then once in a while you come across something even more. Much much more. Lombardi's Pizza uses many ingredients normally found in "gourmet" pizzas--similar food establishment Â would be Patsy's Pizza. However, the brick oven taste is hard to reproduce, and coupled with fresh mozzarella, basil, and authentic Italian sweet sausage, Lombardi's beats the competition by a mile.
