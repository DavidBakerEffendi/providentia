Getting more and more disappointed with each time that I eat here. Ate here this past week and ordered the spicy basil chicken w/ rice. There was barely any chicken in my entree! I think there was at most 5 actual pieces literally. So I was basically just eating vegetables the entire time. While the sauce was prepared well, not putting in the sufficient amount of chicken is just unacceptable. The previous time I ate here, the pad thai was mediocre at best--very soggy and not flavorful. So yea, I don't know...just have to find another Thai restaurant I suppose, which will be hard considering most of the ones in NYC kind of suck.
